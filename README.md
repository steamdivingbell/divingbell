# Steam Diving Bell (revitalized)

This is a fork of the semi-functional-but-eventually-deprecated [steam diving bell](https://github.com/larsiusprime/divingbell) project.

I have taken the original source code (and done some heavy reading of [the literature](https://www.fortressofdoors.com/steam-diving-bell)) and done my best to recreate this project in a semi-functional form.

The current state of this project is:
- [ ] Not working
- [ ] Barely functional
- [X] Functional
- [ ] Feature parity
- [ ] Extended development
- [ ] EOL

# License

Much like the original, this code is under the MIT license -- see [the license](https://github.com/jbzdarkid/divingbell/blob/master/LICENSE.md) for details.

The data files are not present in this repo -- but at some point I will be scraping data from steam to power this project.
All the usual legally gray areas about scraping aside, please don't assume that I own any scraped data.

# An overview
TBD, once the project works. Hopefully it'll work just like the original.
