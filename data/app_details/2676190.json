But their already impossible mission is further complicated by a cunning necromancer whose dark schemes threaten to tip the balance. Can Erica and her allies survive the brutality of this world and its monsters to bring salvation, or will they fall slain, by the legendary God-beasts and undead army nipping at their heels?</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Game Overview</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is a story-rich, single player turn-based RPG inspired by classic titles but with a modern, darker edge-definitely not one for the kids! Set in the realm of Strifestav, you\u2019ll gather your party, hunt for treasure, and upgrade weapons, armor, and spells to prepare for the challenging battles ahead.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Combat is strategic and unforgiving, featuring mechanics like resistances, stuns, ailments, and even instant death. Your survival hinges on thoughtful use of consumables and smart upgrades found in towns, treasure chests, and through defeating enemies. Shops in major towns let you rest, gear up, and buy crucial buffs to prepare for your next fight.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is not your typical lighthearted RPG\u2014it\u2019s a brutal tale filled with adult themes, violence, strong language, and an atmosphere of raw determination. Are you ready to embrace vengeance and fight for a dying world? Well too bad, because you will probably have better luck in causing its very destruction! This apocalyptic tale is not for the faint of heart!!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> <strong>Classes</strong> </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Once assembled, your four-member party will feature five distinct classes alongside a powerful summoned flesh golem.
