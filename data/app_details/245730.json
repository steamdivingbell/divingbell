True to the original spirit but made a million times better by using modern engines such as Unreal and Havok. The makeover is completely stunning.<br><br><strong>It\u2019s all about Gameplay.</strong> The team modernized gameplay mechanics, making the game more reactive, offering new features, like gadgets and an experience progression system.
