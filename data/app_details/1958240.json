{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>TRUE CONTROL. TRUE SKILL. TRUE SKATE</strong>\u2122</h2><br>Skateboarding is challenging.<br>Skateboarding is freedom.<br>Skateboarding is TRUE SKATE\u2122.<br><br>TRUE SKATE\u2122 is the closest FEELING to real-world skateboarding as the player\u2019s interaction with the skateboard is powered completely by the instant and unified PHYSICS system. The skateboard reacts instantly as foot and stick feel truly connected.<br><br>Play the true skateboarding sim and experience the FREEDOM to do what you want, the way you want.<br><br>Players increase skill by getting a feeling for the physics, rather than learning gestures, creating a new paradigm for skateboarding games on Steam. The beauty of the physics, is it's just like real-world skateboarding. With the right skill, if you can dream it,  you can do it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>TRUE CONTROL</strong></h2><br><strong>True Axis's instant and unified physics system</strong> listens for swipe, position, direction and strength from the player and processes how the skateboard should respond in real-time. So the same flick in two different points of the skateboard will react very differently. The skateboard reacts instantly in-game and foot and stick feel connected; whether pushing, popping, flipping or grinding. Literally any trick is possible with TRUE CONTROL of the skateboard. If you know how to do a trick in real-world skateboarding you could guess how to do a trick in TRUE SKATE\u2122.<br><br>TRUE CONTROL is made possible because the player\u2019s interaction with the skateboard is driven by the unified physics system - timing, strength, precision, angle, late corrections all make a difference. Players have to perform 100% of the trick, instead of learning a basic control system that by pressing buttons or flicking a stick will perform the trick for you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>TRUE SKILL</strong></h2><br>TRUE SKATE\u2122 is hard! But the harder the more rewarding and bigger the adrenaline rush. To increase skill players need to get a feeling for the physics, rather than learning gestures. To feel the flow of the physics, start by imagining your triggers are your feet and your sticks as your legs - they are truly connected! Then enter into <strong>MACBA</strong>, the one word that epitomizes the Barcelona skate scene, and be guided through the fundamentals by some friendly faces... Tutorials include pushing, popping, flipping and grinding. Then it's just a matter of time and practice, try <strong>The Valley</strong> to improve your grinds and flow, <strong>The Warehouse</strong> for transitions and gaps or have some fun at <strong>Mondo Ramp</strong> generating electrifying air, speed, spins, and slams! <br><br>TRUE SKILL requires dedication, persistence, skateboarding knowledge and split-second timing and with that, just like real-world skateboarding you are bound, only by your creativity and imagination. Enjoy the adrenaline rush of pure satisfaction that comes from perfecting the action to land your favorite tricks, gnarly gaps and technical lines - clean.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>PROCEDURAL ANIMATION</strong></h2><br><strong>True Axis's instant and unified physics system</strong> uses PROCEDURAL ANIMATION to generate real-time character animations, by blending real-world skateboarder motion capture animations to match any kind of trick players can dream of. PROCEDURAL ANIMATION enables a more diverse series of actions than could otherwise be created using any kind of pre-defined gesture or canned animation system.<br><br>Any type of skateboarding trick (old or new!) is possible in TRUE SKATE\u2122, all in real-time. But your timing must be perfect to unlock the steez..<br><br><strong>WARNING: This game will challenge you.</strong>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1958240/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1667955817","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1958240/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1667955817","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1958240/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1667955817","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1958240/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1667955817","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>TRUE CONTROL.
