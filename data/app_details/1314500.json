In any case, it can potentially be a really interesting title because it offers a light-hearted version of football. The gameplay suitable for everyone is simple, immediate and direct. You don't have to be a football fan to enjoy this title: the rules are simple, run, move, roll, jump, hit the ball and score.  The title offers the best of itself when played in the company both in presence and online and it is clear that with the necessary precautions, Cyberlab Studios can aim high. It goes without saying that we await further updates on gameplay and content. We are sure that with some adjustments we could talk about something sensational.\u201d<br>IlVideogioco<br><br>\u201cThe gaming experience at the moment is limited because it is a bit cumbersome to have fun in company, but the good thing is that with remote play it is not necessary for everyone to have the game. Undeniably, it's still an incomplete product and needs some tweaking (and updating), but the base is good and has a lot of potential. Playing alone can become a bit repetitive in a matter of minutes, but if you have someone to involve, laughter and fun are guaranteed, even if you miss an empty goal or score an own goal.\u201d<br>Gaming Italiano<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1314500/ss_522234634a9f7783bdafa4ecd8add66406065d63.1920x1080.jpg?t=1726599081","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1314500/ss_522234634a9f7783bdafa4ecd8add66406065d63.600x338.jpg?t=1726599081"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1314500/ss_9e883dd305d74185b415bd34f2e601b5a6554fb3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1726599081","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1314500/ss_9e883dd305d74185b415bd34f2e601b5a6554fb3.600x338.jpg?t=1726599081"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1314500/ss_e9e2a5d82ca8b20d0a48bb32ac58bc5c245c514d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1726599081","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1314500/ss_e9e2a5d82ca8b20d0a48bb32ac58bc5c245c514d.600x338.jpg?t=1726599081"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1314500/ss_97551ebf95f301ad10e7fdf482f28a22a26c9ca9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1726599081","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1314500/ss_97551ebf95f301ad10e7fdf482f28a22a26c9ca9.600x338.jpg?t=1726599081"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1314500/ss_237128ee379ea215aefa37e6fc3b3ffb6b8df1aa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1726599081","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1314500/ss_237128ee379ea215aefa37e6fc3b3ffb6b8df1aa.600x338.jpg?t=1726599081"}],"short_description":"Dive into a soccer game that\u2019s as unpredictable as it is fun.
