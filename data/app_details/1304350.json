{"about_the_game":"As a survivor of a car crash, you enter a world affected by a mysterious drug substance that controls everything around you. Formerly known as a joyful place, now transformed into a wasteland full of disturbing monsters, mysteries and an eerie atmosphere. Here, any action can lead to the increase of the hazardous fog, which when maxed-out will make a living hell out of your life. Every moment is a choice, will you kill this enemy easily by hitting him in his substance-filled head (and thus risk increasing the fog), will you drive a vehicle with limitless fog-spreading fuel and so forth. Play nomad style, wandering between towns or set up a base somewhere and call it home. Learn from your past mistakes to prevent death and uncover the truth of this strange place.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Main features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The hazardous fog, player-caused or not, is the punishment for your corner-cutting actions, which brings a variety of problems (e.g., special enemies, physical dangers, speeds up your urge, and the like).<br></li><li>Chop down trees to build yourself a complex base or just look around for plywood to barricade one of the abandoned houses.
