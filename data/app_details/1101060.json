Foes are visible on the map, and you can decide to elude battle most of the time. However, some more aggressive creatures will not hesitate to charge and chase you!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1101060/extras/creatures.png?t=1589637314\" /><br><br>Battle sequences are turn based (with no waiting time) but strewn with mini-QTEs (1 to 3 button presses) to validate the player's choices. It's not just about hammering the action key: using a potion or the last resort ability acquires another taste when your dexterity is also involved! This system is balanced with a counter and evasion system, which highlights the strategic aspect of battle: you can choose to bear the brunt of an attack to counter immediately, or evade to stay out of harm's way.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1101060/extras/actions.png?t=1589637314\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1101060/extras/enquetes.png?t=1589637314\" /><br><br><br>Because it\u2019s not all about action, Lumen is teeming with rich dialogues and encourages the player to discover the game\u2019s world through them.
