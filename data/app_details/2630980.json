{"about_the_game":"You are Maia, a trusted forest guardian, a speaker to all birds and most importantly a fighter. What will you do to save your people from being ravaged by the deadly Grey Death toxin created by a tyrannical mutant otherwise known as your father? <br><br><i>Guardian Maia</i> is a 3rd person action-adventure game set in 2750 where the world of science fiction and traditional Indigenous M\u0101ori culture collide. Play as Maia and embark on a treacherous quest across New Zealand\u2019s unforgiving South Island in a bid to find three hidden kete (baskets) which are the key to saving your people. Fight ruthless warriors, mutated creatures and androids who run rampant as you uncover your family\u2019s secretive past. <br><br><i>Guardian Maia</i> is developed by Metia Interactive, a M\u0101ori led team of developers based in Auckland, New Zealand. <br><br><u>Immerse In A Captivating Story</u><br>A culturally resonant and universal narrative which captures the human need to discover who we are and how we can reach our greatest potential. <i>Guardian Maia </i>is based on the traditional M\u0101ori genealogical story of T\u0101ne (God of the Forest), his ascension through the twelve heavens to retrieve the baskets of knowledge for humankind and his vengeful brother Whiro\u2019s (God of Darkness) rabid attempts to stop him. <br><br>In collaboration with M\u0101ori cultural consultants, <i>Guardian Maia</i> has been developed to  authentically represent M\u0101ori history, tikanga (customs), carving and costuming. <br><br><u>Uncover Your Family\u2019s Dramatic Past</u><br><i>Guardian Maia</i> is a heroic tale of good versus evil intertwined with deep rooted family conflicts. Befriend a memorable cast of characters including smart mouthed AI and M\u0101ori deities who\u2019ll help you untangle your family\u2019s dark secrets. Reconcile with your estranged father so you can forge a hopeful future for you and your people. <br><br><u>Venture Through Thrilling Lands</u><br>An environmentally diverse world where darkness has shrouded the land and its people for centuries, experience New Zealand as you\u2019ve never seen it before. Call on the help of M\u0101ori deities who\u2019ll guide you through peaceful South Island forests where moa and kiwi birds run free, to the high-tech cityscape of Tahuna\u2019s Regeneration Hub and snow capped mountain ranges blanketed by the thick mist of the Grey Death toxin. <br><br><u>Wield Authentic Weapons</u><br>Crunchy combat is designed to mirror the brutality of mau rakau (traditional M\u0101ori martial arts). When up against overwhelming odds, your best form of defence is your short ranged mere (greenstone club) or long ranged taiaha (staff). But when in doubt, stealth will be your best friend. Think strategically and sneak through decrepit buildings and lush forests to avoid or ambush merciless enemies standing in your way. Leverage cosmetic and combat focused weapon upgrades to protect your people and fight like the mighty guardian you are. <br><br><u>Travel Across Tahuna</u><br>Run, climb and swim across <i>Guardian Maia\u2019s</i> endlessly challenging environments. Use your strong athletic exploration skills to travel across the unlimited vertical traversal pathways across the region. Gain the trust of wild moa and the giant hokioi bird to access fast travel options. <br><br><u>Make Your Choices Matter</u><br>Every choice has its consequences. Your choices will determine how your quest unfolds, your mana (prestige, social standing) and how others perceive you. Will you save a helpless Grey Skin from an environmental trap and gain respect from their community? Or will a simple decision you make leave a loved one dead? Make every choice count but beware of those who\u2019ll take advantage of your kindness. <br><br><u>Mature Content Description</u><br>Players will use weapons such as mere and taiaha to defend themselves from mutated creatures, tama tu warriors and androids. Players will also be able to engage in stealth combat which includes violent chokeholds. Combat sequences and melee attacks include blood and gore.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2630980?t=1724216784","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2630980/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1724216784","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2630980/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724216784","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2630980/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724216784","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Contains combat scenarios."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"You are Maia, a trusted forest guardian, a speaker to all birds and most importantly a fighter.
