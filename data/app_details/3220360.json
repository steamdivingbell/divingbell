{"about_the_game":"Flowering Void puts you in the perspective of a creature with no memory, but very human emotions. You have a goal, but don't know why. You exist in a dark realm, but don't know where. Over time, you'll learn more about the nature of your world and the impact you're having on it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Survival Sequence</h2>In the primary gameplay area, you're challenged to protect a core from an army of hostile entities, allowing the core to gain as much energy as possible. This sequence has no set end point, so you're encouraged to improve your skills and toolset to perform as best as possible and earn better rewards and endings.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Sanctuary</h2>The second area is where you spend most of your down time. Here you can purchase new items, view your inventory, practice your movement, and even uncover secrets.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3220360/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734370353","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3220360/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1734370353","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3220360/640a54cf3e576150f49102ee3e377fd52284e07d/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734370353","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3220360/640a54cf3e576150f49102ee3e377fd52284e07d/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734370353","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"This game contains a small number of scenes with blood coming out of inhuman creatures and human body parts.
