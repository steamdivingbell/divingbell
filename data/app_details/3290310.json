It's a software that emulates the limitations and performances of retro consoles.

I made games at Ubisoft for 3 years before going indie in solo. Creating a game alone is a challenge, but it's incredibly rewarding and it offers you (the players) a unique and personal experience (thinking about <i>undertale</i>, <i>stardew valley</i> and <i>braid</i>).
