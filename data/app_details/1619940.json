After being returned to the store, Max breaks out of the backroom to find the store completely overrun with hostile toys and his numerous counterparts turned against him. Using spare parts lying around or taken from defeated Maxes, you must traverse knocked over boxes, stocked shelves and well laid traps to ultimately reach your nemesis, defeat him and return the store back to its family friendly self!","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1619940?t=1673120746","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1619940/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1673120746","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1619940/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1673120746","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1619940/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1673120746","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Mix-A-Max is an action packed beat-em up where our hero Max must use his wits and defective copies' interchangeable parts to thwart a rogue prototype version of himself who has turned a toy store into a plastic battleground.
