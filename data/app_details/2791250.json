{"about_the_game":"Clay\u2019s wife went missing six years ago. She was going to visit her sister, got off the train at Hazelwood Station, and never got back on. He\u2019s going back now to find out what really happened and deal with the consequences. Along the way, he\u2019ll have to earn the money needed to buy train tickets, make friends with other passengers, and try to keep it all together. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach station brings new challenges, new sights, and higher ticket prices, but Clay didn\u2019t come this far to be stopped by something as mundane as being broke - he\u2019s always been resourceful and is willing to do whatever it takes to get back on the train. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the train, he finds that people are willing to share their stories and he sees a lot of himself in the people he meets. If only he could get a full night of sleep without dreaming about the events from six years ago. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHazelwood Station is a narrative game about loss, forgiveness, and empathy, with a host of interesting minigames thrown in. Play guitar or sell pictures to earn your way onto the train and admire the scenery as the train travels the length of the country over the course of the game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2791250/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732304775","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2791250/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1732304775","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2791250/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732304775","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2791250/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732304775","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":2792780,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Clay\u2019s wife went missing six years ago.
