The action in the game circles around steampunk and tells a tale of a time after a biological war, the consequences of which proved fatal for the biosphere of the planet. In a city built high in the sky, far away from the poisonous vapor, the residents spend their time without a worry or a care. Meanwhile, all the work is performed by robots. One day, however, something happens and all of the residents were evacuated by robots. The main hero Charlie decides to put a cap on the situation. The fate of the city and its people lies in his very hands. Throughout the game, he makes some unusual friends: a robot guard named Howard and a little sheep named Shaney, who share his daring adventures with him<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/610720/extras/anim3.gif?t=1723603135\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/610720/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1723603135","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/610720/page.bg.jpg?t=1723603135","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/610720/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1723603135","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/610720/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1723603135","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/610720/extras/mechatronikaP5.png?t=1723603135\" /><br>Mechatronika is an adventure genre game with puzzle elements.
