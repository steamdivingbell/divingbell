I am still waiting for this game to see if there will be feedback from players. Recently, I am developing new games and want to make a game that supports online at the bottom of the game itself;<br>2. Sometimes I think that if there is an online function, the game may be more fun;<br>3. I have received some new comments and connoisseur comments in the past two days. I am very happy!<br>4. Because during the release period, I didn't dare to update the game randomly, so I could only wait and see if more players would comment, hoping to get more valuable experience in developing the game;<br>5. Let me talk about what I have been doing recently. I have been developing a game architecture that can naturally support online connection. I hope that based on this, all the games I develop in the future can naturally have online functions;<br>6. Therefore, recently, while we are still developing games, we are waiting for more players to comment on the game so that we can learn more experience in game development;<br>7. The newly developed online architecture of the new game has been tested very smoothly with players in the community. Perhaps the newly developed games can really have online functions naturally!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0929] ----</h2>1. Today is the 23rd! There is still one day left before the game is released! The last game package has been uploaded to steam today. I hope everything will go well on the 25th!<br>2. My first game made on steam will be released soon! I hope everything goes well!<br>3. Today is the 24th! Tomorrow at 12 o'clock Beijing time on the 25th, the game will be officially released!<br>4. Today, I made a brand new promotional video and put it on the store page. I hope everyone will like it!<br>5. If you have anything you want to ask during the game, you can say it in the comments if you want to give feedback. I will check the comments and replies one by one!<br>6. Finally, I hope the game can be released smoothly on the 25th!<br>7. Today is the 25th! The game has been successfully released on Steam!<br>8. Today, someone reported that some details in the game were not handled properly, and they were fixed as soon as possible. If there is any other feedback, you can leave a message in the comments area and I will check the comments one by one!<br>9. Recently, I have been studying ways to make games online, and I want to develop a game that can be connected to the bottom layer. At the same time, I should pay attention to the player reviews of this game, because the game has just been released, and I want to ensure that the bugs reported by players can be fixed in time as soon as possible;<br>10. Recently, I have been developing a new online game architecture, and then I have been concerned about the feedback from players of this game; I am especially afraid that players will report that the BUG cannot be fixed in time;<br>11. However, so far there have been no major bugs reported, which is very happy;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0922] ----</h2><br>1. According to the needs of test players, I put the online system that is still in beta status into the game; I hid it, and the online interface will only be opened when I click the Varsion version number;<br>2. I originally planned to wait until the online development was better before releasing it, but there were still many problems; however, the players said it was better to release it directly or hide it, so I released this online module;<br>3. After testing with players, I found that the online system had great flaws and it was completely impossible to play games normally; it might not be possible to put them into use before going online;<br>4. Maybe it is still too early to implement online mode, and the technology is not mature enough;<br>5. Because the game's release date is coming soon, I don't dare to make too much changes to the game recently. The recent updates are relatively small content;<br>6. At present, I really hope to go online smoothly; without bugs, everyone can run the game normally, and I have tested as much as possible recently.<br>7. Recently, because we can't make random changes to the game, we hope to be able to go online stably, but we have time to slowly study some new technologies;<br>8. After this game is officially launched, it should be busy. When the time comes, it will be exciting to think about accepting comments from players to fix possible bugs as soon as possible, or updating content;<br>9. Today is the 20th, and there are still 4 to 5 days left before the game is released! The game's plot may be finally reviewed and revised recently, and then there should be no more development before it is released;<br>10. There was a recent incident. Many people who seemed to be connoisseurs sent me emails saying they wanted a key;<br>11. Today is the 21st, and there are still three days left before the game is released!<br>12. Today is the 22nd, and there are still two days left before the game is released! The last game update package should be carried out tomorrow, and in the last two days, we should concentrate on preparing for release, and prepare for player feedback as soon as possible after release!<br>I hope the sales will go smoothly!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0915] ----</h2><br>1. The latest demo version has been updated! I've been busy with a lot of updates this day, and I finally caught up on September 8. I hope everyone can have fun!<br>2. There is less than half a month left before the game was released, and a game test was recently conducted in the community. Then, based on feedback from players, the game was adjusted in the final stage. Overall, no serious bugs were found in the test so far, which is very happy;<br>3. Test, test, test; I have been testing recently, and the players who participated in the test have given me a lot of feedback. I have been testing and making final adjustments to the game;<br>4. I hope that when it is finally launched, I will be able to achieve a game that allows players to play happily; a game that can be smooth and profitable without bugs will be officially launched;<br>5. Recently, the UI interface of the leaderboard has been redesigned; this makes the overall style of the main interface more concise!<br>6. In recent tests, players have said this, saying that this is more like a mowing STG game like Vampire Survivor; I am very, very happy to get such a review!<br>7. Recently, I uploaded an officially usable Workshop item and it can be used normally in community testing! When the game is released later, you should be able to use this Workshop item normally!<br>8. Recently, during testing, players responded that they might need to make an in-game graphic manual, but I wonder if they can rush it out before the final launch.<br>9. The manual in the game is out! With this Manual, I feel that the overall game is much better; at least to a certain extent, people can understand some basic data mechanisms by reading the Manual;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0908] ----</h2><br>1. Recently, a new and more difficult production was completed, which is arguably the most difficult difficulty so far; in this way, when the original version of the game was released, there were more options in the overall game's difficulty mode;<br>2. Currently, it is confirmed that the game will be released on September 25; before then, the last wave of game testing may be conducted in the group; I hope that the game will be launched smoothly without bugs;<br>3. Recently, in order to allow players to have more different experiences every time they re-play, more content has been filled in the entire early game process; we hope to ensure that every time players experience more subtle differences;<br>4. The latest demo version should be updated on September 8. This should be the last demo version before the game is released;<br>5. Recently, a lot of content has been added. If a person develops a game, he always feels that he always has to add new and interesting content and always add a lot of special bullets. It feels like the development of a game seems to have no end. This feeling is quite interesting;<br>6. Recently, I found an interesting feeling because I often played my game during testing; then for reference, I went to find some Eastern Project-type games to play, and suddenly found that I couldn't penetrate the other party's bullet screen, which actually made me a little uncomfortable;<br>7. As I mentioned before, I went to experience the game Angel at Dusk; I found that if you hit an enemy in it, you will not be harmed. I found that this design is very good; so I adjusted the game, and now this game will not be harmed even if you hit an enemy;<br>8. Recently, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is about to be released soon, and I really want to experience video clearance; but my game is approaching the 25th of the release date, and I have to constantly optimize the game content recently; It is difficult for one person to develop a game to ensure that it can be optimized 100% well. Time is tight now, and I can't have time to watch videos like the previous video clearance Black Myth did;<br>9. Recently, because the release date is approaching, I dare not make too much changes to the internal system of the entire game; so when I want to make updates with relatively small changes, I may prefer updates with small content recently, and then see if I can update some more example mods in the Workshop, so that players who may want to make mods can easily understand how mods are made;<br>10. September 8th is coming soon. If everything goes well, we should be able to update the latest demo version to Steam! Please look forward to it!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0901] ----</h2><br>1. Today, I have completed the production of all promotional pictures on the store page; now all the cover pictures of the store page have been updated; these pictures are much better than the original ones, and I hope everyone will like them!<br>2. Because there are too many historical development logs, I removed the log information before February this year;<br>3. Recently, some players reported that the BOSS's behavior pattern is too single, which I think makes sense; therefore, I added a lot of behavior patterns to the BOSS, and there are also several movement trajectories that are difficult to deal with;<br>4. Recently, some players have reported that the character's melee attack damage is too weak, so I have also strengthened the melee damage a little bit; I found that this kind of feedback is really good, and I really like the feeling of slowly improving the game through this kind of feedback; I hope that players can give me more feedback when playing games in the future, so that I will be very happy, because it will be very helpful for the development of the game;<br>5. Recently, the layout of the entire store page has been rearranged, and some new art materials have been updated; an image of Brand Girl has also been placed at the bottom; I hope these new art materials will be liked;<br>6. Recently, I happened to see a video about Konami Code, which I found very interesting, so I added a hidden character to the game. I can switch to the hidden character by entering the Konami Code during the game;<br>7. Recently, in order to make this game more fun, I found a STG game called IKARUGA when I searched the information. I checked it and it is indeed a great work, hoping I can find some inspiration for developing games.<br>8. Recently, someone told me that there are few STG game players nowadays, and asked me to refer to the game Angel at Dusk to do some special art style themes; I went to check it out, and it is indeed a very unique game!<br>9. Recently, during discussions in the community group, some players said that they hope to make it as difficult as possible, regardless of whether they can clear the customs or not, they hope to make it as difficult as possible. Recently, they are thinking about how to continue to make it more difficult;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0825] ----</h2><br>1. Recently, some cute feedback behaviors have been added to the UI interface of the game during runtime;<br>2. In this way, when obtaining some attribute items, players can more clearly understand the function of the items based on feedback;<br>3. Some digressions, recently the Black Myth Wukong (WU KONG) will be released soon. If I become addicted to it, it may affect the update of this daily record;<br>4. However, I will definitely try my best to have an update log every day!<br>5. Recently, the overall internal structure of the game has been sorted out to a certain extent; this is done to make it more convenient when updating the game in the future; I have always felt that it is very important that the game structure can be kept updated at any time;<br>6. Recently, I was thinking about the Workshop. I tried my best to make Mod production as simple as possible. I also uploaded Mod for demonstrations, but I was worried that players would not be able to learn it well; these can only be answered one by one after some players start research and when some players start asking questions;<br>7. I am very confident that making Mod will be easy, but I am also afraid that players will not be able to learn it at the beginning. I can only wait. I hope I can teach everyone how to make Mod in the future;<br>8. Recently, I received a comment on this game; the comment said that the artistic performance of this game may be a bit different from that of good-looking games, but it can be seen that the game is very gameplay; I am still very happy to get such a comment;<br>9. As I said before, I might focus on playing Wukong this week, but over the past three days, I found that I still prefer games like PalWorld. Since I have spent too much time developing games recently, I went to play Palworld in order to relax;<br>10. Because it is almost September 25th, the game's release date, I have been doing system optimization in terms of details recently; because it is the first game I have made sold on Steam, I am worried about the stability of the game after it is actually released; I hope it can be released smoothly. No matter how bad it is, at the very least, I hope that I can fix the player feedback problems as soon as possible after there are player feedback problems;<br>11. Recently, I have been thinking about beautification of store pages, and I am thinking about whether I need to draw some pictures that can beautify store pages; this may take a lot of time. If I can draw them in decisive time, the pictures on store pages should continue to be updated;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0818] ----</h2><br>1. Delete all Mods that were previously tested and uploaded in the workshop;<br>2. Then, I uploaded a demonstration Mod to the workshop and filled its configuration file with comments as much as possible;<br>3. In this way, if a player wants to make a Mod, by subscribing to the Mod project for the demonstration, he should be able to understand the directory structure and configuration information of a Mod to a minimum extent;<br>4. When conducting tests in the community recently, I finally discovered a BUG; it feels great to be able to test out the BUG and then fix it smoothly;<br>5. Previously, some people in the community reported that the expressiveness of the UI was too monotonous; so recently, they have improved the expressiveness of the UI, and now the overall look is much better;<br>6. Recently, WU KONG is about to be released soon. I was thinking about playing it, but developing the game takes a lot of time, and if you play the game, you can't develop it; so I might just find a video to review the plot;<br>7. Recently, I have been thinking about whether to continue to fill more content into the game, but I am afraid that it will make the game complicated. I may want to wait until players start playing and see what kind of feedback will be received so that I can make a decision easily.<br>8. Recently, when I was testing the game in the community group, I received a comment from a player, saying that such a Shmup/STG barrage shooting game could be played; I felt very happy to get such a comment. This player is very bad at playing this kind of game, which shows that the current development direction of this game is still successful;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0811] ----</h2><br>1. The latest version of the Demo is updated! Compared with the previous version, there are many more changes. I hope everyone can have fun!<br>2. I have been busy with development recently, which has caused me to forget the time. I can't make a new demo version on August 4th. I can only update the new demo version on August 11th;<br>3. Because it is about to be released soon, I have been doing game testing recently to see if I can find any more bugs; but so far, no bugs have been found; the more no bugs are found, the more I always feel that there will be bugs; This feeling is so wonderful;<br>4. I have been thinking about one thing recently, because the game is approaching its release date, and I am thinking about whether the current game meets a minimum standard that makes people happy to play;<br>5. However, there is currently no good way to collect feedback from players on the game; so, all I can think about is to wait until the game is released to see what feedback players have following the development and adjustment; I don't know if this is the right approach.<br>6. Recently, I have often searched some other STG games, and it seems that there are very few where all bullets can eliminate each other;<br>7. So, I hope that the type of STG I developed can bring you a completely different gaming experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0804] ----</h2><br>1. The game is almost at the end of development. Recently, the design of the BOSS has been completed. Currently, there are 200 BOSS units;<br>2. Some people may wonder why there are more than 200 Bosses in a Shmup/STG game that has not a long process. That is because the Bosses appear in each game are random. Maybe a player wants to play this game repeatedly and see all the Bosses. The probability may be lower than winning the prize;<br>3. In this game genre, this game may be more like a Roguelike Game;<br>4. I have completed the design of the last 20 new Bosses today. A rough calculation shows that the entire game process should be about 220 Bosses. Now I am thinking about a question. For a Shmup/STG game, will my game process be too short, but I am worried that too long game time will make players too tired;<br>5. The difficulty of the game has been increased to another level. Now, at the highest difficulty level, the game duration should be more than 30-40 minutes; in this case, it may be more in line with the duration of a Shmup/STG game;<br>6. I adjusted the overall difficulty of the game; now the difficulty in the early stage of the game continues to decrease; after all, what I want to make is a game that everyone can play happily and easily;<br>7. Recently, I discovered that there was a problem with the Japanese translated by the translation software I used, and it has been repaired;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0728] ----</h2><br>1. Recently, some optimizations have been made for the direct collision handling of each unit in the game; in the future, enemy units will not all be stacked together, and enemies will squeeze each other and bounce away, so that the overall visual effect will be better;<br>2. Some players responded that the backswing time for melee attacks was too long. Recently, when updating the game daily, they greatly shortened the backswing time for this melee attack;<br>3. I posted a forum post asking everyone what they thought of this game at present. Everyone said that my game's main interface is too concise and not good enough; so recently I found some art materials and tried to beautify the main interface as much as possible.<br>4. I consulted many forum people and asked everyone for their opinions on this game. Everyone said that mine is different from the traditional SHMUP game and more like a meat pigeon like the Vampire Survivor, which is simply referred to as Shmup Survival Like;<br>5. However, many people commented that this is not the same as traditional Shmup games at all; however, what I do is not a traditional Shmup game, but more like a game with a new gaming experience; from this perspective, maybe I prefer this kind of evaluation;<br>6. Recent statistics show that there are currently more than 130 BOSS types and types in the game; however, in order to make players more random when encountering BOSS in each game process, more BOSS types will continue to be added;<br>7. Recently, I completed a function that will randomly play BOSS related music when the BOSS appears. Although I use all free materials, with BOSS's special music, I feel that the overall atmosphere is still quite good;<br>8. Now I find that the Shmup/STG game I developed seems to be completely different from traditional games; many people in my posts said that enemy bullets can be shot out, which is different from traditional Shmup/STG games;<br>9. Now think about it, it is indeed the case. The game I developed seems to be more like a Hack and Slash Game, and the game experience is like a game with this kind of fun;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0722] ----</h2><br>Q: I need an item description interface. When I play the game, I don't know which item has what effect;<br>A: Okay, I will think about how to add an easy-to-understand item description.<br><br>This week's diary:<br>1. Hello everyone, this time we tried to use the logging method once a day;<br>2. Recently, I am filling content and approaching the release date, and I want to make the entire game's content process as rich as possible;<br>3. Recently, a new point-in-time triggering event has been developed, which can trigger events with high performance when a target is close to another target; I wonder if it can be used in any interesting design;<br>4. Recently, I learned from Vampire Survivors and wanted to make an off-site store. I felt that this off-site store would enhance the protagonist to a certain extent. Such a design would be very interesting; at the same time, it might also reduce the difficulty of SHMUP/STG games to a certain extent. This would allow more players to play STG games happily.<br>5. It seems that the development of off-site stores has been successfully completed, and now I am starting to have a headache about how to design off-site stores; if I want to reduce the overall game much, I think I should strengthen the off-site stores a little more; I am still thinking about it at the moment, let's see what level we can achieve by then.<br>6. Today, I posted posts on different forums asking everyone what they think of this STG game, and received varying degrees of feedback; now I have to think about how to apply this feedback to the game;<br>7. Today, I carried out some optimization research and development on the physics engine I wrote throughout the game. Perhaps because of today's optimization, a new bullet type can be added to the game;<br>8. So, this week's diary is the previous one, so we'll see you next week ~<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0714] ----</h2><br>Q: I think we can post Steam announcements on these update logs, so that I think it will have better publicity effects;<br>A: OK, I will issue an announcement starting this week, but it is too stressful for me to do multi-lingual localization in the announcement, so I only do multi-lingual processing in Chinese and English on the announcement;<br>A: In fact, the content in the announcement is actually the content of this week's diary below;<br><br>This week's diary:<br>1. Hello everyone, welcome to this week's development diary;<br>2. Hesitation is approaching the release of the game soon, and recently a large amount of content has been enriched in the game; including adding more types of BOSS and completing the production of more background images;<br>3. At the same time, hesitation has begun to enter the final part of the game, and has also begun to think about making some Steam achievements; hoping to provide players with a better game experience assistance in terms of achievements;<br>4. Also, there were some minor problems with the Demo released on July 6, and now the Demo has also been updated to a new version;<br>5. Next, we will continue to improve the content of the game, hoping to provide a game that is as fun as possible for players who like SHMUP/STG on September 25;<br>6. So, we will see you again next week in our blog update. I hope there will be more good research and development in the next week to make the game as interesting as possible;<br>7. See you next week, bye ~<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0706] ----</h2><br>Q: Is the historical information of the game development log written here too long?<br>A: Okay, I deleted some historical information that was too long;<br><br>This week's diary:<br>1. Hello everyone, although it's not yet Sunday, the demo version has been updated in advance!<br>2. Next, the next update to the demo version should be on August 4th, so stay tuned!<br>3. This update adds a lot of new things, including new bullet types, new background scenery, and various beautiful flowers and plants;<br>4. At the same time, because someone previously said that they wanted full-screen mode functions, these are now all added;<br>5. Moreover, a new &quot;high-performance mode&quot; has been added. In this mode, players will have a better feeling of operating the character;<br>6. In terms of difficulty, players will be given enough time at the beginning of the game to familiarize themselves with the operations;<br>7. In short, compared with the previous version, this new version should have many obvious differences. I hope everyone can have fun.<br>8. So, regarding the new content being developed recently, let's talk about it in next week's update log;<br>9. See you next week, bye ~<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0630] ----</h2><br>Q: Have you been playing Palworld recently?<br>A: ... yes, because she updated the new version, I like this game very much. I have been playing it for three consecutive days;<br><br>Q: Will playing Palworld affect the development progress of your game?<br>A: ... Yes, but I really like playing it. I used to like POKEMON players very much. As soon as the magical beast Paru came out, I became addicted. I think that only by playing well and having fun can I have more energy to develop this game.<br><br>This week's diary:<br>1. Hello everyone, it's Sunday again. This week, I was eaten up by Palworld for three days of development time;<br>2. However, I did some tests, which proved that the performance optimization of the games I have developed currently satisfies me;<br>3. I tested it and let Palworld run in the background, then ran my game in Unity. At the same time, I also opened recording software and video playback;<br>4. In this case, my game can run at 100-140 frame rates. When I don't turn on the recording software, my game frame rate can reach 190 frame rates, which is only 10 frame rates lower than normal games;<br>5. This test result made me very happy. I never knew how to determine the minimum configuration required for this game; as everyone knows, Palworld is very popular with configurations. I put it in the background of the computer to run it, but the result actually did not have a big impact on my game running frame rate, so I am very satisfied.<br>6. Next, there is news about the new demo version on July 7;<br>7. At present, it is initially confirmed that there will be a new demo update on July 7, and new content will be updated then. Please look forward to it ~<br>8. So, that's all for this week's diary. We'll see you next week in the development diary. I hope I can have fun next week and start game development as soon as possible.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0623] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. Hello everyone, it's Sunday again;<br>2. The development this week is still relatively smooth. If nothing goes wrong, we should be able to update the latest trial version in July;<br>3. If nothing goes wrong, it should be updated on July 6 or July 7;<br>4. This week, the performance of the game has been greatly optimized. Starting from the next demo version, the operating feel of the entire game will be better;<br>5. Recently, during testing recently, some players responded that the difficulty may be a bit difficult; so the next update will be optimized in the direction of continuing to reduce the difficulty; but there is currently no more ideal approach;<br>6. Therefore, I hope that in the next week, further research and development can be completed, making the entire game process more suitable for novice STG players;<br>7. So, that's all for this week's update log. We'll see you next time ~<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0616] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. Hello everyone, welcome to this week's development diary;<br>2. The development progress this week was relatively smooth, and it would be great if the next week could go so smoothly; but at present, the trial version 0.15 should be completed smoothly in July;<br>3. Recently, there was a problem that was very confusing. I didn't know what label the type of game I developed should be. Everyone here calls it STG games, or barrage shooting games. Someone told me that on Steam, everyone calls it Shmup type games; I have tagged both STG and Shmup, and it would be nice if someone could read this blog and send me an email to teach me;<br>4. At present, the content of the trial version in July has been completed ahead of schedule, and the next work will continue to adjust and optimize the content of the game. If everything goes well, everyone can play the next trial version in July;<br>5. So, that's all for this week's update log. We'll see you next week;<br>6. There is a digression. Isn't Palworld going to have a new version on June 27? I may go and play it for a while then, hoping that it will not delay my development progress of this game;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0609] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. This week, the demo version of 0.14 was successfully updated; this demo version is a great improvement compared to the previous version, at least at the beginning, it is a playable game;<br>2. By now, you should have seen on the store page that I have adjusted the release date of the game to September 25, 2024; this is the most recent plan, and I hope to complete the minimum level of research and development before August, so that I can Release the game in September;<br>3. This means that I need to complete the last part of the game within two months. I hope I can complete my plan smoothly.<br>4. However, in July, I plan to continue to launch the next phase of the demo version; for this reason, the overall development plan is relatively tight;<br>5. Moreover, one thing recently may greatly affect my development plan; that is,&quot;Wukong&quot; will be released soon. If it is released in August, I may spend a lot of time understanding and playing this game; this will have a lot of impact on my development plan;<br>6. In short, I will try my best to ensure the progress and quality of my game development, hoping to complete a better game;<br>7. So, that's all for this week's update log, and we'll see you next week's log;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0603] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. I'm sorry for the late update of my blog this week!<br>2. I have been focusing on preparing for the next demo update this week;<br>3. There is less than a week left until June 9. If the development goes smoothly this week, the next demo version will be updated between June 7 and June 9;<br>4. At that time, the updates involved in the new demo version will be recorded in the &quot;Update Notes&quot; above;<br>5. Then, there is the next update plan. After June 10, the next stage of update research and development will be entered. At that time, it is hoped that a further trial version will be updated within July;<br>6. Regarding the research and development content involved in the new content, let's see if there can be any progress next week, and let's talk about it then;<br>7. So, we'll see you next week in the journal ~<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0526] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. Recently this week, I have been developing the content of the game;<br>2. It's almost June, and the current goal is to complete the new demo update before June 9;<br>3. Recently, there has been relatively simple content research and development, so there is not much to say this week.<br>4. However, after some thinking this week, I still feel that I want to make a simpler and relaxed barrage shooting game;<br>5. So, this week's diary is almost like this. I hope next week's diary can provide a better progress and report on the development progress of the demo version;<br>6. So, we'll see you next week ~<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0519] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. Regarding the development progress this week, the development this week was relatively smooth; due to the increased game content in the version under development, the ten-minute experience mode of the demo version may no longer be able to play the entire game process;<br>2. The new demo version will be updated after the latest version is developed;<br>3. I recently reviewed the current game process. The current game content is not rich enough. The next updates should continue to enrich the current game process; increase the types of enemies and the number of bullets dropped; the ultimate goal is to make the entire game process more relaxed and decompressed when playing;<br>4. In short, I ultimately plan to make this game a SHMUP game that anyone can easily play; and it would be better to have a lower difficulty;<br>5. So, this week's diary is pretty much like this. Let's see you next week ~<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0513] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. I'm sorry for the late update of my blog this week!<br>2. So, let's talk about the recent game development situation immediately;<br>3. Recently, the main process of the game is still being developed; the newly developed system has been initially finalized, which is aimed at a meat-like pigeon-like system like the Vampire Survivor;<br>4. However, it may take a week or two to confirm whether this system can finally be developed and implemented;<br>5. The ultimate goal of this meat pigeon system is to be able to pop up optional attributes, weapons and other improvement items like vampire survivors in a form that does not interrupt the flow; a design to improve one's own abilities;<br>6. The next two weeks were mainly about thinking and developing this new meat pigeon system;<br>7. So, this week's diary is almost like this. If the development of the new system goes smoothly, it will be updated to the demo version;<br>8. Some digression: Didn't the game Manor Lords just come out recently? Developers may spend some time studying this game recently, which may have a slight impact on the development progress of the game, but I believe the impact will not be too big; I won't be addicted like Palworld last time (wry smile);<br>9. So, we will see you again next week in the journal. I hope that this week's research and development will make a very smooth progress; especially the meat pigeon system that I spent a lot of time thinking about this time, I hope it will be developed smoothly; then we will see you next week ~<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0505] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. Hello everyone, it's Sunday, and I'm starting to write this week's update diary;<br>2. Now, the demo version has been updated to version 0.12! If nothing goes wrong, this version is the version that participates in the Steam &quot;Infinite Replay Games Festival&quot;;<br>3. Regarding the next update to the demo version, it should focus on the update of the game process, including new scenarios and enemies; specifically, waiting for the next research and development, if it goes smoothly, it should also be updated to the demo version simultaneously;<br>4. Recently, I have been thinking about how to make the game process more interesting, while ensuring that the game is relatively simple; I believe that it will not take much time to think about a better approach;<br>5. So, if this demo version 0.12 is fine, the developer will concentrate on the development of the next new version;<br>6. So, we'll see you next week! Looking forward to new research and development progress next week!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0428] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. Hello everyone, it's Sunday, and I'm starting to write this week's update diary;<br>2. First of all, the research and development of the next demo version is currently at an initial stage. If there are no mistakes, the demo version can be updated to the latest version around May 5;<br>3. At present, the relevant screenshots and promotional videos on the store page have been updated to the new version, and the content of these new screenshots will be in the next demo version;<br>4. Regarding the research and development of new functions, the main purpose for this game is to create a simple flying shooting game; every time a new function is conceived, I will think about whether it will make the game complicated; therefore, the new function is still being considered whether to join;<br>5. At present, this week's update log content is almost like this; the main purpose is to prepare for a healthy trial version in preparation for participating in Steam's &quot;Infinite Replay Games Festival&quot;;<br>6. So, we'll see you next week! I hope that the update of the demo version will be successfully completed next week; I also hope that the development of new features will be smooth!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0422] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. I'm sorry for this week's update log coming late!<br>2. This week, I was mainly thinking about how to make a STG game as simple as possible; since the prop module system was previously developed, I am now thinking about whether the integration of this part of the system is too complicated for STG games.<br>3. For this reason, there was not much progress in R &amp; D work this week;<br>4. I hope that in the next week, the research and development work can be successfully completed to a further stage;<br>5. I hope that the game can be completed to a new stage in early May;<br>6. So, we will see you next week and hope to have better research and development results next week!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0415] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. I'm sorry for this week's update log coming late! Let's talk about this week's research and development content immediately;<br>2. This week, I focused on studying the systems of Brotato and other survival-like games; looking for ways to incorporate interesting parts of them into my game.<br>3. To this end, this part of the content has been under development this week. Moreover, the research and development is relatively smooth!<br>4. I believe that these new system modules will be updated to the demo version soon. Please look forward to it!<br>5. In the next week, the research and development work on this part of the module will continue. If it goes smoothly, I believe it will be available in the demo version soon!<br>6. So, we'll see you next week!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0407] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. Online mode has been updated initially! Now, the online mode is still in the testing phase, so in the start interface hidden online mode button; the game interface lower right corner of the Varsion text, you can click this text to open the online interface; the current online mode is still in the testing phase, there may be many problems;<br>2. Next, we will continue to develop new content on the basis of slowly improving this online module;<br>3. As for the contents of the next development, they should be recorded in the journal next week.<br>4. In the next week, I hope to improve the game even more.<br>5. Well, we'll see you next week;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0330] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. This week, research and development for online is going smoothly; I believe that the demo version will be updated to the next version soon;<br>2. If it goes well, next week when the log is updated, it should be able to update the demo version smoothly.<br>3. However, because the current online mode is completely testing phase, when the time should be hidden processing; specific performance is, use the mouse to left-click the Varsion version number of the lower right button, will open the online room;<br>4. The following week, will have been focusing on online mode processing; hope that the next week can be developed smoothly;<br>5. See you next week in the diary.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0324] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. This week, I am busy with the research and development of online and optimizing game memory management.<br>two\u3002 Recently, during a test, it was found that there was a serious memory leak in the current trial version.<br>3. This memory leak problem will result in not even starting a game on a player's computer with low memory configuration.<br>4. So, recently, we have been optimizing this memory leak problem.<br>5. With regard to the online module, the research and development of the online module is relatively smooth at present. After the memory leak has been fixed, we will continue to develop the online module next week.<br>6. After the most preliminary online development is completed, the trial version may be updated for preliminary testing.<br>7. That's about all for this week. I'll see you next week.<br>8. As an aside, I recently found that RIMWORLD has been updated to version 1.5. it seems that I may delay the development of this game because I want to play this game; after all, it is too fun; I hope I will not be too addicted and delay the progress of the research and development of this game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0318] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. This week, I am busy with the research and development of online system.<br>two\u3002 Recently, I want to add an online system to this game.<br>3. At present, the research and development is relatively smooth, but when the online function is actually developed and used, there may be a lot of problems.<br>4. However, after thinking about it, the game still needs online function to be fun, so it has been developing an online system recently.<br>5. If all goes well, in the next trial version, we should be able to test the online function.<br>6. Well, I hope the online function can be developed smoothly in the coming week.<br>7. So, I'll see you next week.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0310] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. This week, we finally finished the initial stage of research and development of the prop system.<br>two\u3002 Now, it is found that all the R &amp; D content so far can be updated to the trial version.<br>3. Next, we will sort out the overall code architecture, and if all goes well, I believe we will soon be able to update the current trial version of the game to a new version.<br>4. After updating the trial version, you can experience the updates so far in the new version.<br>5. Then, I hope the next week's R &amp; D arrangement can be carried out smoothly.<br>6. So, I'll see you next week.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0303] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. This week, the research and development of the prop system is relatively smooth; I believe that the second version of the trial version may be completed soon.<br>two\u3002 Under the current research and development idea of the prop system, it may be dealt with according to the props used in the two games &quot;Knights of Valour&quot; and &quot;Metal Slug&quot;.<br>3. For this reason, the update of the demo version may be developed in this direction;<br>4. Next, let's see how far the prop system can be completed in the next week.<br>5. Hope to be able to combine it more interesting, so that the completion of this STG game will appear a little more diversified; let's look at the test results of the new trial version.<br>6. So, I'll see you next week.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Run the game 1 time (1/6)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2329760/a5981bc0f1abe8b6c3d547a1543515efc4478bb6.jpg"},{"name":"Run the game 2 times (2/6)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2329760/d0e77efd022248f93b65683fcdf4a5c49a784688.jpg"},{"name":"Run the game 4 times (4/6)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2329760/eb22ea4001de85c491783a286d71841b9d76fa64.jpg"},{"name":"Run the game 6 times (6/6)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2329760/79e99f1d740aafecce77f03000a36c4953c49214.jpg"},{"name":"Pass the customs!

I am still waiting for this game to see if there will be feedback from players. Recently, I am developing new games and want to make a game that supports online at the bottom of the game itself;<br>2. Sometimes I think that if there is an online function, the game may be more fun;<br>3. I have received some new comments and connoisseur comments in the past two days. I am very happy!<br>4. Because during the release period, I didn't dare to update the game randomly, so I could only wait and see if more players would comment, hoping to get more valuable experience in developing the game;<br>5. Let me talk about what I have been doing recently. I have been developing a game architecture that can naturally support online connection. I hope that based on this, all the games I develop in the future can naturally have online functions;<br>6. Therefore, recently, while we are still developing games, we are waiting for more players to comment on the game so that we can learn more experience in game development;<br>7. The newly developed online architecture of the new game has been tested very smoothly with players in the community. Perhaps the newly developed games can really have online functions naturally!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0929] ----</h2>1. Today is the 23rd! There is still one day left before the game is released! The last game package has been uploaded to steam today. I hope everything will go well on the 25th!<br>2. My first game made on steam will be released soon! I hope everything goes well!<br>3. Today is the 24th! Tomorrow at 12 o'clock Beijing time on the 25th, the game will be officially released!<br>4. Today, I made a brand new promotional video and put it on the store page. I hope everyone will like it!<br>5. If you have anything you want to ask during the game, you can say it in the comments if you want to give feedback. I will check the comments and replies one by one!<br>6. Finally, I hope the game can be released smoothly on the 25th!<br>7. Today is the 25th! The game has been successfully released on Steam!<br>8. Today, someone reported that some details in the game were not handled properly, and they were fixed as soon as possible. If there is any other feedback, you can leave a message in the comments area and I will check the comments one by one!<br>9. Recently, I have been studying ways to make games online, and I want to develop a game that can be connected to the bottom layer. At the same time, I should pay attention to the player reviews of this game, because the game has just been released, and I want to ensure that the bugs reported by players can be fixed in time as soon as possible;<br>10. Recently, I have been developing a new online game architecture, and then I have been concerned about the feedback from players of this game; I am especially afraid that players will report that the BUG cannot be fixed in time;<br>11. However, so far there have been no major bugs reported, which is very happy;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0922] ----</h2><br>1. According to the needs of test players, I put the online system that is still in beta status into the game; I hid it, and the online interface will only be opened when I click the Varsion version number;<br>2. I originally planned to wait until the online development was better before releasing it, but there were still many problems; however, the players said it was better to release it directly or hide it, so I released this online module;<br>3. After testing with players, I found that the online system had great flaws and it was completely impossible to play games normally; it might not be possible to put them into use before going online;<br>4. Maybe it is still too early to implement online mode, and the technology is not mature enough;<br>5. Because the game's release date is coming soon, I don't dare to make too much changes to the game recently. The recent updates are relatively small content;<br>6. At present, I really hope to go online smoothly; without bugs, everyone can run the game normally, and I have tested as much as possible recently.<br>7. Recently, because we can't make random changes to the game, we hope to be able to go online stably, but we have time to slowly study some new technologies;<br>8. After this game is officially launched, it should be busy. When the time comes, it will be exciting to think about accepting comments from players to fix possible bugs as soon as possible, or updating content;<br>9. Today is the 20th, and there are still 4 to 5 days left before the game is released! The game's plot may be finally reviewed and revised recently, and then there should be no more development before it is released;<br>10. There was a recent incident. Many people who seemed to be connoisseurs sent me emails saying they wanted a key;<br>11. Today is the 21st, and there are still three days left before the game is released!<br>12. Today is the 22nd, and there are still two days left before the game is released! The last game update package should be carried out tomorrow, and in the last two days, we should concentrate on preparing for release, and prepare for player feedback as soon as possible after release!<br>I hope the sales will go smoothly!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0915] ----</h2><br>1. The latest demo version has been updated! I've been busy with a lot of updates this day, and I finally caught up on September 8. I hope everyone can have fun!<br>2. There is less than half a month left before the game was released, and a game test was recently conducted in the community. Then, based on feedback from players, the game was adjusted in the final stage. Overall, no serious bugs were found in the test so far, which is very happy;<br>3. Test, test, test; I have been testing recently, and the players who participated in the test have given me a lot of feedback. I have been testing and making final adjustments to the game;<br>4. I hope that when it is finally launched, I will be able to achieve a game that allows players to play happily; a game that can be smooth and profitable without bugs will be officially launched;<br>5. Recently, the UI interface of the leaderboard has been redesigned; this makes the overall style of the main interface more concise!<br>6. In recent tests, players have said this, saying that this is more like a mowing STG game like Vampire Survivor; I am very, very happy to get such a review!<br>7. Recently, I uploaded an officially usable Workshop item and it can be used normally in community testing! When the game is released later, you should be able to use this Workshop item normally!<br>8. Recently, during testing, players responded that they might need to make an in-game graphic manual, but I wonder if they can rush it out before the final launch.<br>9. The manual in the game is out! With this Manual, I feel that the overall game is much better; at least to a certain extent, people can understand some basic data mechanisms by reading the Manual;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0908] ----</h2><br>1. Recently, a new and more difficult production was completed, which is arguably the most difficult difficulty so far; in this way, when the original version of the game was released, there were more options in the overall game's difficulty mode;<br>2. Currently, it is confirmed that the game will be released on September 25; before then, the last wave of game testing may be conducted in the group; I hope that the game will be launched smoothly without bugs;<br>3. Recently, in order to allow players to have more different experiences every time they re-play, more content has been filled in the entire early game process; we hope to ensure that every time players experience more subtle differences;<br>4. The latest demo version should be updated on September 8. This should be the last demo version before the game is released;<br>5. Recently, a lot of content has been added. If a person develops a game, he always feels that he always has to add new and interesting content and always add a lot of special bullets. It feels like the development of a game seems to have no end. This feeling is quite interesting;<br>6. Recently, I found an interesting feeling because I often played my game during testing; then for reference, I went to find some Eastern Project-type games to play, and suddenly found that I couldn't penetrate the other party's bullet screen, which actually made me a little uncomfortable;<br>7. As I mentioned before, I went to experience the game Angel at Dusk; I found that if you hit an enemy in it, you will not be harmed. I found that this design is very good; so I adjusted the game, and now this game will not be harmed even if you hit an enemy;<br>8. Recently, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is about to be released soon, and I really want to experience video clearance; but my game is approaching the 25th of the release date, and I have to constantly optimize the game content recently; It is difficult for one person to develop a game to ensure that it can be optimized 100% well. Time is tight now, and I can't have time to watch videos like the previous video clearance Black Myth did;<br>9. Recently, because the release date is approaching, I dare not make too much changes to the internal system of the entire game; so when I want to make updates with relatively small changes, I may prefer updates with small content recently, and then see if I can update some more example mods in the Workshop, so that players who may want to make mods can easily understand how mods are made;<br>10. September 8th is coming soon. If everything goes well, we should be able to update the latest demo version to Steam! Please look forward to it!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0901] ----</h2><br>1. Today, I have completed the production of all promotional pictures on the store page; now all the cover pictures of the store page have been updated; these pictures are much better than the original ones, and I hope everyone will like them!<br>2. Because there are too many historical development logs, I removed the log information before February this year;<br>3. Recently, some players reported that the BOSS's behavior pattern is too single, which I think makes sense; therefore, I added a lot of behavior patterns to the BOSS, and there are also several movement trajectories that are difficult to deal with;<br>4. Recently, some players have reported that the character's melee attack damage is too weak, so I have also strengthened the melee damage a little bit; I found that this kind of feedback is really good, and I really like the feeling of slowly improving the game through this kind of feedback; I hope that players can give me more feedback when playing games in the future, so that I will be very happy, because it will be very helpful for the development of the game;<br>5. Recently, the layout of the entire store page has been rearranged, and some new art materials have been updated; an image of Brand Girl has also been placed at the bottom; I hope these new art materials will be liked;<br>6. Recently, I happened to see a video about Konami Code, which I found very interesting, so I added a hidden character to the game. I can switch to the hidden character by entering the Konami Code during the game;<br>7. Recently, in order to make this game more fun, I found a STG game called IKARUGA when I searched the information. I checked it and it is indeed a great work, hoping I can find some inspiration for developing games.<br>8. Recently, someone told me that there are few STG game players nowadays, and asked me to refer to the game Angel at Dusk to do some special art style themes; I went to check it out, and it is indeed a very unique game!<br>9. Recently, during discussions in the community group, some players said that they hope to make it as difficult as possible, regardless of whether they can clear the customs or not, they hope to make it as difficult as possible. Recently, they are thinking about how to continue to make it more difficult;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0825] ----</h2><br>1. Recently, some cute feedback behaviors have been added to the UI interface of the game during runtime;<br>2. In this way, when obtaining some attribute items, players can more clearly understand the function of the items based on feedback;<br>3. Some digressions, recently the Black Myth Wukong (WU KONG) will be released soon. If I become addicted to it, it may affect the update of this daily record;<br>4. However, I will definitely try my best to have an update log every day!<br>5. Recently, the overall internal structure of the game has been sorted out to a certain extent; this is done to make it more convenient when updating the game in the future; I have always felt that it is very important that the game structure can be kept updated at any time;<br>6. Recently, I was thinking about the Workshop. I tried my best to make Mod production as simple as possible. I also uploaded Mod for demonstrations, but I was worried that players would not be able to learn it well; these can only be answered one by one after some players start research and when some players start asking questions;<br>7. I am very confident that making Mod will be easy, but I am also afraid that players will not be able to learn it at the beginning. I can only wait. I hope I can teach everyone how to make Mod in the future;<br>8. Recently, I received a comment on this game; the comment said that the artistic performance of this game may be a bit different from that of good-looking games, but it can be seen that the game is very gameplay; I am still very happy to get such a comment;<br>9. As I said before, I might focus on playing Wukong this week, but over the past three days, I found that I still prefer games like PalWorld. Since I have spent too much time developing games recently, I went to play Palworld in order to relax;<br>10. Because it is almost September 25th, the game's release date, I have been doing system optimization in terms of details recently; because it is the first game I have made sold on Steam, I am worried about the stability of the game after it is actually released; I hope it can be released smoothly. No matter how bad it is, at the very least, I hope that I can fix the player feedback problems as soon as possible after there are player feedback problems;<br>11. Recently, I have been thinking about beautification of store pages, and I am thinking about whether I need to draw some pictures that can beautify store pages; this may take a lot of time. If I can draw them in decisive time, the pictures on store pages should continue to be updated;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0818] ----</h2><br>1. Delete all Mods that were previously tested and uploaded in the workshop;<br>2. Then, I uploaded a demonstration Mod to the workshop and filled its configuration file with comments as much as possible;<br>3. In this way, if a player wants to make a Mod, by subscribing to the Mod project for the demonstration, he should be able to understand the directory structure and configuration information of a Mod to a minimum extent;<br>4. When conducting tests in the community recently, I finally discovered a BUG; it feels great to be able to test out the BUG and then fix it smoothly;<br>5. Previously, some people in the community reported that the expressiveness of the UI was too monotonous; so recently, they have improved the expressiveness of the UI, and now the overall look is much better;<br>6. Recently, WU KONG is about to be released soon. I was thinking about playing it, but developing the game takes a lot of time, and if you play the game, you can't develop it; so I might just find a video to review the plot;<br>7. Recently, I have been thinking about whether to continue to fill more content into the game, but I am afraid that it will make the game complicated. I may want to wait until players start playing and see what kind of feedback will be received so that I can make a decision easily.<br>8. Recently, when I was testing the game in the community group, I received a comment from a player, saying that such a Shmup/STG barrage shooting game could be played; I felt very happy to get such a comment. This player is very bad at playing this kind of game, which shows that the current development direction of this game is still successful;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0811] ----</h2><br>1. The latest version of the Demo is updated! Compared with the previous version, there are many more changes. I hope everyone can have fun!<br>2. I have been busy with development recently, which has caused me to forget the time. I can't make a new demo version on August 4th. I can only update the new demo version on August 11th;<br>3. Because it is about to be released soon, I have been doing game testing recently to see if I can find any more bugs; but so far, no bugs have been found; the more no bugs are found, the more I always feel that there will be bugs; This feeling is so wonderful;<br>4. I have been thinking about one thing recently, because the game is approaching its release date, and I am thinking about whether the current game meets a minimum standard that makes people happy to play;<br>5. However, there is currently no good way to collect feedback from players on the game; so, all I can think about is to wait until the game is released to see what feedback players have following the development and adjustment; I don't know if this is the right approach.<br>6. Recently, I have often searched some other STG games, and it seems that there are very few where all bullets can eliminate each other;<br>7. So, I hope that the type of STG I developed can bring you a completely different gaming experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0804] ----</h2><br>1. The game is almost at the end of development. Recently, the design of the BOSS has been completed. Currently, there are 200 BOSS units;<br>2. Some people may wonder why there are more than 200 Bosses in a Shmup/STG game that has not a long process. That is because the Bosses appear in each game are random. Maybe a player wants to play this game repeatedly and see all the Bosses. The probability may be lower than winning the prize;<br>3. In this game genre, this game may be more like a Roguelike Game;<br>4. I have completed the design of the last 20 new Bosses today. A rough calculation shows that the entire game process should be about 220 Bosses. Now I am thinking about a question. For a Shmup/STG game, will my game process be too short, but I am worried that too long game time will make players too tired;<br>5. The difficulty of the game has been increased to another level. Now, at the highest difficulty level, the game duration should be more than 30-40 minutes; in this case, it may be more in line with the duration of a Shmup/STG game;<br>6. I adjusted the overall difficulty of the game; now the difficulty in the early stage of the game continues to decrease; after all, what I want to make is a game that everyone can play happily and easily;<br>7. Recently, I discovered that there was a problem with the Japanese translated by the translation software I used, and it has been repaired;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0728] ----</h2><br>1. Recently, some optimizations have been made for the direct collision handling of each unit in the game; in the future, enemy units will not all be stacked together, and enemies will squeeze each other and bounce away, so that the overall visual effect will be better;<br>2. Some players responded that the backswing time for melee attacks was too long. Recently, when updating the game daily, they greatly shortened the backswing time for this melee attack;<br>3. I posted a forum post asking everyone what they thought of this game at present. Everyone said that my game's main interface is too concise and not good enough; so recently I found some art materials and tried to beautify the main interface as much as possible.<br>4. I consulted many forum people and asked everyone for their opinions on this game. Everyone said that mine is different from the traditional SHMUP game and more like a meat pigeon like the Vampire Survivor, which is simply referred to as Shmup Survival Like;<br>5. However, many people commented that this is not the same as traditional Shmup games at all; however, what I do is not a traditional Shmup game, but more like a game with a new gaming experience; from this perspective, maybe I prefer this kind of evaluation;<br>6. Recent statistics show that there are currently more than 130 BOSS types and types in the game; however, in order to make players more random when encountering BOSS in each game process, more BOSS types will continue to be added;<br>7. Recently, I completed a function that will randomly play BOSS related music when the BOSS appears. Although I use all free materials, with BOSS's special music, I feel that the overall atmosphere is still quite good;<br>8. Now I find that the Shmup/STG game I developed seems to be completely different from traditional games; many people in my posts said that enemy bullets can be shot out, which is different from traditional Shmup/STG games;<br>9. Now think about it, it is indeed the case. The game I developed seems to be more like a Hack and Slash Game, and the game experience is like a game with this kind of fun;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0722] ----</h2><br>Q: I need an item description interface. When I play the game, I don't know which item has what effect;<br>A: Okay, I will think about how to add an easy-to-understand item description.<br><br>This week's diary:<br>1. Hello everyone, this time we tried to use the logging method once a day;<br>2. Recently, I am filling content and approaching the release date, and I want to make the entire game's content process as rich as possible;<br>3. Recently, a new point-in-time triggering event has been developed, which can trigger events with high performance when a target is close to another target; I wonder if it can be used in any interesting design;<br>4. Recently, I learned from Vampire Survivors and wanted to make an off-site store. I felt that this off-site store would enhance the protagonist to a certain extent. Such a design would be very interesting; at the same time, it might also reduce the difficulty of SHMUP/STG games to a certain extent. This would allow more players to play STG games happily.<br>5. It seems that the development of off-site stores has been successfully completed, and now I am starting to have a headache about how to design off-site stores; if I want to reduce the overall game much, I think I should strengthen the off-site stores a little more; I am still thinking about it at the moment, let's see what level we can achieve by then.<br>6. Today, I posted posts on different forums asking everyone what they think of this STG game, and received varying degrees of feedback; now I have to think about how to apply this feedback to the game;<br>7. Today, I carried out some optimization research and development on the physics engine I wrote throughout the game. Perhaps because of today's optimization, a new bullet type can be added to the game;<br>8. So, this week's diary is the previous one, so we'll see you next week ~<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0714] ----</h2><br>Q: I think we can post Steam announcements on these update logs, so that I think it will have better publicity effects;<br>A: OK, I will issue an announcement starting this week, but it is too stressful for me to do multi-lingual localization in the announcement, so I only do multi-lingual processing in Chinese and English on the announcement;<br>A: In fact, the content in the announcement is actually the content of this week's diary below;<br><br>This week's diary:<br>1. Hello everyone, welcome to this week's development diary;<br>2. Hesitation is approaching the release of the game soon, and recently a large amount of content has been enriched in the game; including adding more types of BOSS and completing the production of more background images;<br>3. At the same time, hesitation has begun to enter the final part of the game, and has also begun to think about making some Steam achievements; hoping to provide players with a better game experience assistance in terms of achievements;<br>4. Also, there were some minor problems with the Demo released on July 6, and now the Demo has also been updated to a new version;<br>5. Next, we will continue to improve the content of the game, hoping to provide a game that is as fun as possible for players who like SHMUP/STG on September 25;<br>6. So, we will see you again next week in our blog update. I hope there will be more good research and development in the next week to make the game as interesting as possible;<br>7. See you next week, bye ~<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0706] ----</h2><br>Q: Is the historical information of the game development log written here too long?<br>A: Okay, I deleted some historical information that was too long;<br><br>This week's diary:<br>1. Hello everyone, although it's not yet Sunday, the demo version has been updated in advance!<br>2. Next, the next update to the demo version should be on August 4th, so stay tuned!<br>3. This update adds a lot of new things, including new bullet types, new background scenery, and various beautiful flowers and plants;<br>4. At the same time, because someone previously said that they wanted full-screen mode functions, these are now all added;<br>5. Moreover, a new &quot;high-performance mode&quot; has been added. In this mode, players will have a better feeling of operating the character;<br>6. In terms of difficulty, players will be given enough time at the beginning of the game to familiarize themselves with the operations;<br>7. In short, compared with the previous version, this new version should have many obvious differences. I hope everyone can have fun.<br>8. So, regarding the new content being developed recently, let's talk about it in next week's update log;<br>9. See you next week, bye ~<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0630] ----</h2><br>Q: Have you been playing Palworld recently?<br>A: ... yes, because she updated the new version, I like this game very much. I have been playing it for three consecutive days;<br><br>Q: Will playing Palworld affect the development progress of your game?<br>A: ... Yes, but I really like playing it. I used to like POKEMON players very much. As soon as the magical beast Paru came out, I became addicted. I think that only by playing well and having fun can I have more energy to develop this game.<br><br>This week's diary:<br>1. Hello everyone, it's Sunday again. This week, I was eaten up by Palworld for three days of development time;<br>2. However, I did some tests, which proved that the performance optimization of the games I have developed currently satisfies me;<br>3. I tested it and let Palworld run in the background, then ran my game in Unity. At the same time, I also opened recording software and video playback;<br>4. In this case, my game can run at 100-140 frame rates. When I don't turn on the recording software, my game frame rate can reach 190 frame rates, which is only 10 frame rates lower than normal games;<br>5. This test result made me very happy. I never knew how to determine the minimum configuration required for this game; as everyone knows, Palworld is very popular with configurations. I put it in the background of the computer to run it, but the result actually did not have a big impact on my game running frame rate, so I am very satisfied.<br>6. Next, there is news about the new demo version on July 7;<br>7. At present, it is initially confirmed that there will be a new demo update on July 7, and new content will be updated then. Please look forward to it ~<br>8. So, that's all for this week's diary. We'll see you next week in the development diary. I hope I can have fun next week and start game development as soon as possible.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0623] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. Hello everyone, it's Sunday again;<br>2. The development this week is still relatively smooth. If nothing goes wrong, we should be able to update the latest trial version in July;<br>3. If nothing goes wrong, it should be updated on July 6 or July 7;<br>4. This week, the performance of the game has been greatly optimized. Starting from the next demo version, the operating feel of the entire game will be better;<br>5. Recently, during testing recently, some players responded that the difficulty may be a bit difficult; so the next update will be optimized in the direction of continuing to reduce the difficulty; but there is currently no more ideal approach;<br>6. Therefore, I hope that in the next week, further research and development can be completed, making the entire game process more suitable for novice STG players;<br>7. So, that's all for this week's update log. We'll see you next time ~<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0616] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. Hello everyone, welcome to this week's development diary;<br>2. The development progress this week was relatively smooth, and it would be great if the next week could go so smoothly; but at present, the trial version 0.15 should be completed smoothly in July;<br>3. Recently, there was a problem that was very confusing. I didn't know what label the type of game I developed should be. Everyone here calls it STG games, or barrage shooting games. Someone told me that on Steam, everyone calls it Shmup type games; I have tagged both STG and Shmup, and it would be nice if someone could read this blog and send me an email to teach me;<br>4. At present, the content of the trial version in July has been completed ahead of schedule, and the next work will continue to adjust and optimize the content of the game. If everything goes well, everyone can play the next trial version in July;<br>5. So, that's all for this week's update log. We'll see you next week;<br>6. There is a digression. Isn't Palworld going to have a new version on June 27? I may go and play it for a while then, hoping that it will not delay my development progress of this game;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0609] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. This week, the demo version of 0.14 was successfully updated; this demo version is a great improvement compared to the previous version, at least at the beginning, it is a playable game;<br>2. By now, you should have seen on the store page that I have adjusted the release date of the game to September 25, 2024; this is the most recent plan, and I hope to complete the minimum level of research and development before August, so that I can Release the game in September;<br>3. This means that I need to complete the last part of the game within two months. I hope I can complete my plan smoothly.<br>4. However, in July, I plan to continue to launch the next phase of the demo version; for this reason, the overall development plan is relatively tight;<br>5. Moreover, one thing recently may greatly affect my development plan; that is,&quot;Wukong&quot; will be released soon. If it is released in August, I may spend a lot of time understanding and playing this game; this will have a lot of impact on my development plan;<br>6. In short, I will try my best to ensure the progress and quality of my game development, hoping to complete a better game;<br>7. So, that's all for this week's update log, and we'll see you next week's log;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0603] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. I'm sorry for the late update of my blog this week!<br>2. I have been focusing on preparing for the next demo update this week;<br>3. There is less than a week left until June 9. If the development goes smoothly this week, the next demo version will be updated between June 7 and June 9;<br>4. At that time, the updates involved in the new demo version will be recorded in the &quot;Update Notes&quot; above;<br>5. Then, there is the next update plan. After June 10, the next stage of update research and development will be entered. At that time, it is hoped that a further trial version will be updated within July;<br>6. Regarding the research and development content involved in the new content, let's see if there can be any progress next week, and let's talk about it then;<br>7. So, we'll see you next week in the journal ~<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0526] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. Recently this week, I have been developing the content of the game;<br>2. It's almost June, and the current goal is to complete the new demo update before June 9;<br>3. Recently, there has been relatively simple content research and development, so there is not much to say this week.<br>4. However, after some thinking this week, I still feel that I want to make a simpler and relaxed barrage shooting game;<br>5. So, this week's diary is almost like this. I hope next week's diary can provide a better progress and report on the development progress of the demo version;<br>6. So, we'll see you next week ~<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0519] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. Regarding the development progress this week, the development this week was relatively smooth; due to the increased game content in the version under development, the ten-minute experience mode of the demo version may no longer be able to play the entire game process;<br>2. The new demo version will be updated after the latest version is developed;<br>3. I recently reviewed the current game process. The current game content is not rich enough. The next updates should continue to enrich the current game process; increase the types of enemies and the number of bullets dropped; the ultimate goal is to make the entire game process more relaxed and decompressed when playing;<br>4. In short, I ultimately plan to make this game a SHMUP game that anyone can easily play; and it would be better to have a lower difficulty;<br>5. So, this week's diary is pretty much like this. Let's see you next week ~<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0513] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. I'm sorry for the late update of my blog this week!<br>2. So, let's talk about the recent game development situation immediately;<br>3. Recently, the main process of the game is still being developed; the newly developed system has been initially finalized, which is aimed at a meat-like pigeon-like system like the Vampire Survivor;<br>4. However, it may take a week or two to confirm whether this system can finally be developed and implemented;<br>5. The ultimate goal of this meat pigeon system is to be able to pop up optional attributes, weapons and other improvement items like vampire survivors in a form that does not interrupt the flow; a design to improve one's own abilities;<br>6. The next two weeks were mainly about thinking and developing this new meat pigeon system;<br>7. So, this week's diary is almost like this. If the development of the new system goes smoothly, it will be updated to the demo version;<br>8. Some digression: Didn't the game Manor Lords just come out recently? Developers may spend some time studying this game recently, which may have a slight impact on the development progress of the game, but I believe the impact will not be too big; I won't be addicted like Palworld last time (wry smile);<br>9. So, we will see you again next week in the journal. I hope that this week's research and development will make a very smooth progress; especially the meat pigeon system that I spent a lot of time thinking about this time, I hope it will be developed smoothly; then we will see you next week ~<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0505] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. Hello everyone, it's Sunday, and I'm starting to write this week's update diary;<br>2. Now, the demo version has been updated to version 0.12! If nothing goes wrong, this version is the version that participates in the Steam &quot;Infinite Replay Games Festival&quot;;<br>3. Regarding the next update to the demo version, it should focus on the update of the game process, including new scenarios and enemies; specifically, waiting for the next research and development, if it goes smoothly, it should also be updated to the demo version simultaneously;<br>4. Recently, I have been thinking about how to make the game process more interesting, while ensuring that the game is relatively simple; I believe that it will not take much time to think about a better approach;<br>5. So, if this demo version 0.12 is fine, the developer will concentrate on the development of the next new version;<br>6. So, we'll see you next week! Looking forward to new research and development progress next week!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0428] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. Hello everyone, it's Sunday, and I'm starting to write this week's update diary;<br>2. First of all, the research and development of the next demo version is currently at an initial stage. If there are no mistakes, the demo version can be updated to the latest version around May 5;<br>3. At present, the relevant screenshots and promotional videos on the store page have been updated to the new version, and the content of these new screenshots will be in the next demo version;<br>4. Regarding the research and development of new functions, the main purpose for this game is to create a simple flying shooting game; every time a new function is conceived, I will think about whether it will make the game complicated; therefore, the new function is still being considered whether to join;<br>5. At present, this week's update log content is almost like this; the main purpose is to prepare for a healthy trial version in preparation for participating in Steam's &quot;Infinite Replay Games Festival&quot;;<br>6. So, we'll see you next week! I hope that the update of the demo version will be successfully completed next week; I also hope that the development of new features will be smooth!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0422] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. I'm sorry for this week's update log coming late!<br>2. This week, I was mainly thinking about how to make a STG game as simple as possible; since the prop module system was previously developed, I am now thinking about whether the integration of this part of the system is too complicated for STG games.<br>3. For this reason, there was not much progress in R &amp; D work this week;<br>4. I hope that in the next week, the research and development work can be successfully completed to a further stage;<br>5. I hope that the game can be completed to a new stage in early May;<br>6. So, we will see you next week and hope to have better research and development results next week!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0415] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. I'm sorry for this week's update log coming late! Let's talk about this week's research and development content immediately;<br>2. This week, I focused on studying the systems of Brotato and other survival-like games; looking for ways to incorporate interesting parts of them into my game.<br>3. To this end, this part of the content has been under development this week. Moreover, the research and development is relatively smooth!<br>4. I believe that these new system modules will be updated to the demo version soon. Please look forward to it!<br>5. In the next week, the research and development work on this part of the module will continue. If it goes smoothly, I believe it will be available in the demo version soon!<br>6. So, we'll see you next week!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0407] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. Online mode has been updated initially! Now, the online mode is still in the testing phase, so in the start interface hidden online mode button; the game interface lower right corner of the Varsion text, you can click this text to open the online interface; the current online mode is still in the testing phase, there may be many problems;<br>2. Next, we will continue to develop new content on the basis of slowly improving this online module;<br>3. As for the contents of the next development, they should be recorded in the journal next week.<br>4. In the next week, I hope to improve the game even more.<br>5. Well, we'll see you next week;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0330] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. This week, research and development for online is going smoothly; I believe that the demo version will be updated to the next version soon;<br>2. If it goes well, next week when the log is updated, it should be able to update the demo version smoothly.<br>3. However, because the current online mode is completely testing phase, when the time should be hidden processing; specific performance is, use the mouse to left-click the Varsion version number of the lower right button, will open the online room;<br>4. The following week, will have been focusing on online mode processing; hope that the next week can be developed smoothly;<br>5. See you next week in the diary.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0324] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. This week, I am busy with the research and development of online and optimizing game memory management.<br>two\u3002 Recently, during a test, it was found that there was a serious memory leak in the current trial version.<br>3. This memory leak problem will result in not even starting a game on a player's computer with low memory configuration.<br>4. So, recently, we have been optimizing this memory leak problem.<br>5. With regard to the online module, the research and development of the online module is relatively smooth at present. After the memory leak has been fixed, we will continue to develop the online module next week.<br>6. After the most preliminary online development is completed, the trial version may be updated for preliminary testing.<br>7. That's about all for this week. I'll see you next week.<br>8. As an aside, I recently found that RIMWORLD has been updated to version 1.5. it seems that I may delay the development of this game because I want to play this game; after all, it is too fun; I hope I will not be too addicted and delay the progress of the research and development of this game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0318] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. This week, I am busy with the research and development of online system.<br>two\u3002 Recently, I want to add an online system to this game.<br>3. At present, the research and development is relatively smooth, but when the online function is actually developed and used, there may be a lot of problems.<br>4. However, after thinking about it, the game still needs online function to be fun, so it has been developing an online system recently.<br>5. If all goes well, in the next trial version, we should be able to test the online function.<br>6. Well, I hope the online function can be developed smoothly in the coming week.<br>7. So, I'll see you next week.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0310] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. This week, we finally finished the initial stage of research and development of the prop system.<br>two\u3002 Now, it is found that all the R &amp; D content so far can be updated to the trial version.<br>3. Next, we will sort out the overall code architecture, and if all goes well, I believe we will soon be able to update the current trial version of the game to a new version.<br>4. After updating the trial version, you can experience the updates so far in the new version.<br>5. Then, I hope the next week's R &amp; D arrangement can be carried out smoothly.<br>6. So, I'll see you next week.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">---- [2024-0303] ----</h2><br>This week's diary:<br>1. This week, the research and development of the prop system is relatively smooth; I believe that the second version of the trial version may be completed soon.<br>two\u3002 Under the current research and development idea of the prop system, it may be dealt with according to the props used in the two games &quot;Knights of Valour&quot; and &quot;Metal Slug&quot;.<br>3. For this reason, the update of the demo version may be developed in this direction;<br>4. Next, let's see how far the prop system can be completed in the next week.<br>5. Hope to be able to combine it more interesting, so that the completion of this STG game will appear a little more diversified; let's look at the test results of the new trial version.<br>6. So, I'll see you next week.","developers":["Queen
