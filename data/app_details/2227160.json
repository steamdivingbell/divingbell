Why did the Demon King suddenly wage war? Why were humans utterly defeated? Were the murders during the war just coincidental? Why did the heroes who saved humanity die one after another? These secrets await your exploration.<br>The other storyline is set seven years after the war ended, featuring an ordinary town chef who meets a foreign witch and a detective.

Currently, there are eight main playable characters, each with over ten skills, ensuring strategic depth in turn-based combat. Each character has distinct abilities: a witch skilled in both physical and magical attacks, a chess master who disrupts enemies, a chef focused on healing, and an Onmyoji who strengthens defense and counterattacks. This maximizes diversity among characters while ensuring an impressive display in boss battles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Humanised design</h2>Considering that many players are more interested in the game's mystery and storyline, a story mode is integrated. This mode cancels all non-mandatory battles and automatically levels up characters before most forced battles, allowing players to progress easily while still enjoying the combat scenes. For those who want to experience combat but doubt their abilities, the game offers an &quot;Aurora&quot; (easy) difficulty, where all enemy attributes are reduced by 20%, making it manageable even for beginners. Additionally, cheat options are provided at the start, ensuring all players can thoroughly enjoy the game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2227160/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1713961182","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2227160/page.bg.jpg?t=1713961182","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2227160/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1713961182","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2227160/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1713961182","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2932310,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Benge reasoning</h2>Are you tired of the many works on the market that use the label &quot;mystery&quot; but only offer &quot;suspense&quot; and &quot;decryption&quot;?
