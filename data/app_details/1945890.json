Nice house, beautiful wife, stripes on his shoulder, all the free pizza he can eat \u2013 Rocco's got it made. But things at the top of the Family are changing, and after the rise, usually comes the fall. Will Rocco's past finally catch up with him? Is there any path left that doesn't lead to the Infernal fires of Hell? Or has he been trapped in the Inferno this whole time already? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRocco's Inferno is a top down, narrative role playing game which pays homage to the two greatest works of Italian literature - The Divine Comedy... and The Sopranos... You play as Rocco Dante, a captain in the Reggiani crime Family.
