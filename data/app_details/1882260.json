{"about_the_game":"A new evil is plaguing the city of Waterdeep, stalking the streets and preying on its citizens. Though initially thought to come from afar, this great evil, known only as Xanathar, instead resides within Waterdeep and, if not stopped, threatens to overwhelm the city. The Lords of Waterdeep believe that the evil lurks in the sewers below and have commissioned a party of adventurers to investigate and foil this nefarious plot. Granted full rights of marque and ownership of any treasure, artifacts or valuables you find on your quest, you must venture into the chasms, discover the nature of this evil and destroy it by any means necessary.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1882260/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1648566181","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1882260/page.bg.jpg?t=1648566181","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1882260/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1648566181","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1882260/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1648566181","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A new evil is plaguing the city of Waterdeep, stalking the streets and preying on its citizens.
