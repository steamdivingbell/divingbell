{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Current Phase: Pre-Alpha\u00a0</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The first game within the &quot;Stars And Empires&quot; storyline. This game offers a single-player adventure to start, evolving into a multi-player experience as the game becomes more developed. Challenges are on many maps around the solar system of an ever expanding new frontier in space. Its the goal of the Solarian Federation to keep pushing its borders and expand to new star systems building up infrastructure along the way. People are relying on you to work together with fellow colonists and get rid of the threats that prevent growth in these new areas. Work with other players, choose exclusive and unique commanders to play as in this 4x high action strategy game. Start by building up basic defense systems, collecting rare resources and prepare for massive waves of hostile action as enemies of these new worlds will stop at nothing to tear down your command center. Utilize different tactics, defense units and eventually player's abilities to provide protection, support, combat and more while navigating exotic terrains, distant moons and strange creatures around every turn. Once the game opens up into multi-player, you can provide strategy and coordinate with your team as every decision you make effects everyone on the battlefield. You will have to work together to push forward and colonize these new worlds. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The story starts you off on your own as a colonist working for the Solarian Federation to help establish logistics and manage construction in the outer reaches of the Federations territory. Many rouge factions are at war out here and the native wildlife can be vicious. It will take everything you have to make sure you solidify your claim on these new worlds and help push the boundaries of the Federations controlled region in space.</p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"The Beginning","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2829300/5f50a237343d38c46c1c49a6ae9d335084f2d2d1.jpg"},{"name":"First Discovery","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2829300/8dab5229e50a4930fa67d6da6e8b1896ddd0d7d1.jpg"},{"name":"The Butcher","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2829300/96b2cef9ed6f97f7d12967455527c4e31fd0a355.jpg"},{"name":"Shields Up!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2829300/29df15633942d9a318166ac818da3e9dd4ca6c45.jpg"},{"name":"Greedy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2829300/12f61a852046d180e6730f44b0819b5c72c0920d.jpg"},{"name":"Meteor Shower","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2829300/671ae40e6b0b576074a9d035e1e07806d9b771ce.jpg"}],"total":6},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2829300/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728359218","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2829300/page.bg.jpg?t=1728359218","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2829300/2343b418b6a83de818a138ee516638709bd39a60/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728359218","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2829300/2343b418b6a83de818a138ee516638709bd39a60/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728359218","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"May contain crude humor, language or acts of violence."},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Current Phase: Pre-Alpha\u00a0</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The first game within the &quot;Stars And Empires&quot; storyline.
