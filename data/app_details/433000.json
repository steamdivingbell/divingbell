The artwork is very detailed and the colors are splendid. Not to mention that the quality of the graphics is top-notch, all of the scenes are sharp and clear down to the smallest pixels! Moreover, the cutscenes and the animations are amazingly done - the cutscenes look absolutely epic with all of the spectacular visual effects and the character's animations have never been more realistic. As for the audio, the soundtracks are unobtrusive and the voice-overs are excellent - so kudos to the audio team as well!\u201d<br>4.5/5 \u2013 All About Casual
