So if there are depictions of any of these topics it will be minimal and as non-explicit as possible.\r\nThere will be dialogs, or pieces of text, discussing these topics in search of a way to heal. \r\n\r\nBut it is critical to be able to express that they exists and express the emotions and feelings of the characters as they go through the healing process. How the character experiences emotionally and its drama is the most important part, not the source of it itself.\r\nThese emotional expressions could be very intense and crude. Mentioning topics like self-harm, self-deprecation, and abuse. These mentions will be minimal and toned down to the bare minimum necessary to convey the situation in order to establish a baseline from which move out of it.\r\n"},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Notice:</h2><strong><br>This game is very early in the development.
