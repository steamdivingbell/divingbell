{"about_the_game":"Disclaimer: This game is intended to be an extension of the learning achieved in WHMIS 2015 and is in no way meant to replace the learning required for certification. The intent behind the design of this game is to help individuals apply their learning to develop stronger conceptual understanding of referencing an SDS sheet in the workplace. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game allows players to deepen their understanding of WHMIS 2015, in alignment with the Globally Harmonized System, by taking the time to apply their learning. Players will learn to read through Safety Data Sheets to properly sort and organize products given to them by their robot helper named Glitch. However, Glitch is very clumsy and does not follow safe practices. The player will need to manage eye and body contaminations from spills when Glitch has accidents and put out fires started by Glitch\u2019s mechanics by learning how to use a fire extinguisher. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game has three different working environments: the laboratory, warehouse, and construction site. Each of these environments offers a different array of products to practice storing. The gameplay length can be modified from 5 to 30 minutes to ensure students can use this in an educational setting or it can be utilized for corporate training. The game includes tutorials to help the player learn all of the functions of the game and the required WHMIS training to complete the game. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nVirtual Reality training has been proven to help build real-life skills and prepare workers for the types of situations they may encounter in their workplaces. WHMIS 2015 VR allows players to prepare themselves to safely handle products in their workplace and broaden their understanding of WHMIS 2015 courses. This game is a great addition to the 1 hour WHMIS 2015 course.
