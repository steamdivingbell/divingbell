{"about_the_game":"You have to climb to the top using hooks. <br />\r\nUse the keyboard to move, and the mouse to control your hands and hooks (or gamepad if you are not in enough pain). <br />\r\nOnly the most persistent will make it to the top.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Prepare to fall down.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Practice and over time you will be able to overcome those obstacles that at first seemed impassable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Don't give up, because only the persistent can overcome difficulties.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Legs...

This game is inspired by &quot;Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy&quot; and &quot;A Difficult Game About Climbing&quot;. The game was first person at first, but it didn't feel unique. After playing &quot;Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy&quot; and &quot;A Difficult Game About Climbing&quot; I thought this style of game would be better, and I wasn't wrong.
