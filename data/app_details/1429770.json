{"about_the_game":"In Offside Legends, it's heroes vs. heroes in a fast-paced game of football (soccer). Take to the field with King Arthur, Count Dracula, Sherlock Holmes and Prince Hamlet. Hurtle across the ruins of Camelot or Wonderland's tricky chessboard. Pass, shoot and score! \u2014 Unless the swarms of bats distract you, or the lightning. Was that a flamingo? Keep the ball moving, and pick just the right moment for your magical skills. Deal brutal knockouts and take perfectly-timed shots. Offside Legends is nonstop action!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInclement weather, moving platforms, falling chandeliers and power-ups across multiple arenas will keep you on your toes for every match. And if you want to take a break from the chaos and mayhem, you can switch off the dynamic effects and play standard football just like they did back in 19th-century England! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOffside Legends features deep but natural gameplay mechanics. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you're a cunning strategist or just want to dive in without a plan \u2014 you're sure to have fun either way. Pick a team, pick an arena, skip the cinematic and you're in the action!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1429770/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1601310076","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1429770/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1601310076","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1429770/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1601310076","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1429770/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1601310076","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"In Offside Legends, it's heroes vs. heroes in a fast-paced game of football (soccer).
