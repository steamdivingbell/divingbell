{"about_the_game":"Starcross Arena gives new and seasoned pilots alike a shot at being the one crowned in glory at the end of the match. It\u2019s a whimsical approach to some classic themes, and a simplified approach to others. The controls can be learned very quickly, and its non-violent tone makes it something players of all ages can enjoy. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers compete for the highest score in a 3D arena flying customizable spacecraft with a unique pulsed propulsion. Snag tokens for points, and popup items for their effects while you attempt to cross out other players with your trail for more points. Avoid collisions as each &quot;cross out&quot; incurs a score penalty. Only the highest score can win.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Welcome to Starcross Arena","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/945870/b7a5ccf09a604a77a1a3f506a7f15c400dc75de8.jpg"},{"name":"On the Champion's Trail","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/945870/e1df14e4344dd0ffd63644cfe73e1f5b1ceb4eae.jpg"}],"total":2},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/945870/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1581976778","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/945870/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1581976778","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/945870/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1581976778","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/945870/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1581976778","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Starcross Arena gives new and seasoned pilots alike a shot at being the one crowned in glory at the end of the match.
