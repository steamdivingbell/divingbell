{"about_the_game":"\u25a0Gothic Castle Music DLC<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis collection includes a variety of Castlevania inspired music to fill your games with catchy yet haunting gothic melodies. It features a total of 15 different tracks to cover the many different areas of your games.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u25a0Various music themes for different situations<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach music track is between 1 and 2 minutes, with more than 20 minutes of unique music for your games.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nContents<br />\r\n01. Swirling Darkness. A prelude for an impending calamity. Also a good menu/game over theme. <br />\r\n02. Unwritten Epitaph. An introduction theme, perfect for inserting passwords and character names.<br />\r\n03. Ascension. Song created with a platformer in mind. Ideal to reach undreamed heights in your citadel of madness.<br />\r\n04. Indigo Nocturnal Leaves. Inspired by Curse of Darkness, this song reminisces of a misty night forest and will o wisps. <br />\r\n05. Satyr Dance: Tangling, melodic, pagan and catchy, with a final touch of concealed evil.<br />\r\n06. March of the Dragon Prince. A song which could perhaps work as a final area with great things at stake.<br />\r\n07. Night Vanquisher. Song for cinematic scenes, game trailers and more.<br />\r\n08. Ascoltare. A quiet respite in the haunted castle. One filled with books and items to sell. A safe room, perchance. <br />\r\n09. Blood Prince Toccata. If you want to introduce a mini-boss, this is your song. <br />\r\n10. May I have this Dance. Waltzing vampires dream with such a song. Join them.<br />\r\n11. Powers of Darkness. A song to summon a true festival of servants into your lair. <br />\r\n12. Archetype of Futility. Sad, melancholic and resigned. A thousand broken hearts screaming in a single melody. <br />\r\n13. Ars Magistra. An alternative, more dynamic version of 08.Ascoltare. A holy song for vanquishing your foes. <br />\r\n14. Moonlit Flight. The right song for an elegant warrior, dancing through the night. <br />\r\n15. Tenebris Animam. A most formidable foe, it's motifs match those of 07. Night Vanquisher, so that that dreamed confrontation can finally occur.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n--------------<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u30fbThis pack is for use in RPG Maker Series or the engine of your choice.<br />\r\n\u30fbOK to be used in Commercial projects made in RPG Maker<br />\r\n\u30fbYou may modify some of the assets (but not redistribute them) for your own game use only.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2945600/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1715217199","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2945600/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1715217199","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2945600/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1715217199","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2945600/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1715217199","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"\u25a0Gothic Castle Music DLC<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis collection includes a variety of Castlevania inspired music to fill your games with catchy yet haunting gothic melodies.
