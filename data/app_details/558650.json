{"about_the_game":"Star Kingdom is an astrology discovery virtual reality experience about yourself and how the planets play a big part in your life based on birthdays. Enter your birthday and see where the planets align and discover what they tell you about how you interact with the world. Learn how each element, Earth, Water, Air and Fire affect your daily life after you have succeeded in defeating the dark forces that hinder empowerment.  <br />\r\n <br />\r\nThis is a virtual meditation of self-exploration in the Temple of the Stars.  Dark skulls representing life's dark forces have absorbed the light energy that keeps your power from manifesting in the realm of the living.  Reactivate each of your planets and learn how the zodiac constellations color your daily life and personality.  Remove the fog of darkness that surrounds the temple to learn the secrets within.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/558650/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1585850374","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/558650/page.bg.jpg?t=1585850374","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/558650/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1585850374","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/558650/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1585850374","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Star Kingdom is an astrology discovery virtual reality experience about yourself and how the planets play a big part in your life based on birthdays.
