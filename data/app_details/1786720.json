It takes inspiration from Valve's games, with its use of environmental story telling and pacing between enemy encounters, striking a balance between combat and atmosphere. Think the atmosphere of a slow-burn horror game fused with movement and combat options of a modern shooter...<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1786720/extras/features.png?t=1719119598\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1786720/extras/ColliderGif.gif?t=1719119598\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1786720/extras/Dot_points.png?t=1719119598\" /> For those who want instant action, enter the horde mode and take on waves on enemies using your abilities to turn the tables on your tormentors! <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1786720/extras/Dot_points.png?t=1719119598\" /> Use time dilation to outmanoeuvre enemies and dodge projectiles- including bullets! Time dilation also allows for altered movement, dashing multi-directionally to evade enemies and dodge projectiles, and a double jump to reach places not achievable otherwise.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1786720/extras/Dot_points.png?t=1719119598\" /> Projectile based ballistics system.

Blow your enemies apart with a robust blood and gore system. Feel the impact of each distinct weapon, or just shoot an explosive barrel and watch the bloody show!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1786720/extras/Dot_points.png?t=1719119598\" /> Cunning, reactive A.I - The soldiers in Entropic Decay don't mess around. They react to grenades, can hear you, take cover, flee, and throw their own grenades. The mutated work in packs, can hear you running and will roam the area you were last seen. The military will shoot the mutated on sight, but taking them down is no easy task, even for the well trained.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1786720/extras/Dot_points.png?t=1719119598\" /> A variety of mutated to fight against - Currently there are over ten different mutated to contend with. Ranging from agile spider mutants and dogs, to hulking tanks weilding lead pipes.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1786720/extras/Dot_points.png?t=1719119598\" /> Puzzles to break up combat sequences - Puzzles and narrative pieces are used to keep the player engaged to avoid simply being one type of genre and keep things fresh and dynamic.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1786720/extras/Dot_points.png?t=1719119598\" /> Physics interaction - Interact with the world with physics puzzles, and deceive enemies by throwing objects or craft a devious trap by arranging explosives in your environment to detonate on an unsuspecting foe.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1786720/extras/Dot_points.png?t=1719119598\" /> Stealth, A.I and how they interact -  Distract your foes by throwing an object or bring them closer to setup an ambush with a whistle, or simply sneak by and avoid combat all together. Use your wits and the environment and the A.I will respond allowing emergent gameplay and tactical options.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1786720/extras/Dot_points.png?t=1719119598\" /> Narrative driven gameplay - The story will be told through the environment with the player merely an observer of things outside it's control.

The signal is tracked, and the crash site investigated on impact. A mineral is found. Astrobioligist's are amazed to find a living pathogen inside the mineral. The pathogen is extracted and experimented on, and the findings indicate aggressive cell growth when in contact with other organisms....dead or alive. Rapid cell mutation causes a rabies like disease. Anything infected with the pathogen becomes a hive-minded aggressor to everything not infected. The pathogen spreads and envelopes the world. Civilisation becomes an overgrown, decaying husk of the nature we once knew. The decay and despair is juxtaposed with beauty, as plant life flourishes due to the pathogens effect on cell growth, and everything man-made returns to nature, but rises again with a twisted skew. The last bastion of humanity are elitist's, deploying the military to kill anyone on sight who aren't in uniform. Military death squads roam in packs, taking orders for food and protection from the pathogen, while trading their humanity. <br><br>You awaken in a facility, fumbling for hazy memories of before the place you find yourself in.... Journey through a world foreign to all but the mutated, and find a place free from decay and entropy at any cost...<br><br>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1786720/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1719119598","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1786720/page.bg.jpg?t=1719119598","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1786720/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1719119598","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1786720/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1719119598","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence or Gore, General Mature Content, and some non sexual nudity."},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":1891800,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1786720/extras/WishList_Now_New.png?t=1719119598\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1786720/extras/WishList_gif.gif?t=1719119598\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1786720/extras/WhatIsEntropicDecay_New.png?t=1719119598\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1786720/extras/Combat_Gif_1.gif?t=1719119598\" /><br><br><br><br><strong>\u201cThe definition of entropic is having a tendency to change from a state of order..to a state of disorder...&quot;</strong><br><br>Entropic Decay is a fast paced, but slow burn horror/action FPS inspired by games from the late 90's through early 2000's, driven by narrative, puzzles, combat arenas, and horror sequences.
