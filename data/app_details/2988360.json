{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The overall aesthetic of IsoMetro\u2122 is a nod to city builder games from decades ago. Building on the base mechanics introduced by those original pioneers, IsoMetro\u2122 leverages the vastly superior processing capabilities of today's &quot;low end&quot; hardware, to power a surprisingly nuanced and authentic economic simulation. Despite the nostalgic 90's visual aesthetic, it's not as simple as &quot;big city, big buildings&quot; -- economic effects are specific to every individual tile, encouraging you to think carefully about transit options and zoning policy if you want to see dense, vibrant city centers take shape.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Playing as the government, you can use your treasury funds to build public infrastructure such as utility facilities, transit networks, and civic service buildings. Meanwhile, buildings such as houses, shops, and factories will only be built in residential, commercial, and industrial zones respectively by the citizens themselves if you've met all their requirements. If your citizens can't get where they need to go, face utility shortages, are exposed to unacceptable levels of pollution, or are under-served in other ways, your infrastructure investments will go to waste. Meanwhile, a well-planned city will see healthy economic growth, and develop a positive cash flow from its tax base that can be used to invest in further expansion.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">While building cities in IsoMetro\u2122 is intended to be a comfortable, low-stress experience, the simulation also invites you to consider how the simplified concepts in the game world apply to the world we live in. Experiment with different transit options and zoning strategies to determine which approaches work better than others. Are roads and parking lots the way to go? Can you get away with not building even a single tile of road at all? Is a dense city core more profitable or is it better to have a metro area that sprawls far and wide?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">IsoMetro\u2122 brings you a balanced experience -- it can be thought-provoking if you choose to look closely at how your city works, but is also meant to be a satisfying and relaxing experience if you just want to watch your city evolve while you zone out to the varied music styles comprising the high-quality, 90-minute soundtrack.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2988360/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735264095","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2988360/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1735264095","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2988360/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735264095","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2988360/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735264095","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The overall aesthetic of IsoMetro\u2122 is a nod to city builder games from decades ago.
