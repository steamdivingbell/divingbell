{"about_the_game":"<i><u>Screenshots come from the early version of the game and might change later.</u></i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Welcome to The Station</h2><br>As a new employee of the Station Unknown - you'll have to learn and adapt to the new challenges of the night shift. You're on your own, manage to meet expectations of the clients by fulfilling your night shift tasks and serving customers. At the same time you'll have to face the darkness surrounding the station. Meet the dangers coming to take your life. There's more to it than meets the eye - stay alert and look for the clues that will help you escape this nightmare.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2><br>Survival-horror meets management simulator. Your change is beginning - your main task? To make the customer happy. (Optionally, you can also try to survive.) Customers may want to purchase something from the store, so you need to make sure the products are in their place - after all, you wouldn't want someone to rob you while you're searching the warehouse, would you? You will have to serve many customers at once, while trying to survive because some corners of the station hide beasts from beyond this world. Will you be up to the task of maintaining the station while fighting for your life?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Regular Customers</h2><br>Meet our regular customers - learn more about them, trust them, or remain suspicious. Learn their stories and use their knowledge to survive the night. Are you sure they are what they seem? Follow their lead or refuse their help and face the consequences of your choice. It's up to you whether our regulars become your friends or enemies.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Accessibility</h2><br>Our game is for everyone - whether you're a horror fan or just enjoy scary stories. We're proud to announce that we'll be adding an option to turn off jump scares if they scare you too much. Other than that, the difficulty level is highly customizable with options to reduce or increase the number of customers and turn on the option for the products to resupply themselves for you. We highly recommend leaving the difficulty level at default, but the choice is yours.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiple Endings</h2><br>Experience multiple endings and unlock the true ending. Each ending will teach you more about the mysterious Abomination. Experience one ending or search for the truth and see all possible outcomes of this story. There are six endings - only one of which reveals the truth about what happened at Station Unknown.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2550470/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735413160","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2550470/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1735413160","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2550470/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735413160","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2550470/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735413160","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Game contains violent scenes, jumpscares, illigal activities and disturbing themes."},"detailed_description":"<i><u>Screenshots come from the early version of the game and might change later.</u></i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Welcome to The Station</h2><br>As a new employee of the Station Unknown - you'll have to learn and adapt to the new challenges of the night shift.
