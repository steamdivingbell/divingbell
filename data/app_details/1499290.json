{"about_the_game":"An online multiplayer co-op escape room experience. In this demo, you and your friends will go trick or treating to the haunted mansion in the neighborhood.  Bring your wits and skills in order to survive the horrors ahead of you. Need to unlock a door? Find a key! Zombie horde attacking you? Find a gun! Locked in a pitch black dungeon? Find a way out! Demo includes a tutorial escape room to learn the game mechanics and a ~45-60 minute Halloween escape room experience. Full release of the game continues the story from this demo with more escape rooms and additional content releasing monthly. Try not to release all the Zombies into the world in this demo, okay? Full release will include an escape room building system in which you can build your own escape rooms for the world to play. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nJoin the community and lets have some fun!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDemo Features:<br />\r\n - Multiplayer Online Co-op<br />\r\n - Single Player<br />\r\n - First Person<br />\r\n - Training Escape Room<br />\r\n - Trick or Treat Escape Room<br />\r\n - Controller Support<br />\r\n - Mouse / Keyboard Support<br />\r\n - Windows Support<br />\r\n - English Only<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFull Release Features :  <br />\r\n - Escape Room Building System (Build your own escape room for others to download and play) <br />\r\n - Multi-language support (localization)<br />\r\n - 8 escape rooms with more releasing monthly","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Tutorial Challenge Complete!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1499290/405bc5779dca9c02de6cf96dc4e4053bc51aaf83.jpg"},{"name":"Trick or Treat Complete!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1499290/950e20bfc2904ec642547400659f58fa1b8be24d.jpg"}],"total":2},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1499290/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1633478309","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1499290/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1633478309","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1499290/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1633478309","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1499290/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1633478309","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Contains mild violence such as Skeletons, Zombies, Ghouls, and shooting.
