Yet, as the ship's resourceful engineer, you utilize scientific drones on board, repurposing them as resource gatherers to mine and salvage the materials surrounding you in the vastness of space. These adaptable drones are also capable of being recoded to undertake crucial tasks, such as repairing weapons, maintaining life support, and upgrading communications.

Your survival hinges on your ingenuity to outmaneuver the ominous cult of VUGSHERYOG and the unspeakable horrors trailing in its wake. The game charts a harrowing tale of a plunge into madness as you grapple with maintaining your sanity in the face of these alien horrors.
