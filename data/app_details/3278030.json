{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>NOTE: Demo players can only host the Graveyard map, but they can join any session.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In this dystopian nightmare, soldiers track the Anomaly\u2014a shape-shifting enigma that clones itself, warps reality, and mimics human speech. Communicate with your squad, queue up for online missions, but remember: it\u2019s not just a hunt; it\u2019s a frantic race against time.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Soldiers:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Soldiers are hunters. They were forged with steel for one purpose: To hunt down anomalies. They hold powerful guns inside their bodies, that have insane force to penetrate anything that comes alone their way. The extra weight makes them slower and unable to jump, but the powerful gunshots can easily be heard, and can smash through objects like butter. They cannot be harmed, and only the time limit before the Anomaly escapes can stop them. They can use voice chat to speak to each other, if they are close by.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Anomaly:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Their origins are unknown. Motives unknown. Anomalies can change shape, preferring smaller objects compared to bigger. It can mimic human voice. It can create false objects, that when shot, will create a giant puff of smoke allowing for easier movement. It has the ability to spit, which will temporarily blind a solder for a couple of seconds when hit. It's spit shot can also impact objects, and the bigger the Anomaly's form, the bigger the force it has. But the smaller it is, the faster it becomes. Easy to learn the basics, but has a lot of depth to master.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Online play:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Missions are started with a simple press of a couple of buttons, use the &quot;Join Server&quot;  browser to discover missions to join or set them up yourself with &quot;Host Game.&quot; Choose what map and player session limits you will have. Will you infiltrate a haunted graveyard or explore a derelict spaceship?  10 missions to choose from, each with their own quirks to set them apart. Play by yourself when joining a session or have your friends join your session from it's session ID. Online play is designed to not show certain info, allowing no advantage to any player outside pure gameplay skill and manipulation. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Physics:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Every map has most objects being able to be manipulated by soldiers and the anomaly, making it either easier or harder to win depending on who plays the smartest with what is provided. Change the shape of a map to make each one more dynamic than the last.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3278030/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728681551","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3278030/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1728681551","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3278030/d083271fac5bbb6ffbfd0287ce0e0207fae7c22b/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728681551","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3278030/d083271fac5bbb6ffbfd0287ce0e0207fae7c22b/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728681551","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>NOTE: Demo players can only host the Graveyard map, but they can join any session.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In this dystopian nightmare, soldiers track the Anomaly\u2014a shape-shifting enigma that clones itself, warps reality, and mimics human speech.
