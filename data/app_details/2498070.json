I mean, they're monsters from Saturn, of course of they are going to be sexual? Basically, Adult Only sexual content that actually is fairly rare throughout the story. It merely encompasses about 3% of the entirety of the game's content. Worst offenders? A notebook doodle porn scene that isn't even animated, (boss battle) and a final boss that is a demon made of smaller demons that are humping during transitions? Yeah, big deal, right? No, it really isn't. IF it weren't for SEX, you would NOT exist so, get over it.
