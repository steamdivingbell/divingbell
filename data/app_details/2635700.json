It\u2019s much harder when there are only a few hidden objects left (especially randomly). You can also use up to 3 save slots so you can replay without progress loss. Alternatively, you can reset your progress for the entire game if you\u2019d like to start over.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Perfect","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2635700/e70c7f217517e670480ba9432f98fef5a6c7d759.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Tasty Moon","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2635700/6c0766897908dc0cd3949df8a6247c6b2cd31f2b.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the The Meat Market","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2635700/d2e134aa197359eddb8f7a3aad2fca174ef5c4f4.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Messy Bunk Desk","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2635700/b36ce04c776f139ce2c7b4a36654326c1335ddb0.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Basement Furnace","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2635700/3a1591d328d2b439b2d298e717ab97118f338115.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Mountain Village","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2635700/1089a006138dcc3b63ed68fbf90a9f41afab78d6.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Emperor Meeting","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2635700/9fa7b25fb31f244ab6b73af628488ea3423b0edb.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Potion Making","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2635700/3939bc498679e5bd430c330194e66282959557eb.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Messy Cottage Sunrise","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2635700/7a75b980ae4d6331e83fee9c59bc1ce27a9b0a7c.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Summer Clothes Shopping","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2635700/c2bcdcb3b5cea6554d8bdbc10afa45adc36f1227.jpg"}],"total":16},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2635700/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714855867","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2635700/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1714855867","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2635700/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714855867","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2635700/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714855867","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Recommended for you</h1><p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>A hidden object game where you must find all the cats and wool to complete each level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2>\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f 15 Unique artworks<br><br>\u2753 1500+ Hidden objects total<br>\ud83d\udc08 750+ Cats<br>\ud83e\uddf6 750+ Wool<br> \ud83d\udca1 \u221e Unlimited hints if you get stuck<br>\u267b\ufe0f Restore a small number of hidden objects to a painting so you can find them again!<br>\ud83c\udfb5 Music for each artwork<br>\u2328\ufe0f Use your keyboard to move/zoom in if you have no scroll wheel<br>\ud83d\udcbe 3x save slots<br>\ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f Reset progress entirely and play again<br>\ud83d\udd52 Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Context:</h2>The brief was simple.
