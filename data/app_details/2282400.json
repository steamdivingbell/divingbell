{"about_the_game":"Run Hearth's Light Potion Shop, a cozy store for handcrafted brews. You will build up your potion making skills from a novice who creates simple remedies, to a respected expert, creating perfect potions to fit your customers' needs and desires. With deep potion making mechanics, there are always multiple ways to build up Hearth's Light and your reputation, and many ways to approach each individual potion order. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you boost the reputation of your Hearth's Light you will attract lucrative new specialty orders. Unlock more ingredients to help you along the way; there are more than 60 in the game to find. There are also many ways to improve and customize your shop with upgrades like gardens to grow your own ingredients, cold storage to keep your ingredients fresh, and training to find ingredients in the wild on your own.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPotion mechanics are best summarized as a mix of puzzle mechanics and card game mechanics. Hearth's Light borrows the complex relationships and synergies that make card games exciting to play, while giving them a solitaire-esque cozy spin. There are no recipes in Hearth's Light, there are innumerable ways to create any given potion, its up to your expertise with the ingredients and the tools you have at your disposal to complete your orders. Hearth's Light also shares those &quot;Aha!&quot; moments from the best puzzle games where you thought there was no way you could complete a potion but you end up just scraping by with the perfect order and combination of ingredients.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can build relationships with your customers, or make them angry, either path provides interesting interactions, unique dialogue, and can help you out on your journey in sometimes unexpected ways.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHearth's Light is a low pressure, cozy, casual game but still has the depth to keep all players interested.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you have any bugs please report them on the Bug Megathread on our Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthslight/<br />\r\nYou can also report bugs, or any other inquiries, by email at will@builds.games","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Getting Started","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2282400/310d3d5dbf071a577c3edeb59af2efad9ced264f.jpg"},{"name":"Journeyman","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2282400/310d3d5dbf071a577c3edeb59af2efad9ced264f.jpg"},{"name":"Professional","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2282400/310d3d5dbf071a577c3edeb59af2efad9ced264f.jpg"},{"name":"Maestro","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2282400/310d3d5dbf071a577c3edeb59af2efad9ced264f.jpg"},{"name":"Pretty Penny","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2282400/310d3d5dbf071a577c3edeb59af2efad9ced264f.jpg"},{"name":"Establishing Yourself","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2282400/310d3d5dbf071a577c3edeb59af2efad9ced264f.jpg"},{"name":"Entrepreneur","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2282400/310d3d5dbf071a577c3edeb59af2efad9ced264f.jpg"},{"name":"Monarch","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2282400/310d3d5dbf071a577c3edeb59af2efad9ced264f.jpg"},{"name":"Polyamorous","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2282400/310d3d5dbf071a577c3edeb59af2efad9ced264f.jpg"},{"name":"Village Idiot","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2282400/310d3d5dbf071a577c3edeb59af2efad9ced264f.jpg"}],"total":16},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2282400/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1681241124","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2282400/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1681241124","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2282400/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1681241124","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2282400/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1681241124","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Run Hearth's Light Potion Shop, a cozy store for handcrafted brews.
