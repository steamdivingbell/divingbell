The objects form a \u201ccontraption\u201d which are placed in such a way, which creates a chain reaction that will wipe out all monsters.

Some gadgets work on their own, while other gadgets must be connected together to function. For example in order for the conveyor belt to turn, it must be connected to an active engine, using a belt. Likewise in order for the laser gun to fire a laser, the trigger must be connected with a rope, to a moving object, like a car.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nObjectives<br />\r\nThere dozens of ways you can rid the levels of the monsters. It all depends on what objects are you presented with. The simplest way is if the monster is pushed off the edge of a platform and falls off the screen. Other ways include cutting a rope holding a heavy object, which will smash the monster; pulling a rope, connected to a laser gun; igniting the engine of a rocket with a lighter in which the monster is in, etc.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe solution is achieved through chain reactions, Rube Goldberg style. For example: in order to shoot the monster with a laser, you might have to connect a rope to the trigger, the other end to a rocket. You will need to ignite the engine of the rocket, which will pull the rope, which will trigger the laser gun, which will ultimately eliminate the monster. The more you progress through the game, the more complex the new puzzles become.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2478260/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1689923092","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2478260/page.bg.jpg?t=1689923092","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2478260/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1689923092","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2478260/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1689923092","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"How many steps does it take to change a light bulb?
