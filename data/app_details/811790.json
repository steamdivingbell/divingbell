{"about_the_game":"In this 1v1 hide and seek style game set in a warehouse that makes and distributes video game character prototypes, you play as either one of these Prototypes whose AI has been prematurely activated and must try to escape, or as a Security Guard who is trying to seek and destroy the Prototype before they escape so you don't get fired. As the Security Guard you are equipped with a flashlight to see and a night stick to destroy the Prototype. Be careful not to destroy too many Prototypes or you will be fired and lose the game. As the Prototype you can freeze and pose in order to try to blend in with the other Prototypes and hide in <i>Plain Sight</i>.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/811790/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1707178568","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/811790/page.bg.jpg?t=1707178568","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/811790/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1707178568","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/811790/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1707178568","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In this 1v1 hide and seek style game set in a warehouse that makes and distributes video game character prototypes, you play as either one of these Prototypes whose AI has been prematurely activated and must try to escape, or as a Security Guard who is trying to seek and destroy the Prototype before they escape so you don't get fired.
