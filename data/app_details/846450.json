{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A00: Crow's Rest Island</strong></h2><br><strong>A great introductory adventure to playing Savage Worlds!<br><br>A Savage Worlds compatible adventure for 4-6 Novice level characters (0-10 experience points).</strong><br><br><i>Shrouded in whispered rumors, Crow\u2019s Rest Island has been avoided as long as any can remember. Nothing but death, and the memories of those long gone, greet any who take to land upon the isle\u2019s shores. It is to this island that the PCs will find themselves driven as a storm threatens to drive their ship below the waves. Awaiting the PCs are far more than ghost stories upon this island, for there lives a very real threat, hiding here among the legends that keep sailors at bay.</i><br><br>A classic ghost story that casts the PCs not as adversaries to the specters, but rather as their benefactors, A0: Crow\u2019s Rest Island challenges the PCs with a tribe of foul kobolds, a haunted village, and the forgotten servant of a long departed ice devil. An excellent introduction to the Aventyr Campaign Setting, this adventure gives the PCs their first glimpse into Vikmordere culture. A00 may also be easily ported to any setting containing a northern wilderness near a large body of water.<br><br><i>Featuring:</i><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A0: Crow\u2019s Rest Island - Introduction to the A-Series Adventure Path!<br></li><li>Detailed maps by 3x ENnie Award winning Cartographer Todd Gamble.<br></li><li>Designed to lead into A01: Crypt of the Sun Lord.<br></li><li>Pre-generated characters complete with illustrations for fast play!</li></ul><br><i>Conversion by: </i><strong>Mark Sim</strong><br><br>Released on April 12, 2018.
