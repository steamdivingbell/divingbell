{"about_the_game":"Hasius was the son of Zeus and Danaeus, born a demigod on earth. Hades, the king of Hades, took advantage of the fact that humans no longer admired the gods of Olympus, and provoked Zeus's relationship with humans. Hades unleashed the North Sea Demon Kraken and defeated the gods and humans in one fell swoop. Hades ruled over humanity, and Hades, a demigod, set out to find a way to defeat Kraken in order to escape Hades' rule over the underworld.<br />\r\nRise of the Underworld is an open-world game created by Unreal Engine 5, the game uses the new Unreal 5 world partition to make open worlds, players can use the teleportation function to travel around the world without getting bored with the oversized map, you can choose to do quests in the world, you can also play in the world without any restrictions, you can talk to NPC, you can also pick up some items to craft weapons and do some handicrafts.<br />\r\nThe scene of the rise of the underworld is made in a realistic way, the 4K material map adds to the immersion, the production does not use visual occlusion to give you a more realistic world, and does not deliberately increase the fog effect and reduce your line of sight distance. In terms of combat system, bone-based hit feedback is used, which really makes you feel the blow. All monsters can be executed, ordinary monsters can also backstabbed, and the process of waiting for execution is added before being executed, which are all operations that can be experienced, not cutscenes.<br />\r\nRise of the Underworld has a day-night cycle in terms of the time system, and can also control time through meditation, and in terms of weather system, rain and snow are well represented, and they can also interact with the scene. The whole game strives to be perfect, but given that the game is a personal production, although it took several years, but in the end the energy and funds can not keep up, so the game still has a lot of shortcomings, I hope you can understand how difficult it is to develop a game independently.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2053890/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1667004639","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2053890/page.bg.jpg?t=1667004639","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2053890/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1667004639","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2053890/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1667004639","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Hasius was the son of Zeus and Danaeus, born a demigod on earth.
