Son to revered wolf hunters in Kansas, he watched his mother and father stalk, hunt, and gut the beasts in front of his infant eyes. With each prey brought to the slaughterhouse they called home, the red haze grew and clouded his mind with sanguine dreams. When he held his first small game in crimson hands under the silvery light of the full moon, wolves howled as if to celebrate his rite of passage, unaware of the unholy bloodthirst burning in his heart, and ignorant of the bloodshed he\u2019d bring upon them. <br><br>It was the wolves \u2013 not his father \u2013 who taught Frisk how to hunt. Envious of their savage nature and hunting prowess, Frisk wanted to prove his worth by taking down the alpha wolf with the Caldwell Pax his father gave him. Successful, he adorned himself with the alpha\u2019s skin, and his Caldwell with the fang ripped bloody from its maw and tried to stab his own father in the heart. He would become the mightiest predator in his territory.  <br><br>But in spite of besting the forest\u2019s alpha, he could not best his father, and so Frisk disappeared in the night, taking only his father\u2019s Caldwell and a Hunting Bow. His bloodlust led him to Louisiana, where he continued hunting, ignorant of the shadows tracking his every move; shadows Hunters in the Bayou would later come to know as Dire Wolf and Luna Wolf; shadows he had once called mother and father. Like a lone wolf, he listened to his instincts and left one pack for another, forgetting his human nature and his father\u2019s words: \u201cA wolf that leaves its pack becomes a threat.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1906330/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728562698","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1906330/page.bg.jpg?t=1728562698","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1906330/909a15cb56682e5259a440ad1c4f3817b2635083/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728562698","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1906330/909a15cb56682e5259a440ad1c4f3817b2635083/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728562698","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Remote Play on Tablet","id":42},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"This DLC contains one Hunter, two Weapons, and one Tool:<br><br>- Lonely Howl (Hunter)<br>- Ripper (Pax Claw)<br>- Stalker's Snarl (Hunting Bow)<br>- Rawhide (Dusters)<br><br><br><strong><u>Lonely Howl</u></strong><br><br>An insatiable bloodthirst possessed Leonel Frisk since he first caught its scent.
