{"about_the_game":"<i>Raise your CodeWalker. <br>Customize their skills. <br>Battle the world. </i><br><br><strong><i>...welcome to the world of CodeWalkers. </i></strong><br><br>In the not-so-distant future, humanity\u2019s reliance on technology has grown beyond what we could have imagined.

Those who do are known simply as Hackers. <br><br>Hackers rely on their virtual partners, sentient developmental AI known as CodeWalkers, to program changes in cyberspace. Over recent decades, these AI have branched into three main categories:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The pacifist and protection-focused <strong>Whitehats</strong>.<br></li><li>The aggressive and manipulative <strong>Blackhats</strong>. <br></li><li>The disciplined and balanced <strong>Redhats</strong>. </li></ul><br>Hackers work with their CodeWalkers to build their affinity toward the needed skills or abilities for their work and goals.

While research is still ongoing, what we do know is that they appear to be aggressive, corrupt CodeWalkers that multiply like the computer viruses of old. You can never turn your back on a Vagrant \u2013 it will be the last thing you do. <br><br>Now, Hackers and their CodeWalker partners are training worldwide to face this new threat.
