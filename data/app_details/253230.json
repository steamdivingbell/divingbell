Her adventure is halted when all her fuel, the Time Pieces, is lost and scattered across a nearby planet. Hat Kid must now jump, fight and stitch new hats to make her way into every nook and cranny of this new world in order to restore her fuel and resume her journey.

Hats can become even more powerful, by attaching badges that are found, sold and traded by the locals!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Community-funded, community-focused</h2>A Hat in Time was successfully funded on Kickstarter, reaching nearly 10 times its goal!
