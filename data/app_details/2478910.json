{"about_the_game":"Over &amp; Under is a difficult action 2D platformer where you have to stick to walls and jump around to go travel a long stretch of ground, only to reach the end, and stick to the underside. You are dropped into a seemingly linear world-- at least at first. You set out to travel as far as you can before you buckle under the difficulty. But time after time, you will hone your skills. The clock ticks ever upwards-- at least at first. Try and get achievements and try and storm your way through the obstacle course as quickly as you can. Every few levels brings a new mechanic, or as the player will see it, a new way to die! The streamlined and minimalistic art style allows for efficient gameplay and focus on the objective. As you come ever closer to the end, things just seem to get harder. What, or who, could possibly be waiting for you in the end? Once you've overcome your greatest hurdle yet, you will need to face new levels of challenge, and new modes to spice up new runs. See the old game in a new light, or dark, in Blinded, face your greatest enemy yet, time, in Timed, and in Floor is Lava, even the ground seems to be working against you. Will you prevail in this complex and challenging, but action-packed and easy to learn, 2D platformer?","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Casual","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2478910/12c3d8f0f17f8ce3ea6292294f18fe1a7440cf25.jpg"},{"name":"Harder, Worse, Slower, Weaker","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2478910/12c3d8f0f17f8ce3ea6292294f18fe1a7440cf25.jpg"},{"name":"Getting Over & Under It","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2478910/12c3d8f0f17f8ce3ea6292294f18fe1a7440cf25.jpg"},{"name":"Jumpscare!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2478910/9d79d253b351b79afcc7461a0be3abb7809ffb10.jpg"},{"name":"3rd Degree Burns","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2478910/a94cc8c53091f78baff0a948c9fb9dd439db15b0.jpg"},{"name":"THANK YOU!!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2478910/39f22389d8e3962b31dd614501caf099345ccdd1.jpg"},{"name":"Reverse Speedrunning","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2478910/d8fea92632113cd7799169a612b114df8de5339b.jpg"},{"name":"Getting Warmed Up","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2478910/a3338e22cc4a5c95f5be887e353a0803b2f4b688.jpg"},{"name":"Supersonic","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2478910/f793391899269eec6e58635094cb570a5eb61355.jpg"},{"name":"Lightspeed","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2478910/6de8b7c039d999c25988b9d6dff8ca2ebfad0cd9.jpg"}],"total":29},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2478910/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1689001253","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2478910/page.bg.jpg?t=1689001253","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2478910/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1689001253","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2478910/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1689001253","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Over &amp; Under is a difficult action 2D platformer where you have to stick to walls and jump around to go travel a long stretch of ground, only to reach the end, and stick to the underside.
