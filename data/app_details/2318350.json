{"about_the_game":"<strong>Inside SCP-167</strong> is a first-person psychological horror game that combines elements of investigation and puzzle-solving, aiming to resolve the strange occurrences related to SCP-167.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About SCP-167</h2>After years of research and experimentation, the SCP Foundation finally classified SCP-167, a cube containing an infinite labyrinth of cubic rooms, as &quot;safe&quot; \u2014 provided it is adequately mapped and marked by specialized teams. Shortly after its reclassification, the intricate rooms of SCP-167 began to be used as expansive storage by the Foundation, but things are not exactly what they seem...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Spreading Threat</h2>Recently, a series of disturbing events triggered a deeper investigation into the enigmatic SCP-167. Despite multiple investigations yielding no conclusive results, Alex, the most experienced agent of the SCP Foundation, was assigned to explore the site alone and collect crucial information to eradicate the growing threat that seems to somehow be taking over the place.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About the Game</h2>As a player, you have a single mission: to enter SCP-167, unravel the origin of the disturbances, and root out the evil. Alex, the main character, is one of the most competent and reliable agents of the SCP Foundation. Even though she is used to handling tasks that range from the simplest to the most complex, she could not imagine the horrors and challenges awaiting her in the Foundation's infinite storage.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What's Inside SCP-167?</h2>From stacks of boxes filled with the Foundation's obsolete equipment to secret labs dedicated to horrendous and disturbing research, SCP-167 is literally a cube of mysteries. When the SCP Foundation turned the place into a storage facility, a large amount of items was stored in its countless cubic rooms. This includes everything from materials and tools considered useless to lower-risk SCPs that can be stored with some degree of safety. Over time, this structure not only served its purpose as a storage facility but also transformed into a crucial research center for the Foundation. Which seems to be slowly falling apart.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2318350/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1704992780","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2318350/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1704992780","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2318350/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1704992780","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2318350/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1704992780","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"This game contains blood, violence and dismemberment."},"detailed_description":"<strong>Inside SCP-167</strong> is a first-person psychological horror game that combines elements of investigation and puzzle-solving, aiming to resolve the strange occurrences related to SCP-167.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About SCP-167</h2>After years of research and experimentation, the SCP Foundation finally classified SCP-167, a cube containing an infinite labyrinth of cubic rooms, as &quot;safe&quot; \u2014 provided it is adequately mapped and marked by specialized teams.
