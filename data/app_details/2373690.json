{"about_the_game":"Aerion is a fantasy casual adventure game set in a world destroyed by a meteorite. The player takes on the role of an alchemist who travels across flying islands in search of ingredients to enhance magic and save the world from collapsing. The gameplay combines elements of exploration and crafting as the player moves across the map and creates potions to help mythical creatures along the way. With randomly generated maps, players will experience a unique journey with each playthrough.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong></h2>You leave your settlement and head to the lonely islands in search of the Old Alchemist, who knows a way to restore magic and save your home island. You have to piece together the clues and signs that lead to the Old Man. Magical Creatures can help you, but due to the lack of magic, they can be annoyed, upset, frightened, or mad. If you can get along with them, they will help you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>CRAFT</strong></h2>After collecting the necessary ingredients, you can brew a potion according to the recipe in the book. You pour the base into the cauldron, then add the elements in the appropriate consistency and set fire to the wood. Wait a bit and the potion is ready. You can use it as intended.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2373690/extras/aerion-craft-to-gif.gif?t=1710190870\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>MAGICAL CREATURES</strong></h2>As you already know, there are four magical elements in the world.
