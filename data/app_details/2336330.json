Malevolent towerborne and cunning echobeasts execute deadly stratagems while always revealing their intent to the player. With good preparation and clever choices, players can carry the day. (The campaign also offers multiple difficulty modes!)<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2336330/extras/TowerSong-StoreDescription-03.png?t=1734659027\" /><br>Players access new skills, skill modifications, and crafting recipes as they progress the main quest. Loadouts can be easily changed between encounter attempts, and players can re-craft their equipment at campfires to suit their playstyle.

Each hero is equipped with unique battle mechanics, can explore otherwise unreachable areas of the world, and has a unique perspective on the main quest storyline. To succeed, players will also have to recruit deadly sniper Solace, magical swordsman Kiran and master of the elements Akeno. These Mana Knights will join forces to delve into the harrowing depths of the eldritch Towers and fight across the overgrown forests of Guhar and the desert expanse of Kidonia to liberate their allies from a terrible naga invasion.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2336330/extras/TowerSong-StoreDescription-05.png?t=1734659027\" /><br>Two Towers haunt the landscapes of Tower Song, and players must unravel their mysteries to save Solace's sister and the desert metropolis of Qadam. Along the way, players will traverse across forests, rivers, deserts and more. After a hard day\u2019s work, they can also pause to get to know their party better at camp.
