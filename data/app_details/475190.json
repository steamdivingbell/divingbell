{"about_the_game":"Regaining consciousness you smell the damp.  Opening your eyes you see the stone walls of the chamber flickering by the light of the fire; you stumble to your feet and kick a helmet clattering across the floor.  Slowly the ache in your head begins to subside and you notice the beginnings of a passage.  After a few steps the darkness consumes you.  Returning to the safely of the fire you see a LIDAR scanner on the floor - a trigger press results in a faint glow coming from inside the helmet.  You put the helmet on, adjust the beam-width and proceed into the abyss\u2026.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInspired by Gone Home and Dear Esther, Scanner Sombre is a cave exploration experience.  With stunning visuals and a terrifying theme, it is the 6th major video game released by Introversion Software - creators of the million selling, BAFTA award winning Prison Architect as well as Uplink, Darwinia, DEFCON and Multiwinia.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/475190/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725115742","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/475190/page.bg.jpg?t=1725115742","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/475190/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725115742","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/475190/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725115742","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Supported","id":53},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Regaining consciousness you smell the damp.
