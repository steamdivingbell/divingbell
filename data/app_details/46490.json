Hernandez has been highly critical of the FBI's and Victoria's lack of progress. That does not stop Hernandez from phoning and asking Victoria to meet her later that evening. Hernandez claims to have some so-called clues on the killer in her possession. Victoria flatly refuses. Just moments later, Paloma is kidnapped by the Torturer\u2026<br>\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Still Life 2</strong> remains true to the spirit of its first installment, but now allows you to play and manage two characters bound by the same fate. This time, the aim is to control two heroines, see the game from two complementary viewpoints and experience two different gameplays. Depending on whether you are playing Paloma Hernandez, the victim being hunted by the killer or Victoria McPherson, the FBI agent tracking him down, you can alternate between survival and investigation.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/46490/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1570009802","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/46490/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1570009802","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/46490/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1570009802","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/46490/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1570009802","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Who is hiding behind Mr. X?
