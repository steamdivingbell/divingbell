{"about_the_game":"The game is like a Shoot'em up Bullet Hell. <br><strong>Special aspects: </strong>the game will be interesting for those whose aim is speedrun and for those who want to memorize enemy attack patterns to pass the game up the end without continuations. In case of success, the battle with the final bosses will be available. The game contains more than 10 different bosses, many different enemy characters. The player does not die after several hits, but the temporary invulnerability to enemy fire is not provided as well. Therefore, having missed a strong volley, you can almost immediately lose all your energy. The player has at his disposal several different types of weapons (laser, missiles). Using them you can effectively deal with enemies and bosses. For the sake of convenience, the main weapon shoots in auto mode. You do not need to press the button constantly :-)<br><br><strong>There are three regimes of the game: Bullet Hell mode, Standard mode and Casual mode.</strong> In the Bullet Hell mode and in the Casual mode slowing down of the time through pressing the button for better avoiding the bullets is available. In the Bullet Hell mode there are much more bullets. Slowing down the time  is not available in the Standard mode.<br><br><strong>Plot</strong><br><br>Distant future. The Earth Union reconnaissance ship is carrying out an ordinary mission to explore the far reaches of space. <br>Despite all the technology and exploration of space, there was not any contact with aliens. On the planets there was found only unintelligent life. But then suddenly the ship receives an unknown signal. The crew was so happy! Is it really the first contact at last and the humankind is no longer alone in the Universe? Having Gone to the place of the signal source in the hope to make the first contact, the crew discovers an army of aggressive aliens! They immediately began to attack the ship for some unknown reason with massive attacks. <br><br>Having made a difficult choice, the crew decided to destroy them all! The particularly important aims are the giant mother-ships.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Fighter1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/968410/940c852b6bc4daf489226610bdb513b5c4c09662.jpg"},{"name":"Flying Saucer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/968410/4f4590aa97fd9f1379a9595d9b26e57fa5c369d9.jpg"},{"name":"Space Exterminator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/968410/144006e63688001951e6fbd8d3d79e0a5a9e5135.jpg"},{"name":"Sprayer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/968410/24746860208676d85d2687f478938c19183744e9.jpg"},{"name":"Galactic Fighter","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/968410/e39be746ca3330d225c0a86d3610f64b6ef66b15.jpg"},{"name":"Fighter2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/968410/953029477104bc1a50b21e0dd76356754b3ec397.jpg"},{"name":"Eliminator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/968410/037cef53416c8e80729b8fee6c6b5fb6a1969251.jpg"},{"name":"Fighter3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/968410/7e856f5f1a17174b933b4ba219a4bd02c0527d01.jpg"},{"name":"Rotator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/968410/e45be1f60f7e3de0ed3b4c7b3278fcaa4bafbc07.jpg"},{"name":"Rocket Carrier","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/968410/1f7ec502742e18070c2bbd8f26104232291e9305.jpg"}],"total":25},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/968410/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1574625021","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/968410/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1574625021","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/968410/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1574625021","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/968410/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1574625021","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The game is like a Shoot'em up Bullet Hell. <br><strong>Special aspects: </strong>the game will be interesting for those whose aim is speedrun and for those who want to memorize enemy attack patterns to pass the game up the end without continuations.
