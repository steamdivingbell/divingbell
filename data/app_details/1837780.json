Lots of bullets and spells to choose from which you can buy from local store. Choose your build before the next level and face the creatures in this top-down, tower defence, shoot 'em up, action game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Story</strong></h2>You lived peacefully in the middle of a dark forest. Gathering herbs, creating potions, and studying magic were your daily activities. It was like that until terrifying monsters started haunting you. Who ordered them to disturb your peace? <br>Plunge yourself in the fantasy world by following the story of the old wizard and reading the rich descriptions in the bestiary.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Modes</strong></h2>Two modes available: campaign and freeplay. The campaign include structured levels with epic boss fights that end in fighting the main villain. <br>Freeplay is an endless gameplay with randomly generated levels. Check yourself how far you can go!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Atmosphere</strong></h2>Beautiful, warm colors. Bright, cartoon, fantasy graphics.
