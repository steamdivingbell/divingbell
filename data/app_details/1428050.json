{"about_the_game":"Angle Wars is a light-hearted, top-down war game blending elements of speed and strategy. Control soldiers using a variety of weapons and abilities, across an array of battlefields and game modes. You'll have to direct your men where to move and at what angles to shoot, taking into account perspective, obstacles, physics, wind, and elevation. Victory or defeat, the balance lies in your hands...because in Angle Wars, <i>you</i> call the shots!<br><br>In the demo you can play through the first 5 challenges in the campaign, as a British soldier in the European Theatre. Go to war alone or with up to 4 players in local co-op.  <br><br>The demo also includes one single player/co-op survival map...how long can you withstand the hordes of Nazi experimental zombies? Between waves, spend your combat points wisely to upgrade yourself and your weaponry, because the zombies only get tougher!<br><br>Controls are customizable, and support playing with gamepads, keyboard, mouse, or any combination thereof. Play with 4 controllers on a couch, 4 people hunched over 1 keyboard, or use Steam's Remote Play as the perfect socially distanced virtual couch!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1428050/extras/iwantyou.png?t=1602013694\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1428050/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1602013694","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1428050/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1602013694","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1428050/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1602013694","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1428050/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1602013694","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Angle Wars is a light-hearted, top-down war game blending elements of speed and strategy.
