The performance of an airsoft gun is dependent on all internal components. Improve the hop-up for increased accuracy. Install a shorter barrel for more stealthy gameplay. Or switch to a red dot on your sniper rifle to show off an aggressive play style.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2932450/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1719326808","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2932450/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1719326808","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2932450/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1719326808","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2932450/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1719326808","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2932450/extras/DescriptionHeaderBLAuthenticGameplay.png?t=1719326808\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2932450/extras/DescriptionGifSniper.gif?t=1719326808\" /><br>Inspired by our own experiences with the sport and by studying airsoft videos from various countries, we try to reproduce the sport of airsoft as accurately as possible.
