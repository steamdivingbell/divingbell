My new video game, Membal, is a serene game filled with adorable animals, aiming to train memory while enjoying the construction of a small village.<br>This game is truly important to me because the idea of a memory training game came to me when I was about 16, and my aunt was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. I wanted to create a game to help her and others with memory issues. Perhaps it was naive and innocent, but I was genuinely focused on making it happen. Back then, I did almost all the art, but lacked the coding skills. After 5 years of developing my own games, I finally decided to finish it. I had to redo all the art, and now, I've finally brought it to life.<br>Unfortunately, my aunt passed away two years ago. Therefore, I decided this game would be a tribute to her, making her one of the main characters assisting the player. I hope this game can help those in need and those seeking to enhance their memory and keep their minds active!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Neighbors 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2360490/7506dc8556f0dc9588ffef3ed339eb3e17a6d1c2.jpg"},{"name":"Neighbors 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2360490/d3662b26c6c665c2641317bdb2866cb7cf6f0998.jpg"},{"name":"Neighbors 3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2360490/5248c4f0aa8ca7892a99ffa4a3b869ccca7532ef.jpg"},{"name":"Neighbors 4","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2360490/9bbdeb8548427e5ca2f31ddfdd727751aa2e8d0c.jpg"},{"name":"Neighbors 5","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2360490/c008c46c04a1afe87d5ac337881067d342d6c128.jpg"},{"name":"Missions 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2360490/e315e8ff26f9bbc5d12893cebdc7ae45d459a40a.jpg"},{"name":"Missions 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2360490/713b2d4ccf4f2f3229476f75207f1b61a47d33d3.jpg"},{"name":"Missions 3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2360490/e1c7b9c919f14cfccddebd6da9cf8555cefe04d8.jpg"},{"name":"Talkative 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2360490/085c801757e0bdcac3d7063a94a4742734f9c183.jpg"},{"name":"Talkative 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2360490/2cd8dd06af8be41315415939e7725c0e2a9cb9d4.jpg"}],"total":60},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2360490/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1706906125","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2360490/page.bg.jpg?t=1706906125","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2360490/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1706906125","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2360490/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1706906125","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>Welcome to Membal: Your Town, Your Memory!</strong><br>Immerse yourself in a charming world where city reconstruction goes hand in hand with caring for your mind.
