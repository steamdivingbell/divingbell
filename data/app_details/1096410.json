You have to learn what it means to be one of the Kindred in a huge, vibrant, contemporary metropolis. On your way you\u2019ll meet different NPCs \u2013 other vampires, thin-bloods, ghouls, humans... and more. You will perform tasks that will put test your humanity and take part in a complex and often brutal struggle for power between the Camarilla and the Anarchs. You\u2019ll interact with key NPCs - form unique bonds and relations and learn your undead companions\u2019 deepest secrets... or see them abandon you. You\u2019ll feast on the living and will ask yourself about the very nature of humanity. You will have to keep track of your Hunger or the Beast inside you will take over. You will make choices for the character, including which storylines to pursue and how to approach the different situations presented. You will take part in a narrative experience with branching dialogue choices, memorable characters - all among iconic locales of the Big Apple. You will be able to use Disciplines that will help you in combat and conversations, but be aware that every use of a Discipline may increase the level of your Hunger. Left unchecked, your Hunger will force you to give control over to the Beast: a dark side of your nature which wishes only to feed... no matter the cost.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">If it\u2019s called Vampire: The Masquerade, does that mean you have something in common with World of Darkness, Bloodlines 2, the cult tabletop RPG system, or...?</h2><br>Yes, exactly! <strong>Coteries of New York</strong> is set in the same universe as Bloodlines 2, but our game offers different experiences and stories.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Do you plan to expand the universe of <strong>Coteries of New York</strong></h2><br>As for post-launch support, we\u2019ll keep you updated. We would love to expand Coteries\u2019 stories, but it depends on many factors and we do not want to over promise anything.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Which platforms will <strong>Coteries of New York</strong> be available on?</h2><br><strong>Coteries of New York</strong> is available on PC (Windows, Mac OS and Linux), PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch in Q1 2020.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Does the game support controllers?</h2><br>Yes!
