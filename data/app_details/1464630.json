{"about_the_game":"Gravity in Space is the ultimate synthesis of an astrodynamics simulation and an action shooter.

Controlling a spaceship is totally different compared to an aircraft. It is much harder. No air resistance, no maximum speed, no limits. You have to completely rethink the basic idea of flying.
