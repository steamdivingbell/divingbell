{"about_the_game":"Nether is a master of communicating with a dark force from deep in space but she is not its master. By surrendering herself to it she gains a part of its power and with it a minor control over reality. With a variety of different vacuums, pulls, and pushes she can exercise a limited control over the fabric of time and space. Her spells are a mix of ground casted area-of-effect and projectiles. By combining these she can initiate an excellent combination of spells by pulling a distant enemy into a trap and then draining their life and mana. She can also use her ultimate to capture and disable an entire group of enemy wizards leaving them vulnerable to her allies.<br><br>This is a more advanced class and is better suited to teamwork based gameplay. By communicating with teammates, it is possible to pull of devastating spell combinations which can change an entire battle. While she is able to put out solid damage her real power is in how she can force other players to change their playstyles.<br><br><strong>Unique Passive Spell:</strong> Voidstep - Instead of normal Manashifts Nether can teleport herself a short distance wherever she is looking.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Starting Spells</h2><strong>Primary:</strong> Chakram -Send out a chakram of nether energy that causes 10 - 14 damage on contact. This spell returns to the caster once it reaches max range or after hitting a non-player object. The chakram also deals damage on return.<br><strong>Secondary:</strong> Rift - Summon a nether portal at the targeted location that deals 4 damage and drains mana every 0.5s. This spell lasts for 4s.<br><strong>Utility:</strong> Void Tether - Launch tendrils of Nether energy that when it hits will pull your target to your location and deal 15 damage.<br><strong>Ultimate:</strong> Vortex - Create a powerful gravity well at the target location that sucks in nearby enemies for 5s and deals 5 - 6 damage every 0.5s while also preventing them from moving or casting spells.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/426960/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1509023843","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/426960/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1509023843","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/426960/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1509023843","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/426960/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1509023843","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Stats","id":15}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Nether is a master of communicating with a dark force from deep in space but she is not its master.
