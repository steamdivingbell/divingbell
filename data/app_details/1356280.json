I played this for hours at a time, unable to put it down.\u201d<br>90 \u2013 Pure Nintendo<br><br>\u201cIf you\u2019re a fan of games like Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley and Rune Factory, you\u2019ll definitely like this title. It has a decent balance of farming and adventure, a solid story and the most adorable characters you will ever see. Since the game is pretty open, you can really go at your own pace, you don\u2019t have to do any of the story quests right away if you feel like opting towards farming and gathering instead. Or if you think you can get away with a limited income, you can mostly forgo the farming and head straight into the adventure! Overall, Kitaria Fables is a wholesome and relaxed time.\u201d<br>82 \u2013 COGconnected<br><br>\u201cA fantastic tribute to Fantasy Life that nails the kind of grindy combat that many people love, Kitaria Fables is genuinely sweet and impressively well-made for a three-person team in under three years. If Fantasy Life is a Wagyu beef steak, Kitaria Fables is a really, REALLY good burger.
