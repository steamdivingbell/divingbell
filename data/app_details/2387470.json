{"about_the_game":"This game is a puzzle adventure game based on the theme of elevators. At first, the player boards the elevator, but it is initially in a stationary state. The interior of the elevator varies from retro-style to being filled with unknown machinery. The player explores the stages, finds clues, and operates the elevator buttons and devices in a specific order to move the elevator and progress to the next stage.<br><br>In this game, the elevator serves as a symbol that traces memories. When the elevator doors open, strange scenes unfold, such as endlessly long corridors or vast deserts, representing someone's memories. While riding various designs of elevators, the player reaches the &quot;deep floors&quot; of memories and reveals the truth of the story.<br><br>[Player Controls]<br>This game is a first-person view, and like a typical FPS game, the player can move and rotate the view (but jumping is not possible). The player's hands are displayed on the screen, with the right-hand function assigned to the R/ZR button and the left-hand function assigned to the L/ZL button of the gamepad. The player can press buttons, pick up items, and combine items using each hand.<br><br>[Use Your Imagination]<br>In this game, no characters other than the player appear. Instead, the concept is to use the player's imagination to supplement the appearance and hidden stories of the characters from the objects and fragmented voices that fall.<br><br>Although this game is currently in the early stages of development, images and demos under production will be uploaded in the future.
