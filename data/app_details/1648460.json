I work on it about 30-40 hours per week, and have a full time career and a family as well.<br><br>To give you a idea of how much work goes into a game:<br>Call of Duty is made by a team of 60+ people @ 12 hours per day. Each iteration (Version) takes about 3 years to make. That's 690,000+ hours of development!<br>Space One - Electron has a little over 1,200 development hours so far! It is a long way from finished!!!<br><br>What I can promise:<br>- There will be bugs!<br>- Some updates will get delayed, even cancelled!<br>- The planned content may change!<br>- It will take 3-5 years to be fully ready.<br>- Work and Family will always come first!<br>- You may lose save games!<br>- The final product of this game will be <strong>ABSOLUTELY EPIC</strong>!<br><br>Buying the game is a way to support the growth and development of the game, and be a part of that process. <br>This is what early access is all about! <br>However, if you are not ready to handle bugs then I do not recommend you buy the game at this time!<br>I do, however,  encourage you to join our community on discord and follow our progress!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><i>Currently, not all features listed below are available.
