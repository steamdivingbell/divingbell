Every effect can be altered in intensity with note velocity, particles can be blown around by note activity, and all three pedals contribute to activity calculation.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1325730/extras/store_features_1-6-3_v2.gif?t=1732804230\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A note from the developer</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Hello! My name is Jack (although I typically go by Egglyberts) and I'm the sole developer for Keysight. I began playing with MIDI integration in Unreal Engine 4 back in June 2019, and then Keysight development began in earnest in January 2020 at the request of a few streamer friends. It released on Steam on June 30th that same year, and evolved substantially over the next four years into what it is today!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">While originally targeted at streaming, Keysight has now grown into a powerful, flexible MIDI visualization tool that can serve many purposes. If you're looking for some inspiration, check out a myriad of community creations over in the very active Official Discord! (See link at the side of this store page). The Discord is also a great place to get help if you have any questions; I will often answer questions within minutes (or, in the worst case, within a day). </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Finally, if you happen to be a serious content creator: <strong>I do offer a paid service to build custom Keysight implementations to your specification</strong> (more information available in the Community Hub discussions). To be clear, this is not aimed at the overwhelming majority of users! Keysight is a fixed price, and it's yours to use for any content creation you desire. No subscription, no in-app purchases, no DLC. But for those &quot;time is money&quot; folks out there, I am here to help!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">PS., if you're interested, give the demo a go! The only demo restriction is that 50% of note-on events are dropped at random; all features are present and anything created in the demo carries over into the full version.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1325730/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732804230","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1325730/page.bg.jpg?t=1732804230","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1325730/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732804230","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1325730/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732804230","categories":[{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":1362820,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">'Keysight' is an Unreal Engine powered real-time MIDI visualization platform aimed at piano-focused video creators and streamers.
