You need to balance the optimization of production efficiency and the improvement of military strength. The game is easy to play, but it's not easy to win in the end. Your stronghold won't die out because of a single defeat, but can be rebuilt quickly, which makes you always reach the final battle. But if the development is not fast enough, you will not win in the final battle. In fact, it is normal for ordinary players to win the final battle through multi-generations game. Some items can be inherited between generations to help you become stronger and stronger. At the same time, the world of each generation will be re-randomized, so the construction and development strategy will be different every time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GAME CONTENT</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Build factories to recycle all kinds of waste left by human beings for reproduction.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Maximizes production efficiency by planning the distribution of buildings, roads and robots.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Trades with other strongholds to obtain electricity.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Rescue and accept different robotic partners and increase your hands.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Unlocks buildings, robotic components, various production technologies and combat technologies in technological tree.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Arm your robots, attack Justicar and robber robots'strongholds for resources.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Use defensive buildings to protect your strongholds.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Collect the remains of human civilization, and they will enhance your strength.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>If you lose in the final war, a powerful magnetic storm will bring everything back to its original point.
