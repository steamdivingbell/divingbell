{"about_the_game":"<strong>Bomsy</strong> is a fast, aim-based, multiplayer arena brawler with destructible maps. Take out your opponents by launching bombs in their direction, breaking the ground from under them, or pushing them off the edge! Go after your enemies right off the bat or dig around and hoard upgrades before you decide to engage. The map is your playground; swing off blocks, blast jump to high ground, or quickly roll to safety. With so many ways to get around, Bomsy is made to feel smooth, responsive, and rewarding. Round up your friends and start playing in the bright and colourful world of Bomsy!<br><br><strong>Bomsy Demo</strong><br>In this demo version, demo players are able to play offline local mode (game mode settings locked) as well as join online lobbies. Demo players can also host one lobby of their own every 24 hours (with lobby and game mode settings locked). The purpose of this demo is to let players get a sense for what Bomsy is like. Since Bomsy is strictly multiplayer, this is a great way for a bunch of friends to try out the game without anyone/everyone having to purchase it.<br><br><strong>Join our Discord</strong><br>Chat with other players and set up matches!
