{"about_the_game":"Convicted for the mysterious death of his wife, Adam returns to the house where the tragedy occurred, in search of evidence to prove his innocence. As he traverses each room, feeling every stone and every dark corner of the house, he sifts through memories and confronts deeply buried fears. In the apparent silence of each space, echoes of the past are hidden, and every gust of wind seems to whisper the name of his lost beloved. With each step, the old tales of the place come to life, and shadows walk beside him, urging him to explore the darkness that surrounds him. In a journey full of suspense and mystery, Adam confronts ghosts of regrets and sins, discovering that the truth is often more complicated and more frightening than any supernatural fantasy. Faced with each obstacle, he must maintain his lucidity and steel his will, for only thus will he succeed in unraveling the enigmas that haunt his existence. With each discovery, the disturbing truth becomes clearer, and the shadows of the past reveal their secrets hidden in the depths of the house haunted by dark memories.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2906130/extras/Untitled1-ezgif.com-crop.gif?t=1722611454\" /><br><br>*Key Features:*<br><br>- *Terrifying Exploration:* Delve into the depths of the cursed house and uncover the disturbing secrets hidden in every dark corner.<br>- *Intense Horror Atmosphere:* Experience the suspense and terror of a chilling search, supported by haunting sound and graphics.<br>- *Player Power:* You, the player, will have the power to possess and manipulate objects, influencing the environment to progress in the game.<br>- *Confronting Inner Demons:* Face not only external threats but also internal ones, in a quest for truth and redemption.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2906130/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1722611454","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2906130/page.bg.jpg?t=1722611454","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2906130/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1722611454","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2906130/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1722611454","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"This video game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, and may potentially trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy.
