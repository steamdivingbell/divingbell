You\u2019ll want to try to stay alive to get to the next experiments to research. You can <strong>tap the enemy</strong> with a left click to do damage.

Always try to be a better Mage.<br>At the TRADERS you can trade Liquid Gold, Runes, and Dragon Eggs. These all have different advantages. Dragon Eggs give powerful buffs with low caps and the unspent Dragon Eggs stay with you through Time Shifting. Runes give small bonuses but you'll find a lot more of them, you trade them to the fairies for Boons that stack up and up and up. Liquid Gold powers up your Spells. These are your main source of progression, they give you health, damage, defense, loot bonuses, clicking, and more!<br><br>Every TRADER gets a PERMANENT bonus too! They're called WINDOW FACTIONS. You get them just for using the Traders! You trade in enough goods with them and they just give you a bonus. Trade in enough liquid gold and you'll find yourself finding more.

You still get to burst down some mobs and feel epic but then you get to get back to the fight and whack some baddies much sooner!<br>     <br>      The prestige currencies in the game come in two shapes and both stack up everytime you Time Shift:<br>      You have one that rewards your pushing called <strong>KNOWLEDGE POINTS</strong>. You get these for every new Mage Level you reach. Every first time you reach a new Mage Level you get one of these bad boys to add to the pool. These <strong>increase your experience yields for ALLL future runs</strong>. So essentially every time you get more knowledge points you level faster getting you back up to where you were faster!<br>      Then you have your &quot;farming&quot; reward called <strong>MONSTER POPULATION</strong>. You get these for EVERY stage you pass every Time Shift you go through! They <strong>increase your health and damage permanently</strong> for all future runs too. You even get bonuses to that run's gains every 250 Stages you pass. AND after you time shift and you start at that HALF your max stages EVER reached, you get a starting booster bonus to your gains so you're not missing out on what you would have earned if you had started from Stage 0 (and you get it much quicker than if you had to start all over again!).<br><br>       Between the two currencies you can shoot back up and push push push.  If you're starting to slow down you have two options. If you're really tenacious you can wait for another mage level or more Liquid Gold, Runes, etc and push out a few more Stages or hit a burst of power and grab some more Knowledge points, or time shift and try for more Monster Population and store your bonuses that you gained from your last run.  Time Shift more, or less ,depending on how you like to play, slow and steady, fast and furious, or somewhere in between!<br><br>       This game is all about playing how you like to play and finding your own pace and strategy for your idle and management experience. We hope you enjoy!<br><br>        <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get stronger, go further! Keep at it! We have faith you\u2019ll be the strongest Magician ever!
