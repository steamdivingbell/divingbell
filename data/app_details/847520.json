{"about_the_game":"Pizzamon is a fantasy story about a young adventurer doing battle with, and fighting against, imaginary creatures.  After you create your trusty Pizzamon, a pizza who does battle for you, you get the chance to compete in the Chef Championships.  Side by side with your Pizzamon, you must battle to collect badges from Grand Chefs who reside in various villages that you discover during your journey.  Each village has a badge based on the zone that they are located in, for example the Winter Badge, Mountain Badge and Water Badge.  Not only must you defeat the Grand Chefs but you will have to fight others who are also trying to get the badges that you need to win.  You will fight other competitors, chefs, and Grand Chefs in your quest to make it to the top.
