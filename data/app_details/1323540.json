{"about_the_game":"<u><strong>STORY</strong></u><br>Take the role of Wally. A mysterious character that has recovered what was taken from him. Hopefully, you're fast enough to outrun your enemies. Expose the truth and try to uncover the mystery of what happened to them. With an average runtime of an action movie (about an hour and a half on Normal), a first run of this action-packed adventure can be enjoyed in an afternoon. Afterwards you can improve your score.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1323540/extras/aerialknight_Neveryield.gif?t=1717687365\" /><br><br><u><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong></u><br>Aerial_Knight's Never Yield is a 3D side-scroller that plays much like a classic endless runner.
