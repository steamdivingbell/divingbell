{"about_the_game":"Jump, fly, and shoot your way through the boundless depths of the Cosmophage, an autodimensional cyber-organic entity whose very immune system wants your end. Play as the courageous and out-of-his-league Sir Reese as you destroy Antibodies, adopt their laser signatures, and blast your way to victory, collecting their dark energy for one final detonation and the total annihilation of this otherworldly foe. As you progress, the Cosmophage's defenses will grow increasingly agitated at your presence. See if you can survive a world that is truly out to get you. Invade it, and infect it. Give hell a fever.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Explore a new procedurally generated world every playthrough.<br></li><li>Precision platforming and bullet hell gameplay combine for a difficult but rewarding play experience.<br></li><li>Infinitely varied and surprising laser drops from Antibodies give Sir Reese the tools he needs to fulfill his mission.<br></li><li>A steady ramp-up in difficulty means only the best will be able to achieve final victory.<br></li><li>An original instrumental death metal soundtrack gets you pumped for action.</li></ul>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1600700?t=1620494811","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1600700/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1620494811","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1600700/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1620494811","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1600700/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1620494811","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Jump, fly, and shoot your way through the boundless depths of the Cosmophage, an autodimensional cyber-organic entity whose very immune system wants your end.
