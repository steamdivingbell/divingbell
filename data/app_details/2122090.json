{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2122090/extras/Steam_Gif.gif?t=1738417979\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2122090/extras/GIF_02.gif?t=1738417979\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Forgotten but Unbroken offers a unique perspective on the WWII turn-based strategy genre. Inspired by real stories and events, the game introduces fresh mechanics never before seen in the genre. Players will experience defense missions, historical characters, and unique &quot;micro&quot; features based on reality. From the special abilities granted by wearables to the absence of magical healing, &quot;Forgotten but Unbroken&quot; provides a realistic and immersive gameplay experience. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Elite enemy units, such as the feared SS troops, are designed to spread fear among players, affecting their aiming and overall performance. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Additionally, the game allows players to forge strong relationships with allies, who may send elite soldiers to assist in battle for a limited time, adding a strategic layer to gameplay.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2122090/extras/GIF_01.gif?t=1738417979\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Deep and Complex Experience</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Forgotten but Unbroken delivers a deep and complex gameplay experience by intertwining historical events with personal narratives. Players will encounter a newspaper feature that reports on real events from WWII, such as the Battle of Kursk or the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich. These global events are presented alongside the personal story of the main character, Commander Martin, whose life is profoundly impacted by the events of the war. This dual narrative approach not only provides players with a rich historical context but also immerses them in the emotional journey of the main character.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Real Protagonists of WWII</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game features real characters of WWII, carefully &amp; respectfully selected for their legacies. Players have the opportunity to meet and interact with these protagonists for a limited time during the game, adding a layer of authenticity and reverence to the gameplay experience.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Soldier Management</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game features six classes of soldiers, each with unique abilities and perks. Players can customize their soldiers and manage their traits, which affect their performance in battle. Traits such as &quot;Iron Will&quot; can significantly impact a soldier's morale, while physical traits like &quot;Sickly&quot; can affect their disease susceptibility.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Base Management</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Base management is a crucial aspect, allowing players to heal, train, and maintain the morale of their troops. Structures such as hospitals and armories can be built to improve various aspects of the base and troops. Additionally, players must consider factors such as weather and disease, which can impact the effectiveness of their base and troops.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Region and Campaign</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Forgotten but Unbroken is set primarily in central Europe, with a focus on Czechoslovakia. This region's strategic importance during WWII makes it an ideal setting for the game, as players will navigate the complex political and military landscape of the era.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Diplomacy/Politics</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Forgotten but Unbroken incorporates a diplomacy and politics system that allows players to impress allies through successful missions, thereby increasing support. Relations with allies can impact the type and level of support they provide, adding a strategic element to player decisions.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2122090/extras/GIF_03.gif?t=1738417979\" /></p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Boss Fight","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2122090/13b6bb835591358ef2978c18608bbbaeefe4875a.jpg"},{"name":"Meaning of Life","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2122090/caeb8d95d11ecd84ba4b283963cb98bab5a1487f.jpg"},{"name":"New Adventure","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2122090/59ac6a2c0a5c7575cb715b949ecfcd5dc1f31ca4.jpg"},{"name":"All Alike","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2122090/2aea8c16c1a78e08fd3134c27ea97080a910dbe4.jpg"},{"name":"Banner of Valor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2122090/a6d4524b084321c9434c487b5987d0675d21dde5.jpg"},{"name":"Baptized by Fire","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2122090/adf8e1d3acb16b8d2a7001c6cc986dd90615c4ff.jpg"},{"name":"Base-Builder","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2122090/71712cdc65d1782461fe1cca637ba21fe64476bc.jpg"},{"name":"BOOOM!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2122090/f2f975bf3bf5819d4af2325d91c2007961c5f661.jpg"},{"name":"Clutch or Kick","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2122090/646b033cb39e314d8f79a233b9b33d291b3ef800.jpg"},{"name":"Deal like a Pro","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2122090/cb50489bde6bb6ae25f830ec77c593603772dc55.jpg"}],"total":42},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2122090?t=1738417979","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2122090/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1738417979","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2122090/4910d0735b5704d9200329f5eac308affe4e79f5/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738417979","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2122090/4910d0735b5704d9200329f5eac308affe4e79f5/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738417979","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"In some locations around the world the depiction of some German WW2 uniforms and symbols are not permitted.\r\n\r\nWhilst these soldiers are present in the game they are presented in a historical context and their actions are not glorified."},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2122090/extras/Steam_Gif.gif?t=1738417979\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2122090/extras/GIF_02.gif?t=1738417979\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Forgotten but Unbroken offers a unique perspective on the WWII turn-based strategy genre.
