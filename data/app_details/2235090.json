Like traditional Rouge-lite games, the game map will be randomly generated at the beginning of each game, and you will decide on your own way to promote the game. You can choose to face a strong enemy or switch a route. Meanwhile, the game focuses on the combination of weapons and props, and provides numbers of usable weapons and props. You can match them freely and choose your own unique fighting style. The combination of different props and buffs can usually produce different outstanding performance. Eventually, you will collect more props and become more powerful in the process of constantly exploring the map. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2235090/extras/bdh001.gif?t=1734596759\" /></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2235090/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734596759","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2235090/page.bg.jpg?t=1734596759","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2235090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734596759","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2235090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734596759","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Introduction</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is a simple Rogue-lite action game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game has been adapted to Steamdeck.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> The current version include 7 Maps and 12 boss fight.
