Well, with our assortment of different Gun-Bats, you will shoot and slash your way to victory. The kicker is, every attack and shot from your Gunbat will not only send the enemy flying, but also yourself. Staying on the ground is dangerous, so try to stay in the air by using enemies, weapons and other junk flying around as boosters. Staying in the air has other benefits, but try to find them out by yourself.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1724420/extras/gamerplay2.gif?t=1686896445\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Give them a taste of their own medicine</h2><br>Almost all attacks can be sent back with a hit from your bat.
