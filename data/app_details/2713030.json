{"about_the_game":"<i>Recently I moved to a new house in my city. The previous tenant was a weird guy, a programmer working for the government. He left in a hurry and forgot a bunch of things in the attic, including a weird terminal. This terminal gives access to a kind of network of old games - at least dozens of them, and maybe a lot more, I can't tell for sure. The games are linked - you need to clear one to get access to the next. I've been exploring it for a while, and I talked to a few NPCs I met.  They keep rambling about a golden city full of treasures that could be found deep in the network.  So maybe there's more to it than just games. One thing is certain: this place is huge. Gargantuan.
