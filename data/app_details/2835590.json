{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">&quot;8AM&quot; plunges the player into an enigmatic and tense game of observation and decision under an unfathomable veil of mystery. In this game, you find yourself in a stark room, devoid of any memory or knowledge of your purpose or how you arrived there. The only companions in your solitary vigil are a set of devices and a computer, your window to the outside world, connecting you exclusively to the security camera system of a seemingly ordinary house.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The house is inhabited by a family whose life appears to proceed normally until the clock strikes midnight. From that moment, as the hours slip towards dawn, you become a witness to a series of events that could be classified as ordinary or deeply disturbing. The nature of these occurrences varies widely, from ghostly figures slipping through the corridors in the darkness, manifestations of paranormal activity that defy all logic, to the strange behaviors of the family members, like sleepwalking, which could hide something more sinister.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your task is simple yet immensely complicated: to determine whether what you are witnessing is a manifestation of the supernatural or mere coincidences and everyday events interpreted through a prism of isolation and tension. There are no clear answers, nor are you provided with tools to investigate or influence events. Your judgment is your only guide in this dark task.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Every correct decision you make brings you one step closer to your final goal: reaching 8:00 a.m. and, with it, your liberation. But what does &quot;correct&quot; truly mean in a world where reality intertwines with the incomprehensible? There are no truths to unravel, only the growing anxiety that each choice could be as right as it is wrong.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">&quot;8AM&quot; is a challenge to perception, a game that forces you to question reality and face the uncertainty of the night. With each passing night and every decision you make, you not only draw closer to liberation but also delve deeper into the mystery of the human condition and the nature of reality itself. This game not only challenges you to observe but also to reflect on what it means to be a spectator of the lives of others, isolated yet intimately linked to their fate.</p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Who am I?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2835590/17b216fbc2888aff108808cc9a320016e3d7275a.jpg"},{"name":"8 AM","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2835590/4c882fe3d6db3a6418ee7edd6e47f2cae3778443.jpg"},{"name":"Inspector","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2835590/5158f697afc4b4f5c9c386a9f8c3812a5dfcaee6.jpg"}],"total":3},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2835590/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731537193","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2835590/page.bg.jpg?t=1731537193","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2835590/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731537193","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2835590/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731537193","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>JOIN US ON DISCORD</h1><p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2835590/extras/discord.png?t=1731537193\" /></p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">&quot;8AM&quot; plunges the player into an enigmatic and tense game of observation and decision under an unfathomable veil of mystery.
