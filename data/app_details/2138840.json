{"about_the_game":"You are the <strong>Bug Queen</strong>. But not really, it's just a simulation. You're actually a person playing a video game. And in that video game, you play a hero called the Bug Queen, who launches bugs (again, not for real, this is simulated) that zoom around infesting simulated enemies with deadly poison.<br><br>Or maybe you are the dark vampire <strong>Niloc Nosnibor</strong> - but I must stress once again that you aren't really (unless you are, which I respect), you are just playing a video game. I mean you're not right now. You're reading about potentially playing this game in the future. I hope you do. You're gonna love it. So that vampire I mentioned, he can turn into mist to dodge attacks, or drain life from the victims of his impaling spikes. It's good fun.<br><br>Each of the 10+ heroes (who upon second look might actually be villains) has a particular set of 15 skills to invest in, and equips one of 10+ special abilities, which in turn have their own sets of 5 skills. The hero can also acquire and upgrade a set of weapons during their run with their own special bonuses in traditional* roguelite fashion (*This tradition is like 5 years old at most, but it is sure widespread!). Level up and collect game-changing bonuses to create the most absolutely broken build to overcome the monstrous hordes!<br><br>Whoever you happen to be (not really, just simulated), you get to blast away at countless armies of the demonic and ridiculous in a collection of unique game modes that each parody a popular roguelite game, from the angry Cheeseburgers of <strong>20 Minutes Till Lunch</strong> to the Zombies and Skeletons of <strong>Vampire Revivers</strong>, or you can create your own challenge by mixing any of the heroes, weapons, abilities, and modes. It's a rollicking twin-stick shooter of a time which accurately simulates what playing a <i>real</i> video game might be like!<br><br>And if that's not enough variety, we've got scripting and modding to create your own heroes, weapons, abilities, and modes. But you can't make real ones - only simulated ones. This is a simulation. ...Just like real life might be?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2138840/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727906845","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2138840/page.bg.jpg?t=1727906845","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2138840/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727906845","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2138840/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727906845","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"You are the <strong>Bug Queen</strong>.
