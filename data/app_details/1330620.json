While, in the beginning, WCS will just offer online play of two players against each other, my goal is to add various additional modes, such as playing with up to 8 (or even 20?) players in any vs/co-op combinations, or join a match as a spectator only.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fast-paced Gameplay</h2>WCS is not a simulation but an arcade \u201ceasy to learn, hard to master\u201d approach to playing soccer on a computer. When designing WCS, it is crucial to me that controls always feel utmost responsive, and that you would never have to wait for any animation/script to finish before your desired action commences.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Responsive Controls</h2>All your beautiful dribbling, passes and goals should be a direct result of you controlling the game, pressing the right buttons at the right time and for the correct amount of time, rather than random effects or pre-scripted events.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\u201cEasy to Learn, Hard to Master\u201d</h2>Simulating the complex player movements, feints, tricks, dribbling and kicks, which are part of real-life soccer, leads to very complex controller layouts with lots of buttons to use and dozens of combinations which are hard to master, requiring a lot of practice and making soccer simulations quite hard to pick up.<br><br>WCS is different.
