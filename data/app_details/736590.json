Our game has full support for modifications, single-player play, co-operative play, competitive multiplayer play, and Steam workshop! Our game is similar to other mod-friendly games like Ravenfield and Garry's Mod but with roots in military simulation games like Squad and Arma III. This means while the base un-modified game will play more like Squad or Insurgency: Sandstorm, modified versions of the game can be like anything else you can imagine.<br><br><i>Defending against an alien invasion in the &quot;Troopers&quot; mod for Operation: Harsh Doorstop.</i><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/736590/extras/ezgif-4-3e4ecfab76.gif?t=1729459726\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How much does Operation: Harsh Doorstop cost?</h2><br>Operation: Harsh Doorstop is a free game. Our community members can donate to help fund development, but we still believe in making our game freely accessible to everyone. Not only is this important to us as a statement against corporate greed, but we also feel that game communities are healthier (and larger) when games are more accessible.<br><br><i>A full squad assaults a flag while playing &quot;Khafji&quot; in Operation: Harsh Doorstop.</i><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/736590/extras/ezgif-2-9d0bd6edc3.gif?t=1729459726\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Is this game a tactical shooter?</h2><br>Operation: Harsh Doorstop has strong roots in tactical shooter games such as Project Reality, Squad, and Red Orchestra (including multiple developers from those projects who have also worked on this game) however Operation: Harsh Doorstop has a much stronger emphasis on mod-ability and flexibility (similar to games such as Arma.) Ultimately we encourage everyone to play the game as you'd prefer to play it, and we intend to continue implementing additional parameters that allow players to customize their experience to their own liking.<br><br><i>Assaulting the urban district while playing &quot;Khafji&quot; in Operation: Harsh Doorstop.</i><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/736590/extras/ezgif-2-52c928e420.gif?t=1729459726\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">When will Operation: Harsh Doorstop be finished?</h2><br>As long as the community continues to donate and support our development, Operation: Harsh Doorstop will be continually updated. Moreover, we have built Operation: Harsh Doorstop in such a way that even if development ceases at any point, the community could continue developing it independently through Steam Workshop. The goal is to create a game that lasts forever.<br><br><i>A heavy machine gunner laying down fire in Operation: Harsh Doorstop.</i><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/736590/extras/ezgif-2-4648315ac4.gif?t=1729459726\" /><br><br>Thank you so much for following our project, and we hope to see you on the battlefield soon.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/736590/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729459726","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/736590/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1729459726","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/736590/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729459726","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/736590/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729459726","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/736590/extras/ohdbanner.jpg?t=1729459726\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What is Operation: Harsh Doorstop?</h2><br>Operation: Harsh Doorstop is the ultimate, free to play, tactical sandbox.
