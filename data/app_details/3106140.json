{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Every nook and cranny in Bloom Paradise was once filled with flowers of every color, until one day when pesky pests came and ravaged the land, rendering it unrecognizable. Thus, flower fairies Tamabo and Hanabo have joined forces, setting off on an adventure to restore Bloom Paradise to its former glory and get rid of those irksome pests.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How to Play</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Play as either Tamabo (Player 1) or Hanabo (Player 2) and make flowers bloom. Fill all the grounds in each stage to clear it. How you bloom flowers differs between single-player mode and two-player mode. In single-player mode, flowers bloom on the ground as Tamabo walks across. In two-player mode, however, when either Tamabo or Hanabo walks across the ground, only flower buds appear. The other character must then touch these buds to make them bloom. Work together to take back Bloom Paradise from the pests. Both Tamabo and Hanabo can shoot water in the direction they're facing with the use of the attack button. Flowers can't bloom when the ground is covered in mud, so use water to clean up and eradicate any pests standing in your way.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3106140/extras/controller_xbox.png?t=1736508524\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3106140/extras/controller_keyborad.png?t=1736508524\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u30fb100 total stages <br>\u30fb19 types of bothersome yet likable pests<br>\u30fbSingle-player and two-player coop modes with differing ways to play<br>\u30fbGame design reminiscent of late 80s arcade games</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3106140/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736508524","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3106140/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1736508524","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3106140/e159f4912fb61437d1535ee6c257610b14052437/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736508524","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3106140/e159f4912fb61437d1535ee6c257610b14052437/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736508524","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Every nook and cranny in Bloom Paradise was once filled with flowers of every color, until one day when pesky pests came and ravaged the land, rendering it unrecognizable.
