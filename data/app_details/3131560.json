{"about_the_game":"<strong><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Bo\u00f6tes Easter Egg</h2></strong></strong><br>Bo\u00f6tes includes an easter egg along with its gameplay. It is important to note that completing this Easter Egg will reward the player with an achievement and other rewards in game throughout the progression. It will take a lot of skill to complete this Easter Egg and only the best will figure it out. Good Luck and Happy Hunting!<br><br><strong><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Bo\u00f6tes Storyline</h2></strong></strong><br>In the year 2872, David, who is an astrologist, finds himself in the vast nothingless, known as The Bo\u00f6tes Void. He leaves his family behind to research the mysterious crystals near the planet Loki II, which is located in the heart of The Bo\u00f6tes Void. These crystals seem to provide power to those who collect them. Most importantly, they believe this power could help ships in outer space move even faster. Later the crew of the space station, who are comprised of both researchers and specially trained astronauts, venture out to the dark side of the planet where most of the crystals are located. Most of the crew freeze over and the ones who remain came back to name the location the Cold Dark. After months go by, the crew ends up dying from numerous hazards and going back to the Cold Dark. David is now by himself. He continues to survive on his own for quite sometime but later he decides to put on the space suit and travel to the Cold Dark himself.<br><br><strong><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Bo\u00f6tes Gameplay</h2></strong></strong><br>Your goal is to collect a total of 3 crystals in each location around the planet while jumping on astroids. It is important to note that each level the astroids will rotate faster and faster, making it harder for you, the player, to balance. After you collect all 3 crystals in the location you will be able to travel to another location. Each crystal you collect will give you new abilities/upgrades. For example, you may collect a crystal that gives you super jump. This allows the player to jump higher in space for a short period of time. Once you find this crystal, every location after will provide you with an upgrade to that ability. You can also unlock suits for beating levels, as well as, finding secret astronaut suits in the locations. By collecting these hidden suits on each level, you will be able to unlock master class versions of the other suits in the game. Suits in general, will give the player passive perks. Players can also add a perk to the suit if they collect them from the dream world. The dream world may look like a mini game, but it is crucial for many parts of the game. It can be accessed in your base and all the player must do is sleep. Once you are dreaming, you will be able to play a unique spin on the jumping formula. If you get far enough, you can collect green cubes that will give you access to new perks for your suits. Your main objective is to visit the Cold Dark and collect the final crystals to escape. However, there may be other secrets hidden away.<br><br><strong><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Bo\u00f6tes One-Shot Mode</h2></strong></strong><br>This mode is made for those who are looking for the ultimate challenge.
