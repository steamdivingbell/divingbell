{"about_the_game":"You find yourself catapulted back in time to the beginning of existence, and into the darkness where everything began. The overarching narrative that ties visuals and sounds together leans on the stories of creationism and the big-bang theory. The Universe is yet to be born from a glimmer of light. You are called to discover and co-create a new existence with the help of colours and sound.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsing rhythm-based decisions and completing colour-based objectives, you experience the beginning of life and compose your technicolour universe. As creation unfolds and evolves before your eyes, and the rhythmic soundtrack intensifies, you will find yourself in a meditative state of flow, reconnecting you with your own spirit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIlluminary is set over 10 stages each representing a different part of existence that are thematically different from each other. We have a good idea of where it all began, and where we are right now, but do we know where it will end? The visuals and game world can change multiple times within each stage depending on your choices, culminating in a kaleidoscopic landscape of colour and leaving you in a contemplative state of mind about what you just experienced.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/648950/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1722827334","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/648950/page.bg.jpg?t=1722827334","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/648950/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1722827334","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/648950/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1722827334","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"You find yourself catapulted back in time to the beginning of existence, and into the darkness where everything began.
