{"about_the_game":"<strong>\u201cSex, drugs, and leveling up!\u201d</strong><br><i>Victim Cache: The RPG </i>is a parody of popular Japanese role playing games from the 1980s and 1990s, such as Final Fantasy I-VI and Dragon Warrior I-IV. Although the game play, story, and graphical style mimic RPGs of that era, <i>Victim Cache: The RPG</i> features mature humor, themes, and language.<br><br>The gameplay is modeled after classic JRPGs. Players can move their characters  up, down, left, or right on a  top down 2D map to explore the  8-bit towns, dungeons,  and overworld. Along the way, players must talk to archetypal non-player characters to advance the quest lines. Battles are fought from a side view perspective in which the player can choose to attack, cast a spell, execute a special attack, use an item, or later in the game summon additional allies to help. Battles are won when all enemies hit points have reached zero.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1115970/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1581539141","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1115970/page.bg.jpg?t=1581539141","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1115970/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1581539141","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1115970/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1581539141","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"This game contains Strong Language, Crude Humor, Mature Humor, Use of Drugs, Use of Alcohol, Drug and Alcohol Abuse, Sexual Themes, Sexual Content.
