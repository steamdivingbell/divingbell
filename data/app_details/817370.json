{"about_the_game":"I did not see a marching simulator on the market, so I made one!  This is a 2D, sprite based marching simulator.  It is intended to give the user what it would feel like to march a military formation, as well as see how well they can do!  You will give commands by keyboard or mouse to a flight of 12.  These 12 must execute 10 commands from a list of 27 within a 70 ft by 70 ft area.  Your score depends on how fast your flight can execute your commands, and how well you stay in your are.  Do you have what it takes?  This is a constant work in progress so any feedback is appreciated.","achievements":{"total":0},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/817370/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1535378161","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/817370/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1535378161","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/817370/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1535378161","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/817370/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1535378161","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"I did not see a marching simulator on the market, so I made one!
