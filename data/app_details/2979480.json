{"about_the_game":"The synthwave musical journey from Masters of Light, composed by Waveshaper &amp; Paul Zimmermann. The album features the cinematic music that depicts the dramatic and emotional key moments on your way to the black hole, as well as the combat music, powerful and motivational tracks that keeps you engaged during the fight.<br><br><i>&quot; It takes me back to 2015 when I composed the boss music for the game Furi. The music gradually evolves in intensity based on the players ability to progress in the cosmic combat levels. It evokes an empowerment and motivational feeling that keeps you engaged during the fight. The synth palette for the game features classic Waveshapers signature synth sounds as well as female choirs piano and strings.&quot;</i><br>Waveshaper <br><br><i>&quot;As the players discover the story of the separated sisters and learn more about the evil shadows the music ranges from very ambient to quite dramatic and emotional moments. Early on we decided that we wanted to feature vocal elements throughout, to represent the stars. The synth sounds range from soft bell-like to full blown distorted leads. Organic textures like solo strings, piano and soft woodwinds represent the stars and their home, while the sounds get more and more mangled as players approach the black hole.&quot;</i><br>Paul Zimmermann <br><br>Some of the tracks on the album includes variations and slight changes from the in-game music.<br>23 tracks. 58 mn.
