Play as the sword-obsessed knight Percy as he sets out to find the best, shiniest swords out there with the help of his trusty squire, Penelope. On the way, he'll explore colorful locales, meet a cast of charming characters, and fight his way through a whole goblin invasion!<br><br>In taking the role of a knight, you will have to master the ability to fight with different weapons against a variety of foes. Don't get too comfortable with any one blade! Even the finest weapon is prone to wear and might shatter at the most inopportune moment. Use whatever swords you can find and be on the lookout for rare swords with awesome special powers. By playing to your weapons' strengths and cleverly using their abilities, you'll be able to tackle anything the goblins throw at you. You might even survive a fight against the fearsome Goblin King himself!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1357710/extras/Gamefeatures.png?t=1670243648\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fun, cartoony visuals<br></li><li>A simple, yet robust, combat system<br></li><li>Quirky characters to encounter<br></li><li>A variety of unique special abilities<br></li><li>Small swords<br></li><li>Big swords<br></li><li>Rainbow swords<br></li><li>Chicken swords<br></li><li>Swordfish swords<br></li><li>And more swords!</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1357710/extras/Aboutdevelopment.png?t=1670243648\" /><br><br>This game was developed as a student project at DigiPen Institute of Technology and was created for educational purposes only.
