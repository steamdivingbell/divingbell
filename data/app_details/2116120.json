Vietnam rebuilds and prospers over the next few decades, especially through arms exports, thanks to significant Soviet support. However, the Soviet Union's collapse in 1990 leaves Vietnam vulnerable. Western economic infiltration and cultural transformation begins to shift Vietnam's geopolitical landscape. By 2013, China's interest in Vietnam intensified, resulting in the formation of a China backed Vietnam Communist Union Party. A front for a private military organization designed to sabotage Western influences. Over the next 2 years, covert and black-ops conflict between the US and China lead to Vietnam's societal collapse. International intervention started in 2015, but degraded over the next 3 years into conflict involving various PMCs and militias, driven more by profit and opportunism than by governmental allegiances, set against the backdrop of a once-prosperous country now engulfed in lawlessness and war.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2116120/extras/Looting.gif?t=1738658784\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Incursion Red River lets you play with up to three of your friends.
