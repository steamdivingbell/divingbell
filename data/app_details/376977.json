{"about_the_game":"The titan of Electro-Motive\u2019s landmark \u201cDash 2\u201d line of diesels \u2013 the 3,600-horsepower, six-axle, 20-cylinder SD45-2 \u2013is ready for Train Simulator service in famed Santa Fe livery.<br><br>Created by DTM (Digital Train Model), the Train Simulator EMD SD45-2 faithfully re-creates the husky locomotive that was introduced in 1972. Powered by EMD\u2019s unique 20-cylincer 645-series diesel powerplant, the SD45-2 was a refinement of the SD45 that had been introduced in 1966. As compared to its predecessor, the SD45-2 featured the improved electronics of the Dash-2 line and addressed the main-bearing and crankshaft problems that had plagued the big 20-cylinder powerplant in the SD45. At 70-feet, 8-inches long, the SD45-2 was nearly five feet longer than the SD45, which allowed EMD to utilize vertically mounted radiators on the Dash-2 rather than the SD45\u2019s trademark flared radiators. <br><br>Far-and-away the largest fleet of standard SD45-2s belonged to the Santa Fe Railway, which purchased 90 of the potent units for priority main line duty. In the mid-1980s, most of Santa Fe\u2019s SD45-2s were put through a rebuilding program at the railroad\u2019s San Bernardino (California) Shops. While most were rebuilt largely in-kind, eight units were rebuilt as cab-less \u201cbooster\u201d units. Most of the remanufactured SD45-2s continued on to serve Santa Fe successor BNSF and some remained in service on BNSF into 2014.<br><br>You can now put the SD45-2 \u2013 in stylish Santa Fe \u201cyellow bonnet\u201d livery \u2013 to work. DTM\u2019s SD45-2 is an authentic and highly realistic re-creation of the big diesel, and the pack not only includes the standard SD45-2 as constructed by EMD for the Santa Fe, but also two versions of the San Bernardino Shops remanufactured cab-less \u201cB\u201d units. The Santa Fe (AT&amp;SF) SD45-2 DLC includes a superb selection of freight rolling stock, including AT&amp;SF\u2019s iconic CE-1 class steel cupola caboose; two versions of 50-foot boxcars; flatcars with multiple loads; and a 3-bay offset-side open-top hopper. And the pack also includes four career scenarios putting the SD45-2 to work on the Train Simulator Cajon Pass route.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2>The pack includes four career scenarios for the Train Simulator Cajon Pass route (route available separately). <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Raining Over Cajon Pass<br></li><li>A Short Train<br></li><li>Coal To Barstow<br></li><li>Collecting Goods</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
