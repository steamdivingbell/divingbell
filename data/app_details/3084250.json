{"about_the_game":"<i>Today we passed the point of no return.  We no longer have enough water to<br>back out of the desert.  The only way open to us is forward: through the<br>desert, to the Burning King.  To victory, or to death.</i><br><br><i>The strain of this journey is taking its toll on Nina.  No wonder \u2014 this is<br>her first desert crossing.  I was born in the desert, but Nina was born in a<br>city, in some land unimaginably far away.  She never held a sword before I<br>summoned her to this world.  She never rode a horse.  She never slept under<br>the open sky.  The latter, she still doesn't do.  Every evening, she vanishes<br>before my eyes, and every morning she reappears, guided by the ancient magic<br>that I have released.  And every night I spend in fear, alone, worried that<br>she won't come back.</i><br><br><i>Because I can't do this alone.  I know how to use a sword, but I am no<br>warrior.  No hero.  Not like Nina.  I have seen Nina fight, and I know that I<br>cannot match her, despite my greater experience.  She has the instincts of an<br>adventurer.  Where I like to retreat into by books, she goes out to face the<br>world.  When I look at her, I see the face of the hero destined to defeat the<br>Burning King.</i><br><br><i>The heat is not just draining our bodies, but our spirits.  I feel hot and<br>tired and irritable.  I can only imagine how much worse this is for Nina, who<br>is not used to the desert.  I can only imagine, because we rarely talk anymore.<br>The heat makes speaking painful.  I wish I could tell Nina how much she means<br>to me, how much I appreciate her taking this journey with me, but nothing comes<br>out when I open my mouth.</i><br><br><i>Soon we will reach the great oasis of Daklath.  There we will replenish our<br>waterskins, and hopefully our spirits.  The way through the desert is long,<br>but we have already made it this far.  We will just have to keep going.  To<br>victory, or to death.</i><br><br>Platforming action and adventure game puzzles.  Seven chapters.  Lots of sidequests.  More secrets than you will ever find.<br><br>This demo is contains the full first chapter of the game.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3084250?t=1721936823","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3084250?t=1721936823","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3084250/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1721936823","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3084250/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1721936823","categories":[{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<i>Today we passed the point of no return.
