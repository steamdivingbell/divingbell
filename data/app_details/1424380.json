{"about_the_game":"Bunker Down is a bomb-survival genre game set in an apocalyptic city. The city is being overrun with aliens and you have to make your way to the bunker deep underground.

Collect coins and try to delve as deep into the earth as possible.<br />\r\n(If you have an extra controller, try this mode in 2-player pvp mode)<br />\r\nSave The Puppy mode is similar to Survival Mode, but you have to protect a puppy all the way down to the bunker.<br />\r\nIn Rescue Mode, you will find citizens on land or trapped in caves. Escort as many citizens as you can to the bunker below.<br />\r\nStory Mode currently includes 1 short chapter, but I am planning on slowly releasing more if there is enough interest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI also plan on doing updates to add more bombs, upgrades, cosmetics, and game modes for no additional charge.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1424380/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1624662484","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1424380/page.bg.jpg?t=1624662484","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1424380/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1624662484","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1424380/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1624662484","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Bunker Down is a bomb-survival genre game set in an apocalyptic city.
