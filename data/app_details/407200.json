A promising career in military engineering with the STEAL teams  (Special TEchnologies And Logistics) was cut short when the officers' quarters she built under enemy fire turned out to be lacking in toilets (and the local diet was laxative-rich).

It\u2019s tough and unforgiving, but it\u2019s also fair. Despite all the deaths I spent climbing through the dungeon\u2019s floors, I slowly mastered the game.
