Solid thumbs up from me.\u201d<br>Prof.Vaharrak<br><br>\u201cThis is a basic course in tactics. And it is very well made. Taken together, the series is like having a nice little tactics library at your fingertips. The examples are very well chosen to be instructive. I got the first one in the series and immediately had to get all six. I hope they make more. I'd love to have them do a positional coursebook.\u201d<br>yvessabo<br><br>\u201cGreat game for anyone who wants to improve their chess tactics.
