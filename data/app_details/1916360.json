Combining the fun of traditional boots on the ground shooters with an innovative climbing locomotion system.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ADVANCED MOVEMENT TECHNICES </h2>Project Impulse was built from the ground up to reward players who master the movement. We encourage players to gain momentum and preserve it though techniques such as bunny hoping, sliding and surfing slanted slopes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PHYSICS BASED INTERACTIONS </h2>Everything you do in Project Impulse is based on physics!
