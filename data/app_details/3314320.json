ImmoRally features <strong>online Leaderboards</strong> for hotlaps and multi-lap-average times, <strong>ghost cars</strong> for personal best and absolute best laps, a <strong>track-editor</strong> and <strong>user generated tracks</strong> in-app as well as <strong>controller support</strong> and custom control schemes. The game's focus is on <strong>satisfying driving and sliding physics</strong>, tyre-heat simulation adds a strategic element to the gameplay. A brilliant  soundtrack by <i>Lella 208</i> (\u2764\ufe0f) completes the hypnotic atmosphere of ImmoRally.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">ImmoRally was a personal passion project that made it to release against all odds.

To complete a lap you have to have cleared all checkpoints and then race back to the start finish point. Only valid laps (all checkpoints cleared) will be timed and counted towards your highscores and average laptime. There is no predefined order for collecting checkpoints, so finding the optimal route for a track is part of the fun.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3314320/extras/checkpoint_explain_01.png?t=1739996004\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3314320/extras/checkpoint_explain_02.png?t=1739996004\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Leaderboard and timing</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Worldwide leaderboards for every track that record hotlap scores (best laptime for one individual lap). There are also boards for tier-scores (accumulated average laptimes over 5, 10, 20, 40 ... laps). There's no limit to how many laps you can complete and set a tiered score for. Set the best time over 320 laps to secure a spot in the Tier-320 leaderboard forever!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Track Editor and user generated tracks</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There's an easy-to-use in-app track editor. Build and publish tracks, and enjoy a growing library of user-generated tracks in the game. You can search and filter by track name and creator name in the track selector.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tire-Heat and sliding mechanics</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">ImmoRally simulates tire temperatures at both the surface and carcass levels. Drive recklessly, and carcass tire temperature will rise. Tires have an optimal temperature window where they provide the best grip. If temperatures fall outside this range, your car will slide more, compromising your lap times. To climb the leaderboards, you'll need to manage your tire temperatures strategically.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3314320/extras/tire_explain.png?t=1739996004\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ghost cars</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If you're passionate about competition and leaderboards, this feature is for you. There are ghost car options that replay your best lap of the session, your all-time best lap, and the fastest lap ever recorded by any player. Ghost cars are available on all tracks.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3314320?t=1739996004","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3314320/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1739996004","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3314320/f621ce1bbd226a78d6b3eb4e512f6ece5b4a17a1/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739996004","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3314320/f621ce1bbd226a78d6b3eb4e512f6ece5b4a17a1/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739996004","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3314320/extras/IR_logo.png?t=1739996004\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About the Game</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">ImmoRally is a <strong>retro-arcade 2d top down racing game</strong>.
