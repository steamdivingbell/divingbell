I commissioned artists to create a fantasy world, and hide as many pigeons and bread as they could inside it. Now it\u2019s your job to find them all! With 15 art pieces to choose from, and 1500+ hidden objects, you will have a lot of searching to do.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Controls:</h2>Use your mouse to move around the image and zoom in / out. When you find a hidden object, click it and it will disappear. You can also use WASD to move and the arrow keys to zoom.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Difficulty:</h2>A full range of difficulty is included, but all levels start unlocked, your progress is saved as you play, and you can use hints if you get stuck.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get immersed:</h2>Each painting has its own music and ambiance to help you connect with the world, as you search for everything.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Replayable</h2>You can restore a small number of hidden objects back into a painting so you can find them again! It\u2019s much harder when there are only a few hidden objects left (especially randomly). You can also use up to 3 save slots so you can replay without progress loss. Alternatively, you can reset your progress for the entire game if you\u2019d like to start over.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Perfect","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2435590/3100bb3e4b6f3c2860cd3ab1b16be23f585b1daa.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Post Paper Party","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2435590/475e9c0de7d2b5c2f7742c1132e5010f285ab3d7.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Curious Cat Companion","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2435590/cb69ae1c33b12eec328ca65bd43f719a7677e0b0.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Green Grocer's Corner","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2435590/35c8797494b4255eaf01ed46545074ef8aaa4a7e.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Little Rooftop Garden","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2435590/a3057d8dc55920d7b735f5936fda0cb129c02668.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Japan Spring Steps","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2435590/35f2e66fc7bb79e0ede67ce55c07f6c4da1a7881.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Playing In The Park","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2435590/9e4e596e4285a55d0fb13a6b5692ba1feb5adffa.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Playroom","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2435590/b616d928d4a50de7ac3ff21812c0862e7326344a.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Rocking On","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2435590/05b577bfc988e83defb6a104d546cc5a869dcf42.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Plants And Paws","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2435590/434fd7cb29fdd3821e30111f8981a0fea1911b8f.jpg"}],"total":16},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2435590/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714856469","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2435590/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1714856469","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2435590/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714856469","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2435590/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714856469","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>You might also like</h1><p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>A hidden object game where you must find all the pigeons and bread to complete each level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2>\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f 15 Unique artworks<br>\u2753 1500+ Hidden objects total<br>\ud83d\udc26 750+ Pigeons<br> \ud83c\udf5e 750+ Bread<br>\ud83d\udca1 \u221e Unlimited hints if you get stuck<br>\u267b\ufe0f Restore a small number of hidden objects to a painting so you can find them again!<br>\ud83c\udfb5 Music and ambiance for each artwork<br>\u2328\ufe0f Use your keyboard to move/zoom in if you have no scroll wheel<br>\ud83d\udcbe 3x save slots<br>\ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f Reset progress entirely and play again<br>\ud83d\udd52 Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Context:</h2>The brief was simple.
