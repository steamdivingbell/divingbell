{"about_the_game":"With this skin pack, you can unlock five additional skins that will take your creations to the next level: Gooey, High Tech, Scales, Non-Slip and Rivets. It is still possible to change the color of blocks that have these skins equipped - so you can get the slimy gooey skin the color you want, or the change the scales on your dragon build, for instance.<br><br>The skins can be applied to the following blocks: Block 1x2, Block 1x3, Block 1x4, Block 2x4, Block 2x2x2, Block 4x8, Cylinder 1x1x2, Shield Plates, all the blocks in the Aerodynamic Category as well as all Hull Blocks.<br><br>Please note that these skins are only cosmetic in nature, and do not alter the physical properties of blocks in the game. Players who do not own the Skin Pack cannot edit vehicles that use these skins without purchasing the Skin Pack for themselves, but will still be able to drive vehicles with these skins equipped if spawned in by a player who owns the Skin Pack. <br><br>In addition to making your builds pop, buying the Skin Pack also supports the continued development of Trailmakers and future games from Flashbulb Games.
