{"about_the_game":"The Marder 2 was an experimental German IFV, developed in the late 1980s to replace the aging Marder IFV. It featured more armor, a new turret and a brand-new Rheinmetall dual-caliber autocannon that could fire both 35mm and 50mm rounds. Despite its qualities, the vehicle was never accepted in service due to its high cost and because it was no longer needed because of the fall of the Soviet Union. A single surviving prototype can be found today in the Koblenz military collection.<br />\r\nIn Armored Warfare, the Marder 2 is a Tier 8 Armored Fighting Vehicle. With its 44 tons, it\u2019s one of the heaviest and toughest AFVs around. Unlike many other AFVs of its Tier, it is not armed with guided missiles, relying instead on its extremely powerful 50mm autocannon. It also features special black camouflage.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/825710/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1688640060","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/825710/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1688640060","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/825710/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1688640060","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/825710/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1688640060","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Turn Notifications","id":32}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Marder 2 was an experimental German IFV, developed in the late 1980s to replace the aging Marder IFV.
