At each turn, you determine whether or not you want to draw additional cards. Drawing additional cards increases your score, and grants your purchase points which you can convert into various boosters or special powers, which in turn increases further your score or grants you immunity to bust. The downside is that each card played increases your chances to go bust, ending immediately the game and reverting your score to zero.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">...and infused with roguelite elements...</h2>You win a round of the game by either burning through your entire deck of action cards (in which case you gain an additional bonus), or by deciding to stop drawing additional cards while having reached a minimum effects level. <br>During each round, you get the opportunity to unlock and complete challenges, which are either predetermined or randomly determined, depending upon the round you are in and the progress you have made so far.<br>Completing challenges is allowing you to increase your score, to receive additional action cards for the next round and to unlock new powers and boosters which will become active during the next round.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">...so that each and every round becomes more challenging....</h2>Because the number of cards in your deck increases round after round, burning through the whole deck becomes increasingly difficult, and mitigating the consequences of your actions require further strategic planning, under the form of judicious selection of the powers and boosters you choose to acquire. <br>As you progress through the rounds, the sequence in which you play the cards, and which cards you choose to retain or discard when constituting your deck for the next round will become paramount, as these choices will weigh on your ability to trigger combos, hence to receive additional bonuses.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">...and every game you play is unique</h2>The conjunction of randomness in the hands you are dealt with, a vast  choice of powers and boosters you can use in order to mitigate the side effects of the cards you play, and the variety of the tactics you can use to form powerful and game changing card combinations allows to provide a unique experience with each and every game you play.<br><br><img
