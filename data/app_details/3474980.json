{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Blobbert 64 is a 3D platformer set in the world of Blobbert's Bouncy Breakout. Progress through a variety of worlds meeting colourful characters in order to stop the evil Araka Monoi from progressing with his plans of destroying the world! You play as Blobbert Blunger Monoi, a lab experiment made by Araka Monoi and the scientists he keeps captive. Your goal is to escape Monoi Laboratories and find the person who saved you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You'll progress through many worlds throughout this game and maybe even new realities with your pal: Tutorialbert! He'll occasionally help you through the world and may even tag along at certain points.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Blobbert, while having his traditional Hammer Whirl Attack, Hammer Throw Attack and Hammer High Jump move, is not the only character you can play as! You can play as many of Blobbert's friends (and even some of his enemies). Each of these characters can play through the same campaign as Blobbert, but with their own unique movesets and, depending on the character, some alternate bossfight.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If you wish to explore more of Blobbert's world, you can play some of the bonus content! Including more bossfights and levels, you can explore more than just the main campaign has to offer.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">During certain seasons, you can play the different events! During these events, you can snag new characters and bossfights. Halloween even has a seasonal theme, turning all the levels into nighttime versions! (these events can be purchased in the in-game store with &quot;CDs&quot;, a currency that can only be obtained through playing the game)</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">So what are you waiting for? Hop into Blobbert's world and help him stop the evil Araka Monoi and save the world!! And maybe, even stop a bigger threat looming in the shadows...</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3474980/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738316720","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3474980/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1738316720","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3474980/532da15f5f6ed49a9eca0808d89b81ab6d0e8947/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738316720","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3474980/532da15f5f6ed49a9eca0808d89b81ab6d0e8947/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738316720","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3475090,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Blobbert 64 is a 3D platformer set in the world of Blobbert's Bouncy Breakout.
