{"about_the_game":"Onslaught on the Solar Frontier is top-down shooter roguelite.  It is designed to test your skill and strategy as you fight to conquer a deep-space starport.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe action centers around taking cover and dodging enemy attacks.  Not every bullet can be evaded, but a skillful player will use these advantages to survive until the later levels of the game, when they will be powerful enough to stare down the enemy without flinching.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe strategy of the game is about planning which levels you will enter and what abilities you will acquire.  Microchips that enhance your character can be found on every level and you will always have a choice regarding which chips you take.  Microchips are randomly distributed to keep the game exciting, but the player will have enough control to plan a powerful build.  Microchip abilities often come with tradeoffs, so players will have to think carefully about what items to take.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSurvive 15 levels and defeat the final boss to conquer the Solar Frontier!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2940630/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728674526","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2940630/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1728674526","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2940630/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728674526","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2940630/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728674526","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Onslaught on the Solar Frontier is top-down shooter roguelite.
