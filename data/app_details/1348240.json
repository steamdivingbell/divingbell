{"about_the_game":"Snow Trail is a puzzle game where your main objective is to cross a lake which only has one path through it known as &quot;Snow Trail&quot;. In order to pass through the trail you must solve a varying degree of puzzles that may contain some not so normal elements. Slime, Knights, Tiny Castles and many other roadblocks stand in your way to cross the lake and walk through the Snow Trail.  <br><br>                                                                               <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1348240/extras/TitlesMenu.png?t=1594429227\" /><br><br>The game revolves around the ability to push snow blocks. Snow blocks can connect to one and other and when connected can be pushed as a unit. Snow blocks can be pushed into water in order to make bridges that can be used to complete each level. Other mechanics affect the snow blocks such as rocks that can be used to break apart snow blocks from each other or slime which will push away any snow blocks that are beside it. Snow Trail has 100 levels, each with it's own tricks that will stump you as you make your way through the trail.  <br>                                                                                <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1348240/extras/slimeAndPlayer.png?t=1594429227\" /><br><br>The game was created by a single developer from Canada.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Slimes?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1348240/a7664d1265c74feceb6471225226f05c83a13e67.jpg"},{"name":"Maybe they're nice?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1348240/a293f7eae829ee25d7871cf834cadee17fc257fe.jpg"},{"name":"Is anyone home?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1348240/69432419393ce5eb848f8b0817d2c7518f8e87b8.jpg"},{"name":"Were they always purple?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1348240/e97124aa4e86afc10fcf21965c0bc1a6ae429844.jpg"},{"name":"Halfway there...","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1348240/312ce8f03d810371877e37a9338d678dfc376928.jpg"},{"name":"Finish the Snow Trail","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1348240/2f1cb266c5033ea5e19ade8f2b2c7723d93cacfa.jpg"},{"name":"Magic x Trick","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1348240/0b34ff84ae01a189a98fefd27fc7654dc0515879.jpg"},{"name":"But there is only one?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1348240/5b0716f7070e4aa5cd2a4b5056f054a956511e29.jpg"},{"name":"That does not look healthy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1348240/74424ae7b4677c3ff819a2fd9484e8941301f36c.jpg"},{"name":"Where does this go?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1348240/8dbc688d8a2c664c5637bc10c345c09cd0a8f0b3.jpg"}],"total":11},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1348240/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1594429227","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1348240/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1594429227","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1348240/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1594429227","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1348240/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1594429227","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Snow Trail is a puzzle game where your main objective is to cross a lake which only has one path through it known as &quot;Snow Trail&quot;.
