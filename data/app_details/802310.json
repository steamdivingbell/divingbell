The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally as follows: players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table, and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once. A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. Play is fast and demands quick reactions. Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent's options, giving the hitter a great advantage.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Notes for Tracker Users</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If you are a user using Tracker, pay attention to this article.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The basic settings in PingPong Kings VR are two controllers, the left controller means a ball for a serve, and the right controller means a racket.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If you want to use the tracker that is attached to the racket, turn off one of the controllers and then connect the tracker.
