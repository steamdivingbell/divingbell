Would definitely recommend the full game!&quot; - Jacc </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">&quot;Nice demo introducing the basic concept. Worth upgrading, the full game's puzzle get quite a bit more challenging.&quot; - Nandos </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">&quot;Great, elegantly designed puzzles which are pleasantly challenging, with charming presentation.&quot; - AP </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">&quot;Was surprised by how nice the atmosphere is in this with its ambience and art style. Very nice puzzle game.&quot; - Adam </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">&quot;Fun and engaging puzzle game that introduces you to the mechanics found in the full game!&quot; - Saga </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">&quot;The gameplay is challenging and super satisfying.
