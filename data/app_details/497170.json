Their Regenerate skill makes them very, very difficult to kill\u2026 It\u2019s also a versatile team, with heavy hitting Mummies able to wade in and support the faster but weaker Ghouls and Wights.

Freed from 'boring' mortal restrictions like sleep, thirst or hunger, the Wights can spend all their spare time in training. Thanks to their Block skills and their good agility, the Wights are central players for the Undead teams.
