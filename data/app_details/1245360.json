{"about_the_game":"This game demands both logic and strategy. The objective is to construct solid layers of cubes without any gaps, utilizing provided figures of specific shapes. Players earn points for each completed layer, which is then removed from the matrix. The game aids in developing 3D spatial orientation skills and might prove challenging for players who naturally lack this ability. Although the game accelerates slightly with each completed layer, players can also set their preferred game speed via the options. I find playing it both satisfying and relaxing. I hope you do too.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1245360?t=1698234607","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1245360?t=1698234607","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1245360/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1698234607","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1245360/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1698234607","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This game demands both logic and strategy.
