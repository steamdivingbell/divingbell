{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Collect various androids known as &quot;Pvas&quot; on the futuristic colony planet named &quot;Solaria&quot;, deploy them for battles, construction, farming, crafting; pilot your own mobile base to explore the vast world. This is a brand-new, single player open-world survival and crafting game. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Background Story</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Solaria is a human colony planet that relies heavily on artificial intelligence. It was once one of the most glorious early human colonies. The population was once stably controlled at 20,000 people, and each resident owned thousands or even tens of thousands of square kilometers of territory. The vast territory is managed by tens of thousands of Pvas(Personal Versatile Assistant), and the Solarians live a luxurious life like royal nobles. With the advancement of medical technology, the life expectancy of Solarians is getting longer and longer, reaching hundreds of years. During their long life, Solarians are obsessed with the research of androids and have created countless Pvas with different styles and functions. These Pvas allow Solarians to break through all moral and legal taboos and realize their most private and wildest desires. Solaria is like a shining pearl in the universe, and it was once the dream home of everyone. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">However, beneath this seemingly perfect world, seeds of decline were quietly sown. As dependence on Pvas deepened, warmth and connection between humans gradually faded, until socializing became taboo, the birthrate dropped to zero, the population continued to decline, and even in the eyes of the outsiders, this planet has become a cold mechanical world. Today, there is no way to know the number of residents in Solaria. Maybe there are only dozens, maybe only a few, or maybe only you, the last watcher of Solaria. But what does it matter? You are accompanied by hundreds of thousands of Pvas, many of which are your own creations. These Pvas have different shapes and functions. They are not only assistants in life, but also emotional sustenance. The good days seem to continue, until one day you wake up and find that all the Pvas have malfunctioned. Is this a betrayal of technology or a conspiracy of outsiders? You must survive alone in this familiar yet strange land, repair your Pvas, rebuild infrastructure, explore unknown areas, and gradually uncover the truth of the incident. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Survival</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As a Solarian who is used to a luxurious life, it is not easy to survive on your own, so capture some Pvas as soon as possible to help you. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Pvas</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your Pvas are all broken! Fortunately, you can use electromagnetic pulse grenades to temporarily shut them down, then restore them to factory settings and finally regain control of them. You can also use the materials and technologies you have collected to customize your Pvas to make your life more convenient and comfortable. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mobile Base</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your territory is too big! You can build a temporary mobile base on a small flatbed at any time, and take you and your Pvas around to experience unprecedented adventures and fun. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Buildings and Theme Parks</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When you decide to build a new home from scratch, Solaria's superb construction technology will provide you with unlimited possibilities. From the selection of basic building modules to the careful matching of furniture decorations, every detail can show your unique taste and creativity. What's more interesting is that you can also use Pvas as &quot;hosts&quot; to build theme parks full of joy and fantasy in your territory.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3130880/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735825311","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3130880/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1735825311","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3130880/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735825311","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3130880/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735825311","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: General Mature Content"},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Collect various androids known as &quot;Pvas&quot; on the futuristic colony planet named &quot;Solaria&quot;, deploy them for battles, construction, farming, crafting; pilot your own mobile base to explore the vast world.
