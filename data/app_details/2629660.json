{"about_the_game":"Join the Kitchen Crew as they make different meals from around the world! In this arcade game, fire away at the pegs on screen to be able to clear out the red plus pegs, and advance to different levels! Race to get the fastest time and brag to your friends!<br />\r\nShoot shots clearing some or all the pegs on screen. As you progress unlock access to more Appliances (and eventually other Kitchen Crew members) to give you different types of power ups for your shots. Power ups unlocked by clearing Frowny/Smiley faced blue pegs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nReveal different meals made by the Kitchen Crew with:<br />\r\n- 21 Levels!  + Make 7 Levels of your own!<br />\r\n- Custom Level editor!<br />\r\n- 3 Kitchen Appliances!<br />\r\n- Up to 3 Stars awarded for beating each level!<br />\r\n!(Intend to increase all the above as we continue to develop through Early Access)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou get to shoot balls from the top of a screen down into arrays of pegs. The balls clear pegs that they hit after the ball is gone. If you clear all the red plus pegs before you are out of pegs you beat the level and can advance on to another level! If you don't clear all the red plus pegs, you'll need to retry the level until you have cleared the red plus pegs from that level. By hitting enough pegs to get 700 points you'll early an extra ball back, and you can earn a ball back by having the last shot ball go into the Ball Pot at the bottom of the level.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"First Star!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2629660/840fed7a57a403435641393a0142952fb99577cd.jpg"},{"name":"The Ball go BOOM!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2629660/f441ea88ec760e5de845fb5d750275f39c53c286.jpg"},{"name":"Triple Threat!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2629660/5b984a99f7ec4730be7062d78dd050d149a5de03.jpg"}],"total":3},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2629660/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736826905","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2629660/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1736826905","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2629660/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736826905","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2629660/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736826905","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Join the Kitchen Crew as they make different meals from around the world!
