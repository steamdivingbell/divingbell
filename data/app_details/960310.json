{"about_the_game":"CrossCode is all about how it plays! That's why there is a free Steam demo! Go give it a try! Take the best out of two popular genres, find a good balance between them and make a great game. That\u2019s what CrossCode does. You get the puzzles of Zelda-esque dungeons and are rewarded with the great variety of equipment you know and love from RPGs. During the fast-paced battles you will use the tools you find on your journey to reveal and exploit the enemies' weaknesses and at the same time will be able to choose equipment and skills for a more in-depth approach in fighting your enemies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis downloadable content is a cosmetic change for the protagonist of the game, Lea. It offers no specific benefits besides looking rather cool. It has been a reward for Indiegogo backers and is now also available for purchase.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/960310/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1544711980","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/960310/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1544711980","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/960310/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1544711980","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/960310/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1544711980","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"CrossCode is all about how it plays!
