{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Upon waking up, you find that your wife has mysteriously disappeared, and thus embark on a journey to find her. As the last descendant of a Taoist family, you use tracking spells to teleport to the last known location of your wife, only to unexpectedly find yourself in the &quot;Underworld,&quot; a realm familiar to many from traditional Chinese ghost and deity stories. Along the way, you will battle wandering ghosts, search for traces of your wife in the ghost city, converse with local deities to learn about the customs and culture, continuously learn new combat skills, collect items to strengthen yourself to defeat more powerful enemies. Meet mythical figures, ask the King of Hell for the Book of Life and Death, have Zhong Kui arbitrate right and wrong, and ultimately find your wife and uncover the truth behind the entire incident. Depending on the choices you make, the game may lead to different endings.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Main gameplay elements:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Exploration: Players take on the role of a Taoist, searching for his missing wife in the underworld, traversing seven distinct regions of the afterlife.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Combat: Use a peachwood sword for close combat, or use thunder, frost, and flame talismans for ranged attacks to battle monsters.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Parkour: Players can use multi-jump, dash, and decoy talismans, among other parkour skills, to move quickly and explore the map.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Collection: Collect a variety of items on the map to trade with NPCs or to enhance character abilities.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Puzzle-solving: Gather information through conversations with NPCs or by collecting story items to understand the details of the plot, gradually uncovering the truth behind the entire event.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3137070?t=1729690945","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3137070/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1729690945","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3137070/acc902f211d81a51a076593163fa288934308706/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729690945","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3137070/acc902f211d81a51a076593163fa288934308706/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729690945","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Upon waking up, you find that your wife has mysteriously disappeared, and thus embark on a journey to find her.
