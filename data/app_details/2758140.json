{"about_the_game":"Take charge of a sky pirate crew and soar across the skies!<br><br>The war-torn land of Sazdemir is home to many powerful magics birthed from the enigmatic Terodythium crystals, which keep aloft the sky-islands that adorn the vast cloudscape. Witness the war between the Kingdom of Vantheris and the Liraz Empire while on a journey to rescue your captain from capture.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Legends of old, with modern ideas!</h2>Inspired by iconic tactical RPGs, Crystal Horizons provides authentic speed-based tactics gameplay with new features that add an extra layer of depth to team building and combat. Carefully designed to modernize the gameplay experience without streamlining away complexity. Experience tactical combat optimized for player interaction.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A wide array of complex classes!</h2>Build your crew from a large variety of fantasy classes, ranging from the light-wielding Lumimancer to the cunning Thief. Each class possesses unique mechanics and 10 ranks of mastery to grow and unlock new abilities. Units can change class freely at any time, and unlock even more classes through mastery!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Manipulate the battlefield to execute your perfect strategy!</h2>Your actions do more than just affect your foes. Set grass alight, freeze rivers to create new paths, and strike the same area with different elements to create powerful Elemental Reactions that can turn the tide of battle! Master the relationships between the elements to dominate the battlefield with the unmatched power of Compound Reactions!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A world of information at your fingertips!</h2>The Glossary is always just a button away, giving you unlimited access to detailed information on nearly everything in the game.
