It\u2019s a little easier in a list:<br>All characters in An Aspie Life are black outlines. By doing this, players can\u2019t read body language. Just like someone with autism.  <br>Some characters that the main character knows well, are not black outlines and have some detail. But they are still darkened. This represents how some with autism can learn someone\u2019s body language if they have known them for a long time. <br> In the game, every environmental sound gets represented on the sound sensitivity meter. The player must keep this under control, so the main character does not become overwhelmed. This represents Sound sensitivity in autism. <br>In conversations, the player again can\u2019t read body language, as they are all black outlines.  But they must try and figure out how to respond with a limited vocabulary. This represents the difficulty Aspies have in putting thoughts into sentences that people can understand. <br>Also in conversations, the player\u2019s feeling meters of stress, happiness, courage, and uneasiness will affect how a conversation plays out. For example, not much courage means you can\u2019t look at the other person. <br>To regenerate the feeling meter, players must go into quiet places or do things that the main character enjoys. That being, playing video games. <br>The game\u2019s art style of blue and purple, represent not just the 80/90s feel of the game but also social isolation. Some items in the game that hold great importance to the main character are not in blue/purple but are in full color, because of how important they are.<i><i></i></i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i><i></i></i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i><i><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/786410/extras/Back.png?t=1729398214\" /></i></i></p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Robot's that talk?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/786410/8bc4b9dd87bd13551c017985c6174eb1ce5d7ad2.jpg"},{"name":"1000 kills Shoot Man....","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/786410/c8c0a2d5a2be7365e62d088dab89a1a93879808b.jpg"},{"name":"200 kills Shoot Man....","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/786410/1b78d5ad3296795705186471d8718e46fbcfd3df.jpg"},{"name":"20 kills Shoot Man....","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/786410/162977d1225cc006a5aa996cd9a9a63c35e010cf.jpg"},{"name":"Interfering signals ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/786410/9aa37a5a9c57ccb0d69f89bf480e8b0c8b17fb37.jpg"},{"name":"Well...
