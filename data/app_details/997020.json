{"about_the_game":"Aye Aye Captain is a game about crewing a ship on the high seas of the 1500 and 1600s. You'll have to manage a pirate crew, all while pillaging vessels of royal navies, other pirates, and facing the terrors of the sea.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour every action will have consequences. Fight for one nation and become a privateer for them or become the bane of every sovereign on the high seas. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAye Aye Captain's rouge-like pirate crew management ensures you're always on your toes. Fires and flooding of your ship can lead to devastating results. Purchased upgrades, such as bilge pumps and crow's nests, allow you to handle situations and snipe the enemy, while additional additions to your ship such as medics and boarding lines, allow for new takes on combat. Hire new crew members to replace that cabin boy who was blown overboard in that hurricane and prepare the lads for a raid!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/997020/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1683636480","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/997020/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1683636480","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/997020/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1683636480","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/997020/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1683636480","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Aye Aye Captain is a game about crewing a ship on the high seas of the 1500 and 1600s.
