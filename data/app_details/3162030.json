Ordinary terrain can be transformed into various landscapes under the influence of the elements of gold, wood, water, fire, and earth. Through precise landscape manipulation, you can turn simple land into tactical resources like defense towers, traps, and bait, giving you an advantage in battle. Each landscape type not only offers unique visual and strategic characteristics but can also generate one-of-a-kind weapons and equipment. Players must carefully choose their weapons, characters, and structures to create the optimal defense and attack conditions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Creature Nurturing </h2>In the game, you can nurture various creatures across different landscapes. Each creature not only provides unique abilities in battle but its body structure can also be used to craft and unlock rare weapons and items. By nurturing and researching these creatures, players can continuously expand and optimize their arsenal, significantly enhancing their combat capabilities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">initial release on early access includes:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>3 characters<br></li><li>13 landscape types<br></li><li>21 weapons<br></li><li>100 items<br></li><li>7 enemy types</li></ul><br><br>The finished version will contain even more content, and other features - all to be determined as we receive and review feedback from the community during Early Access.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3162030/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737545752","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3162030/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1737545752","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3162030/7efd0ef32e205beeacee08ef8089f8201ff727a1/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737545752","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3162030/7efd0ef32e205beeacee08ef8089f8201ff727a1/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737545752","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Take back your planet!</h2>Guns of Gaia is a single player auto-shooter game that combines survivor-like and base-building elements.
