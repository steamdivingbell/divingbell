{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In this first-person adventure game, you\u2019ll follow the story of a young man who, unknowingly, has been thrown into a world where the rules of logic have been left behind. It all begins with a seemingly simple mission: buying eggs for his mother. But what seemed like an everyday task transforms into an extraordinary experience, thanks to a group of cosmic comedians armed with magical text boxes that write comments coming to life and altering the world in real time.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you progress, you\u2019ll witness situations ranging from hilarious to utterly absurd. You might find yourself speeding through a jelly-like landscape in a car or piloting a drone solely to track animals that seem more interested in mocking you than being found. The comedians don\u2019t just sit back and watch; they constantly introduce random challenges that will test your skills and creativity, from frantic races against flying snails to solving puzzles with answers that only make sense in their twisted universe.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game doesn\u2019t fall short on modes and mechanics: you\u2019ll explore a variety of worlds and levels that feel like they\u2019ve been plucked from a delirious dream, each filled with side quests designed to challenge you. From collecting impossible objects to participating in utterly ridiculous talent competitions, there\u2019s never a dull moment. Each level is packed with secrets and hidden paths, rewarding the most observant players with unexpected &quot;and often comically useless&quot; discoveries.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The blend of a surreal narrative, unpredictable events, and constant interaction with the comedians \u201cwriting\u201d the world ensures that every playthrough is unique. While absurd humor lies at the heart of the game, you\u2019ll also encounter genuine challenges that will test your skills as a player. Get ready to laugh, get frustrated, and be surprised as you embark on an adventure where the ordinary becomes extraordinary, and you\u2019ll never be able to guess what happens next.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3446740/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737029952","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3446740/page.bg.jpg?t=1737029952","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3446740/2f5b70b9799e9b7f4788e8120c992861ba2eeb3b/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737029952","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3446740/2f5b70b9799e9b7f4788e8120c992861ba2eeb3b/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737029952","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In this first-person adventure game, you\u2019ll follow the story of a young man who, unknowingly, has been thrown into a world where the rules of logic have been left behind.
