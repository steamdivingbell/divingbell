{"about_the_game":"Weird Hero is a humorous and challenging shoot'em up where the hero, SuperMegaDude, battles countless foes with his arsenal of weird weapons: the Flickinator, the Atomic Toaster, a magician's hat and other strange devices. <br><br>The world around you has gone mad.

What could bring such a diverse crowd together? How do the cyborgs fit in? What about the anime heads? What use is the Flickinator? What's going on? <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Varied Enemy Types <br>There are eighteen enemy types, including bikers, Australians, samurai, Russian suicide bombers, giant anime heads and cyborgs from the future.
