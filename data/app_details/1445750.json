{"about_the_game":"After having escaped from the extremely inhospitable planet you crashed on last time, you decided to keep searching for Gaia, the home of the Ancients, on your own. It will be difficult without a crew, but having found artefacts of Ancient tech on your previous adventure, you\u2019re thinking you have to be close. Your ship\u2019s sensors have found an uncharted planet relatively close nearby. This planet is giving off similar signals as the one you found the Ancient tech on. You decide to make a landing near the location of these readings. Your story begins here.<br><br><br>Gaia 2: Ancient Mysteries features some of the mechanics from the first game:<br><br>\u00b0  Three different AI storytellers: Cora Core, Tranquillio Pax and RNGesus Silvius. Each storyteller provides a different type of game play experience, from a nice curve of rising difficulty, to a chill sandbox experience, to something not even RNGesus can predict.<br>\u00b0  Harvest several types of minerals, alien flora and underwater resources.<br>\u00b0  Build a base made of modular components, such as corridors and rooms, and decorate the inside with additional objects.<br>\u00b0  Craft items, vehicles and ammo.<br>\u00b0  Take care of your hunger and thirst.<br>\u00b0  Survive raids made of space pirates or alien creatures.<br><br>\u00b0  Notable Events:<br>\u200e- Raids: Air or ground, by the local wildlife or space mercs.

This may also spawn solar storms, which will start small, localized fires wherever lightning hits.<br>- Meteor shower: Mostly visual, but also provides a nice boost to your well being while \u200e\u200eit's active.<br>\u200e- Trade ships: Trade with the different factions.<br><br>\u00b0  Day and night cycle with amazing weather.

Certain needs affect you in different ways, such as decreasing your max health or your running speed. Some, such as radiation, are even more critical and deadly. You can craft certain substances that mitigate radiation but make you more susceptible to it, or you can try and ride it out.<br><br><strong>The time of day and weather affect your gameplay.</strong> Not only do they affect you directly, but they also affect your structures and their effectiveness.

Every vegetable you grow has its own advantages or disadvantages, such as nutrition, time of growth and amount of harvest. Choose between corn, chili, carrots, onions, cabbage or even leeks. These will prove especially tasty in the completely alien environment you find yourself in, which lacks a diversified source of food.<br><br><strong>Explore the depths of the lake.</strong> Although the surrounding ocean is completely void of life, the lake contains many useful resources and different types of fish. You will need a submersible to reach some of them however.<br><br><strong>Mine gold and diamonds throughout multiple cave systems.</strong> These caves can be found both inside mountains and deep underground.
