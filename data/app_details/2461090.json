{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DEATHGRIP invites the player to the jump in the pilot's seat of some of the fastest and most lethal hovercrafts ever seen and dominate the tracks they compete on. Navigate natural environments through split paths, twists, turns, jumps, shortcuts, and narrow corridors in an intense race to the finish. <br><br>DEATHGRIP introduces a depth to its racing controls that challenges the player to explore the skill ceiling. From afterburner allowed at any time to pitching, rolling, drifting, repairing, managing heat, and firing weapons, one should take pride in their ability to master a racer. <br><br>It is an experience meant to be visceral, brutal, exciting, and intense, centered on offering players instant enjoyment without gimmicks and an extended sense of achievement for those competitive and dedicated enough to get the most out of the game. </h2><br><strong>This demo includes 2 unique racers and 2 tracks to race across in both time trial and races against AI.</strong><br><br><strong><i>The full game will release will include (at a minimum) the following features:</i></strong><br><br><strong>8 Unique Racers</strong><br>All racers share the same functionality, but each has it's own strengths and weaknesses to suit different playstyles.<br><br><strong>10 Distinct Tracks</strong><br>Race across 10 environments on 10 tracks over terrain filled with obstacles, jumps, drops, shortcuts, multiple paths, and other challenges.  <br><br><strong>Combat Racing</strong><br>Race against AI with offensive and defensive armaments.
