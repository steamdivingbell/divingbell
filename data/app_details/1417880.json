{"about_the_game":"You are Arthur Artorias \u2013 the sole survivor of a massacre that devastated your family\u2019s legacy and tore them out of the history books. Thought to be dead, you emerge from exile 8 years later, the faceless man kindled by the flame and seeking vengeance. <br><br>Embark on an adventure unravelling a dark tale filled with twisted characters, centered around a militant religion hell bent on keeping control.  <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1417880/extras/Arrow_Small.gif?t=1726545420\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Key Features:</strong></h2><br><strong><i>A True Stealth Experience</i></strong><br><br>As Arthur, you must stick to the shadows, infiltrate homes and explore hidden passageways; but, be careful not to be spotted! Choose your playstyle: knocking out enemies may keep them quiet for some time, but they will eventually wake up; a quick slice to the throat may be a more permanent solution, but the bloodstain you leave on the carpet might be a dead giveaway! Keep your wits about you, dispose of bodies, peek through keyholes and pickpocket unsuspecting victims. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1417880/extras/Train_Small.gif?t=1726545420\" /><br><br><strong><i>Deep Arrow Crafting System</i></strong><br><br>Prepare for your mission by planning your loadout. With over 30 arrows to craft, experimentation is key to your success! Do you craft a smoke arrow to blind your opponent, or do you add on a poison element to create poisonious gas? Use your arrows offensively or defensively: break down weak walls with a blunt arrow to surprise your enemy, or use a rope arrow to reach a higher place and take out your enemies from a distance.<br><br><strong><i>Skill Tree</i></strong><br><br>Customize your playstyle from 3 distinct skill trees \u2013 stealth, combat, and utility.
