{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The alarm blares. Your heart races. In 180 seconds, lives will be changed forever - including yours.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As a firefighter in this thrilling simulation arcade game, you're thrust into burning buildings with nothing but your wits, your equipment, and a ticking clock. Each environment - from maze-like office complexes to sprawling schools - is a puzzle of flame and smoke, waiting to be solved. But unlike traditional puzzles, the stakes here are life and death.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3027700/extras/Store-Hoses.jpg?t=1727666160\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your primary tool is a firehose with three tactical modes, each offering a different balance of power and precision. Will you use the focused stream to cut through to a specific hotspot, or switch to the wide spray to control a larger area? Every choice matters when the clock is ticking down from 180.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">But &quot;180 Seconds&quot; isn't just about fighting fires. It's about the people caught in them. The game uses advanced AI to generate unique characters for each playthrough, complete with their own voices and backstories. The child you save in one run might be replaced by an elderly couple in the next, ensuring that no two games feel the same.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This unpredictability extends to the fires themselves. Using a proprietary system developed in Unreal Engine 5, the game simulates fires that react realistically to their environment and your actions. Manage oxygen levels carefully, or risk turning a smoldering room into a raging inferno with one wrong move.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Between missions, you'll return to the firehouse. Here, the game slows down, allowing you to explore, interact with fellow firefighters, and even care for the station's pet. But don't get too comfortable - the alarm can sound at any moment, catapulting you back into the action.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you play, you'll find yourself improving. Response times that once seemed impossible become achievable. Rooms that were death traps become navigable. You'll start climbing the Steam Leaderboards, competing with firefighters around the world. But more importantly, you'll gain a deeper appreciation for the real-life heroes who do this work every day.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">&quot;180 Seconds: A Firefighter's Call&quot; isn't just a game - it's a testament to the bravery of firefighters and a challenge to anyone who thinks they have what it takes to stand in their shoes. It's a project that began with one developer's vision but has the potential to grow into something much bigger, with plans for expansions and DLC.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The question is, are you ready to answer the call?</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3027700/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727666160","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3027700/page.bg.jpg?t=1727666160","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3027700/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727666160","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3027700/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727666160","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3243870,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The alarm blares.
