Set in a futuristic, Earth-like utopia, 'Formation' features a unique core-gameplay experience that focusses on intense formation flying. Besides fun, addictive gameplay, 'Formation' strives for visceral immersion by providing silky-smooth visuals, a cohesive art style and muscular audio.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>3...2...1...MARK!</strong></h2><br>The moment-to-moment gameplay in Formation mixes arcade flight-sim (like Ace Combat) and 'rhythm-based' genres. Execute maneuvers right on the MARK as notified via your FORMHUD advanced heads-up display. Successfully execute a series of maneuvers to complete a routine.
