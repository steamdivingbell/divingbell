For years, Redreach's strongest minds attempted to gain some insight into where this being's immense power came from, and how it somehow disappeared from existence altogether. These studies led to the discovery of the Stormrites, a series of powerful scrolls that, in the wrong hands, could lead to the end times.

Humans in Stormrite do not have any magical powers, and all power is granted by focus crystals. To cast spells, they must charge their energy via a crystal, with different crystals providing varying buffs and abilities to the character.

Your time will be spent going on enthralling quests, exploring the kingdom of Redreach and using various weapons and fighting techniques to dispose of your enemies. The three main styles of fighting are melee, ranged and magic. However, within each of these three categories there are several choices of weapon/combat style for you to choose. For example, ranged players can choose to go for a traditional bow and arrow loadout, can choose to go for a more clunky but powerful crossbow style, or even a hybrid melee-ranged loadout utilising agility, daggers, and throwing knifes. <br><br>Magic users can choose to cast spells that directly affect their enemies, summon companions to fight, or manipulate the very fabric of the world around them. You are also able to shoot spells into each other, resulting in some very interesting interactions that can be used to increase your options in combat. <br>Melee users also have plenty of choices, with 5 fighting styles (and counting) to choose from, and abilities to aid with your battles.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1428600/extras/April2022_5.gif?t=1684520544\" /><br><br>Stormrite will also have a companion system where you can bring allies on your travels to fight alongside you, either supporting you from behind or soaking up all the attention while you deal the damage from behind.
