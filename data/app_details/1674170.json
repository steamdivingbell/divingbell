{"about_the_game":"Design tanks in a dedicated and intuitive designer, allowing the realistic armour mechanics that make tank combat so unique. Explore tank design's challenges through WW1, the interwar period and the early, mid and late stages of WW2.<br><br><i>Please note: There is currently no dedicated tutorial. If you don't enjoy figuring things out or you don't know much about tanks, it may be worth holding off until better guidance is in place.</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Hull &amp; Turret Shape Design</strong></h2>Easy to use and flexible enough to give you endless design starting points. Drag on a face or edge to move it. Bigger compartments create more internal space but have more surface to armour. <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674170/extras/HullShapingDemo2.gif?t=1632163787\" /><br>Well angled shapes may bounce incoming shells off entirely, leaving only a scratch and several ringing ears.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Armour Design</strong></h2>Set the thickness of each armour plate, allowing you to block shots from your foes. Though the weight and space used adds up!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Cannon Design</strong></h2>Build a gun capable of piercing enemy armour. You'll need enough space and force to rotate it. Make sure you save enough room for ammo!<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674170/extras/CannonDemo.gif?t=1632163787\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Crew Design</strong></h2>Humans are light but large and quite essential, squeeze them in and assign them one or more roles. Cramped and overworked crew perform poorly.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Attached Parts</strong></h2>Add functional and decorative parts to the exterior of your vehicle. These can define where internals are e.g. the engine is positioned where you place your exhausts and vents, then gets hit if a shell pierces your armour in that area. Place a fuel port in front of the driver and the fuel tank just might absorb a projectile, saving their life - if it doesn't ignite...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Track Design</strong></h2>Focus your tracks and suspension on trench crossing, mountain climbing, going fast or just looking cool.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674170/extras/TrackDesignDemo2.gif?t=1632163787\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Engine Design</strong></h2>Design anything from ship engines to lawnmower engines in a basic powerplant designer.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Fuel Tank Design</strong></h2>Set your fuel capacity and tank locations. Even bring them outside of the vehicle - if you don't mind them being shot off every now and then.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Transmission Design</strong></h2>Design your ratios - make it faster backwards than forwards or give it a 1st gear that can climb any mountain. One of these on each track will let one side drive while the other reverses, turning on the spot.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Internal Component Health</strong></h2>No hit-points. Vehicles carry on the fight as long as their critical internals are still functioning.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Full Powertrain Simulation</strong></h2>Engines, transmissions &amp; tracks work together to move your tank with a realistic simulation, making vehicles feel like the real thing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Scenarios</h2>Battle in a range of environments with a team of your custom tanks, although make your design too expensive and you might be on your own. If your vehicle is destroyed, you carry on the fight in control of an ally - sometimes watching your previous self go up in flames.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674170/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1632163787","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674170/page.bg.jpg?t=1632163787","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674170/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1632163787","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674170/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1632163787","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Design tanks in a dedicated and intuitive designer, allowing the realistic armour mechanics that make tank combat so unique.
