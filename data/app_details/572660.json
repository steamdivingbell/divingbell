{"about_the_game":"<strong>Time to kick some ChristmASS.</strong><br><br>Nick is a free VR survival shooter defense game. Built in the Unreal engine, this first-person, room-scale VR experience lets users take control of a variety of weapons and tools to fight off endless waves of evil robotic elves. As Santa, users must move around the environment to set up defenses and dodge attacks to beat back the onslaught. 'Tis the season! <br><br><strong>KEY FEATURES: </strong><br><br>- Step into Nick\u2019s boots to make a last stand in this room-scale interactive VR experience.<br>- Hone your skills with the game tutorial.<br>- Select the level of difficulty from three options.<br>- Face crushing waves of deranged killer robo-elves each with different abilities.<br>- Use the \u201cSanta\u2019s Little Helper\u201d suction gun alongside your trusty mallet to turn everything around you into a weapon. <br>- Board up windows to fortify your defenses between waves.<br>- Maintain your workshop\u2019s energy source by collecting battery cells dropped by defeated elves to power the generator.<br>- Christmas Easter Eggs (oh, the irony) abound! <br>- Save the holidays.

(Polar Algorithmic Computer). For the first few months, everything seemed copacetic. Then came an efficiency test\u2026 that Santa, by dint of being flesh and blood as opposed to mechanical marvel, inevitably failed. P.A.L. repurposed the once-peaceful robo-elf manufacturing arm into an army bent on assassination, and set out to wipe Santa from the face of the Earth. Why?
