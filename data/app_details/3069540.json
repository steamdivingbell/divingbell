{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2><i>Who Wears the Crown?</i> is about controlling a little pawn and trying to get to the top of each level to claim your crown. Play your way through various chess games to build your platforms and climb higher and higher. Be careful though, much like the game of chess, the movement of your pawn requires timing and patience. One wrong maneuver could send you tumbling back down to the bottom of the level and start you over. It's not <strong>only</strong> about your platforming skill either. One blunder in any of the chess games could send you back as well! <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3069540/extras/fallinggifsmaller.gif?t=1721665188\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Modes</h2><br><u>Adventure</u><br>This is the main game mode in <i>Who Wears the Crown?</i>.
