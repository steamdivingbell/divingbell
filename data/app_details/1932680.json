A thousand years ago, humanity lived on the now volcanic and lifeless earth-like planet known as Terra. Due to the planetary catastrophe, ASTRA, humans were forced to find a new home. Unfortunately, no habitable planet existed within a reasonable distance, so the remaining survivors made their way to Luna, the moon that orbits Terra. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Filled with hope, dreams, and determination, Humanity continued to survive and flourish in a new home. Centuries later in the year 30XX, Luna became home to some of the most brilliant human minds in existence (and their creations). However, humanity's existence is now threatened by an oncoming antimatter comet - the same comet that wiped out the people of Terra a thousand years ago!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Join Lunar Warrior Bella as she fights her way across the Moon to find a way to destroy the comet before it wipes out life as we know it!
