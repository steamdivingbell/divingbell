She got both, but wasn\u2019t ready for what it cost her. Featuring Akenya on vocals and Joshua Du Chene on guitar.<br></li><li><strong>Breathe the Black:</strong> Little Ben already had a hard life as a union man trying to get by in the mines. But things got harder when the Company sent their hired guns in to put things back the way they were. Featuring Joshua Du Chene on guitar.<br></li><li><strong>Vagrant Song (Deep South):</strong> Easy to get lost in the swamps and bayous of this land. Most folk like it that way. Featuring Joshua Du Chene on guitar and vocals.<br></li><li><strong>Miles of Smiles:</strong> Life on the rails might sound glamorous to some, but Franklin knew that only held true if you were the one holding the ticket. Featuring Ryan Ike on piano.<br></li><li><strong>Curandera:</strong> Fidelina practices the Old Ways. The Old Ways bring succor, peace, safety. But when the Old Ways fade to nothing, where, then, are we to turn? Featuring Cody Richards on flute and Joshua Du Chene on guitar.<br></li><li><strong>From This Field I Wish To Rise:</strong> Shaw\u2019s family suffered beneath the yoke of slavery. Now, as a free man, not much has changed. Featuring Joshua Du Chene on guitar.<br></li><li><strong>Shining Isles of Ivory:</strong> August made a life on the high seas, but that life was lost to him. Now, trapped on the land he once cast off from, he\u2019s drowning.<br></li><li><strong>Vagrant Song (Appalachia):</strong> Hard lands give way to hard people, or so they say. Featuring Jeff Ball on Fiddle, Jillian Aversa on vocals, and Joshua Du Chene on Guitar<br></li><li><strong>Noodle It Out:</strong> If beauty and heartbreak are the stuff of poetry, Cassidy figured the open road was as much a poet as he was. Featuring Ryan Ike on piano.<br></li><li><strong>Dust to Dust:</strong> They say the heavy winds in the Dustbowl left nothing but stones behind, and stone is what Bertha became. She would not be moved. <br></li><li><strong>This Trench Was Dug For Me:</strong> Mason may have lost a leg to the war, but his marching days are far from over.<br></li><li><strong>Vagrant Song (Midwest):</strong> The cold outside just means a warm hearth burns all the brighter. Featuring Elizabeth Zharoff on vocals.<br></li><li><strong>Rail Hoppin\u2019:</strong> Two dogs, a sharp knife, and the rattling thrum of a boxcar bound for new shores. Might not seem like much to some, but for Quinn, it was plenty. Featuring Joshua DuChene on Guitar<br></li><li><strong>Read \u2018Em and Weep:</strong> No better allegory for American Life than rolling the dice on a big gamble. Everyone\u2019s luck runs out, sooner or later. Featuring John Robert Matz on trumpet and Kristin Naigus on oboe.<br></li><li><strong>Tear It Down:</strong> It\u2019s a hard time for a man of faith when there\u2019s not much left to believe in. But then, isn\u2019t that what faith is all about?
