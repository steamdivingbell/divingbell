{"about_the_game":"Remember when handhelds used to have single player card games, where you play through an RPG-like story collecting cards and having battles along the way? This long-dormant genre has always been one of my favorites, so I created Eternal Skies because I wanted a new one. Eternal Skies is a TCG RPG, where you advance through the story by having card battles. The card game and mechanics themselves were created completely from scratch, and are inspired by Slavic mythology and the old Dreamcast game Skies of Arcadia. Don't like the way the card game plays? Change it!
