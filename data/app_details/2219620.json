Many of the powerful kingdoms have fallen, and the heir to a small merchant kingdom with hardly any soldiers to boast decides the only way to save his people is marrying one of the two most powerful bachelorettes in the known world - Princess Mai and Princess Tetsuko. The Oni court approves, but with a small caveat - if the marriage is to go through, he'll have to rein in the bickering pair's worst excesses, as well as teach them about ruling properly in times of peace. It can't be <i>too</i> hard, can it?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Characters:</h2><br><strong>Princess Tetsuko</strong><br>Rowdy, loud and proud, Princess Tetsuko isn't exactly what you've grown up knowing princesses to be. When she's not out brawling with the royal army soldiers for fun (whoever's still willing to get in the ring with her, that is), you'll probably catch her working out or devouring a family sized buffet all by herself. Unfortunately for her, her fearsome reputation has left her without any potential suitors, until you stumbled along. She's not one to stress out over who dominates who, but between a human and a 7 foot tall, sexually frustrated Oni amazon, it's fairly normal that she'll be the one taking the lead more often than not.<br><br><strong>Princess Mai</strong><br>Fit, gorgeous, and fond of herself to a fault, Princess Mai is the polar opposite of her twin sister. She won't settle for anything, and always demands everything be done according to even her slightest, and most trivial whim. Nothing but the best will satisfy her, in everything from food to love. Despite all this however, she's seemingly come down with a bad case of human fever as you've managed to strike a chord in this haughty princess' heart. Even if her desires can be a little sadistic at times, mean girls have their appeal too, right?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><br>Full HD<br>Over 30 CGs<br>Dynamic Dialogue System<br>3 Endings<br>Voice Acting By MissMoonified","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219620/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733207621","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219620/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1733207621","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219620/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733207621","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219620/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733207621","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,3,4,5],"notes":"This game has adult themes, adult language, references to the occult, and fictional characters depicted in adult situations and performing hardcore sexual acts with human and fantasy characters.
