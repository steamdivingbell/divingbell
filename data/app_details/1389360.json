{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1389360/extras/mechs.jpg?t=1726692567\" /><br>Mech Armada puts you in command of your own team of custom-built Mechs. Upgrade and build your roster of available Mechs from over 80 unique parts, each with their own strengths, weaknesses and playstyles. From flamethrowers to mega missile pods, fighter drones to rayguns, determining the right Mech build and leveraging its weaponry is key to conserving your resources and defeating The Swarm.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1389360/extras/tactical.jpg?t=1726692567\" /><br>Mech Armada offers deep grid-based, turn-based combat, where there are no perfect solutions to the challenges you face. Understanding your enemy and anticipating their actions, getting to know the limitations of your Mechs while managing your resources and observing the terrain ahead of you will determine your success. At the end of each area, you\u2019ll need to take on The Swarm\u2019s major bosses: they're massive, ugly and ridiculously tough. Are you up to the task?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1389360/extras/unique.jpg?t=1726692567\" /><br>No two runs in Mech Armada are the same. With procedurally generated levels set across a backdrop of varied post-apocalyptic environments, every element in the game is randomly combined and balanced to create a unique, challenging experience. Like all rogue-likes, death in Mech Armada means game over. You\u2019ll need to try again with an entirely new run, with fresh Mechs and all new encounters.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1389360/extras/sandbox.jpg?t=1726692567\" /><br>Wanting to try new tactics, Mech designs and strategies without risk? Head to the Sandbox, where you can pick any parts you want. Practice your maneuvers, experiment with unique loadouts and refine your strategies against The Swarm.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Goliath Down","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1389360/7d3fb1b2ea5b1f175051a28391ea00a842d73831.jpg"},{"name":"Let's Get Crackin'","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1389360/4ca0ada3f9fb94707f451589ee2525ba42a444d8.jpg"},{"name":"Watch That Tail","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1389360/80fd8797fc9e4116375121dc37f14379847ff117.jpg"},{"name":"Cloudy With a Chance of Rocks","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1389360/8c7c1968d13584780c958a0ad98900f3da7c9946.jpg"},{"name":"Got Sand in My Eye","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1389360/d0fd808c33976a0c18c598c9aaf7f15336a24617.jpg"},{"name":"It's Hot In Here","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1389360/d3da30af175f0dc6af8eb168a85b4536eafa8343.jpg"},{"name":"Creepy Crawlies","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1389360/a78f85e63b359e4aa644ab31b4d664244f6fc36f.jpg"},{"name":"Ouch!
