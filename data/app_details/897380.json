To do this, you will have to hunt dinosaurs, discover the ruins of a ruined human civilization and build new, stronger weapons.<br><br>The game takes the best features from other survival and action games. Take resources from the environment, skin the dinos, and dive into water to search for unique items. Use a drone to find dinos\u2019 positions.
