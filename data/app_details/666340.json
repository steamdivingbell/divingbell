{"about_the_game":"You find yourself trapped in a stone basement, locked in by an unknown mastermind. Your task is simple: to escape by completing the series of challenges and puzzles set before you.

In it you'll find puzzles ranging from relatively simple to quite complex, with clues both transparent and cleverly obfuscated. We've endeavored to keep objects true to their real world counterparts and to give the player the tools they need to interact with the virtual world as comfortably and intuitively as possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInescapable VR: Underground was made to mimic the feel and pace of real life escape rooms as closely as possible. The puzzles are not designed to be simple matters where you have to follow very basic instructions or complete overly obvious tasks. Each puzzle in the game has multiple parts to it, with some requiring the combination of various objects to find the final solution.
