{"about_the_game":"Infernal Wave is an intense cooperative survival shooter that pits a team of up to five players against endless waves of bloodthirsty zombies. As the last line of defense in a post-apocalyptic world, players must work together to strategize, survive, and annihilate hordes of the undead using an arsenal of firearms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCooperative Gameplay: Join forces with up to five friends in a seamless cooperative experience. Teamwork and coordination are essential to surviving the relentless onslaught of zombies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEndless Waves: Prepare for an adrenaline-pumping challenge as waves of zombies pour in without end. Each wave becomes progressively more challenging, requiring players to adapt their strategies and use their arsenal wisely.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nExtensive Weaponry: Arm yourself with an array of firearms to mow down the zombie hordes. Unlock a wide selection of weapons. Each weapon offers a different playstyle and tactical advantage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIncludes three maps: The first map is a laboratory full of zombies where creatures from another world will help you open the doors of the laboratory, but in return you will have to help them. The second map is based on the first map's underground, an inaccessible area within which you dodge and kill with a long distance advantage, and the third map is based on the corporation's offices. And soon we will release the fourth map.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdvantages: On the maps there are open chests that provide you with certain advantages such as the advantage of resistance to zombies, the speed of weapons, the player or reloading, the advantage of reviving or increasing the number of space to carry weapons.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2515060/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729065109","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2515060/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1729065109","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2515060/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729065109","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2515060/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729065109","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Contains violent and bloody content."},"detailed_description":"Infernal Wave is an intense cooperative survival shooter that pits a team of up to five players against endless waves of bloodthirsty zombies.
