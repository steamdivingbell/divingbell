{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You are the keeper of a house from which you can never escape. Day after day, you follow the instructions that appear on your tablet. You can break them, maybe that will change something? The choice is yours. But I recommend you think carefully before doing so. Your decision affects more than just your life.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your task is to survive. But no one is chasing you, and you don\u2019t die of natural causes. And believe me, you can die many times before you finally unravel the mysteries of this world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Features:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is a game created by only two people.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Complete freedom of choice: you can independently decide which door to open, which character to interact with most often. <i>(You can choose a favorite, whatever that may mean.)</i></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Impact of choices: every choice you make not only affects the current dialogues but also the subsequent events. Your choice may also lead to death, either for you or for any character in the game. <i>There are no immortals here.</i></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A well-developed world: the post-apocalyptic universe is much broader and more expansive than it may initially appear. The most attentive players will uncover a dark, surprising, and brutal world in <i>Reflections of the Void</i>. <i>Surviving does not mean truly living.</i></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Romantic storyline: it exists in the game, but not everyone will be able to win over the ambiguous, slightly strange (or perhaps insane?) girl. First, you\u2019ll need to understand her thoughts \u2014 why does she act the way she does? Perhaps everything isn\u2019t as obvious as it seems?</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Meaningful depth: some will see only a dark story here, while others will uncover the philosophical meaning behind what\u2019s happening, pondering questions about life and death, love in all its forms, and the price of survival.
