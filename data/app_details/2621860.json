With fully interactable menus, players will easily understand the base controls of Energy Tanks. After selecting a map to battle each other in, the battle will start! Surrounding the maps are shield generators that help keep players\u2019 shields active. Players will have to take out all the enemy shield generators to be able to destroy the opposing tank. Also on the maps are power ups to aid in achieving victory, each one giving different powers to change your battle plans. Once the final strike has been landed, players are able to restart the battle or choose a different map to play in.
