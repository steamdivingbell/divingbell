{"about_the_game":"<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are using Proton you may need to set the launch options to:<br>PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1 %command%<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">General Control of the Game</h2>SHIFT+L: <strong>Load Game</strong><br>SHIFT+S: <strong>Save Game</strong><br>Ctrl+C / Pause Key:       <strong>Pause Game/Exit Level</strong><br>Left Click:                      <strong>Select Unit or Building</strong><br>SHIFT+Left Click:           <strong>Select Multiple Units</strong><br>Double Left Click:          <strong>Select all similar units in view</strong><br>Right Click on Map:       <strong>Tell unit(s) to go there.</strong><br>Right Click on Enemy:   <strong>Tell unit(s) to attack unit or building</strong><br>Escape:                          <strong>Abort whatever unit/building is doing</strong><br>A:                                   <strong>Attack unit, building, or terrain</strong><br>Left Click Mini-map:      <strong>Change view area to that part of map</strong><br>Right Click Mini-Map:    <strong>Send selected unit(s) to that area</strong><br>Mouse at Screen Edge:  <strong>Scroll Viewing Area</strong><br>Cursor Keys:                   <strong>Scroll Viewing Area</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">First Priorities</h2>You have between 9 and 10 minutes before the enemy will <br>    attack.  Use that time to start harvesting resources and<br>    building up defenses.<br><br>Minerals - You will need to build a smelter (Hotkey T) near <br>    where you see rocks and crystals.  Use the builder to pick <br>    up minerals and drop them along sides of the smelter <br>    building.  The smelter will automatically pick them up and <br>    process them as it needs. <br><br>    Start with the crystals first, as they are the highest <br>    value resources.  When those run out, you can process the <br>    rocks, starting from the largest to the smallest.<br><br>Solar Power - You will first need to build a power station <br>    (hotkey A) somewhere on the map.  Once it is finished, you <br>    can build up to 8 solar panels around the power station.  <br>    If you need more than 8 panels (which you probably will) <br>    then build an additional power station.<br><br>Gas Refinery - Build the refinery (hotkey G) on top of <br>    volcanos.  The more volcanoes you tap, the more gas you'll <br>    have available.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Setup Defenses</h2>    You can move rocks or build walls to fortify the areas <br>    most vulnerable to attack.  Then build sentry tanks at the<br>    factory and move then a few spaces behind your wall, as <br>    they have a very long firing range.  Be sure to set them <br>    to sentry mode (hotkey S).  If they aren't spinning, then <br>    they aren't going to defend!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build A Radar Station</h2>    This game does not employ a fog of war, and you can always<br>    see anything in the main view area.  However, if you want to<br>    be able to see both player and enemy mobile units live on <br>    the mini-map, a radar station must be present. Player units<br>    show up in white, while Protoid units are yellow.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Balance Of Units</h2>    Obviously not all units are equal.  Some are slow, some are<br>    fast.  Some are cheap, and some are expensive.  A small<br>    group of heavy tanks, for example, could decimate your <br>    opponent's base. However, they are expensive, take a long<br>    time to build, and they are slow to move.  On the flip side<br>    of that, ATVs are cheap and fast, but not very powerful.<br><br>    In time, you will learn which units are best suited for<br>    different strategies.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Missile Silo</h2>    Missiles can devestate your opponents base easily.  But be<br>    warned, they are expensive and slow to build.  You must<br>    also build a new missile for each launch.<br><br>    The coordinate system used is based on how many spaces <br>    relative to the silo the target is.  So, if you have more <br>    than one missile silo, the coordinates will not be the same<br>    for each one.  Also the coordinates are shown in hexa-<br>    decimal.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Protoids</h2>    It is good to know your enemy.  The Protoids will typically<br>    not attack your base until their army has reached a certain<br>    size.  However, they will always rush to defend the base if<br>    you attack them.<br><br>    They aren't too bright when it comes to navigating the map<br>    to attack your base.  However, their tanks will blast<br>    through terrain objects that are in the way, or even build<br>    bridges over water, thus allowing the rest of the units<br>    a path to your base.  <br><br>    Protoids do rebuild their base if pieces of it are<br>    destroyed.  So don't wait too long after a partially<br>    sucessful attack, or you may have to start all over again.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Difficulty Levels</h2>    There are three difficulty levels: easy, normal, and hard.<br>    There are numerous things that change with each level. Some<br>    things are small, such as the ratio of tanks vs soldiers<br>    that are built.  Also the number of sentry pods that the <br>    Protoids build varies.  It is as little as 4 pods per base<br>    in easy mode, to 12 pods in hard mode.  <br><br>    In easy mode, the protoids will not even build a factory, <br>    hence no tanks will be made. And with no tanks, the Protoids<br>    will not cross water or create paths through forest or<br>    rocks.  <br><br>    In hard mode, the Protoids will build two bases at the<br>    start of the game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2727770/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1704058264","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2727770/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1704058264","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2727770/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1704058264","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2727770/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1704058264","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are using Proton you may need to set the launch options to:<br>PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1 %command%<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">General Control of the Game</h2>SHIFT+L: <strong>Load Game</strong><br>SHIFT+S: <strong>Save Game</strong><br>Ctrl+C / Pause Key:       <strong>Pause Game/Exit Level</strong><br>Left Click:                      <strong>Select Unit or Building</strong><br>SHIFT+Left Click:           <strong>Select Multiple Units</strong><br>Double Left Click:          <strong>Select all similar units in view</strong><br>Right Click on Map:       <strong>Tell unit(s) to go there.</strong><br>Right Click on Enemy:   <strong>Tell unit(s) to attack unit or building</strong><br>Escape:                          <strong>Abort whatever unit/building is doing</strong><br>A:                                   <strong>Attack unit, building, or terrain</strong><br>Left Click Mini-map:      <strong>Change view area to that part of map</strong><br>Right Click Mini-Map:    <strong>Send selected unit(s) to that area</strong><br>Mouse at Screen Edge:  <strong>Scroll Viewing Area</strong><br>Cursor Keys:                   <strong>Scroll Viewing Area</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">First Priorities</h2>You have between 9 and 10 minutes before the enemy will <br>    attack.
