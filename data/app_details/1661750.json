{"about_the_game":"Heavily inspired by Dante Alighieri\u2019s &quot;Inferno&quot;, <strong>Dead Box</strong> is a lighthearted yet dark game about a box named Henry who lived his life in a box, worked in a box, played in a box. When he died they put him in a box. It seems only fitting that purgatory would be the same. Experience this artistic view of the in between, while Henry makes his way through the gray trying to find the light. But its not as easy as one might think. Besides the occasional puzzle and the monsters laid throughout each scene, he will have to struggle with his inner demons that have escaped. Face down the shadow's of pride, greed, wrath, envy, lust, gluttony, and sloth. Will Henry defeat his demons and find his way out, or will he be trapped for all eternity; that is up to you.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1661750/extras/Overview_Divider_3.png?t=1652715278\" /><br><br>This indie side-scroller was developed by Liam Swetnam with the help from some of his friends after years of attempts at making different playable experiences, and started from a simple multiplayer game that Liam made out of boredom to entertain himself and his peers.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1661750/extras/Vibin_Box.gif?t=1652715278\" /><br><br><strong>Features include:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Playing as Henry as you try to fight the shadows of sin and escape Purgatory<br></li><li> Listening to a unique soundtrack written by the game creator and his music producing acquaintance<br></li><li> Venturing a variety of hand-drawn scenes<br></li><li> Seeing how Henry's method of movement throughout the story changes in weird ways</li></ul>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1661750?t=1652715278","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1661750?t=1652715278","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1661750/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1652715278","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1661750/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1652715278","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Heavily inspired by Dante Alighieri\u2019s &quot;Inferno&quot;, <strong>Dead Box</strong> is a lighthearted yet dark game about a box named Henry who lived his life in a box, worked in a box, played in a box.
