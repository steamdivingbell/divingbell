You'll explore the cave system within Mt. Noble, finding valuable treasure along the way and fighting the many creatures inhabiting each floor... or avoiding them entirely if you feel confident in your combat prowess!

They'll help by rewarding you with useful items and even have your back when the time calls.<br><br>Unfortunately, the caves and their monstrous inhabitants aren't your only obstacles. There's someone else trapped down here. Someone who's after your life. Who is she, and who sent her?
