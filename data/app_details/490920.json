{"about_the_game":"Wolfpack is a realistic, first person, co-op U-boat game where one or multiple crews of players man the stations of a highly detailed German type VII U-boat during the Second World War. The crew will encounter large randomized convoys of merchants escorted by destroyers, sloops, and corvettes. Their objective is to intercept and sink enemy ships and escape undetected. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach player mans a station in the U-boat, and the crew will need to cooperate in order to succeed in their mission. Unlike other submarine simulators, Wolfpack is designed for players to procedurally manage the submarine through direct, manual interaction with valves, levers, and instruments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach U-boat has up to five players: The captain, the helmsman, the dive officer, the radio man, and the navigator.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe radio man operates the hydrophone, radio, radio direction finder, and Enigma machine. The helmsman controls the U-boats heading and speed, and operates the torpedo data computer. The dive officer controls the depth using the dive planes, ballast and negative tanks and serves as a lookout and gunner for the deck gun and anti aircraft gun. The navigator calculates the position of the u-boat, and determines the best route to intercept enemy convoys. The captain is the commander of the U-boat, and leads the crew.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWolfpack also features a single player mode where one captain can easily manage his U-boat solo. Plus, it is easy to start a mission solo and allow other players to join the battle in their own subs as part of a wolfpack. The captains can use the U-boat radio to communicate with each other just like the real U-boats did.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll stations and instruments in the U-boat are carefully modeled after original pictures and sources, and kept as realistic as possible without compromising usability. The game contains a fully operational torpedo data computer, manual navigation tools, and ship recognition manual.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/490920?t=1725028722","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490920/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1725028722","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490920/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725028722","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490920/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725028722","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Discord Community</h1><p></p><br><h1>Roadmap</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490920/extras/roadmap.png?t=1725028722\" /></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Wolfpack is a realistic, first person, co-op U-boat game where one or multiple crews of players man the stations of a highly detailed German type VII U-boat during the Second World War.

Turn-based and RTS players identify so much with their units that they feel they are members of the force. Simulation and FPS players have even more visceral connections: they are virtually on the spot, spewing bullets and doing Split-Ss. Submarine simulations tend to combine both styles. The main position is the captain\u2019s positions in the command center where he can pick targets by the periscope. He can also click on dials to control speed, course and depth. Some simulations can send players to specific compartments like engineering, fire control, sonar/radar, radio, even crew quarters via clicks on icons. Still, the player is in control with no real change in perspective. Skvader Studios\u2019 \u2013 aided by  -- Wolfpack gives a whole new dimension to submarine sims.\u201d<br>Wargamer<br><br>\u201cIf you've ever dreamed of working on a &quot;highly detailed German type VII U-boat during the Second World War&quot;, Wolfpack is the game for you.\u201d<br>PC Gamer<br><br>\u201c&quot;It was our second mission, so our three-man crew was a little nervous. Even though my two gaming buddies and I cracked jokes about our rather limited adventures at sea we knew that we were playing a game that was deadly serious. We were tasked with seeking out and destroying any British supply convoys that we came across in the frigid waters of the North Sea.  Wolfpack is not an easy game. It sure managed to flummox my two gaming buddies and I when we initially tried it out. This is not a submarine simulator where many of the complex calculations and controls are streamlined for you. No, this is a full-on simulator which forces you to come to grips with your chosen U-boats many machinations all by yourselves. And when everything comes together and your crew finally comes to grips with Wolfpack\u2019s carefully articulated mechanics, the game becomes a thing of beauty that I personally haven\u2019t experienced in most of the games I\u2019ve played.&quot;\u201d<br>91% \u2013 CyberpowerPC<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490920/ss_dd6654732d7261e5fb4c5ee4f63f49ad6143541f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725028722","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490920/ss_dd6654732d7261e5fb4c5ee4f63f49ad6143541f.600x338.jpg?t=1725028722"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490920/ss_ec187beedf2c7504857d6a9a25e5c7fd79ca1e36.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725028722","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490920/ss_ec187beedf2c7504857d6a9a25e5c7fd79ca1e36.600x338.jpg?t=1725028722"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490920/ss_88fa2d011259c4e1b1e1da51b4cb3ef997e71043.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725028722","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490920/ss_88fa2d011259c4e1b1e1da51b4cb3ef997e71043.600x338.jpg?t=1725028722"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490920/ss_d54a7ef3fc5a497ded88f3c09532ea18e8c19985.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725028722","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490920/ss_d54a7ef3fc5a497ded88f3c09532ea18e8c19985.600x338.jpg?t=1725028722"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490920/ss_2a2533d19d6d1e70e567c1ded189023ce449bc63.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725028722","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490920/ss_2a2533d19d6d1e70e567c1ded189023ce449bc63.600x338.jpg?t=1725028722"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490920/ss_1d7f15a4c6c28dbca91811a4c35896007e586948.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725028722","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490920/ss_1d7f15a4c6c28dbca91811a4c35896007e586948.600x338.jpg?t=1725028722"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490920/ss_17ee58fba53ddeffd81c1385257509112ea6d63a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725028722","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490920/ss_17ee58fba53ddeffd81c1385257509112ea6d63a.600x338.jpg?t=1725028722"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490920/ss_65965f21354129c7848ecc8197687f87b3b59ec5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725028722","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490920/ss_65965f21354129c7848ecc8197687f87b3b59ec5.600x338.jpg?t=1725028722"},{"id":8,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490920/ss_a042ad87f156b2389c5a0657c1e7f4d287886a1c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725028722","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490920/ss_a042ad87f156b2389c5a0657c1e7f4d287886a1c.600x338.jpg?t=1725028722"},{"id":9,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490920/ss_bfaa50c33f5445255938c317a6688666b879b452.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725028722","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490920/ss_bfaa50c33f5445255938c317a6688666b879b452.600x338.jpg?t=1725028722"},{"id":10,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490920/ss_aacb4eb6389039d66a774c74fb4a407deb6c8c3b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725028722","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490920/ss_aacb4eb6389039d66a774c74fb4a407deb6c8c3b.600x338.jpg?t=1725028722"}],"short_description":"A crew of players experience the tense atmosphere of a WW2 U-boat, manning the stations in this realistic co-op simulation game.
