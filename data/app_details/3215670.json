Every society has its expiration date - and some dates are sooner than others. Surrounded by a cast of AAA voice talent, including David Hayter, Jennifer Hale, and Christopher Randolph, you'll find yourself entrenched in the utter brutality of a labyrinthine city gone mad. Sleuth through the shadows of the world and lose yourself in every nook and cranny of this city - and the blood of its inhabitants.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3215670/extras/CLIPSD-005E.gif?t=1728664273\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As The Whisper, you'll have to balance stealth and brutality to make your goals into reality.
