You have been accepted for a job at your local department store. A massive storm starts forming as you arrive for your first shift, before you can get settled, your manager gives you a list of tasks to complete before you can leave for the night. At the end of your first night, the storm rages on outside tripping the emergency shutters and trapping you at work.<br>With no sign of help and nothing but your wits and your flashlight, you need to mark off all your tasks so you can at least get paid. However as each night passes, you feel something isn't right. Something is watching you... Whatever it is, it moves in the dark.<br>Navigate through the spacious storefront, the claustrophobic service tunnels, and eerie employee-only rooms. Complete your tasks to make sure the store is looking perfect for when the store can reopen... and you can leave.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3155790/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729964028","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3155790/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1729964028","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3155790/444de5a9b42443577c481e5b10f2f52290becbf7/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729964028","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3155790/444de5a9b42443577c481e5b10f2f52290becbf7/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729964028","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Timeline","id":63}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence,  General Mature Content."},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Experience the first two levels of The Night Shift in this demo.</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SYNOPSIS</h2>The Night Shift is a first-person horror game that brings the player into a world that progressively becomes a harrowing nightmare.
