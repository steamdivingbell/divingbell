You can choose to play handmade levels in Story Mode, and uncover the secret backstory of the Bitlands, or play through the procedurally generated worlds in Endless Mode to complete your Critter Journal collection!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Critter Journal</h2><br>As you play through Story Mode, you can collect and fill your Critter Journal with badges found throughout the world, and show off your completed collection to your friends!
