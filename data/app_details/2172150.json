{"about_the_game":"Inspired by hundreds of games ranging from Chrono Trigger, Zelda, Final Fantasy, Morrowind &amp; Oblivion, 90s Star Wars games, Mega Man, Metroid, Phantasy Star 4, and even newer games like Outer Wilds, Hades, Vampire Survivors, and Sea of Stars, Angel Droid is the culmination and incarnation of the love and joy experienced through all those games. Our love and admiration for the developers that pioneered the 90s golden age of video games is the core of this project. Angel Droid exists as a love letter to all the developers that came before us. The inspiration given from those blessed developers and musicians and artists have accumulated to a point of bursting, and Angel Droid is the direct representation of all that positive energy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThough Angel Droid's development is incomplete, the game is still enjoyable to play as an experiment borne of passion and wonder. The game has been priced at 99\u00a2 because that is the lowest price that can be listed on Steam without making the game completely free. I, the developer, never cared about the money. I don't want this game to show up on free game playlists. This game was not meant to be played by the masses. This game was meant to serve as a love letter to all the devs, musicians, and artists I respect (albeit being incomplete and quirky in the game's current state).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNo popular game was created by one person.<br />\r\nThis game is no exception, but it comes pretty close to being completed by a one-man-army. With the exception of the Angel Droid's concept art, and the 3D model of the Angel Droid, everything seen, heard, &amp; coded into Angel Droid was created by one person. Angel Droid was developed in 10 months, and the development was halted because I found out my wife was pregnant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLuna, if you're reading this Steam page, I love you, and I cannot express how excited I am now that you're finally here. You probably won't have fun playing Angel Droid when you're a teenager, however I hope Angel Droid shows you how much fun I had developing video games before you became my ultimate pride and joy.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2172150/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1695341849","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2172150/page.bg.jpg?t=1695341849","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2172150/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1695341849","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2172150/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1695341849","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Inspired by hundreds of games ranging from Chrono Trigger, Zelda, Final Fantasy, Morrowind &amp; Oblivion, 90s Star Wars games, Mega Man, Metroid, Phantasy Star 4, and even newer games like Outer Wilds, Hades, Vampire Survivors, and Sea of Stars, Angel Droid is the culmination and incarnation of the love and joy experienced through all those games.
