They speak familiar languages and have similar customs to the Travellers, but know nothing of the Imperium or its neighbours.  <strong> Tradeport</strong>   A freeport on the edge of explored space, Tradeport has a dockyard of sorts - and Deepnight Revelation needs one. Tradeport is a dangerous place but with the jump drive on the verge of breakdown the Travellers have little choice but to plunge into its turbulent politics.  <strong> The Biologicals</strong>   The Travellers encounter a mysterious race of what appear to be intelligent plants. Their biological starships are pushing into human-dominated space and conflict seems inevitable. An encounter with the wreck of a human battlecruiser suggests that great danger lies ahead.\u00a0The Far Side of Nowhere.
