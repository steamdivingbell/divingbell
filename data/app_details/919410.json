Many themes have emerged in the cultural identity of Death, including <i>The Dance of Death</i> or <i>Danse Macabre</i> and <i>Death And The Maiden</i>. We sort of mashed those two themes together in Felix The Reaper.<br> <br>For the character himself and the world around him, the inspiration was more diverse: We took cues from the ancient TV show <i>The Twilight Zon</i>e, medieval painters like <i>Bruegel and Bosch</i> and the cartoon characters of <i>Adventure Time</i> and <i>Hayao Miyazaki</i>.<br> <br>Another important inspiration for Felix The Reaper was the amazing artistic collaborators in the production. We worked with dancers, a long list of music artists and history scholars.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Dance</h2>Several dancers contributed to the game's production, and eventually Gunilla Lind and Rapha\u00ebl Ferdinand Eder-Kastling improvised the final moves that ended up in the game.<br> <br>Here's Gunilla doing a dance move for Felix:<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/919410/extras/STEAMassets_SPLITSCREEN_Gunilla.gif.png?t=1642454254\" /><br>And here's Raphael doing another:<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/919410/extras/STEAMassets_SPLITSCREEN_Raphael.gif.png?t=1642454254\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Music</h2>Of course a game with a dancing protagonist needs great music\u2014why else would he be dancing? We designed the game in a way that lets the music artists be themselves. We wanted them to add to the game through their personal artistic expression, rather than ask them to be what we want them to be. This made for a varied and strange combination of music. But since the gameplay is a non-stressful puzzler, you actually have time to appreciate and enjoy the weirdness while playing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Art History</h2>The idea for the game itself stems from art history. We actually started with <i>The Danse Macabre</i> and <i>Death and The Maiden</i> as a basis, and then asked ourselves: How can we make a game about this? Eventually and through several different prototypes, we ended up here. <br> <br>Alongside the production, a history scholar was diving into the art history of Death across more than 10 centuries for a book manuscript he is working on, and every time he hit upon something interesting he told us, and we tried to put it into the game if it fit. There are five different articles by this historian <i>S\u00f8ren Hein Rasmussen</i> within the game\u2014you can unlock them as you progress.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Your First Chapter of Death!
