Those cursed with Black Dragon blood in their veins, whether by bonding with one like the Dragon Knights of Lasserburg do by drinking the contents of the whelpling's egg at birth, or by forced feeding of a living dragon. Whatever the method, the very design of the body is altered from the inside out, all organs cease to function normally, and certain powers begin to flood the embiber. <br><br> Some, not all, are horribly corrupted in the process. Some change appearance completely, some lose their sanity like the Ancient Black Dragon, Malganon, did. All are a threat to life, however, as all must feed off the living, through blood and flesh, to live. <br><br>   It's this need to feed that starts our story and tale of Lucid Soul, the Town of Guillen is housing foolhardy humans that decide it's time to return to harvesting the woods around our castle. Silly little things, but how can they not feel comfortable; the world has Grey Paladins with holy powers governing every hamlet, a Priestess of Medina to relay all activities to others of their order, and above all, no fear of what lies outside their walls. <br><br>This all is about to change...<br><br> Well... for you at least. I make no promises for the others destined to bleed for our Lord's amusement. Hytwart, King of the Goblins, now known as The Enfeebler, the longest living Goblin in history, is a thirsty deviant and it is... after all... our duty to slake his thirst! Elderly, women, children, all are used to feed the ever guzzling gluttony of the Deathtouched. Don't look at me like that, you'll be given an opportunity few others are given: a rare gift... if you survive the trial... A pit both deep and dark... filled with cadavers and meat from ancient raids and conquest.  <br><br>   A singular Black Dragon Egg, relic of the last known nest of the Dark Lady, Umbryss, second concubine to Malganon... shall be your prize. Oh, and we've chosen others to join you in that fetid catacomb buried within our tower...
