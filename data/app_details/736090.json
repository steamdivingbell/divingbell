{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The original soundtrack for Organ Quarter.</h2><br>Locked away in a dusty basement with a computer for 10 months, I was given the task of coming up with a horrifying and yet beautiful soundtrack for a game project. It was about a strange town, with morbid inhabitants and a horrible curse. With nothing but a few images to go by, this is what I created. 41 instrumental tracks (1 hour 50 minutes) of ugly/beautiful/surreal soundscapes and melodies. Perhaps something to take with you on a long ride through a quiet place. For fans of film scores and strange haunting ambience. I would love to know what you think of it. All contributions go towards future artistic/musical projects of mine. <br><br>Thank you for supporting my work. <br>I am truly grateful. <br>- Anadale<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">INFLUENCES: </h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>1970's/1980's Horror films <br></li><li>Akira Yamaoka (Silent Hill) <br></li><li>Nobuo Uematsu <br></li><li>David Lynch <br></li><li>Castlevania <br></li><li>Dark Souls </li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/736090/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1581558698","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/736090/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1581558698","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/736090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1581558698","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/736090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1581558698","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The original soundtrack for Organ Quarter.</h2><br>Locked away in a dusty basement with a computer for 10 months, I was given the task of coming up with a horrifying and yet beautiful soundtrack for a game project.
