You can hunt survivors as Rake by using your hypersensitive senses or play as a survivor yourself, use proximity voice chat and work together with other survivors to either escape Rake, or fight back.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Blind Monster... Rake! </h2>Rake\u2019s vision depends on sound. The less sound there is, the less Rake\u2019s able to see. Rake can hear the slightest bit of noise over huge distances and run at an incredible speed. With traits like these, It\u2019s not hard to guess what Rake could do in the right hands.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1361000/extras/Monster.gif?t=1639062908\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Shh... Be Quiet!</h2>You may be a heartbeat away from being face to face with a monster because of a step you took, a toy you stepped on, or a vase you broke\u2026 But was it your plan all along? You could use noise that objects like a TV or a Radio make in order to distract Rake and escape the area, or maybe to set up a trap instead....<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1361000/extras/Survivor.gif?t=1639062908\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Escape or Hunt!</h2>As a Survivor, you have two choices. Either try to escape by repairing a car and leaving with it, or open a secret armory and hunt the monster down.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Where Am I?</h2>Every match you\u2019ll play is going to be different. Your perks, escape points, roles and the item placement will all be randomized. You will always feel uneasy because there\u2019s no way to predict how the game will go.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1361000/extras/Desc_2.jpg?t=1639062908\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Single player </strong><br>Take your shot at defeating Rake by yourself!<br></li><li><strong>Nightmare Mode </strong><br>The amount of items that are spread across the map is equal to the amount of items you will require.

But don\u2019t forget, Rake will be able to hear your voices too.<br></li><li><strong>Flashlight and Flashbang</strong> <br>You will use an advanced flashlight to defuse Rake. With flashbang effect, this flashlight can stop Rake, but also it can make your friends blind. If you are caught by Rake or your friend is caught, you can stun Rake with flashbang and escape. In order to use flashbang, you have to be sure that your flashlight has enough energy. <br></li><li><strong>The Armory</strong> <br>During the match, survivors will be able to find and open a secret armory in order to acquire weapons to aid them with fighting Rake.
