{"about_the_game":"In 2001, development began on an ambitious Game Boy Advance game based on a popular franchise. Maybe the project was a little <i>too</i> ambitious, because it was cancelled in 2002 and the team walked away. Twenty years later, this game finally sees the light of day, albiet without the original franchise license. Experience the game now in this enhanced, emulated version.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2>Elland, a harsh desert world on the outskirts of the Galaxy. With nothing but scant indigenous life, the planet is controlled by the cooperative Elland Inc, which mines the abundant minerals and crystals used in the construction of Galactic star cruisers. The mining operations and the abundance of Brem-Nar Crystals have transformed Elland from a dusty wasteland into a glittering and much envied prize.<br><br><br>Notorious for its precipitation, the neighboring world of Mank is home to the headquarters of the Trafford Corporation, the largest constructor of space cruisers and weapons in the Galaxy. Trafford is infamously aggressive, using it\u2019s financial muscle and military power to always get what it wants. At this moment in time it wants to control Elland and it will use all and any resources to get what it wants.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>You are Ethan Lancashire, one of the finest of Elland Inc.'s fighter pilots.
