{"about_the_game":"Rebels and Redcoats recreates the battlefields of the American Revolutionary War. The war began in 1775 when the American colonies rebelled against the British Empire, declaring their independence in 1776. In the following years, Britain tried to end the revolt and recapture the American territories. The rebels however had support from Europe, with France and Spain later joining the war as allies to their cause. A decisive American victory at Yorktown in 1781 broke the British resolve and was a catalyst in starting peace negotiations. The war ended in 1783 with the signing of the Treaty of Paris and global recognition of the sovereignty of the United States.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKey Game Features<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u25cf 5 Mission 'Tutorial' Campaign.<br />\r\n\u25cf 5 Mission \u2018Resistance' Campaign.<br />\r\n\u25cf 5 Mission \u2018Revolution' Campaign.<br />\r\n\u25cf 4 Mission \u2018Evolution' Campaign.<br />\r\n\u25cf 4 Mission \u2018Nemesis' Campaign.<br />\r\n\u25cf All missions, apart from the tutorial, can be played as both sides.<br />\r\n\u25cf 37 different historical models representing 26 different unit types.<br />\r\n\u25cf Three classes of troop quality \u2013 Raw, Average and Veteran.<br />\r\n\u25cf New general quality mechanic, affecting command radius and leadership benefits.<br />\r\n\u25cf 14 different troop classes including infantry (line, grenadiers, guard, and militia), light infantry (and j\u00e4gars), light cavalry (light dragoons and hussars), dragoons and artillery (4pdr and 6pdr).<br />\r\n\u25cf 5 types of infantry formation - Line, Column, Open Order, Square, Unformed.<br />\r\n\u25cf New joint Artillery and infantry formations, allowing for effective and resilient combined units.<br />\r\n\u25cf New troop morale mechanic (Disruption)<br />\r\n\u25cf New 'light' woods that block line of sight but don't give a defensive bonus.<br />\r\n\u25cf Detailed Combat Analysis<br />\r\n\u25cf Map zoom<br />\r\n\u25cf Flank Attacks<br />\r\n\u25cf Strategic Movement<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u00a9 2015 HexWar Games Ltd.<br />\r\n\u00a9 2014 Decision Games, Inc<br />\r\nAll Rights Reserved.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025540/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730739974","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025540/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1730739974","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025540/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730739974","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025540/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730739974","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Rebels and Redcoats recreates the battlefields of the American Revolutionary War.
