There is what can be considered (unrealistic) violence against enemies, be it fantasy creatures or sometimes animals. There are horror elements in a fantasy setting and the main character (a detective) uses a gun as well as a fantasy weapon against enemies.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest stages of the game there is In the earliest minutes of the game you see:\r\nA naked body of a woman, preserved in an ice block, not realistically or explicitly shown. Soon after, a man is shown sitting in a chair smoking marijuana in the first circa 10 minutes, described as being for medicinal use, and legal in Boston (the sequence of smoking is not controlled by the player).\r\n\r\nThere is a bar in the game, where alcohol is served, and the investigation (in the past) centers around a murder case - but the violence is rarely realistic. When violent acts are shown in the adventure sections, it's often in service of the story - and the violent acts are often more alluded to (shown with phantom figures or camera angles disguising the details)."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Deadly Premonition 2: A Blessing in Disguise is an open-world survival horror video game serving as both a sequel and prequel to the original Deadly Premonition: The Director\u2019s Cut.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1271100/extras/Image9.png?t=1688546947\" /><br><br>The story takes place in present-day Boston where it turns out FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan will have to revisit a case he thought was solved in 2005.
