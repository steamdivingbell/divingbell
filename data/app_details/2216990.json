{"about_the_game":"Under the Waves OST is a 21-track piece of art composed by Nicolas Bredin, influenced by Icelandic composers such as Valgeir Sigurdsson and \u00d3lafur Arnalds, as well as post-rock bands like Mogwai, Sigur Ros and Radiohead. This ambient soundtrack perfectly illustrates the game's characters and atmosphere through a medidative and melancholic soundscape.
