{"about_the_game":"Today I am born, today I die.  The Neinzul are an insectoid race of perpetual &quot;younglings&quot; that live for an extremely short span before dying and being superseded by fully-aware and vicious replacements.

In this second expansion to AI War, players face off against the Neinzul minor factions, against new AI types in general, and enlist the help of the friendlier members of this new alien presence.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\tEnclave Starships bring a long-awaited feature: mobile space docks. New map types and new capturables add more excitement. Optionally, Hybrid Hives bring a new type of AI logic to the game: these free agents are like a coordinated pack of velociraptors hunting you against the backdrop of the regular AI forces.
