{"about_the_game":"In this game, you wil have to chase and avoid being catched while moving around a cube in space. This unusual cube create power ups and bring menaces from wich you will need to protect yourself and use to your advantage and obtain/retain the glory of being the champion. For this, the players share 3 cameras (one for each fighter), so you won't only develop fast fingers, but also fast eyes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can edit the color of the fighters, their names, controls, among other things.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay alone, with a friend or even with 2 (I personally prefer it with 2 friends ;))<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIdeal to hang out with friends and improve reflexes.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Mirre squares morgh\u016blis","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/789600/985122007a20b7a69400782863ee439dc451380c.jpg"},{"name":"Long he lived","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/789600/c2d701e224898750ba0d04b1c82951510a43b3c8.jpg"},{"name":"Good times with friends","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/789600/fbf4d596ff4e2782c78260f90e166903b0dcdb1a.jpg"},{"name":"Changing history","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/789600/0c35484b3aa64d01a9c61c9c2717e2c37c71dacc.jpg"},{"name":"Traveller of faces","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/789600/a6ee8105bf0ac9ed534a449d1f5866ff893d3639.jpg"},{"name":"The fast one","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/789600/1b8e7cf3ff2fe52d04339b42db17506338f6255c.jpg"},{"name":"The fun has no rush","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/789600/1bd60a0744f2e66990272de89fd6a9ec9bebc200.jpg"},{"name":"Just a coincidence","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/789600/dd2afb0cb4d4a0edee106a1b30339591e23510f7.jpg"},{"name":"Don't care about darkness","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/789600/3b982fe4ca1d4dc7bbf30492cc88c2052fd0607c.jpg"},{"name":"Close encounters of the square kind","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/789600/458b6216800d3faaf59d885cef35f7753d1535f7.jpg"}],"total":10},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/789600/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1681231204","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/789600/page.bg.jpg?t=1681231204","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/789600/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1681231204","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/789600/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1681231204","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In this game, you wil have to chase and avoid being catched while moving around a cube in space.
