{"about_the_game":"Welcome to &quot;Qing Dynasty Cats&quot;, a charming game about finding cats. Set against the backdrop of the Qing Court's &quot;Qingming Shanghe Tu&quot;, the game features 600 hand-drawn cats, creating delightful interactions between cats, historical scenes, and figures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe &quot;Qingming Shanghe Tu&quot; is a scroll painting created collaboratively by five artists from the Qing Palace Painting Academy in 1736 (the first year of the Qianlong Emperor's reign). It is currently housed in the National Palace Museum in Taipei. The painting's layout is intricate, balancing density and openness, nearness and farness, simplicity and complexity. It vividly captures the bustling life of the time with concise brushwork, combining stillness and motion. It depicts the scenery of Bianjing (present-day Kaifeng) and is a highly integrated fusion of artistry and reality, providing a reliable reference for research in architecture, transportation, crafts, commerce, cuisine, medicine, clothing, customs, and more. The painting's unique coloring style is characterized by subdued yet rich colors, concise use of tones, and distinctive brushwork techniques, such as watery strokes for skies, dense strokes for trees, heavy strokes for mountains, red strokes for wooden pillars, bright strokes for beautiful women, clear strokes for figures, vibrant strokes for spring scenes, and stable strokes for architecture, reflecting the basic characteristics of the Qing Court style of large-scale figure painting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-----Game Features-----<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Enjoy a relaxing and leisurely experience while admiring ancient artwork.<br />\r\n- Explore six different scenic settings.<br />\r\n- Encounter 600 cats of various shapes and sizes.<br />\r\n- Immerse yourself in soothing ancient music.<br />\r\n- Delight in adorable cat sound effects.<br />\r\n- Unlock 100 meticulously crafted achievement icons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-----Game Controls-----<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Press ESC to toggle the visibility of in-game buttons.<br />\r\n- Click the hint button to quickly locate a cat in the scene; usable once every 60 seconds.<br />\r\n- Click the game logo on the cover to view the complete high-definition version of the &quot;Qingming Shanghe Tu&quot;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n------------------------","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"5 cats","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2887320/0f3d63e4a2bf61471f7494046f3ef5d1047b1ece.jpg"},{"name":"10 cats","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2887320/8d031f14204a87b547a055def79b99acbb0f376b.jpg"},{"name":"15 cats","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2887320/95c60772761f792ba1ae1d529368d05fd46bbea7.jpg"},{"name":"20 cats","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2887320/0768b9915b9b3ccffb980050ea833163b299f13d.jpg"},{"name":"25 cats","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2887320/04c95fcf78c6595957cf9395314f6be2407485f7.jpg"},{"name":"30 cats","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2887320/27973160b35c885b94dc0783c1a5223ddf8df058.jpg"},{"name":"35 cats","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2887320/306c47242d2aed3ab314cc87da9a2e11273619ae.jpg"},{"name":"40 cats","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2887320/dba85ebcb23bfdd24de40db9b426f310430a0a9d.jpg"},{"name":"45 cats","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2887320/eb79c88d19493e9148b80bbf96783b1a37d2df80.jpg"},{"name":"50 cats","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2887320/dc898f909db932416758af09a4b8fde0d8fbf6d9.jpg"}],"total":100},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2887320?t=1736480002","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2887320/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1736480002","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2887320/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736480002","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2887320/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736480002","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to &quot;Qing Dynasty Cats&quot;, a charming game about finding cats.
