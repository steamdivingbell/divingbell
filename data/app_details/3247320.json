Choose your upgrades carefully and create powerful builds to take on the relentless enemies and epic bosses on a constantly evolving battlefield. Sektori is a game that requires your complete focus, a game where the high-adrenaline visuals, music, and gameplay come together to transport you into another state of consciousness.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Simple, pure gameplay.

With Sektori I wanted to create a shoot'em up where every run feels familiar, but is still completely unique. A game of skill, not memorization. The hand crafted attack waves, levels and even the bosses are combined and randomized and layered with the upgrade systems in a way that creates an interesting challenge for every run. The aestethics of the game are very much inspired by techno music. Fast, detailed, colorful, saturated, intense, aggressive.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dive in and take on the challenge as it comes and have fun! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3247320/extras/steam_gif_NEW_strike_attack_616x60.gif?t=1727849055\" /></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3247320/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727849055","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3247320/page.bg.jpg?t=1727849055","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3247320/44dd4ae67d73015091b88ecfacc2fa734800e48a/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727849055","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3247320/44dd4ae67d73015091b88ecfacc2fa734800e48a/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727849055","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3247320/extras/steam_gif_NEW_bagel_slice_death_616x60.gif?t=1727849055\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SEKTORI [DEMO VERSION]</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Sektori is an intense, fast paced twin-stick shooter infused with hard hitting techno music.
