{"about_the_game":"<i>A quiet manor<br>Loud crash! Big nasty foot<br>One demand: &quot;Wash me.&quot;</i><br><br>It is said that long ago in Japan, there was a certain house.

However, if the foot was not cleaned, then the foot stomped throughout the house and destroyed everything.<br><br>Ashi Wash is our take on this Japanese folktale.<br><br>Ashi Wash is like a haiku. A goofy one to be sure, but a haiku all the same. A single reading of a haiku is short, but it invites the reader to reread it and ponder the layers of meaning densely packed into its few words. Likewise, a single playthrough of Ashi Wash is short, but this surreal game has layers of secrets and meanings that will give you foot for thought. You'll find something new every time you revisit it.<br><br>Want to show your friends your VR setup? Ashi Wash comes with a toe-tally neato VR mode that's great for parties. Everyone will be laughing all night at the absurdity of Ashi Wash! The local high-score list adds some fun competition, too.<br><br>Don't have VR? No worries! Ashi Wash also plays in standard, non-VR mode. In this mode, there are more rooms in the house to be explored (and also some new secrets to find).<br><br>You have three minutes to clean The Foot.
