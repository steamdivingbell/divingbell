{"about_the_game":"Rockin\u2019 Racket is a narrative driven, fast paced, band-management game with an undercurrent of teenage angst. As their big brother, you manage a rockin\u2019 quartet of teen raccoons who desperately want to break out into the limelight. With no money and only the instruments in their hands, it\u2019s up to you to keep this pop punk band afloat. Fix your band\u2019s instruments and keep the crowd\u2019s energy up through fast paced mid-concert minigames. After the event, check in with your siblings, buy better equipment from your neighborhood music store, and plan your next venue. Your siblings provide the talent, but it\u2019s up to you to take them to the top.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"GARAGE BANNED","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2767790/4b98cc53b433018ecad62d03fe3da75579e73e93.jpg"},{"name":"REHEARSAL BLUES","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2767790/f4478b0190a8aadf29f6090eb10561ff77210fe3.jpg"},{"name":"BARYNYARD BASH","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2767790/0c66731639e703b4fa9361f05aa7ffcb8e78bba3.jpg"},{"name":"BATTLE OF THE BANDS","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2767790/cafb18e176892c2dd78c6f7ed88a55cc03c274c3.jpg"},{"name":"HELLHOUND HILL","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2767790/fc529c8d3553e7536e1291220114afe922ec1764.jpg"}],"total":5},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2767790?t=1713542440","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2767790?t=1713542440","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2767790/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1713542440","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2767790/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1713542440","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2767800,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Rockin\u2019 Racket is a narrative driven, fast paced, band-management game with an undercurrent of teenage angst.
