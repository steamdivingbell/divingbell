{"about_the_game":"Allies turned enemies play the central role in the major <strong>Steel Division 2: Blood Feud in Transylvania</strong> expansion, shining a light on an overlooked fight between Axis Hungary and recently switched Allied Romania. The origin of this long-running feud? Transylvania. <br><br>Until 1944, Axis Hungary and Romania are reluctant allies under the ever-watchful eye of Nazi Germany. This frigid partnership collapses with the massive Soviet invasion of Romania that summer, resulting in the swift about-face of Romania to the Allied side. The Battle for Turda takes place in September 1944 and is hard fought, with many casualties on both sides. <br><br>Hungary, keen on regaining greatly wanted Transylvania, doesn\u2019t take long to invade the eastern territories of their former comrade-in-arms. In turn, the hard-pressed Romanian defenders fight tooth and nail on the river Turda, desperately buying time for fresh reinforcements, including Soviet units, to arrive. <br><br><strong>Steel Division 2: Blood Feud in Transylvania</strong> expansion brings an often-overlooked part of World War II history to the game, thanks to a new Army General campaign, dozens of new units, 2 new Aces, and 6 new playable Divisions, including 2 Axis Hungarian and one German, as well as 3 Allied Romanian.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>MAIN FEATURES:</strong></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li>Attack decisively with two Axis Hungary and one German battlegroup: the powerful tank forces of the Hungarian <strong>2.
