Different companies and organizations from around the globe sponsor different competition series and award unique prizes! Bring your Bobos along to the <u>BRAND NEW AND VERY CLEAN SPORTS COMPLEX</u> to enter them into a competition. Maybe you just want to put your Bobo into the <i>Shiny Ruby Competition Series</i> which consists of 5 beginner races on 5 different maps that focus on Bobo generalists who have decent skills in running, swimming, and climbing. OR maybe you want to train your Bobo to compete in the <i>Nimbus Air\u00ae Jump Series</i> which puts Bobos high in the sky jumping across skyscraper rooftops for 3 difficult races. <br><br>Once you get more Bobos, sign them all up for a team relay race!
