{"about_the_game":"In the 1930s the Grumman Aircraft Company was looking for ways to promote its new line of fast biplane fighter-bombers, so in 1936 an F3F-1 was equipped with a 1,000-horsepower Wright Cyclone engine and specially modified for high-stress manoeuvring and aerobatics.<br><br>The standard F3F-1 of the period had a two-blade propeller but the new aircraft was fitted with a three-blade Hamilton Standard propeller of 9ft. diameter. With this power plant on board the aircraft could achieve speeds of close to 300 MPH and could climb at 2,000 feet per minute \u2013 impressive performance for 1936!<br><br>Delivered to the Gulf Oil Company, the aeroplane was flown extensively by Major Al Williams, Gulf\u2019s chief test pilot, to demonstrate the new techniques employed in tactical dive-bombing.
