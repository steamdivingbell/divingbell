A single call by an old friend takes Alan back on his track, leading you to a small town where a boy was butchered. The parents are missing, strange rumors spread among the folk talking of madness that consumed the father. Furthermore, others foretell of peculiar events and occurrences in the Regans\u2019 home. Inspired by various psychological horror games and detective fiction, Alan Sharp takes the best elements of the horror games genre. Using uncertainty and fear of the unknown, above all, it provides a chilling atmosphere for the players to experience. As you investigate the mysterious murder, death lurks behind every corner.
