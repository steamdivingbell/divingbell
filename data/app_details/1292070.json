Reveal a platform to get across a gap. Cut through a platform to drop down past it. Make a ramp by cutting a platform midway, or even use a platform as an elevator to make it to the goal.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dive deeper into a mysterious world</h2>Use your power to venture deeper and deeper underground, through forests, caves, and a mysterious laboratory. Something is compelling you, but what? Why are there holes in reality? What awaits you at your destination?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Relax to no-pressure gameplay</h2>Quick respawn times, forgiving platforming, and a calm ambience make sure that you won't get too frustrated.
