{"about_the_game":"Recovering from uncertain times, your Peeps find themselves on the back of Kewa - a lonely Space Whale journeying across the universe. Building a city on the back of a sentient creature comes with its own set of challenges, but as you build your relationship and travel across the galaxy, you'll come across great opportunities for exploration and stable expansion. Meet other species, pursue the needs and wants of your Peeps, and seek the truth about their ancestors and the Space Whales alike.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2546270/extras/image_01_loop.gif?t=1726439256\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2546270/extras/headline_01.png?t=1726439256\" /><br>The vastness of space is full of mysteries, and as you first arrive at your new home atop the Space Whale Kewa, your Peeps will quickly learn the need to work together \u2013 with each other, but also with their new home. <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>A Home Among the Stars</strong> - Build a sprawling city on the back of a universe-traveling Space Whale as your Peeps seek places to live and work.
