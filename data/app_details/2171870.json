These break down into several general weapon types. Axes, Swords, Maces, Whips, Spears, Flails (long chain variety), Daggers, Shields (which can be used as weapons), and Books (yes books). <br><strong><br>Artifacts:</strong><br>- Over 30 (so far) different artifacts to equip. Artifacts are items that while held (only one at a time) and used, will either be thrown as a weapon or trigger a unique effect. Some examples of artifact effects are, raise dead Templar knights as zombie minions, inflict plagues on nearby enemies, and even cause certain NPCs (and even some enemies) to strip naked (because... why not?).<br><strong><br>Invocations / Summoning:</strong><br>- Korvald will discover ancient rituals and incantations that can call entities from other dimensions. They are heavily inspired by the MANY legendary figures from world mythology and religious folklore, and can range from the utterly destructive (Fenrir, Hades, Y\u0101j\u016bj and M\u0101j\u016bj, Hastur, Michael, Satan) to nurturing and helpful (Freya, Haniel, Medusa, Eir, Ghanesh).
