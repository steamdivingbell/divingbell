{"about_the_game":"This is an action game in which the player builds and controls a giant robot.<br />\r\nThe game features ground crawling 3D maneuvers, customizable elements, picturesque characters, and scenarios.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the ground, the robot can make bold landings and walk on its main legs to maintain an advantageous turn, and jump up to attack its opponents when the moment is right.<br />\r\nIn the air, use barrel rolls and other special maneuvers to move the battlefield with a light, integrated offensive and defensive stance.<br />\r\nThe &quot;Vulture,&quot; a traveling engine, will fight the battle by rotating and maintaining its engines at high speeds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn missions, players can enjoy combat that combines the unique weight and exhilaration of &quot;Vulture,&quot; a giant humanoid weapon.<br />\r\nIn a world occupied by giant exoplanets, stages are prepared for various situations such as melee battles with giant creatures, one-on-one battles between Vulture, ambushes, underground battles, and escort missions.<br />\r\nPlayers can choose the armaments and parts that are advantageous to each enemy to take advantage of the battle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, the customization and actions allow players to choose their own tactics, such as dogfights, guerrilla warfare, assault operations, and sniper attacks.<br />\r\nThrough careful customization, Vulture can be transformed into a setup that suits the player (pilot).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven those who have never been good at action games will surely find that Vulture will respond to their needs. <br />\r\nWe hope you will enjoy the feel of Vulture.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2473720/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732200982","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2473720/page.bg.jpg?t=1732200982","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2473720/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732200982","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2473720/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732200982","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full
