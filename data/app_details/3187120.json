She remembers nothing about the past after receiving powers. She travels the world, helps those she meets and tries to stop demons in different ways. She carries out orders from ordinary and noble people, and also participates in political intrigues. She is also looking for a way to decipher the Prophecy of Oblivion, which is somehow connected with her. On her way, she meets other church demons, from which the player can assemble a squad, since mercenaries mostly try to help each other.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game world is divided into separate locations with the ability to return, which open up as you progress.

Also, among the church demons in the squad, the main character may be absent - a game convention. This is necessary to complete the game - the selection of characters in the squad is part of the build. All characters in the squad are always on the screen, it is possible to switch between them. During the battle, the player controls only the active character, the rest of the squad are controlled by the computer. In cutscenes, the story is told from the perspective of the characters participating in the story, and not in the squad.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If you replay additional activities, then the pumping has a cumulative effect - the progress is not reset.
