{"about_the_game":"Paintball is a top down puzzle game for 1 to 3 players.<br />\r\nYou control three characters (blue, red, yellow) who throw the paintball back and forth. While travelling the ball creates a line. This line has the color of the character who threw the ball. If the paintball travels over an already existing line, the new color and the former color mix together, creating a secondary or tertiary color.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nColorexia, the evil witch possessed by shapes and colors brought 3 guys into one of her dungeons to test her new puzzles. Can you solve them all and regain your freedom?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach of the 32 levels has a given geometric and colored structure that must be copied. Tasks are sorted by dungons (triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons, polyhedrons, free styles).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, paintball - the puzzle game offers a free play mode, where you can create colored shapes without a task. If you like what you created, you can save the level and make it a task.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2816390/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737102304","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2816390/page.bg.jpg?t=1737102304","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2816390/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737102304","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2816390/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737102304","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Paintball is a top down puzzle game for 1 to 3 players.<br />\r\nYou control three characters (blue, red, yellow) who throw the paintball back and forth.
