Players will witness the aftermath of gruesome scenes: bloodstains on walls and ground, dismembered bodies, and corpses. However, the exact details leading up to these scenes were never shown and are left to the imagination. Some cutscenes hint at violence, with characters holding a firearm or appearing ready to engage in physical confrontations, though these actions are depicted through static illustrations rather than animated sequences.
