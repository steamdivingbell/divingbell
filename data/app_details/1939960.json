{"about_the_game":"<strong>You wake up in the morning, go to the subway station to get to work. Then you finish your job and rush to the subway station to go back home. This type of public transportation is essential for us, right? But sometimes despite its importance, subway stations look really scruffy and untidy. They\u2019re just in bad shape, right? Have you ever dreamed of changing it? Make them your little perfect subway? Regardless of your answer, now you can! So be prepared for repairing underground tunnels and decorating them just to prepare the fastest way around the city!</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Renovation</h2>There are so many abandoned subway lines waiting for someone to care for them. So start your underground journey by fixing all damages. Pull out those old, useless tracks and put new, shiny ones. You probably wonder where you can get them or other essential tools. The answer is simple \u2013 it can be bought from the little, private shop made just for you. Btw, you must be warned. Renovating a subway will be a hard and dirty job, but it\u2019ll also be very entertaining! The train full of fun is waiting for you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Decorating</h2>Yes, yes \u2013 your tunnels look really nice now. Good job! But subway maniacs do not live on putting tracks alone. It\u2019s time for some decorating! Create your own, unique design by carefully choosing all elements. Benches, trash cans, posters, clocks or even flowers \u2013 anything needed! You can select nearly everything from a wide variety of available objects. What\u2019s more exciting, some of the stations are based on those in real life! Cool, isn\u2019t it?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Manage</h2>Have you done with building your perfect tunnel? It\u2019s time to prepare for managing the subway. Start with buying some trains. Subway without trains would be just a dark tunnel, don\u2019t you think? Then, hire drivers, prepare routes and timetables\u2026 and that\u2019s it! You\u2019re ready for the first day of being a subway\u2019s manager! Watch over the trains to always be on time and take care of the passengers\u2019 satisfaction.
