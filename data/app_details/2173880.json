{"about_the_game":"A hidden object game where you must find all the bees to complete each level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2>\u204d 1000+ bees<br><br>\u204d 10 unique artworks<br>\u204d Unlimited hints if you get stuck<br>\u204d Restore a small number of bees to a painting so you can find them again! <br>\u204d Additional bee related objects to find<br>\u204d Music and ambiance for each artwork<br>\u204d Achievements<br>\u204d Use your keyboard to move/zoom in if you have no scrollwheel<br>\u204d 3 save slots<br>\u204d Reset progress entirely and play again<br>\u204d Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Context:</h2>The brief was simple. I commissioned artists to create a fantasy world, and hide as many bees as they can inside it. Now it\u2019s your job to find them all! With 10 art pieces to choose from, and 1000+ bees, you will have a lot of searching to do.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Controls:</h2>Use your mouse to move around the image and zoom in / out. When you find a bee, click it and it will disappear. You can also use WASD to move and the arrow keys to zoom.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Difficulty:</h2>A full range of difficulty is included, but all levels start unlocked, your progress is saved as you play, and you can use hints if you get stuck.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get immersed:</h2>Each painting has its own music and ambiance to help you connect with the world, as you search for all the bees.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Replayable</h2>You can restore a small number of bees back into a painting so you can find them again! It\u2019s much harder when there are only a few bees left (especially randomly). You can also use up to 3 save slots so you can replay without progress loss. Alternatively, you can reset your progress for the entire game if you\u2019d like to start over.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Perfect","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2173880/10c3d1c007ef54db811ce47b2c2eb4edb0601031.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Narhwals","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2173880/46a289ccc93776a8a1b23c0c620fcbcc08780c20.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Basketball","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2173880/a1d6a42fd35f4847e3247e1b2c3d6849f2e8beb2.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Puppy Paradise","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2173880/dc9896b92e122e9db633e17cf65a48b4d0ec8794.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Pirate Party","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2173880/c35fa2278ba57ddebe18e36b5866a51a1634bdc8.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Many Flowers","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2173880/bddb0a19342e1af3f63198d161140dafe8a885cc.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Walled City","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2173880/bd65e595e77a048ecdc3b10729dd127b59ea62a6.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Desert Scene","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2173880/417820caa49b68124a6d932e66bb56fbbec92d2b.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Alien Highway","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2173880/03023919b7586040264feb236ac60e212c0632e3.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Moonlit Galaxy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2173880/8decc9d238118e902783e18ef3b94da5086cd20f.jpg"}],"total":11},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2173880?t=1714855274","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2173880/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1714855274","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2173880/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714855274","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2173880/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714855274","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Recommended for you</h1><p><br><br></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>A hidden object game where you must find all the bees to complete each level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2>\u204d 1000+ bees<br><br>\u204d 10 unique artworks<br>\u204d Unlimited hints if you get stuck<br>\u204d Restore a small number of bees to a painting so you can find them again! <br>\u204d Additional bee related objects to find<br>\u204d Music and ambiance for each artwork<br>\u204d Achievements<br>\u204d Use your keyboard to move/zoom in if you have no scrollwheel<br>\u204d 3 save slots<br>\u204d Reset progress entirely and play again<br>\u204d Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Context:</h2>The brief was simple.
