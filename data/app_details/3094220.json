{"about_the_game":"Hey there, fellow gamers! I am the indie developer for the game named &quot;Myst of Guatemala&quot; , which was inspired by a real historical event: The Guatemala Syphilis Experiment.<br>From the 1940s to the 1970s, the US government conducted a series of unethical syphilis experiments on unsuspecting Guatemalans. Local prisoners were subjected to extremely dangerous substances, including drugs, viruses, fungi, asbestos, and dioxins. These experiments were conducted for research in skin diseases, biochemistry, and pharmaceuticals. The prisoners suffered severe physical and psychological injuries, and many experienced mutations or even death.<br>Sound scary?

Following a distress signal from your long-lost comrade Eddie, you find yourself at a mysterious Guatemalan Villa shrouded in rain, facing a huge locked gate. While suddenly dark red blood slowly flows out of the rusted mailbox right in front of you...As you trace your friend's disappearance, you must navigate eerie corridors and outsmart monsters in a relentless pursuit.

Guatemala is a mysterious place, so when I found out about this real event, I was so interseted and thinking hard to conceptualized a horrifying mystery lurking behind it. The truth, in my imagination, should be bone-chilling enough and a righteous investigative reporter will go in alone and uncover secrets hidden in the rainy night with bravery and wit. <br>It's hard to say what's in it for the poor reporter, while I feel it's very engaging as a horror game. Endless puzzles and mechanisms, unexplained psychic phenomena and scary monsters, all of which will make you wonder if this world really exists! I tried to keep a balance between jump scares and an engaging storyline. I want to ensure that every moment in the game is filled with suspense and meaningful engagement as you uncover the mysteries of Guatemala. <br>The game may have a follow-up development program to deliver an even more immersive and spine-chilling experience. So if you have any feedback, I'd love to hear and value it! <br>Thank you for your patience. Stay tuned for &quot;Myst of Guatemala&quot;, and get ready for an adventure that will make your heart race and your mind tremble!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Join Discord:</h2>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3094220/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735546984","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3094220/page.bg.jpg?t=1735546984","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3094220/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735546984","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3094220/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735546984","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"This game has some adult content that may not be suitable for all age groups of players.
