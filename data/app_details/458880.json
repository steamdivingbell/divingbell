In addition, we will lean toward Egyptian style. <br><br><strong>Trap variety</strong>: The game will contain classic traps such as open platforms, which can make robbers fall onto spikes, and also water traps or killer scorpions and beetles. <br><br><strong>Gore</strong>: In Ratalaika Games, we know you like blood, so we have included it. A lot of it. Killing the robbers won\u2019t be enough. \u201dIf it bleeds, we can kill it\u201d, and we\u2019re taking it to the limit. (If you don\u2019t like blood, you can deactivate it :P) <br><br><strong>Levels</strong>: A large number of levels to make sure the robbers will not steal any of your gold, and you enjoy the game to the fullest. A lot of time can be spent on finishing all of them! <br><br><strong>Robbers with feelings</strong>: No robbers are heartless. Throughout the game, players will see robbers in different moods, and they will also interact with each other a little bit. Seeing a hallway full of blood could make a robber sad and break his heart.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/458880?t=1468405552","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/458880?t=1468405552","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/458880/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1468405552","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/458880/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1468405552","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Note: This is a demo version of the game with 12 levels.
