{"about_the_game":"&quot;Starfindr RPG - Starfinder Adventure Path #51: Into the Dataverse (Drift Hackers 3 of 3)<br> <br> The heroes insert their consciousnesses into a digital realm that represents all the information about the galaxy collected by the goddess Triune--including the code that controls the Drift! Unfortunately, areas have been corrupted and to cleanse the Dataverse of this tarnish, the heroes must fight past digital creatures, aid some of the realm's peaceful programs, and confront the avatar of the leader of the Architects atop a stormswept mountain. Then, they'll need to draw out the harmful code like poison from a wound... but the damage has been done. Though the PCs have helped Triune and the Drift return to functionality, neither the heroes nor the galaxy itself will emerge from the Drift Crisis the same! <br> <br> Into the Dataverse is a Starfinder adventure for four 11th-level characters, wrapping up the 3-volume Drift Hackers Adventure Path. Drift Hackers is part of the Drift Crisis, an event taking place across the entire Starfinder game line, in which faster-than-light travel breaks down and the galaxy is thrown into chaos. In addition to the adventure itself, this book includes ways to expand your campaign, an examination of hacking techniques, as well as an Adventure Toolbox filled with a collection of strange alien and technological creatures.
