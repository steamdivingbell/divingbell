{"about_the_game":"<strong>This DLC is not compatible with an account created outside of Steam.</strong><br><br>Haida is a Commonwealth destroyer with unusual properties for her Smoke Generator consumable. It takes a whole 90 seconds to set smoke screens, which means you can do it as you move. This feature makes Haida an excellent key area fighter. She's an unpredictable and difficult opponent for most other destroyers. But even without smoke screens, Haida can go a long way due to her rapid-firing and long-range artillery that deals a lot of damage, and her four fast-moving torpedoes with a range of 8 km.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Advantages:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Six rapid-firing 120-mm guns with good traverse speed and a firing range of 12.3 km.
