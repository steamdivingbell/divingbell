{"about_the_game":"You and your wife live in a peaceful and yet meaningless little village that is currently dominated by Dragonkin. And when you are about to think that you will probably die out of boredom, an over enthusiastic spy informs the emperor himself, that somehow YOU are a dangerous rebel and a threat to his majesty, planning to free the empire from the corruption and violence caused by the emperor and his vile men.<br />\r\nAfraid that you'll kill his sorry ass, he sends his men to capture you and your wife. They succeed and you end up in one of the prison cells of the emperor, alone, not knowing where your wife is. Many times you wished she would disappear, but you got attached to her and somehow you are missing her. You decide that the last thing you will do is NOT rot away in this terrible place, where you are forced to fight other prisoners to the death in the gladiator arena.<br />\r\nYou brew up a plan. A daring plan\u2026 You may not survive it, but staying here locked up is not an option. Fight your way out of this mess, find your wife and restore the world from this wicked leader!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStart your journey in a linear quest line where your neighbor Crenk will learn you the basics of the game. After that you can walk around freely in a large discoverable open world. Level up, train skills, slay bosses, complete quests, and obtain items that will help you to dismantle the empire of the wicked with its evil king!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Weapon Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1308280/0b0c714b3c0e629d75e5e17b6c519fdcfe1170cb.jpg"},{"name":"Crixar Slayer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1308280/2bf11c684a1a6501bc653c88395bc6a0dc664cec.jpg"},{"name":"Wretched Eye Slayer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1308280/ff7edf79d438a746c0537b4e45e17eab5aaf49b8.jpg"},{"name":"Armor Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1308280/37b8c38158aa02584a4c4673e2d59ed8f5713a5f.jpg"},{"name":"World Explorer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1308280/61e40ead57d3c372a6606dd50dbcb28863aaaa04.jpg"},{"name":"Slay Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1308280/3315cb2a84cf63df60f142d175153a1044bc61c2.jpg"},{"name":"Millionaire","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1308280/cb010b923f210cfed356cf389b9e3752e2e8c389.jpg"},{"name":"Royal Reputation","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1308280/f9753d6ad49632cdaaa2479e781f56af9b2ba64d.jpg"},{"name":"Arena Champion","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1308280/7063bd92521efa8ffdbfbf340b6ce4dd89b7a170.jpg"},{"name":"Gladiator Champion","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1308280/ef2893f1639c51f01ffcc9529bd264741299234f.jpg"}],"total":10},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1308280?t=1693902147","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1308280/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1693902147","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1308280/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1693902147","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1308280/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1693902147","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"You and your wife live in a peaceful and yet meaningless little village that is currently dominated by Dragonkin.
