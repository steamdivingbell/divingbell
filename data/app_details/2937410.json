{"about_the_game":"Somewhere in another dimension is a world created from all humanities ideas and imagination. This mindscape is divided into two distinct parts, the exclusive ivory tower known as The Copyright Heights where all ideas and characters currently under copyright live in luxury, and the vast chaotic wasteland below that is The Public Domain. After 96 years of copyright protected status the world's most famous Mouse is thrown out into the cold. Ejected out into the Public Domain with the rest of yesteryear's garbage He must fend for himself and try to find his place in a world where he's no longer the big cheese.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ADVENTURE ACROSS HUMAN IMAGINATION</h2>Encounter places and characters from all throughout the history of media as they are mashed together in a grand story about the structure of civilization and the role that individuals play within it. Stripped of all the power and prestige he has come to define himself by, our favorite cartoon mouse is thrust into a crisis of faith and identity. Desperate for a path back into the Copyright Heights he embarks on an ill-advised journey across the Domain that ends up challenging his closest held notions of individualism, purpose, success, and above all happiness.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">AN UNPRECEDENTED, UNAUTHORIZED ODYSSEY </h2> Every single image and sound in this game is taken from a public domain or royalty free source.
