{"about_the_game":"The British Spitfire is one of the most iconic fighter aircraft of World War II. Most famous for its role in the Battle of Britain, the Spitfire served as Britain's primary fighter during the entirety of the war.

This engine produces its best performance at slightly lower altitudes than the older Merlin 61. Spitfires equipped with this engine were designated LF Mk IX. This was the most numerous version of the Mk IX, with 4,010 produced.

It had a top speed of 409 mph at 28,000 feet, an increase of 40 miles per hour. Its service ceiling rose from 36,200 feet to 43,000 feet. It could climb at 4,000 feet per minute. In July 1942, an early Mk IX was flown against a captured Fw 190A, and the two aircraft were discovered to have very similar capabilities. The RAF had its answer to the Fw 190 problem.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Mk IX replaced the Mk V from June 1942. It allowed the RAF to go back onto the offensive in occupied Europe, and resume the &quot;circus&quot;, &quot;ramrod&quot; and &quot;rodeo&quot; raids. Its first combat success came on 30 July 1942, when a Spitfire Mk IX shot down a Fw 190. Amongst other notable achievements, the Mk IX took part in the highest altitude combat of the Second World War, when it intercepted a Ju 86R at 43,000 feet over Southampton on 12 September 1942. On 5 October 1944 Spitfire Mk IXs of 401 Squadron were the first allied aircraft to shoot down an Me 262 Jet. The Mk IX remained in service until the end of the war, even after the appearance of the Griffon powered Mk XIV.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/411920/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727214523","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/411920/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1727214523","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/411920/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727214523","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/411920/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727214523","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"VR Support","id":31},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The British Spitfire is one of the most iconic fighter aircraft of World War II.
