{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2><br><i>In ages past, there existed a city unlike any other. From the strength and unity of humanity, Niravasi was born.

You play as <i>Mura</i>, a feline archaeologist that finds himself trapped within the titular lost city of ruin after being split off from the rest of his team. Armed with only a flashlight, and a mysterious ally guiding him through the city with his handheld radio, <i>Mura</i> must now navigate the dark streets of <i>Niravasi</i> to find his missing team and make his way out of derelict cityscape.<br><br>But <i>Mura</i> is not the only one living within <i>Niravasi</i>. Guarding it is the <i>Artificial Ecological Overseer Network (A.E.O.N)</i>, an artificial intelligence built to protect and perfect humanity. Together with its robotic proxies, <i>A.E.O.N</i> will do everything in its power to remove anyone who arrives in the city uninvited. Among these machines is a particularly devastating one known only as <i>The Harvester</i>, which will continually track and hunt <i>Mura</i> down until either the latter escapes or is killed. In order survive, you\u2019ll need both your skills and wits to help keep <i>Mura</i> alive long enough to find a way to escape <i>Niravasi</i>.<br><br>Built using the <i>RPG Maker MV</i> engine (and the MV3D plugin), <strong>NIRAVASI</strong> will take you through a world filled with both wonders and horrors. Whether you wish simply to leave the city or explore its most darkest secrets, the throne of humanity offers many riches to those willing to take the leap.
