Start your journey as a fresh Adventurer that has heard the call to return back to the lands of Memora.<br><br>Build your unique character as you explore. Memora Wanderer is a charming RPG that lets you choose how you want your character to develop. Become a master of potions with the Brewmaster, or face the forces of evil with your trusted holy book (it's very good at bashing things!) as an Adept. Each class has a wide range of possible skills, but the choice and freedom is yours to focus on how you want to play it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Main Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Make your character with custom hairstyles and head accessories<br></li><li> Choose your class to gain access to a wide variety of skills and spells<br></li><li> Freedom to choose how you want to play by selecting your stats and improving your equipment<br></li><li> Complete quests to experience the story and gain rewards<br></li><li> No linear path or level scaling<br></li><li> Real-time target combat<br></li><li> Tame pets with unique abilities to help you in your adventure<br></li><li> Find rare items, or collect recipe ingredients to craft gear<br></li><li> Take part in mini games such as fishing for extra rewards</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Style:</h2>A cute mix of Pixel Art characters in a 3D Low Poly world.

Find rare items like monster cards that can fit into your weapons and armor to give bonuses, or hunt a monster for cool head gear to wear.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore Memora:</h2>With a quest driven system, you can explore and find new quest hubs with their own stories. Experience the land at daytime or at night, in the sun or the rain! You\u2019ll be able to take transport to make traveling easier, save your position in certain places, or more depending on your skills.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2937690/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730722644","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2937690/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1730722644","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2937690/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730722644","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2937690/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730722644","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>THE LANDS OF MEMORA ARE CALLING TO YOU!</strong><br><br>Set out on a journey to explore the mysteries of the once abandoned lands of Memora.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ABOUT MEMORA WANDERER</h2><br>Memora Wanderer is a cute nostalgic RPG that pays homage to the ARPGs and MMOs of the 2000s, but as a Single Player!
