{"about_the_game":"In a cold, dark future dominated by mega-corporations, a small lonely planet on the edge of habitable space is the site of a shadowy research facility specializing in necrotic tissue reactivation. You are a scientist who has suddenly awoken to the realization that you are the lone survivor. The rest of the facility\u2019s personnel have all been killed \u2013 micro-chipped and reactivated as combatants by the facility\u2019s central processing AI. <br><br>Teleglitch: Die More Edition is a roguelike top-down shooter with retro pixel graphics. Featuring procedurally generated maps that change with each play through, you will never experience the same facility twice.  Clutch your gun, walk down the dark corridors and enter each new room hoping those last few rounds of ammunition will be enough.
