{"about_the_game":"This is a game pack to know the keyboard and learn how to type.  With four widely different  games I hope this game pack could give people fun and lead people from gaming to learning naturally. It`s not just for kids, even a master of typing could challenge!  This is a long-term personal project. Making a meaningful game is my original intention! I hope that the game will bring happiness to people while growing together! The game is temporarily divided into 4 mini games.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first game is a gold coin collecting game that people who don't know the letters and have not touched the keyboard can also play. As long as you move your fingers and follow the gestures in the game, you will be familiar with the feeling of keyboard tapping.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe second game is an air combat game. While playing the game here, you can fully train your fingers. And as the advancing of difficulty and content, you will slowly become a master of typing and a hero of sky, every five levels has a different boss, Each boss has 10 hard levels you can challenge. This game has much more things beyond your imagination.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe third game is a strategy game based on keyboard combined with typing. I hope that everyone can get different fun through the keyboard. Consolidate your previous efforts. In this game you will be a commander of World War II.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe fourth thing I want to do is more meaningful, that is, the memory and learning of English words. Not only playing words, but also adding memory training content. Get everyone a better English learning tool!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI like games, so I will add some more interesting ways to attract everyone to complete this keyboard typing training. This basic ability that everyone ignores will be a cultivation that every future human must complete!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInitially I just wanted to give kids a fun typing game to help them practice, but if this is interesting, I hope to help more people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you're a computer veteran and can type without a problem, make this a game! Hope you can pass easily! Experience the fun of different games! If your goal is to enlighten your child on computer and typing, you'd better accompany him to complete the first chapter, explain the details to him, and then start the later game experience! This game art is not perfect, if I can have some income, I want to ask someone to help improve the art effect! Thank you all for your support! You made me keep trying!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTry to be one of the most brilliant typing games!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059860/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1557156644","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059860/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1557156644","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059860/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1557156644","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059860/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1557156644","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This is a game pack to know the keyboard and learn how to type.
