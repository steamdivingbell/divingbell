{"about_the_game":"Challenging and fast-paced with a modern twist on old school RPG battle systems, QuestRun is unlike anything you have played before. A J-RPG inspired tactical game with rogue-like elements and deep engaging gameplay. You love RPGs but can go without in depth dialogues and scenario based text? QuestRun is for you - taking you to battle in various themed dungeons. Progress as far as you can with your chosen heroes, die in agony and try again! Apply new strategies, try new heroes, choose new perils and die anyway! Untimely, premature deaths await!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"First Quest","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/286120/bbb494886634a67c18e1e585dd6a9f472fdefaed.jpg"},{"name":"First Dungeon","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/286120/8cac1fea7a85323ef60a93919e19dc152cc6d7c4.jpg"},{"name":"Desert Dungeon","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/286120/e4be08a1de6a34312555ef0bce1587ac721320cc.jpg"},{"name":"First Hour","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/286120/dc3bfe5e929176acec0c92f099858c1ffc6bc9ff.jpg"},{"name":"100 Specials","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/286120/379233a07b325b7c38a5caa98ac898b5e00d787e.jpg"},{"name":"An Hour in Stance","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/286120/d8f46746871cc481276b92f1db244d385a700df6.jpg"},{"name":"100 Items","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/286120/0159b52a1506c3a0ec57d6224935bbdf415cf4be.jpg"},{"name":"1000 Monsters","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/286120/deeaddac649514cfc24475c79cd64cb2a8ee0696.jpg"},{"name":"100 Encounters","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/286120/94f7ae2047dc4eb6c5b2ffab28518ebb8c883e7a.jpg"},{"name":"10k HP","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/286120/d9d081c66e59ad8a0b11498ade9b5bed2c793fd5.jpg"}],"total":13},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/286120?t=1593029296","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/286120?t=1593029296","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/286120/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1593029296","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/286120/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1593029296","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Challenging and fast-paced with a modern twist on old school RPG battle systems, QuestRun is unlike anything you have played before.
