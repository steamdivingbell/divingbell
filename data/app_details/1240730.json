Wall markings and keys within safes are all pretty standard within puzzle games. However, the title's haunting setting is intriguing. A Victorian house full of memories and secrets to be uncovered seems to be the main objective. As your character suffers from amnesia, the many clues that lie around the house will eventually\u00a0explain their reason for being there.\u201d<br>Thegamer<br><br>\u201cDark Room operates via an interesting art style that borders the line between photorealism and pencilling. Seriously, every single item, with the exception of preexisting paintings, looks like it was drawn by a talented sketch artist translating photographs into a pencilled form. Small details like the brownish rust of metal, breaks on a rotting table, the pepperjack tinge of an old suitcase, the yellow fade of a book\u2019s pages, mold on a wall, and dust bunnies gathered up in corners is perfectly depicted in the game as though these were real rooms in a rundown building that someone decided to replicate to a tee.\u201d<br>Flickeringmyth<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1240730/ss_d042c8b95d6ff707a7071bf979fd003b794b3aba.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734432397","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1240730/ss_d042c8b95d6ff707a7071bf979fd003b794b3aba.600x338.jpg?t=1734432397"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1240730/ss_4705d1491a0e19c1aae9503df2357935cc53e828.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734432397","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1240730/ss_4705d1491a0e19c1aae9503df2357935cc53e828.600x338.jpg?t=1734432397"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1240730/ss_e9090532c22a69f7c217537872dddd01678365f5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734432397","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1240730/ss_e9090532c22a69f7c217537872dddd01678365f5.600x338.jpg?t=1734432397"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1240730/ss_55144c489fc383e3d1b0da364b3d9978041daba1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734432397","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1240730/ss_55144c489fc383e3d1b0da364b3d9978041daba1.600x338.jpg?t=1734432397"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1240730/ss_c89003a326eccc5bb83b5e1b064087f26ac60d87.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734432397","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1240730/ss_c89003a326eccc5bb83b5e1b064087f26ac60d87.600x338.jpg?t=1734432397"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1240730/ss_75137a079f975c6e5bd58d2c4346dcb72a2d82c1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734432397","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1240730/ss_75137a079f975c6e5bd58d2c4346dcb72a2d82c1.600x338.jpg?t=1734432397"}],"short_description":"You woke up in a Mysterious place you have never seen before.
