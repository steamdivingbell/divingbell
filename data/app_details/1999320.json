Live the life of a sailor on the free seas.<br>In Sailist, you can control your character in first or third person, and move freely around the interior of a sailing ship. Stop by various towns to buy your favorite ships, ship equipment, clothes for your character, and trade goods. You can even loot other ships if you're prepared enough.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Exploration</h2>Before setting out on a long voyage, players must recruit enough sailors in the harbor and load their ships with enough supplies.
