{"about_the_game":"The art of Cyan began in 1987 when brothers Rand and Robyn Miller lovingly assembled an eclectic collection of hand-drawn, black and white, still images into a fantastic, explorable world called The Manhole. It was a simple start that provided the impetus for the brothers to begin exploring down an evolving path that led to increasingly detailed worlds. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis book holds a representative collection of the visuals along that path - a journey from one world to another - demonstrating the creative attention to detail that Cyan is known for. Follow along with the art of Cyan, and take this chronological journey through Cyan\u2019s own meta-world.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/520873/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1529444366","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/520873/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1529444366","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/520873/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1529444366","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/520873/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1529444366","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The art of Cyan began in 1987 when brothers Rand and Robyn Miller lovingly assembled an eclectic collection of hand-drawn, black and white, still images into a fantastic, explorable world called The Manhole.
