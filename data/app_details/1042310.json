The chilling winds whisper tales of dread as you step foot in Glacial Valley Resort, hiding dark secrets beneath its pristine fa\u00e7ade.

Every corner holds a clue, every step forward unravels a new layer of the enigma shrouding the disappearances that plague the resort. But beware, not all is as it appears, Armed with only your wits and the resources scattered throughout, you must scavenge for vital supplies to aid your quest. From medical kits to light sources and even weapons, the choice is yours on how to approach the mysteries that lie ahead. Will you rely on sheer cunning and stealth, or will you embrace the darkness and wield your tools of defence against the unknown? Brace yourself for a journey unlike any other, where the frosty embrace of Glacial Valley Resort conceals horrors beyond imagination, waiting to be uncovered by the brave and the foolhardy alike.
