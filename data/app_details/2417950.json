{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">OVERVIEW</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Astra Noctis is a combination of early Soulslike strategic combat, Metroidvania exploration, and modern 2.5D side-scrolling environments.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You control the \u201cExile,\u201d one of 12 beings created by the Lord of Time, KAI. Your creator ordered you to protect the Goddess QUOD, The Absolute, The Goddess of Existence, and the most important of all known gods. However, over time, your father\u2019s orders became an attempt to imprison QUOD and deprive her of her freedom. Due to your refusal to comply with those orders, you were executed for high treason. Your body was embalmed and banished from the Astral Plane where the Gods dwell. Until eons later, your oath to protect The Absolute brought you back.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">COMBAT</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The combat system is an attempt to bring the feel of the early Dark Souls to a 2.5D side-scrolling environment. This makes combat seem a bit slower than traditional metroidvanias, but it also makes it more tactical and strategic.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EXPLORATION</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Astra Noctis you can explore several planes of existence with different biomes. Mountains, caves, deserts, jungles and even technologically advanced cities await you to discover them. In addition, for metroidvania lovers, there will be special areas that you will not have access to at first and that will require special skills, or very specific astral weapons, to be able to discover them.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EQUIPMENT</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In this video game there are more than 250 items that can be equipped by the player, among which its 8 different weapons stand out. These weapons encourage totally different play styles. Some are light and fast, others slow but very destructive; it depends on you which one you want to use.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2417950/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730135752","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2417950/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1730135752","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2417950/c5a9e0cc8dbb27c3310f1b5a3a9d452f1d533b0e/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730135752","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2417950/c5a9e0cc8dbb27c3310f1b5a3a9d452f1d533b0e/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730135752","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"The game contains combat with weapons such as swords or maces that can make enemies bleed.
