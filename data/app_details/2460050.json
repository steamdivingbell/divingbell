{"about_the_game":"I got a job as a night guard. They promise to pay a lot, but for my own safety I have to follow strange rules.<br />\r\nAs you progress, you'll have to find keys and open locked rooms. A first-person game with elements of horror.

I've been looking for a job for a long time and have looked at the huge number of jobs on offer.  The ad looked like this. Night security guard required. Pay $80 a night, experience, not required. A bit of information I agree, but pretty tempting for me at the time. I sent my resume in immediately after reading it, afraid the employer would choose another candidate. Surprisingly, not even two hours after submitting my application, I received a reply that they had hired me and I could start tonight.  Which struck me as very strange and I needed to start working that same evening, but that was just the beginning. I was immensely happy to finally get the job. I went to the address listed at 8pm and it turned out to be an old office building. I went in and immediately noticed that it was pitch black inside and the only source of light was through the glass panel in the door, which said security room.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2460050/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1701314273","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2460050/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1701314273","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2460050/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1701314273","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2460050/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1701314273","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"I got a job as a night guard.
