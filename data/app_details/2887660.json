So lean back and take a deep breath\u2026<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2><br>The game starts with a level selection screen where you can choose between many different levels. <br>Once you select the level the actual game starts with a short preview of the level and a little bird who starts flying into the beautiful environment of the level. <br><br>The controls are very smooth and it\u2019s easy to navigate the little bird wherever you want it to go. The main task of each level is to collect a certain amount of memory diamonds that the little bird lost in the unknown wolds.

There are no enemies or any kind of danger and if the player crashes into an obstacle they are simply reset to the position of the last diamond. Collecting the memory diamonds is easy and fun and makes up for a short and enjoyable experience. The player doesn\u2019t need to think too much and can simply enjoy the experience and the beautiful and stylized environments. Once the player collects a certain number of diamonds the level is finished and the player can freely choose a new stage. <br><br>This serves to make sure that the player is most comfortable and slowly becomes calmer and more relaxed. The game aims to release the stress of their daily life and is designed to give them a quiet and enjoyable moment in their otherwise hasty lives.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Level 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2887660/39b8500b077b09e9cf2469a134a4b2efc356e51c.jpg"},{"name":"Level 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2887660/39b8500b077b09e9cf2469a134a4b2efc356e51c.jpg"},{"name":"Level 3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2887660/39b8500b077b09e9cf2469a134a4b2efc356e51c.jpg"},{"name":"Level 4","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2887660/39b8500b077b09e9cf2469a134a4b2efc356e51c.jpg"},{"name":"Level 5","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2887660/39b8500b077b09e9cf2469a134a4b2efc356e51c.jpg"},{"name":"Level 6","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2887660/39b8500b077b09e9cf2469a134a4b2efc356e51c.jpg"},{"name":"Level 7","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2887660/39b8500b077b09e9cf2469a134a4b2efc356e51c.jpg"},{"name":"Level 8","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2887660/39b8500b077b09e9cf2469a134a4b2efc356e51c.jpg"},{"name":"Level 9","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2887660/39b8500b077b09e9cf2469a134a4b2efc356e51c.jpg"},{"name":"Level 10","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2887660/39b8500b077b09e9cf2469a134a4b2efc356e51c.jpg"}],"total":15},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2887660/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725286657","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2887660/page.bg.jpg?t=1725286657","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2887660/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725286657","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2887660/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725286657","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Aery \u2013 Piece of Mind is an interactive game experience that is designed to relax your mind and soul.
