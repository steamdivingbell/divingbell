{"about_the_game":"The Amplitude Engines Bolt-on contains 4 extra amplitude (volume) processing engines to boost capabilities of SFXEngine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFuzz Compression uses compression to add soft distortion, a 'fuzz-box' type effect to your sounds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNoise Gate is a multi-functional noise gate. A noise gate will turn off sounds below a specified volume level and is typically used to remove hiss or undesirable background sounds from a recording. Gating reverb, turning off the reverb when the level drops below a specified point, is another common use for a noise gate. It can also be used for special judder-type effects, to create distortion/interference type sounds, and for many other special audio effects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStereo Amplitude Modulator is a stereo volume/amplitude control. This has greater range than the Amplitude Modulator as well as separate left/right controls. By varying the modulators on each channel this engine can be used to design custom pan-type effects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWire Compression is a dynamic compression effect. Dynamic compression makes loud sounds quieter and quiet sounds louder to make everything a bit more even. In ideal circumstances, the effect is not audible, it sounds natural, but at extreme levels can be used to distort in all sorts of soft and fuzzy ways. Wire Compression uses a volume tracer (the wire) to boost low signal levels and attenuate high levels. This gives it a softer, more analogue sound than conventional compression.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2443102?t=1734436109","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2443102/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1734436109","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2443102/40857924c76aa5d620e49204f678752241a86185/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734436109","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2443102/40857924c76aa5d620e49204f678752241a86185/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734436109","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Amplitude Engines Bolt-on contains 4 extra amplitude (volume) processing engines to boost capabilities of SFXEngine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFuzz Compression uses compression to add soft distortion, a 'fuzz-box' type effect to your sounds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNoise Gate is a multi-functional noise gate.
