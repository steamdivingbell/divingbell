As their stock of medical supplies, food and ammunition runs low, they are lucky to encounter another group of survivors. <br>Roy and Sherry get allowed into their base by word of one of their leaders: Gordon. He invites them inside, even offers Roy work to finance the stay at the base and restock supplies until they\u2019re ready to leave for the U.S. Capital again. Roy accepts the offer, willing to scout dangerous locations overrun by hordes of zombies on the lookout for loot and supplies to gather and sell. <br><br>It\u2019s in Roy\u2019s hands to make sure he and Sherry will reach their goal.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2693380/extras/Banner_Gameplay_english.png?t=1726289294\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Loot and Shoot</h2>Roy will eventually have to defend himself from ravenous zombies on his scouting missions. While it\u2019s possible to avoid most enemies, mowing them down with brute force can be a reliable and satisfying way to fight your way through the apocalypse, as long as you manage your ammo count. Combat options range from melee weapons like a crowbar or an axe to Roy\u2019s trusty handgun and possible gun upgrades.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore and Survive</h2>Each of the scouting locations has its own quest to fulfill or secret to uncover as Roy explores further into the city. Even as new locations get unlocked, the choice remains yours: Scout more dangerous places far away from the base for more valuable loot or stick to closer, less zombie-infested places in exchange for lesser results, the decision is up to you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Interact</h2>The world might be in a grim state, but there's always hope. Roy's actions can impact the life of others, sometimes in direct ways when he's saving another person's life, sometimes indirectly by uncovering a truth. It's a good idea to listen to the people Roy meets at the base and out in the city, they might have valuable information or require your aid.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2693380/extras/Banner_Characters_english.png?t=1726289294\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2693380/extras/Character_Sherry_english.png?t=1726289294\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2693380/extras/Character_Gordon_english.png?t=1726289294\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2693380/extras/Character_Roy_english.png?t=1726289294\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2693380/extras/Banner_Features_english.png?t=1726289294\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dynamic Decisions</h2>Based on Roy's decisions, some people might or might not survive the zombie apocalypse.
