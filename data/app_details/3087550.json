{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Museum of Hauntology is a VR environment  in PC VR format. It is a limited sandbox game intended to make the most of the experiential potential of VR. Built with Unity's High Definition Render Pipeline, the Museum attempts to push what's possible, while retaining playability. The Museum features several different 'exhibitions'; each can transport the player to a  different location to see where items in the exhibition came from. There's no objective in this game. Just like a real museum; take your time and enjoy your visit. But if you do enjoy a challenge, try to unlock the Music Room by finding the hidden four-digit  code.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3087550/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730529185","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3087550/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1730529185","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3087550/b2fd91c885f38f79817e7ec56e0e90b4cb8f34e5/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730529185","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3087550/b2fd91c885f38f79817e7ec56e0e90b4cb8f34e5/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730529185","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Museum of Hauntology is a VR environment  in PC VR format.
