Find them. Align yourself with a community of scavengers and workers, a cell of anarchist activists, a militarized police force, or a wealth-oriented organized crime syndicate. Every character has friends, enemies, and connections, and your decisions will ripple across a complex network of interpersonal relationships. Help the right person and you might find your way into a powerful faction. Betray the wrong person and you might find yourself in bad blood with half the City.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1371230/extras/steampage3.png?t=1722292470\" /><br>Not only do you learn the ins and outs of the City more with every cycle, but your decisions matter across timelines. Knowledge you gain in one through echoes across time to Aurion, allowing him to act with foresight from his past lives. Use this advantage to cut through the lies and bend even the most powerful people and systems to your needs.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1371230/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1722292470","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1371230/page.bg.jpg?t=1722292470","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1371230/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1722292470","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1371230/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1722292470","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"What could you accomplish in just three days?<br><br><strong>4th Dawn</strong> is a cyberpunk themed interactive narrative about finding your path in the face of oblivion.<br><br>Play as <strong>Aurion,</strong> a hermit teenager reintegrating into a dystopian megacity after receiving a vision of his death from another timeline.
