{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">At Blacklands Manor Orphanage, life takes a chilling turn for Esther when a donation box arrives, containing three seemingly innocent toys: a tiger named <i>Mr. Stripes</i>, a panda named <i>Miss Bo</i>, and a rabbit named <i>Mr. Hopp</i>. Esther and her two friends, Molly and Isaac, are delighted and quickly grow attached to them. However, their joy is short-lived as strange and unsettling events begin to occur, centered around the toys. Esther notices strange happenings and an ominous atmosphere that settles over the orphanage. Soon, the situation escalates when Molly and Isaac mysteriously vanish without a trace, leaving Esther desperate for answers. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Determined to find her friends, Esther begins to investigate the mystery of the toys and their connection to an ancient malevolence known as the Entity. Through her investigation, she learns about the dark history of Blacklands and the true nature of these donated toys. As Esther confronts eerie manifestations and deciphers cryptic puzzles, she sets out to defeat the Entity and rescue Molly and Isaac, hoping to lift the long-standing curse that has plagued Blacklands. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Step back into the world of the mascot horror indie hit Mr. Hopp's Playhouse 2, now in this stylized HD remake! <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3143080/extras/hoppA1.gif?t=1738071661\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3143080/extras/hoppB1.gif?t=1738071661\" /></p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Medallion 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3143080/e4a3224ece36d185a5db6a18e6223181d971303d.jpg"},{"name":"Medallion 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3143080/d502e59f93bf436c85941a0c2f23cf8969e4aedb.jpg"},{"name":"Medallion 3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3143080/6848e47ac6ef5976f55be72ce5e6d95c2f978e07.jpg"},{"name":"Medallion 4","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3143080/b59e0c8882c6983d5c7152aab9c763402dc7da17.jpg"},{"name":"Medallion 5","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3143080/a76c3066781913ae2d0ca1d4ff13c8ac0e9d36e4.jpg"},{"name":"Medallion 6","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3143080/ca0e4b4419d57bcf4075a9cdfee34d33a22ce360.jpg"},{"name":"The Wisperer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3143080/7f56f6e33ae09b35d55c20f30f5559d550f70ff1.jpg"},{"name":"The Seeker","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3143080/902fd8a04b96c87dc0c747e374f16757e94975b8.jpg"},{"name":"One Hundred","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3143080/4d0b5be28fd5e39ba4cd35020475bc28157c8ab0.jpg"},{"name":"Silly Rabbit","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3143080/2acf7bb49db67e94e759e0cac423cbe8878e057d.jpg"}],"total":10},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3143080/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738071661","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3143080/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1738071661","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3143080/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738071661","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3143080/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738071661","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Jumpscares and disturbing themes."},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">At Blacklands Manor Orphanage, life takes a chilling turn for Esther when a donation box arrives, containing three seemingly innocent toys: a tiger named <i>Mr. Stripes</i>, a panda named <i>Miss Bo</i>, and a rabbit named <i>Mr. Hopp</i>.
