These all contribute different features/gameplay to the game, and offer a different set of challenges for the player to overcome. With the Timed Levels being intense, to Objective levels being able control of all major objectives across the map. They all offer a new way to play and more content to experience.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Vast Range Of Abilities</h2></strong> Unlock completely different abilities that change the way you fight in battle. Including, but not limited to, a Grappling Hook, Teleportation, and a Ground Pound. These abilities allow you to perform cool feats, and engage with special systems throughout combat, and can be fully customized and tweaked to your liking. Each Ability has different types for you to mix, match, and modify their affect on enemies.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Plenty Of Different Enemy Types</h2></strong> Fight off plenty of unique enemy types, ranging from Exploding Robots, To Heavy Robots, and Light Robots, as well as Turrets. Some robots are more vulnerable to different weapons, and through experience you can find out more about how they behave, and how to defeat them faster.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore Unique Maps</h2></strong> Enjoy and experience a rich selection of over 25 different maps, each with their own layout, structure and vibe. Some of these levels are on planets, either on desert planets, or planets with a high range of flora, while some of them are in space, either in space ships, or destroyed space structures.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Collect Items</h2></strong> Throughout the main campaign, you will find collectables such as art for the game, and themes to style the background of the main menu. These can be used to make the man menu look different for a change of scenery or a fresh coat of paint. The collectables are hidden in most of the levels, and can be found through exploration and a keen eye.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Complete The First Level","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3204430/98a32722f61c6fa2e4dbe7f27d1f16493bf612b6.jpg"},{"name":"Finish The Campaign","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3204430/ace599779e04108f9a2804227013d898a1149853.jpg"},{"name":"Unlock Teleportation","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3204430/a74d4e8a23c6027f29193efd9d028bde3693bb9e.jpg"},{"name":"Unlock Jetpack","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3204430/15148ad9a2f541614da4b712542b3d72b709b0d9.jpg"},{"name":"Solve That Puzzle","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3204430/c75ad78a0b634064932f0766c7838072b0673ca0.jpg"},{"name":"Die","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3204430/45e8eba13d1361503adba9aa9eaccd87a8f37516.jpg"},{"name":"Complete All Tutorials","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3204430/53baf3b0ad74cbea703e6a4cbf7642dddc18114c.jpg"}],"total":7},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3204430/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738853055","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3204430/page.bg.jpg?t=1738853055","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3204430/9e6819fa99688f34187d57ae8533f8037d94f102/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738853055","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3204430/9e6819fa99688f34187d57ae8533f8037d94f102/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738853055","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Variety Of Game Modes</h2></strong> Try out special game modes, such as Arenas, Timed Levels, Objectives, and Puzzles.
