{"about_the_game":"Well shoot, I think it's about time we blast the beast and have a feast!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Beast Blasters&quot; is a show starring Kyle (the leader), Gulp (the researcher), and C Bun (support) where these passionate southern men blast various beasts (often of supernatural origin) in long hunts across the South, saving the victimized counties. And now, with this game, you'll be able to live that big part of their lives. You start as Gulp so you can view his research, which often has key information, and from then on you're able to switch between the three Beast Blasters throughout the hunt. They each have their own special abilities and talents somewhat based on their role, and to defeat the beast, you're going to have to use their specific flair effectively.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd hey, if you do that, you may just blast the beast and have a feast. The county is counting on you to save them from the terror. Do what you can.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2479440/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1689350352","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2479440/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1689350352","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2479440/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1689350352","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2479440/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1689350352","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Well shoot, I think it's about time we blast the beast and have a feast!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Beast Blasters&quot; is a show starring Kyle (the leader), Gulp (the researcher), and C Bun (support) where these passionate southern men blast various beasts (often of supernatural origin) in long hunts across the South, saving the victimized counties.
