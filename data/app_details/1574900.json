{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Salt 2 is an open world pirate game with a focus on exploration, crafting, survival and RPG elements.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You wake up stranded on an island and must find resources to build a raft and head out to sea. Your ship will act as your traveling base as you set sail in any direction you want, exploring islands filled with hundreds of hand crafted caves, ruins, pirate forts, and other mysterious places. Follow the main storyline to uncover the mysteries of the world or join various guilds and earn a name for yourself. Craft powerful weapons and armor, hunt and fish for survival, level up your character unlocking unique skills and talents for your gear, and decorate your ship, making it your home at sea. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1574900/extras/Sailing_Gif_1.gif?t=1737641158\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What Makes Salt Different Than Other Pirate Games?</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>In Salt 2, we've prioritized the single-player experience, with an emphasis on exploration and PVE content.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game can be as relaxing or as adventurous as you want. You don't need friends to help manage your boat or have to worry about being attacked by other players. This isn't a game with naval combat, but is focused on PVE content such as decorating your ship, going on quests, and exploring tons of unique locations. A huge focus has been put on making your ship your home base at sea. We've added over 100 different ship decorations you can place anywhere on your ship. Plus, the world is procedurally generated so you can explore in any direction for as long as you want. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1574900/extras/Beached_Ship.gif?t=1737641158\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore an Infinite World</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Salt 2 is about pure freedom. You start in the middle of a vast ocean, pick a direction, and set sail across a procedurally generated world. Navigate the seas with a compass and sextant, using map coordinates as your guide to new locations. Discover uncharted islands with ruins, pirate camps, seaports, and over 200 unique dungeons all filled with loot and lore. Even though the islands are procedural, our points of interests are hand crafted with unique secrets, puzzles, and design.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1574900/extras/Ship_Customization_GIF.gif?t=1737641158\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Travel With Your Base</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your ship is your home at sea. While exploring the world you will find all kinds of items to craft and decorate your ship making it unique to you. You can place items virtually anywhere on your ship and customize it as you see fit. While traveling the sea you can also craft items, cook food, and fish for survival.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fish and Hunt to Survive</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You\u2019ll need food to survive. Grab a fishing pole and toss a lure overboard to catch some fish or grab your bow and head into the woods to hunt some wildlife. Once you've got your ingredients, it's time to start cooking. With over 50 different meal recipes to discover, you'll constantly be on the lookout for a new recipe that will not only keep you alive, but give you passive benefits as well.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A World You Can Live In</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We wanted to create a world that you could not only get lost in, but live in. You set the pace of your adventure and decide what you want to do. Maybe you\u2019re in the mood to go on epic quests and hunt down a world boss, or maybe you just want to relax on the shore and catch some fish. The choice is yours. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fight Legendary Enemies</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The islands are full of dangerous enemies. Fight legendary pirates, skeletons, bosses, and dangerous wildlife in your hunt for adventure.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Craft and Upgrade</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you explore the world you will discover tons of resources that can be used to craft new items, armor, weapons, and decorations for your ship.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Level Up</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Character progression is an important aspect of Salt 2. Level up your character and skills unlocking new world tiers, crafting recipes, and other upgrades. With each new world tier comes more difficult enemies and rare loot.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Delve Into Dungeons</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We've taken a lot of inspiration from games like Diablo and Skyrim when designing our dungeons. While exploring the world you'll discover caves, crypts, ruins, temples, and other dungeons full of secrets, enemies, puzzles, and unique loot. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Loot Epic Gear</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Salt 2 features an RPG style loot system with different rarities of armor and weapons, and interesting stats to tailor to the play style you want. Each piece of gear also has randomized talents. So whether you are crafting a high level item, or hunting down a pirate captain for an epic sword, you'll always be searching for that new rare item with the perfect roll. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Go on Quests</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dock your ship at a sea port and pick up quests and commissions from guilds, the townsfolk, and merchants.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About Lavaboots Studios</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We're a two man development team at Lavaboots and our goal is to make fun and exciting games that inspire adventure.
