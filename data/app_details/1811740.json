I love that The Plague Doctor Of Wippra exists. It\u2019s such a specific moment in time to capture, the brevity of an adventure-short being the perfect medium.&quot;</i><br><strong>Recommended</strong> -\u00a0, John Walker, UK</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>&quot;With The Plague Doctor of Wippra, I experienced a wonderful adventure that had coherent and logical settings, so that it is worth playing through a second time in the hope of getting a different ending. &quot;</i><br><strong>84/100</strong> - gamers-palace.de, Germany </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>&quot;The Plague Doctor of Wippra isn\u2019t perfect, and its brevity may be a turn-off for some. However, the story it offers is genuinely compelling and worth your time. It\u2019s a reflection on how far humanity has come in the last 500 years. And, more importantly, it\u2019s also a reminder that there\u2019s still plenty of work to be done.&quot;</i><br><strong>80/100</strong> -  </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>&quot;The Plague Doctor of Wippra has many merits worth your attention. Its storyline can slowly hook you in and you'll just want to find out how the story ends. The beautiful orchestrally tuned soundtrack is definitely a big plus, as is the full support for the Steam Deck, through which I reviewed the game itself. If you like classic point &amp; click games and would like to take a short trip to the plagued Middle Ages from the position of a doctor, The Plague Doctor of Wippra is exactly the right title for you.&quot;</i><br><strong>81/100</strong> - , Czechia </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>&quot;There are only a few minutes that have to pass before you are faced with the first case, and that is the only one that puts you in the dilemma of whether or not to continue playing, but as soon as you turn on the light of wisdom, and that of the house where the race against the plague begins, you will know that you will want to give the game so much to finish it because no puzzle should defeat you. This is the mentality you must take if you want to be victorious in The Plague Doctor of Wippra.&quot;</i><br><strong>80/100</strong> - , Spain </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>&quot;The Plague Doctor of Wippra is in fact a story about the role of medicine, information and politics during a pandemic crisis, and it offers clear parallels between the response to the plague and the events following the global spread of COVID-19. [...] The Italian translation is excellent.&quot;</i><br><strong>Recommended</strong> - , Italy <br> </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>&quot;Those who play the point-and-click adventure game &quot;The Plague Doctor of Wippra&quot; will have to act as a doctor in the Harz village of Wippra during plague times - and will have to deal with conspiracy ideologies. A successful mixture of game and educational content.&quot;</i><br><strong>Recommended</strong> - deutschlandfunkkultur.de, Germany </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>&quot;The Plague Doctor of Wippra is, without a doubt, a truly different title, with an approach to historical fiction that departs from the video game canons (along the lines of Ambition: A Minuet in Power) to take the most interesting aspect of the historical novel: the fascination with a specific period and the different lines of thought that formed it.&quot;</i><br><strong>70/100</strong> - , Spain </p></li></ul></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Experience a working day as medieval German plague doctor Oswald Keller.

If you like your adventures games to be deep rather than funny, this one is for you.\u201d<br>8/10 \u2013 <br><br>\u201cTo conclude, The Plague Doctor of Wippra is a very serious Point &amp; Click, which immerses us perfectly in its universe and its rather dark atmosphere.
