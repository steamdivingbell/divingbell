{"about_the_game":"This is a Virtual Reality experience. It is the first in a series of three &quot;VR Paintings&quot; painted by me for you to enjoy in full room scale VR with interactive elements and abstract sights to experience. Experiencing this in VR is like being shrunk down and injected inside the fabric of a painting. You no longer look at the painting on the wall but walk through it and explore its hidden corners of wonder! This first VR painting is focused on the theme of &quot;time&quot; and time in a VR panting can be as amorphous as it is strange. Is time in VR the same as outside VR? Does it stop adhering to our previous understanding of time and require a new approach? These are things to consider as you traverse the VR painting spacetime!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you download this VR experience you will enjoy exploring an abstract VR space with calming sounds and interesting sights! Interactive elements for you to engage with such as physics particles! The intention is that this is a therapeutic experience and that it can be a place to relax, meditate or just explore inside a painting reality! It is the first in a series of three Virtual Reality paintings I have produced for viewers to enjoy in VR exploring the temporal-spatial nature of the VR media within the wider context of contemporary fine art painting. Available to download and experience right now! I hope you enjoy it and I look forward to sharing the next Virtual Reality painting in the series with you soon! This is a room scale experience and includes a teleport system to move your room area around the scene. I chose this as it provides the least chance of causing VR sickness.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo interact with the particles just move your controller near them and watch them follow it, you  can also pick some of the small balls around the scene just put your controller near them and if they have a yellow outline you can click and hold to pick them up and throw them around! If you launch this with steam VR active it will launch in the VR mode if you launch without a VR headset attached it will launch in regular mode and can be experienced by using wasd and a mouse (you can only fly in normal mode not VR mode). You can now also edit your quality settings!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease note this is not an app to make your own painting but a pre made painting for you to experience and interact with in VR. &quot;VR Painting: Time&quot; is a piece of art for you to enjoy! Much like a traditional painting on canvas the only change is that instead of hanging it on your wall you walk through it in VR! Own your very own piece of VR painting art, yours to keep now and forever!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2190500/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1688203993","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2190500/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1688203993","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2190500/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1688203993","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2190500/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1688203993","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This is a Virtual Reality experience.
