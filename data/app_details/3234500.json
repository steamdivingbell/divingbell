{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your city is under attack by &quot;you know who.&quot; Bombs are flying by the thousands. The forecast predicts very hot, dry air for the next minutes before a nuclear winter. Atomic City is a bullet hell with one minute waves.

You can use the middle mouse button to swap equipped weapons. </p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>You start with basic weapons, which have infinite ammo.</strong> Adjust your aim; enemies are moving.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Supplies emerge from remains.</strong> Let them land to equip them. Weapons will equip the side where they land. Shoot them before landing for gold coins.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>New weapons are powerful but have limited ammo, and once depleted, you will fall back on the basic weapons. </strong>Keep an eye on your ammo reserve.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Each wave of attack lasts one minute.</strong> Survive to access the shop where you can buy new supplies.
