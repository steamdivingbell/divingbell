You will fight many hostile creatures as you navigate the <strong>three distinct regions</strong> surrounding the city. <strong>Gather ore and gain coins</strong> to spend on <strong>upgrades</strong> when you return home. While you're there, chat with the <strong>local inhabitants</strong> and get to know them. This is Project: NEO.

Considering it's the first game we have created on our own, we are proud and confident in how our <strong><i>project</i></strong> turned out. However, we are also aware that the game is not perfect, but as we worked through it we treated it as a learning experience to grow our skills so that we can create games that provide the exact experience a gamer wants in their game. We hope you enjoyed this little <strong><i>project</i></strong> we put together. -Project: NEO Team","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2667100/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1713230451","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2667100/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1713230451","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2667100/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1713230451","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2667100/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1713230451","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Project: NEO is a <strong>sci-fi action roguelike game.</strong> You play as a newly-hired \u2018Planet Adventurer\u2019, whose job is to set out and <strong>explore</strong> the exciting yet dangerous areas beyond the city.
