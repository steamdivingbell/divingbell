{"about_the_game":"You\u2019ve wandered through valleys and hills, savannas and frozen forests but now, it\u2019s time to explore our latest reserve in South America. Parque Fernando has asked for your aid in turning an otherwise wild slice of Patagonia into world class hunting grounds. Roam through the gnarled trunks of the dead forests, traverse the swamps and hills, and make your way across the grasslands as you open outposts, build lodges and prove yourself to the reserve\u2019s fierce owner, Carolina. Only time will tell if you can turn the reserve into a hunter\u2019s paradise.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PARQUE FERNANDO\u2019S FAUNA</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/986850/extras/Fernando.gif?t=1648647742\" /><br>Buzzing with life, Parque Fernando sports a large range of wildlife. Get ready to spot a vibrant Cinnamon Teal taking flight, or a Blackbuck pronking as you make your way across the reserve. Not to mention the fact that the park nourishes some the biggest, most exquisite bucks you\u2019ll ever hunt, like the Mule Deer, Red Deer and Axis Deer. Just remember: you are not the apex predator here. That job belongs to the Pumas, and they don\u2019t like to share. This majestic feline can be spotted stalking and chasing after its prey and if you\u2019re especially quiet, you might even find catch one feeding on its prize.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LUSH AND VIBRANT FLORA</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/986850/extras/FGernando-_smalFlora.png?t=1648647742\" /><br>Framed by hills, Parque Fernando houses a variety of environments to explore.

It\u2019s up to you if you want to explore off the beaten path and discover the secrets of the reserve, or if you decide to take on the captivating new story, with 16 new narrative missions, and 39 side missions. <br><br>Through the years, Carolina met the demands of leading her family and her real estate business, but at a price. While she never had enough time to tend to the unfinished reserve, she was always determined to one day finish what she and Fernando started.
