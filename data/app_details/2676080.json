However, the sadistic entity decided to make a proposal that's very hard to resist. In exchange of one more life taken, your soul will be destroyed when your body dies, freeing you from the Judgement of God and, as a consequence, from eternal damnation.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2676080/extras/TQE-GIF-01.gif?t=1728059621\" /><br><br>Your mission is simple.
