{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Shadow of the Demon Lord Monstrous Pack 4 - The Horrific Monsters</h2>  A collection of four Monstrous Pages based on the theme of horrifying. This pack consists of the following Shadow of the Demon Lord products: <br> <br> <strong> Horrific Parasites</strong> <br> <br> Lurking in dark alleyways or hiding in plain sight on bustling streets, the enigmatic and damned creatures known as harvesters stalk and murder the innocent to fulfill peculiar needs. Named for their acts of killing and surgically removing organs, bones, and skin from their victims, harvesters have been horrific parasites on civilization for millennia. <br> Harvester bodies are literal patchworks of organs, limbs, and bones, none of which are their original parts. When an organ begins to fail, a harvester removes the damaged, diseased, or aged one, replacing it with one from a healthy &quot;donor.&quot; This grotesque practice grants them near immortality as they do not appear to age in any traditional sense--some harvesters are hundreds, even a thousand, years old--dying off only when they are caught and killed or when they are unable to replace a critical, failed organ. <br> Because harvesters never venture away from cities and towns, there is always ready supply of fresh organs from the unwitting populace. This entry in the Monstrous Pages series examines the harvesters and lays bare their secrets, revealing their origins, practices, and place in the lands of R?l. Using the lore and rules in Horrific Parasites helps you make harvesters even more dangerous and terrifying! <br> <br> <strong> Night Terrors</strong> <br> <br> When the bloodsucking giants descended from the mountains to either side of the Arrach Dell, the wise people fled and the rest vanished, leaving their squalid hamlets empty, abandoned, and all too quiet. The last person to try to stake a claim on the Old Marsh Tower was never seen again, though his unsettled henchmen reported hearing strange flapping sounds from the upper chambers. And who could forget the headless horseman whose steed carries him riding through the fields of Low Country, snatching up the fools who dare venture out at night? The lands teem with nasty things, things that have grown bolder in these troubling times. <br> Night Terrors presents a collection of nasty monsters for use in your Shadow of the Demon Lord games. All drawn from legends, these creatures possess unsettling capabilities that make them a perfect fit for horror fantasy adventures.\u00a0 <br> <br> <strong> Odd Monsters</strong> <br> <br> From the hills and mountains come the boggarts, a monstrous breed of savage and violent people, weird in form, disturbing in their awful desires. Odd Monsters dives deep into the lore of this strange breed, examining their origins, lairs, motives, and more. In addition, this Monstrous Pages entry includes rules for adapting boggarts and presents three killer variants: the elusive boggles, brags that can transform themselves into ordinary objects, and the magic-using bugganes! Written by Robert J. Schwalb, author of Shadow of the Demon Lord, and illustrated by Pat Loboyko of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay fame, this supplement gives you everything you need to deploy these hideous monsters in your games! <br> <br> <strong> Unholy Champions of the Demon Lord</strong> <br> <br> Unholy Champions of the Demon Lord reveals six vile demons conjured from the imaginations of six talented supporters of the Shadow of the Demon Lord Kickstarter campaign. Each demon acts as the seed for an entire campaign, a terrifying monstrosity with which you can test the mettle of your groups in the last days of a dying world. <br> <br> <strong> Combat encounter maps included: None</strong> <br> <br> This pack features the following: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li> Over 30 NPC entries, included such horrific creatures as the Bloated Duchess, the Two-headed Boggart, and Yg'zg'zor, the Living Wrath <br> </li><li> A detailed discussion of the secrets, origins, and practices of harvesters <br> </li><li> Lore about the origins, behavior, and tactics of boggarts <br> </li><li> A demon-possessed suit of armor that makes you stronger as you become more corrupt </li></ul>   &quot;","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2424460/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1684848439","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2424460/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1684848439","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2424460/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1684848439","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2424460/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1684848439","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Shadow of the Demon Lord Monstrous Pack 4 - The Horrific Monsters</h2>  A collection of four Monstrous Pages based on the theme of horrifying.
