{"about_the_game":"This is a unique twin-stick arena shooter where your own actions define the difficulty. Shoot recklessly at the walls and you will drown in enemies, but shoot too little and you will have a mediocre score. Observe the different monsters's behaviours and be strategic in the way you fight them. The more monsters there are in the arena, the more points you get for each one defeated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnlock and play in 8 different arenas with their unique monsters, take on contract levels to defeat specific sets of monsters, unlock clan levels for monsters you've seen on each of their 5 evolutions, take on seeded daily challenges which keep throwing new sets of monsters at you until you die, or play the gauntlet mode where you win coins and shop for upgrades that will last you until you run out of lives!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game plays either with mouse and keyboard, or with a game controller. You can play singleplayer or co-op with 2 to 4 players. A play session can take anywhere between 5 minutes and multiple hours depending on the game modes you take on and how fast you tire out! Perfect for both coffee breaks and extended play sessions!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game also features a festival mode which you can enable and modify in festival_mode.txt! Festival mode features a new game mode made of levels defined in festival_mode.txt, with a proper arcade-style leaderboard with 3-letter alias input! It also features aim-assist and takes away the fullscreen option, so you can safely launch the game on a computer, hide the keyboard and let people play it without any issue. Like the main game, this mode supports up to 4 players, with 4 controllers, but can also be played solo.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBanging original soundtrack by Pentadrangle!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Explorer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2832620/ab348e9857b3eae0b37cfe06b144cf246e583d24.jpg"},{"name":"Noble","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2832620/7d7eb18e911918844ecd501288911d2602c5d50b.jpg"},{"name":"Prince","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2832620/75c260083891c73b7451836bb8919351d4cce8e2.jpg"},{"name":"King","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2832620/b91e9b77d7bd06bfabd2690d756333bc76016b51.jpg"},{"name":"Emperor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2832620/06d21414c56d5081643506e12805b2547c31266a.jpg"},{"name":"Newcomer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2832620/dbf7444d288bcb97dabf0760b6d36af86e0c51a8.jpg"},{"name":"Freelancer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2832620/4f6c8dc46cbcc72707527c6246932ae03f5afbfe.jpg"},{"name":"Manager","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2832620/1073fcbca275696979e45f2ea14bbd3fffa99250.jpg"},{"name":"Advisor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2832620/eeea841a5382a2f238a4415ab00ab248a49f0a48.jpg"},{"name":"CEO","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2832620/edbd1430d6ad700ff5925c772dd984281c43e3b1.jpg"}],"total":25},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2832620/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1712925564","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2832620/page.bg.jpg?t=1712925564","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2832620/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1712925564","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2832620/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1712925564","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":2832920,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"This is a unique twin-stick arena shooter where your own actions define the difficulty.
