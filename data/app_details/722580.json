Plan ahead, gather supplies and make the best run you can. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe campaign starts with the SDFs fleet on it's last legs. Once a sprawling civilization, humanity is now the resistance. <br />\r\nIts your job as the last Dreadnought's commander to lead the way back into the Inner Colonies before the time window closes and the fleet is cut off.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo fight the alien horde you'll need to use all the weapons at your disposal.
