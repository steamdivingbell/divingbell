{"about_the_game":"Restless souls, denied proper burial or wronged in life, can return from beyond the veil as vengeful spirits. In the ominous world of Dirge, these tormented entities take form as Revenants, powerful hybrid monsters with the ability to traverse the Shadow Realm and manifest indefinitely in the physical world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Origin of Despair:</h2>The haunting legacy of the Revenant traces back to the nightmarish horrors endured as a patient within the Insane Asylum of the City of Wakefield. The unspeakable traumas suffered in those walls birthed a malevolent force that refuses to be forgotten.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Haunting Abilities:</h2>The Revenant is a relentless pursuer, capable of seamlessly moving between the Shadow Realm and the physical world. Its Shadow Jaunt ability serves as a deadly tool, closing distances unseen for surprise attacks or making a swift escape in times of need.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tactical Encounters:</h2>Unlike its monstrous counterparts, the Revenant can be temporarily subdued with mundane weapons, but victory requires overcoming its health regeneration. Hit-and-run tactics and haunting assaults become crucial strategies, allowing investigators to whittle down the Revenant's defenses.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cunning Tactics:</h2>An intelligent Revenant player excels at singling out lone or paired investigators, focusing on defeating the team one at a time. High mobility, paired with health regeneration, makes the Revenant a formidable adversary, striking fear into the hearts of those who dare to face it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Play as the Revenant:</h2>Delve into the darkness of Dirge and become the Revenant itself with this exclusive DLC.
