{"about_the_game":"Post-Apo Machines is a first person simulation tower defense game set in the devastated, post-war universe. Imagine that you are all alone, protected from hordes of zombies only by a wall around your ruined city. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd the wall that is slowly starting to crumble. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the Post-Apo Machines your task is to defend what is left of human civilization. To do that, you'll have to use all you can find in the hostile, deserted environment. Explore the city, find tools and weapons, repair vehicles, build cool, post apocalyptic machines and use them to fight zombie invasion! Remember, once the wall is down, our civilization is no more.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/793130/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729085664","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/793130/page.bg.jpg?t=1729085664","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/793130/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729085664","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/793130/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729085664","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Post-Apo Machines is a first person simulation tower defense game set in the devastated, post-war universe.
