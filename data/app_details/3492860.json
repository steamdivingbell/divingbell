{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In this strategy auto battler you will create a powerful hero by choosing your own rogue-like adventure.

At the end of each round you then auto-battle against another player's character in a PvP matchup. We use an asynchronous match-making system which means that you can take as long (or as short!) as you want to make your turn. There are no round time limits.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Ranked ladder with skill-based match-making: Play against other players of your own skill level for a fair and engaging experience.

This means that the units which appear in player's shops are randomly sampled from a shared pool, and when one player purchases a unit that unit can no longer be found by other players in the lobby. Auto Adventures uses a<i> globally</i>\u00a0shared item pool, where the pool is shared across<i> all</i> players. This means that popular items will automatically become rarer, preventing every player from choosing\u00a0 the same over-powered items and ensuring\u00a0the meta stays fresh and varied.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Auto Adventures is, and will always be, free to play with cosmetic purchases only.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3492860/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738831816","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3492860/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1738831816","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3492860/e6382ecad3ce378a58affac15b3001eeb097cc28/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738831816","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3492860/e6382ecad3ce378a58affac15b3001eeb097cc28/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738831816","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In this strategy auto battler you will create a powerful hero by choosing your own rogue-like adventure.
