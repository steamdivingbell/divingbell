But Gnaw was not a beast that could be caged: his acid-breath melted his holding pen and Gnaw started to rampage through the science facility where he was held. No-one knows exactly what followed, but the facility was found 12 days later, abandoned, and overgrown with some sort of weird, toxic flora.<br><br>Gnaw was eventually noticed by a passing band of Amphibian cosmic biker-pirates.
