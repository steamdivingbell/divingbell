{"about_the_game":"&quot;reIterate(), much like the channel that spawned it, is a lesson in game design&quot; - <strong>RoseTintedSpectrum </strong><br><br><strong>reIterate() </strong>is a fast-paced 2D platformer with a focus on precision and fluidity, with a strong contrasting aesthetic and a retro-future soundtrack.<br><br><strong>reIterate()</strong> has a classic purity that\u2019s all about getting from the beginning to the end, navigating familiar but challenging hazards like spikes, spikes, some spikes, and also, some spikes. They rotate, they spin, they shoot out at you, and sometimes, they just sit there. <br><br>Along the way, you\u2019ll master wall-jumping, double-jumping, bouncing, springs, vanishing platforms, moving platforms and even portals as you leap from level to geometric level, moving along, up and down the screen to put in your best possible performance over 60 challenging and varied stages.<br><br>Then you can leap into the dedicated Speedrun Mode to really test your abilities and (possibly) become a Twitch sensation with your mad speedrunning skills.<br><br>reIterate() is ultimately designed to represent a game from a theoretical retro console that never actually existed.
