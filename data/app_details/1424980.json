Campaign, Campaign Plus, Daily Hotspots and Skirmish (choose your own suits and powers) are take-at-your-own-pace experiences that fit into your schedule. Countdown mode is a place to test your skills with nuanced powers against a ticking clock. This game is endlessly replayable. </i><br><br><strong>Are there microtransactions?</strong><br><br><i>Nope. We know we made a card game, and we know that there\u2019s a risk you might think this game will charge you for unlocks, speed bonuses or aesthetics. We won\u2019t. We may come up with a cool DLC at some point, and if so, will probably charge in the traditional way, but we won\u2019t be charging you for double XP or a particularly shiny new colour theme.</i><br><br><strong>Is this Bithell Short an entry in the \u201cCircular\u201d series?</strong><br><br><i>No. While our previous Bithell Shorts (<i>Subsurface Circular</i> and <i>Quarantine Circular</i>) have been twists on the text adventure, <i>The Solitaire Conspiracy</i> is a new take on solitaire. We love storytelling and world-building, so it absolutely contains a full narrative experience, which we\u2019re telling via full-motion video (FMV) and in-game lore. We decided to use the Bithell Short name to signal something digestible and original. Thanks for continuing to support these odd experiments between our larger projects.</i><br><br><strong>If this game is \u2018short\u2019, what\u2019s to stop me getting a refund when I\u2019m done?</strong><br><br><i><i>The Solitaire Conspiracy</i> is our third Bithell Short (and with continued support from the player base our biggest). Our previous two games, <i>Subsurface Circular </i>and <i>Quarantine Circular</i>, both have a return rate of less than 2%. Steam players have shown us that they understand the work that goes into games, and are up for paying for ones that entertain them. Thank you (again).</i><br><br><strong>Do I need to have played other Bithell Shorts games to enjoy this one?</strong><br><br><i>Not at all. <i>The Solitaire Conspiracy</i> is an entirely different game from <i>Subsurface Circular</i> and <i>Quarantine Circular</i>. It tells its own self-contained story set in a world of spies and intrigue. Of course, our games are all set in a shared universe, so expect some mentions of old friends.</i><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1424980/extras/SOLCONmodes600.gif?t=1623405126\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Tutorial Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1424980/a79c430f863373afebb2946856c8b94476af4395.jpg"},{"name":"Blood Brothers","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1424980/0d443def3edccb68b6cb45544c46ec455500966a.jpg"},{"name":"Plan in Progress","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1424980/62e8584356b894c42e45e9d7a9658d41d794f6eb.jpg"},{"name":"Family","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1424980/c470ba81bec05fe432cc34bba10347bf3c25a7fe.jpg"},{"name":"Mysterious Friends","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1424980/df8616a97d43860b0b883a855e5e3308f167b838.jpg"},{"name":"Best of Us","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1424980/1c6b056b49a2d05f60262cf87a49e7b2e1c7241d.jpg"},{"name":"Friendship and Jumping","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1424980/b8617c58296c606ec7021617d5866ed536860802.jpg"},{"name":"Artifice","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1424980/48ed7b4b5746c35d122f66debe640746758a7bcf.jpg"},{"name":"Sympathy for the Devil","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1424980/809e7fd60e35be076a6cb5e7f90238c8d7d4717f.jpg"},{"name":"Better Allies","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1424980/143f305a270c884ef8bd9567df57a04c9e47a85e.jpg"}],"total":20},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1424980/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1623405126","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1424980/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1623405126","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1424980/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1623405126","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1424980/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1623405126","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1424980/extras/sol6.gif?t=1623405126\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">High Stakes, Highly Powered</h2><br>Protego, the world\u2019s leading spy agency, has been destroyed.
