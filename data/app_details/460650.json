{"about_the_game":"A 30-ton garbage truck screams towards you, plowing through a sea of pedestrians. A swarm of flying drones joins the truck, pinning you down with laser fire. Now's your chance: you stop, and time slows to a trickle. You grab your gun. You aim. You fire. You weave through the lasers, and time returns to normal. Your bullets speed up and cut your enemies to shreds. As the garbage truck slams into the wall behind you, you turn to the camera for your one-liner: &quot;Time to take out the trash.&quot; You're going to look great on the big screen.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Burning Down the House","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/460650/dc1ba4fcadc299307e9a873af7586330fdbfefb9.jpg"},{"name":"Flip Them the Bird","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/460650/aca49af4b3425c163bea8ce211ec703bb3f40b67.jpg"},{"name":"Crazy Eights","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/460650/9350fd6a24b5d0ea85966b1f4802eb8f87e0895a.jpg"},{"name":"Border Crossing","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/460650/bb556eb7c416f60924e5c0007442d976eb948c57.jpg"},{"name":"Nuke 'Em From Orbit","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/460650/66043eac15b171cf46225f728dadd6327e809a3a.jpg"},{"name":"Win The Game","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/460650/e4ebef11c740cdc377af0a9936129882d727b634.jpg"}],"total":6},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/460650/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1570193536","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/460650/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1570193536","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/460650/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1570193536","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/460650/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1570193536","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Shooting robots and other mechanical enemies."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"A 30-ton garbage truck screams towards you, plowing through a sea of pedestrians.
