Sporting numerous rooms with individual and unique interactables and an open area exclusively for spawning extra interactables. There are 3 main floors to Map 1, on floor one you will find tons of cubes, some cones, the delete/clone hammers, a miniature bowling alley, and an airlock for disposing of unwanted items. On floor two you find some more object spawners and a slide for deleting what you dont need, and finally on floor three you have available settings and spawnable ragdoll dummies. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Map 2: The Auditorium</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Auditorium is intended to be a much more confined and smaller map so as to be easier on weaker computers, no objects are spawned in by default and the area is almost completely open by default. Again an airlock is provided for disposing of unwanted objects, alongside the 2 hammers.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Map 3: Interactables Testing Area 2</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Map 3 is the complete opposite of Map 2, instead of being completely open and empty Map 3 has a constant supply of new things to see and do! For example upon entering the main area of Map 3 you will see an ascending staircase that leads you to many fun locations,\u00a0going up the staircase on the first platform there is a fully physics based escalator to put interactables on (yes I did it first) and watch them go! On the next a small bar type area stocked with colorful bottles, tables and chairs. At the top floor you are provided a basketball hoop and some basketballs, try not to lose them all over the edge though, they're quite bouncy. Elsewhere there is tons of object spawners and a grand statue right in the middle.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Map 4: The RV</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The RV is a small, warm and cozy RV for you to relax or play around with objects in, the lights are low and everyones just chilling out maxing relaxing all cool. Inside the RV there's some colorful glasses and bottles, a small assortment of interactables, and a nice warm bed waiting just for you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Including a selection of 12 secret maps you can find hidden throughout the game, although maybe you'd be better off not looking...</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Uncover the hidden story of Jank Cube while playing it and gain answers to alot of questions you might have.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Evil forces surround the bubble that is Jank Cube, and it only takes a small poke for it to pop...</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2528520/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727620985","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2528520/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1727620985","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2528520/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727620985","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2528520/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727620985","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"There is a ragdoll of a man who is insinuated to be dead but his death is never shown and he does not bleed in any way."},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong><u>Jank Cube VR is an experimental physics based virtual reality game based around taking the concept of stacking blocks for amusement, and evolving it using physics and VR.</u></strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Jank Cube VR you will encounter a number of fun physics based interactables, including but not limited to: </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Ragdolls: Fully physics based humanoid ragdolls</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Spheres: Spheres of different shapes, sizes and weights</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Cones: Cones each with unique materials</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Oblongs: Elongated cubes</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Cylinders: Cylinders with varying shapes weights and materials</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Crowbars: Crowbars are useful for hooking yourself on level geometry, or fighting through an alien infested facility</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Gravity Control: A box that can switch gravity to Moon gravity, or ZeroG if you're feeling daring today</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Remote Grenade: A grenade which when detonated pushes all objects far away</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Gravity Manipulation Gun: A gun which can pick up any objects regardless of weight or size</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Audio Boombox: A movable spatial audio boombox that plays your sound effects</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Hammers: The hammers can be used to clone or delete interactables based on your preference</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Playbloks: You remember those fun cushion cube things youd play with as a kid?
