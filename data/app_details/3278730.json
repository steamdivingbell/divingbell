{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>It is the darkest of times.</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Since the dimensional portal to the Outer Worlds was opened, a terrible evil has been invading our world. The dark armies of the Outer Worlds, led by the demon named Pompolic, have overrun most of our planet. He has but one goal: To possess us, by wielding supernatural powers, and enslaving us to be minions of his dark army. The dark demon wields his power through his servants, the Dark Souls. The Dark Souls are infiltrating our minds, and making us slaves of evil. They cannot be easily defeated, for they are protected by a horde of monsters. But they are destroying our race.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There is a faint hope, deep in the heart of the surviving citizens, that a great warrior will come forward. If the Dark Souls could be captured, Pompolic could be stopped and perhaps even defeated. Only a great warrior with strong will, faith, and mighty weapons may succeed in defeating them. He or she will build strength, armor, and health by harvesting the souls of monsters, and gain incredible abilities. This warrior may grow strong enough to challenge the Dark Souls, and save us all.
