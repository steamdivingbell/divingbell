The player must collect all the objectives scattered across the dungeon in an order specified by the tutorial. The player must avoid enemies scattered across the dungeon. To collect the objectives, the player has the following tools: opening/closing portals, rotating the world they reside in, walking, and jumping. The game will test the player's movement in a 3D environment, understanding of the physics of the game, and memory of landmarks. The game has a minimalist design: simple shapes and colors. The game was made by a single developer.
