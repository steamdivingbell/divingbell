His insecurity worsens when Damian unintentionally mocks him in front of the entire class. Years after graduation, Gerald becomes a C-list actor who's usually typecast to act in antagonist roles. Meanwhile, Damian becomes a popular heartthrob who's usually the protagonist in romance dramas. Gerald feels bitter that he has to work hard all these years to land auditions, but Damian gets roles automatically handed to him because of his popularity despite his acting being lackluster. His rival's success constantly reminds Gerald of his insecurities and makes him feel like a loser.<br>One day, Gerald gets the role of the antagonist in a romance drama. By chance, Damian happens to be the male lead in that same drama, and they'll both have to fight over the female lead. Because of his pent-up jealousy and insecurities, Gerald swears to use various underhand tactics on set to embarrass his rival.
