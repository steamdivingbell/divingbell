{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Old-school isometric RPG game with some more modern concepts.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You must challenge the forces of evil by eliminating monsters in a world where evil expands. As evil increases, the difficulty of the game also increases.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can play solo or in co-op by allowing other players to enter your game to help you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The levels are mostly procedurally generated, which guarantees that each game you play has some variation.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Be brave</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Attack monsters with your bow as a scout or a huntress. Don't let evil overcome you. Use your net to take advantage by trapping them.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Or if you prefer, be a warrior or a keepwoman to annihilate monsters with any melee weapon. You can also charge them if you are in a bind.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Or better yet, be a magician or a sorceress, who can attack from a distance by burning, freezing or electrocuting their enemies.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Character skills allow you to perform unique actions. You acquire them by completing quests.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Inventory and Items</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The player has a very visual, practical inventory where each item occupies its space and is easy to identify.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There is also a stash where items can be stored. The stash is shared between all your characters, so what you store from one character will be available from another and vice versa.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There are several types of items. Some are healing, others replenish mana. But the most important are those equipped by the character.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The character can equip 2 amulets and 4 rings at the same time. As well as a hat or helmet, clothing, pants or boots, gloves, belt, weapon and shield or arrows.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each item is vital so you must choose well which ones to equip to make the most appropriate combination of what you want to enhance in your character.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Monsters</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Several types of creatures such as zombies, wolves, giant rats, giant spiders, etc. will be waiting for you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Some are champions, and will present a greater challenge, and may even have other abilities.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Unique bosses will also be waiting for you in some corner, so be careful where you go.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Levels</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The levels are mostly procedural to offer a unique experience in each game. You won't be able to get bored. Delve into the abandoned mines or visit and explore the dark forest. If you tolerate the sun well, you can go to the desert.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game offers a starting map with a camp and vendors from which you can access other areas.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There is also an &quot;arena&quot; area to test your superiority against other players in a PvP combat.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Twitch Integration</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game features an exclusive camp and procedural dungeon exclusively for Twitch streamers, where viewers can vote on what the next event will be.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2661490/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727840308","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2661490/page.bg.jpg?t=1727840308","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2661490/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727840308","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2661490/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727840308","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"This game may contain content not suitable for all ages or for viewing at work: Frequent violence or gore, general mature content."},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Old-school isometric RPG game with some more modern concepts.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You must challenge the forces of evil by eliminating monsters in a world where evil expands.
