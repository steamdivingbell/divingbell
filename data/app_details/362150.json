I just want to go on record as saying, this is not my fault. I warned her getting involved would be bad. She never listens to me. <br><br>My name is Orlok Vladimir Dragonov, son of Konstantin Dragonov. I was born in the town of Stoker some 230 years ago. When I was 23, I was to be wed to my best friend, Elizabeth Crane. What I didn't know was that Elizabeth's sister had been turned into a vampire four years earlier. On the day of my wedding, my sister-in-law, determined to keep her sister single out of some stupid selfishness, killed and turned me. And that's my story. Kind of a downer, I guess. <br><br>Two years ago, a hunter named Simona Rinoldt freed me from a decade of captivity, imprisonment I have her father to thank for. We may have saved the world, I don't know. <br><br>Now we're here, in the Hinterlands, the land of Landis, the land of werewolves. I'd kill every human I see just for a rolled up newspaper and a poop scoop. Actually, I'd kill every human I see just for giggles, but then I'm a man of simple pleasures. <br><br>I kept telling her to stay out of other people's business. It doesn't concern us. She never listens. And this is what we get for helping people. It's never just helping.
