{"about_the_game":"Frustrated that your voters seem too influenced by corporate donations? Eager to lower the minimum voting age?

All your voting and campaign problems are solved with this DLC!<br><br>Only part of winning an election is really about running the country well. Democracy 4 - Voting Systems introduces a whole bunch of new policies that let you decide who can vote, how they vote, and how easy it is for big money to swing an election. This expansion pack includes the following policies:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Compulsory Voting<br></li><li>Limit Corporate Donors<br></li><li>Restrict Election Ads<br></li><li>Maximum Voting Age<br></li><li>Minimum Voting Age<br></li><li>Party Donation Limits<br></li><li>Phone &amp; Internet Voting<br></li><li>Election Robocalls<br></li><li>State Funding of Parties<br></li><li>Voter ID Law<br></li><li>State Voting Campaign</li></ul><br>And also with this expansion, you get to choose a single metric to focus your election campaign on (such as the economy, or crime...), and can decide whether to run an honest, optimistic campaign, or risk looking untrustworthy by running a brutal, cynical campaign full of personal attack ads focusing on your opponent.<br><br>You can also change your country electoral system from 'first-past-the-post' to proportional representation, or maybe do the opposite! plus a new polling option lets you see the difference between the opinions of the electorate as a whole, and those who are considered 'likely voters'.<br><br>Unleash your inner campaign manager, and start playing with the election rules immediately.
