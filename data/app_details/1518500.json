In both games, players explore dungeons while following storylines and engaging in turn-based battles with fantastical enemies (e.g., goblins, demons, monsters). Players select combat moves from a menu screen; characters lose hit points and flash/flicker when struck. Cutscenes also include instances of violence and blood: a female character lying in a pool of blood; a knight impaled by a lance. One scene depicts a creature being decapitated; some enemies appear as floating severed heads trailing small amounts of blood. Some female creatures are depicted with bare breasts (no nipples), and other characters are shown wearing low-cut outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage."},"detailed_description":"<i>Saviors of Sapphire Wings / Stranger of Sword City Revisited</i> - &quot;Dungeons and Refrains&quot; Official Soundtrack includes 44 tracks composed by Naoaki Jimbo","developers":["Experience Inc."],"fullgame":{"appid":"1363840","name":"Saviors of Sapphire Wings / Stranger of Sword City Revisited"},"header_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1518500/header.jpg?t=1732661680","is_free":false,"legal_notice":"\u00a9Experience Inc.
