{"about_the_game":"What happens when a baseball player hits a home run so powerful it soars all the way into space? You get some very angry aliens.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter such a home run, Sally, the greatest batter in the world, gets abducted by the Guis, a race of slimy aliens with a thirst for galactic conquest, and to make matters worse they've even captured Jackie, pitching prodigy and Sally's little sister. Now, the two athletes have to combine their talents in both combat and platforming to escape the alien spacecraft and get back to their home world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSally's unparalleled strength allows her to perform a variety of powerful attacks with her bat (and even her cleats!) to destroy any creatures or objects that get in her way, even launching foes into each other for big damage, while Jackie is equipped with an indestructible helmet that makes her invincible, as well as one mean throwing arm that allows her to toss things with ease, even enemies! Learning to control the two in tandem will be key to getting back to Earth. Along the way, they are aided by Billy the Bullfrog, the team mascot, who provides the duo with upgrades and new abilities... Provided they have enough tickets to pay him, anyway.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game features cartoony hand drawn graphics, loads of bosses and minibosses, a thumping soundtrack by +TEK (composer for Skeleton Boomerang and Ex-Zodiac)","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3182960/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732861587","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3182960/page.bg.jpg?t=1732861587","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3182960/f72a8be27f2921174d147e9890f5f2c7f663ad9d/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732861587","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3182960/f72a8be27f2921174d147e9890f5f2c7f663ad9d/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732861587","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":3236620,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"What happens when a baseball player hits a home run so powerful it soars all the way into space?
