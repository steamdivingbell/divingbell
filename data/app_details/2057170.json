{"about_the_game":"You play an indie horror game in which you run around a house filled scary monsters trying to kill you. This game has an interesting story, and the goal is not only to scare you, but also to discover secrets this place is hiding. If you buy this game you will have a 20 to 30 minutes experience where you will have to try to escape a house, discover what has happened or maybe even discover who you are. You will also have to solve some puzzles and avoid traps inside this weird mechanical house. The gameplay is mostly walking, finding secret rooms, solving puzzles, and avoiding traps. The game will get constant updates and the story and gameplay will become longer.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"The Beginning ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2057170/38038d4fa019e4dc1cc969d65327a2cf6fdbcf4f.jpg"},{"name":"Dark Secrets","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2057170/6fc7866a0e92243dbba437d0595eb4ffc852182e.jpg"},{"name":"Chicken Man","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2057170/bbe12714001912a6188e51b90f9ebe240889b369.jpg"},{"name":"The Tunnel","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2057170/38341411e148dcf24db3becfe44f96004d06a722.jpg"}],"total":4},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2057170/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726343918","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2057170/page.bg.jpg?t=1726343918","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2057170/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726343918","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2057170/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726343918","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You play an indie horror game in which you run around a house filled scary monsters trying to kill you.
