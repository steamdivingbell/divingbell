{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Synopsis</h2><br><strong>Porcelana</strong> (<i>Porcelain</i>) is a story of a girl who is perceived to be perfect by society but is actually more normal than others may think. This shows a reflection of reality where people wear masks to hide the darkness in their hearts. Although the story itself was written years back, we are wanting to share it with others in a new way through a visual novel format. We hope that this emotional story will touch your heart and be one that you remember.<br><br><i>If you could change the past, would you?</i><br><br>Isabella, your classmate, is someone you were never close to but someone you certainly noticed. One day however, you notice that Isabella stopped coming to class. You start to discover how important you were to her despite never even having a conversation with her before. She has left you notes in a particular way that takes you on a journey where you discover her past and meet the people who were important in her life.
