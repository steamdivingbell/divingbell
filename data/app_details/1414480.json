Discover how things work and go deeper into the game. The solutions are simple, but hidden more and more carefully as you progress. Zof is not a pushover. You might get frustrated, you'll probably get stuck, but you'll definitely feel great when you figure it out.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"></h2>No story, no searching for clues, no hand holding. Zof relies on falling into a new mindset, not struggling with difficult concepts.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Not sure?</h2>Try the free demo! ( button above ). You'll find puzzlement, exasperation and elation in the same proportions as the rest of the game.
