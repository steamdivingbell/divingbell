{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The soundtrack of NAIAD, like the game itself, is the result of an experimental approach to creation. In the process, self-learning and freedom have guided the development of each piece on a journey toward introspection and emotions. The main concept of NAIAD is &quot;flow,&quot; and this has been carried into every detail and aspect of the project. It is a very personal and homemade work, in which I have used instruments I\u2019ve modeled to search for a particular sound, essence, and identity. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In NAIAD, each small area is presented with a brief musical piece, which maintains a continuous air of discovery.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The soundtrack is therefore a collection of small fragments, in the form of loops. The &quot;ostinato&quot; predominates as the base, over which other layers appear improvisedly, playing among themselves, dancing, getting lost, and continually finding each other, like leaves carried by the river's waters.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In addition to the pieces that can be heard during the game in each area, there are some additional ones that are somewhat hidden or yet to be discovered.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When I started developing the game years ago, I also began experimenting with the guitar. It\u2019s something that helped me disconnect, simply enjoying making the strings sound, trying to connect chords I was learning, with no goal beyond that. However, some melodies began to emerge, and over time, I decided to build something from these ideas and fragments, which I eventually added to the game as a secondary element.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Among all the small music pieces included in this soundtrack, there is a flute piece titled &quot;Flowing&quot; that was composed and played by my brother, whom I admire greatly. Initially, I proposed that he take on creating all the music for the game, but some complications prevented us from continuing our collaboration. For me, this piece is the main theme of NAIAD.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">It has been 3 years of development, work, and continuous learning. I can look back on a path where I\u2019ve improved, enjoyed every step, every day, and for which I am also grateful.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">I hope you can enjoy listening to this music, which I am proud of, especially because it has allowed me the freedom to create and share, despite not considering myself a musician or composer.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3360970/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733864888","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3360970/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1733864888","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3360970/f3d6e712208ae3f90798c658d089143047d832ae/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733864888","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3360970/f3d6e712208ae3f90798c658d089143047d832ae/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733864888","categories":[{"description":"Additional High-Quality Audio","id":50}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The soundtrack of NAIAD, like the game itself, is the result of an experimental approach to creation.
