{"about_the_game":"Holopoint is pure archery madness. Fight your way through waves of responsive targets, samurai, and highly dangerous ninjas - all while drawing, nocking, and shooting your arrows as quickly as possible. <br><br>Holopoint is a skill based game where progression is based on player skill and training rather than unlocks. Like many arcade style games, personal progress and a high score is the goal. There are two game-modes: Original, and Time-Trial.<br>The original game mode offers sixty waves to progress through. Targets are introduced as groups of waves are completed. This mode quickly becomes difficult and requires an active mindset. Holopoint is designed so that only a few determined archers will reach the last wave.<br>Time-Trial allows player to define a subset of targets and a play-time, during which points are awarded for targets hit, and taken away when a target hits back. This game mode offers a more casual and controlled experience, and is used by many as a timed workout.<br><br>WARNING: THIS GAME GETS INTENSE.
