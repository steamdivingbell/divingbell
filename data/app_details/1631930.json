It also features semi-4th wall-breaking moments, chapter-based storytelling, and endless possibilities for how the story may go.<br><br><strong>Important Note:</strong><br>The Insignia Project is going to be released over time as more chapters become available. Each chapter that is released will be complete and may experience slight changes over time as more chapters become released but the story will remain consistent in all prior released chapters.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1631930/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1629166235","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1631930/page.bg.jpg?t=1629166235","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1631930/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1629166235","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1631930/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1629166235","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Insignia Project is a multiversal horror game in which you must journey through the story of a world which has doomed itself due to its own creations.
