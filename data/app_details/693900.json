{"about_the_game":"<strong>Have you dreamed of what it would be ... to soar like an eagle?</strong><br><br>Aquila Bird Flight Simulator lets you experience soaring bird flight using virtual reality.  It was originally designed for the Oculus Rift, but has now been modified for OpenVR.\u00a0 You embody one of three species of eagle flying over either Northwest Scotland, a part of Columbia, or Graham Island in British Columbia. This is designed as a relaxing soaring flight simulation, and is not arcade-style flight, and as such you can make use of ridge lift and thermals.  If you want a work out try flapping with motion controllers!<br><br>If it works well for you, please consider trying the full version.  Proceeds from this project go towards a major bird of prey centre in Hampshire (UK), where I do voluntary work. Supporting this project helps towards vital conservation, rehabilitation, and education schemes throughout the UK and overseas.  So on behalf of the birds, and the staff, thank you!<br><br>This free demo version features the bald eagle in Scotland, with a 5 minute flight time limit.

These run through an introduction to Aquila, your first flights, and more detail on take off and landing (plus a few other bits).  Please check them out.  They are currently applicable to the Oculus version, using Motion Controllers.  There are two important differences from the Steam version, which will be shown in a future video, however briefly they are:<br> - to open the in-game menu, look straight ahead and double-press your motion controller trigger.<br> - to change your view, look either left or right and double-press your motion controller trigger.<br><br>Other control methods (steering via headset or your gamepad) are the same in both versions.<br><br>My YouTube channel: <br>Aquila Website (click Tutorials): </p><br><h1>If you have already purchased Aquila...</h1><p>... on either Steam or Oculus Home, and you wish to have the other version, please get in touch with your purchase details.

It should auto-detect Oculus and Vive headsets, and give appropriate instructions.  However, if you are presented with the wrong information, there are launch options in SteamVR and your normal Steam Library to override and force Vive or Oculus VR types if required.</p><br><h1>Running with and without VR</h1><p>This is an application that has been made with Virtual Reality in mind, specifically using OpenVR on the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.  It will run without a headset connected, but support is not completed and the tutorial will not be fully applicable.  I've had significant interest in a Non-VR version, so I will do further work on this as time allows.</p><br><h1>About the Demo</h1><strong>Have you dreamed of what it would be ... to soar like an eagle?</strong><br><br>Aquila Bird Flight Simulator lets you experience soaring bird flight using virtual reality.
