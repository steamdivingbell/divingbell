Before you dive in, there are some important notes that you need to be aware of...<br><br>\u2022 A joypad is essential to play The Alpha Device, as the game doesn't support mouse/keyboard input. The left stick controls movement, the right controls the viewpoint and the shoulder buttons control roll. Pause the game by pressing Start or the equivalent on your joypad.<br><br>\u2022 The game uses advanced rendering to paint the procedural world. Those of you with lower spec graphics cards will notice the resolution automatically adjusts itself to maintain an acceptable framerate as you move around. Initially, you may notice slight stuttering as the game works out the best resolution for the experience. However, playing in Windowed Mode won't improve the framerate (it's not that kind of rendering!).<br><br>\u2022 The Alpha Device is a retelling of the story from Caretaker Sacrifice.

To say too much about the story will ruin it, but needless to say it\u2019s fantastic and tells a cleverly constructed sci-fi narrative that\u2019s fondly reminiscent of Arthur C. Clarke\u2019s works.  It\u2019s an incredible experience, with awe-inspiring visuals, a great audio score and a mature sci-fi narrative that throws up lots of philosophical and moral questions as you unravel a mystery at the end of the Universe.
