{"about_the_game":"Aliens have invaded Earth!  The military have fought bravely but have all but been wiped out.  You have been drafted to continue the fight using high tech tank drones.  With the controls bundled into your hands, your task is to destroy the invaders and save the planet.  But how long can you hold out?<br><br>Your futuristic tank can equip an Ability which can be activated to give extra powers such as shields, teleports and restoration.  You may also equip up to 3 Runes which passively work together to make your tank more destructive.  There are over 20 Runes to equip, giving many unique combination builds to help you fight the incoming horde.  Like the idea of a glass cannon?  Well include a 'Volatile' Rune in the mix and try your luck.  Prefer a 'Tank' build, well add a 'Toughen' and 'Healer' Rune to beef up your chances.<br><br>Tackle the task with couch coop player vs enemy battles, or practice your skills and have a laugh with some player vs player action in King of the Hill, Deathmatch, Capture the Flag or Tank League battle modes.  No one else to play?  No problem, we've added AI bots to enhance the battle and improve your skills.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1978070/extras/steam_store_page_00.jpg?t=1681775975\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1978070/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1681775975","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1978070/page.bg.jpg?t=1681775975","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1978070/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1681775975","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1978070/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1681775975","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Aliens have invaded Earth!
