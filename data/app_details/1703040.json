{"about_the_game":"El Alamein, October 1944.  You hear the rumble of three hundred enemy tanks advancing against your position in the North African desert. Deploy your tanks, artillery, air cover and ground troops in this historically accurate simulation. Victory or defeat. It is in your hands. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDecision in the Desert is a classic real-time simulation game from the 80s designed by Sid Meier and Ed Bever.  The second title in the &quot;Command Series&quot; of tactical wargames from Microprose, the game features real-time battles that test your skills as a commander. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFive different scenarios from the North African Campaign (1940 to 1942), each with multiple variables, along with different levels of difficulty will have you playing again and again. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccelerated real-time simulation<br />\r\nHistorically accurate scenarios<br />\r\nDifferent skill levels<br />\r\nSingle player campaign<br />\r\nTwo-play head-to-head<br />\r\nChoose to lead either side<br />\r\nIn-depth historical backgrounds and hints<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe idea for the Command Series came from observation of actual tabletop military scenario exercises.  The games challenge you to manage assets, strategically place and move them around the battlefield map, and try to outmaneuver the enemy.
