{"about_the_game":"Hostile alien forces have set their sights on Earth and will stop at nothing to wipe our civilization from existence. The invaders seek to use their advanced technology to annihilate humanity, but they weren\u2019t expecting the people of Earth to counter with sophisticated technology of our own. Enter Project ExZeus, humanity\u2019s last and best defense to repel the otherworldly menace and restore peace to our little blue planet using ultra high-tech fighting robots!

The lucky few who survived the initial onslaught managed to escape deep underground, narrowly preventing humanity\u2019s extinction. The Governing Council ordered an immediate counter-attack using three experimental robots: Calista, Sophia, and Dynamis. With that, Operation ExZeus was born.
