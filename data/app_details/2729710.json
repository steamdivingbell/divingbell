The catch? He's phoneless! To chat with Susan, he must sneak into other people's phones, but it's anything but easy. These digital devices are fortified with guns, wires, bombs, mines, nukes, and heavy weapons, turning each level into a wacky obstacle course.<br><br>The game revels in its intentional silliness, throwing absurd challenges at our pint-sized hero.
