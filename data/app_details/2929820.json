{"about_the_game":"<strong>IRIS</strong> is a psychological horror game that stands out for its narrative focus and the constant struggle for happiness, urging the player to live in the present. The plot follows the story of a young woman who, after experiencing an anxiety attack, enters a coma and wakes up in a world created in her own mind. In this dreamlike setting, she faces monsters that personify scars from the past and constant problems, addressing issues such as poverty, bulimia, bullying and loneliness. The uniqueness of the game is in the message of searching for meaning and happiness. With an aesthetic that combines elements of anime and retro video games, specifically inspired by the PlayStation 2 era, Iris offers a unique visual experience. The choice of this visual style seeks to evoke carefully curated nostalgia while providing a platform for the exploration of profound and current topics.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2929820/extras/ANGEL_IRIS_RENDER.png?t=1738479380\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2929820/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738479380","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2929820/page.bg.jpg?t=1738479380","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2929820/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738479380","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2929820/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738479380","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Suicide, depression and more sensitive topics are mentioned in this game."},"detailed_description":"<strong>IRIS</strong> is a psychological horror game that stands out for its narrative focus and the constant struggle for happiness, urging the player to live in the present.
