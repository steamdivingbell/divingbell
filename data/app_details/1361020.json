{"about_the_game":"Fire up the Chainsaw. Just because you're dead doesn't mean anything is over, let alone the killing. Massacre and loot your way through this shifting woodland Nightmare, grow in power and improve your tactics, and maybe, if you can reach all six Carrion Shrines and slay every horrible thing that crawls out of the shadows to stop you, you might just make it back to life. You might even get your revenge. Just know that a wrong move will be your end. Again. For now.<br><br>It's a harsh Nightmare. You know what they say\u2014if at first you don't escape, die, die again. <br><br>Living the Nightmare is a difficult Horror Roguelike with fast-paced, turn-based gameplay, random and procedural generation, loot and monsters galore, all made entirely by a team of two. <br><br><strong>MAIN FEATURES</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>A Turn-Based, Hex-Grid, Strategic, Difficult, Horror Roguelike</strong> where death is one misstep away. Being turn-based doesn't mean the action is slow. Commands play out as quickly as you input them. Monsters come in packs, but take their turns all at once.
