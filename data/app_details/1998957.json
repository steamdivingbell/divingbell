{"about_the_game":"Climb aboard an eclectic mix of authentic and detailed Ge 4/4 II locomotives in celebratory liveries, and experience the wintry Alps from the classic observation coach, with Rivet Games\u2019 RhB Anniversary Collection for the challenging Arosalinie.<br><br>First built in 1973, the Ge 4/4 II was designed as a capable replacement to the older and unreliable Ge 6/6 I. More would be introduced in 1984, making a total of 23 locomotives to serve the Rhaetian Railway\u2019s core network. In 1997, the Ge 4/4 II fleet was permitted to work along the famed Arosa Line, as the 25 km mountain railway was converted to the same overhead system as the rest of the RhB network. The Ge 4/4 II\u2019s power output was ideal for the sharp grades and ever-growing traffic, and they would easily transport passengers and freight throughout the valley.<br><br>While the standard RhB red livery is applied across the fleet, multiple locomotives instead carry promotional designs that celebrate the long heritage of the nation\u2019s railway network. Featuring large artistic representations of key landmarks, locomotives such as no. 627 proudly call out the 100th anniversary of the Arosa Line, with others showing off the Bernina or Disentis lines, and even a 125th anniversary loco for the RhB itself.<br><br>For use on the Arosalinie, Rivet Games have produced this collection which features 5 distinctive liveries for the Ge 4/4 II locomotive. For additional variety, RhB\u2019s white and yellow observation coach is included. A new timetable and 5 engaging scenarios let you put the locos to work across mixed-traffic duties, and get in the Christmas spirit with festive-themed gameplay featuring atmospheric scenery and light effects, including across the grand Langwieser Viaduct!<br><br><strong>Please note: Train Sim World\u00ae 3 is required, as a separate purchase, in order to utilise this content.
