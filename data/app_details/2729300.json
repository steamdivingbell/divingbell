{"about_the_game":"The Reverb Engines Bolt-on contains 5 extra reverb engines to boost capabilities of SFXEngine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIronverb is a metallic, tinny sounding reverb effect. The reverb adds some stereo space to the sound. A band pass filter with a fixed bandwidth is applied to the reverb tail which is superior to a low pass filter when trying to obtain a metallic sound. Apply as an environment engine to create the effect of a glassy or metallic environment, such as a tunnel or a tiled or metal room. Filter the effect or reduce the dry to create muffled underwater or behind glass effects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNitroverb is a deep reverb effect with an internal multi-tap delay, and high and low pass filters. The engine will naturally add some stereo space to a plain reverb. A low reverb decay but large feedback on the internal delay can produce some unique and spectacular canyon reverb effects. Use as an environment engine to create space or ambience. This filter has an internal high-pass filter set at 80hz.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOxyverb is a powerful reverb effect with a single tap delay and internal high-pass and low-pass filters. The engine will naturally add some stereo space to the reverb but you can add more width using the single tap delay. As with its brother Nitroverb, this filter has an internal high-pass filter set at 80hz to reduce \u2018boom\u2019. Use as an environment engine to create space or ambience. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSimple Reverb II is a fast and simple monophonic reverb which merges all channels. Includes low pass and high pass filters. The simple reverb series have a cleaner sound than Oxyverb, Nitroverb, Ironverb, and are good to use inside sounds to create unusual effects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSimple Reverb III is the fastest and most simple reverb of all, a monophonic reverb with no filter effects.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2729300/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734436149","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2729300/page.bg.jpg?t=1734436149","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2729300/e7a7b2842a42623fc8815696a997a3e171b45b15/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734436149","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2729300/e7a7b2842a42623fc8815696a997a3e171b45b15/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734436149","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Reverb Engines Bolt-on contains 5 extra reverb engines to boost capabilities of SFXEngine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIronverb is a metallic, tinny sounding reverb effect.
