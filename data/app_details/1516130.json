{"about_the_game":"In our game, you will assume the role of a wandering merchant who, along with a group of creatures, travels from city to city. Your objective is to establish trade relationships between factions, develop autonomous production of goods, and rid the world of giants, whose mere existence causes chaos.<br><br>In this business, you are free to choose any method to solve problems and overcome difficulties. You can become a heavily armed warrior, a peaceful explorer, a diligent craftsman, or an enterprising cattle breeder. Each approach has its place, but the most important thing is to achieve your goal and reap the rewards.<br><br>The procedurally generated world of the game is filled with numerous interesting biomes, locations, objects, and creatures, making each game session truly unique and engaging.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1516130/extras/key_features.png?t=1738618930\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tame Animals</h2><strong>One of the main features of the game is the interaction with the creatures that inhabit the world.</strong> Each creature possesses its own unique characteristics and abilities. For instance, the wolf is a formidable attacker, while the stone golem excels in defense. Meanwhile, the green slug is highly skilled in providing effective support and healing to members of its group.<br><br>However, the creatures' roles are not limited to combat, as there are several unique abilities that they possess. For example, the earth golem can transform into a living bed, the magmapliv can serve as a mobile furnace for melting ores, and the shadowy grabaka can teleport you and your group to different locations within the game world.<br><br>Overall, there are <strong>more than 60 unique creatures</strong> in the game that are eager to befriend you.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1516130/extras/creatures.gif?t=1738618930\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Automation</h2>As a merchant, your primary focus is establishing automated production and sales chains, and in Delares, you will have the opportunity to set up such processes.<br><br>One example of automation is to locate an ancient mine, invest resources in its repair, and employ a tamed stone golem to work on it. The golem will produce resources based on its level, and you can either sell them immediately or use magmofloam to melt the ore into ingots, which are more valuable than unprocessed materials.<br><br>In short, Delares offers a range of automation options that enable you to increase your productivity and profitability as a merchant.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1516130/extras/automation.png?t=1738618930\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Procedurally generated world</h2>The game world is comprised of over <strong>10 unique biomes</strong>, each with its own distinct flora and fauna. These biomes include the forest, redwoods, savannah, desert, volcanic biome, winter, frozen tundra, stone, cave, as well as lavender and wheat fields.<br><br>Moreover, the game world generates several unique locations that provide various functional structures that players can utilize during gameplay. These locations include mines, sawmills, mills, portals that facilitate swift movement across the map, and trading posts of other factions.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1516130/extras/biomes.png?t=1738618930\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1516130/extras/world_map.png?t=1738618930\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Factions</h2>In addition, the game map features several cities belonging to other nations, with whom players can establish cooperation, trade, or enmity.<br><br><strong>People of the Wind</strong> - this faction is based in the forests and is primarily composed of mercenaries and traders. They are considered to be the most neutral faction in the game.<br><br><strong>Northerners</strong> - an artisan faction who reside in a harsh and frigid environment.

They are forced to survive through pillaging and cannibalism, making them outcasts.<br><br><strong>Cavemen</strong> - a group of mages and blackseekers who shun sunlight.
