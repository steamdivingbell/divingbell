{"about_the_game":"You\u2019re set, waiting\u2026. The line tightens, your alarm screams, the fish is on and the battle commences!  <br><br>Take on the hunt of a lifetime as you target and pursue monster sized fish around the world. With 35 species to hunt you\u2019ll have to work up your strategy, skill and tactics to catch every boss fish in each venue. It\u2019ll take both patience and adrenaline to succeed as you choose your angling spot carefully based on time of day, weather conditions and perfect equipment setup, before casting out into the water to battle and catch these elusive creatures.<br><br>It\u2019s all about the catch.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">KEY FEATURES:</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GO SPECIES HUNTING</h2> 35 different species of realistically captured fish with their own unique behaviour and bait preferences await you. Every tactic and piece of equipment will be needed to catch them all as you go from float fishing for species such as rudd, ide and bream to using lures for trout, salmon and pike. You can also fish for rare species such as pacu, mekong and redtail catfish.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LAND THE BOSS FISH</h2> As well as thousands of fish to get your personal bests on all species, there are 125 legendary Boss Fish to hunt including 11 Monster Boss Fish \u2013 the hardest fish to catch in the game. These named fish put up a huge fight and only the best will be able to locate and land them all.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GET OUTDOORS, INDOORS!</h2>Featuring 5 unique destinations that all present their own challenges. Oxlease Lake on the Linear Fisheries complex is a specimen carp water with some great back up species including tench and roach. The River Ebro is home to huge wels catfish and Pearl Lake in Malaysia features exotic monsters such as arapaima and giant wolf fish. Go urban street fishing in Rotterdam city centre or explore the openness of Loch Mickle in Scotland that both contain predators such as pike and zander.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ADVANCED WATER FLOW</h2>  <br>Advanced water flow will affect your fishing whether that\u2019s from the bank or in a boat. Keep an eye on your float drifting downstream or your boat moving off the prime spot that you have identified.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ALL THE GEAR, ALL THE IDEAS</h2> 100\u2019s of items of equipment from over 20 licensed partners including Nash and Mainline Baits. Create different set ups to cover all situations and use some of your favourite real-world equipment from the biggest manufactures in the industry.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BATTLE IT OUT </h2>Multiplayer and tournaments will feed your competitive streak as you take part in a series of events that form the Dovetail Fishing League. There are some fantastic real-world prizes up for grabs if you come out on top!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Walk Before You Run","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1237610/17f91b6c8022c9ed64ed7d75b946add579876758.jpg"},{"name":"What A Loser","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1237610/9e60861f339f5731104a89f83b5cc1296a9f0d27.jpg"},{"name":"Beginner's Luck","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1237610/8c6de8b57b6ece5e7437c2c42e6a9d30061e5d6a.jpg"},{"name":"Triple Digit Milestone","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1237610/d653b9f32468ce8642a1f614783a6da17ffe9171.jpg"},{"name":"Bounty Angler","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1237610/d37c95443540c73f4694c9edc04e57a52c9a878a.jpg"},{"name":"Catchaclysm","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1237610/50857e6058e36e6f5cefc8a609fd2dc94f02b0c4.jpg"},{"name":"Welterweight Swarm","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1237610/3ef3b2a9cf8517158d87bbf54fe649372f12e62e.jpg"},{"name":"Heavyweight Horde","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1237610/2d6fe93451e4b3d2abc7075dab129cbe3a80aece.jpg"},{"name":"The Matador","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1237610/076d89762992b93512e21510329c76e7be783c0d.jpg"},{"name":"Catalonian Catcher","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1237610/d4756baf25d42c42bb4dd92946c328a7a36b862b.jpg"}],"total":30},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1237610/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733929781","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1237610/page.bg.jpg?t=1733929781","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1237610/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733929781","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1237610/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733929781","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"You\u2019re set, waiting\u2026.
