Should you survive, the powerful Ereshkigal will be your ultimate test.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FOUR UNIQUE CLASSES</h2>Choose from four distinct classes, each with its own unique abilities to define your personal playstyle. Assassinate your enemies as the Trickster, incinerate them as the Pyromancer, punish them up close as the Devastator, or engage them at range as the Technomancer, master of heavy ordinance.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LOOK AND FEEL LEGENDARY</h2>Equip yourself with twisted guns and gear with unique savage sci-fi designs made from heavy, brutal metal and feral organic materials.  And transmog your appearance effortlessly to any piece of gear you've collected.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DEADLY BUILDCRAFTING</h2>Discover countless builds to crush your enemies in new and unique ways. Fine-tune your loadout with hundreds of mods across your guns and gear, multiple class-based skill trees, and attribute points.

And even greater horrors await in The Trial of Tarya Gratar, an intense dungeon crawl with brutal bosses. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/680420/extras/GIF6-Class-Select-v2.gif?t=1728485147\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Awoken to a Nightmare","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/680420/3f9ed21ce6467888bc4b72d948096c0e14f53b86.jpg"},{"name":"In Rode A Hero","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/680420/c1b355f18a97447a9429b932618ba63681bc3661.jpg"},{"name":"Wavelengths and Wishes","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/680420/dc582fdbd590b1f82d775a6206b00da9259ceb66.jpg"},{"name":"One Way Ride","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/680420/757c325c6d2bbe36f141a36312bdf4f2f7882f86.jpg"},{"name":"Malpractice","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/680420/52a3606bf49edef8ea2652790a7b9e49a6c7452d.jpg"},{"name":"Breaking the Seal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/680420/3a05ba25acb8f857e0ea27bdc394fa72779086b1.jpg"},{"name":"Fatherhood Ain't Easy, Boss","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/680420/b334c22087c1564b7a585cadf712dc20d8ac4aab.jpg"},{"name":"Descent to Fury","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/680420/3e957704ba570dde304460eb4ec2c0ed30a1ee06.jpg"},{"name":"One Last Chance","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/680420/47bf528ccb5e595a4a87cf020c86af87447c1cde.jpg"},{"name":"Patron of the Past","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/680420/befee60bd16b765bd38e0a929d7f708ec5df56b8.jpg"}],"total":52},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/680420/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728485147","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/680420/page.bg.jpg?t=1728485147","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/680420/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728485147","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/680420/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728485147","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Outriders is a RPG-Shooter with aggressive gunplay and intense action.
