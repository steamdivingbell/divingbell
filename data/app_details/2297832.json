{"about_the_game":"MV users, it\u2019s time for you to enjoy the Another World Heroine Generator 3 pack! Gee-kun-soft has remade 41 generator pieces to match MV\u2019s generator and help you make your heroines look exactly how you imagine them. Give your knight a long ponytail, your mage a floppy black hat, and your martial artist an asymmetrical robe with this pack! 5 options for Eyes, Front Hair, and Rear Hair are perfect for giving your heroines a makeover. Choose the right sparkly eyes for your main character, and then give her some bangs and hair. Long and loose bangs could show that she\u2019s too busy to stop for a haircut, while straight across bangs could fit her studious nature. 4 ponytail choices can reveal even more about personality, with the party\u2019s kind healer wearing a low ponytail while the energetic archer sticks with twintails. And for the warrior woman who can\u2019t stand long hair? Let her keep it loose and shoulder-length.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n20 Clothing pieces along with 2 Accessory 2s, 3 Beast Ears, and 1 pair of Wings are perfect for giving each party member her own style. Let the tiny-horned succubus mage wear a lightweight robe so she can easily dodge while casting spells, and have your isekai\u2019d heroine wear a modern jacket that stands out compared to all the fantastical outfits of the game world. Or just let your players choose their favorite outfit to wear while they relax and farm in a quiet village.
