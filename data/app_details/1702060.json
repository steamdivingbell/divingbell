{"about_the_game":"<strong>No time to space out, cadet!</strong> You\u2019re the last one standing, and the future of Earth is in your hands. There has been some gravity disturbance around Harran, affecting both zombies and men. But we do trust you\u2019ll use it to your advantage. To help you succeed, we\u2019re equipping you with our latest Volkan technology. We\u2019ve been working hard on developing the most advanced types of weapons, and we came up with something completely out of this world. Just what you\u2019ll need to stop a space invasion. <br><br><i>Hop in your new ride, the V-39 Star Rover, put on your V-9 Defender Suit, and let\u2019s get down to business.</i> One of our greatest achievements, the V-40 Suspender pistol, will put your enemies in stasis, giving you extra time to eliminate them. If you\u2019re skillful or lucky enough, you can make them freeze in the air! The fall is certainly not going to be pleasant for them, but as long as they\u2019re hanging up there, remember to say \u201ccheese!\u201d and smile\u2014it\u2019s gonna be your best picture ever. Once you\u2019re done having fun with that, grab the V-23 Eraser, a rifle shooting laser bullets with a dazzling effect, which can set your enemies on fire. With this one, you\u2019re sure to eradicate anyone and anything on your way. <strong>Things got personal and you got trouble deciding how you want your foes served? Poisoned, burned, or shocked?</strong> Slash the Infected with the V-27 Shifter and you\u2019ll have all of these covered, as your machete changes its deadly effect after consecutive hits. <strong>Now, It\u2019s time to give that space equipment a try and kick the unwelcome intruders out of Earth.</strong><br><br><strong>The bundle contains:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Laser rifle</strong>\u2014The V-23 Eraser\u2014with laser ammo and a chance to burn your enemies.<br></li><li><strong>Stasis pistol</strong>\u2014The V-40 Suspender\u2014that\u2019ll put your enemies in stasis with every last shell in the magazine.<br></li><li><strong>Machete</strong>\u2014The V-27 Shifter\u2014that changes its effect after several consecutive hits.<br></li><li><strong>Outfit</strong>\u2014The V-9 Defender Suit\u2014with fall damage reduction.<br></li><li><strong>Buggy skin</strong>\u2014The V-39 Star Rover</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1702060/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1651223731","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1702060/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1651223731","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1702060/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1651223731","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1702060/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1651223731","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Valve Anti-Cheat enabled","id":8},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Remote Play on Tablet","id":42},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>No time to space out, cadet!</strong> You\u2019re the last one standing, and the future of Earth is in your hands.
