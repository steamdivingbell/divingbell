{"about_the_game":"Gothica: The Devil\u2019s Shadow is a single player, steampunk-influenced, adventure puzzle game designed for VR. Professor Van Helsing, the famous monster hunter, is not what he used to be. He needs your help. An insidious shadow is choking London and Van Helsing is assembling a team to fight back.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis introduction to the alternate reality of a Gothic London under siege begins as you're recruited to help Van Helsing. A coach journey through the streets gives you a glimpse of the shadowy world that London has become as the Dark Lord's influence grows. The coach driver gives you the lowdown and you learn about Van Helsing's plight from a special mechanical storybox. But once you arrive at the entrance to Van Helsing's HQ, before you can enter, there's the small matter of an initiative test to pass. Only it's not just the puzzle that will prove challenging. It's safe to say that, for once, you'll wish you were alone in the dark...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Dark Lord is rising and you, the professor\u2019s first new recruit, must defeat his creatures of the night. You'll need ingenuity to tackle the physical puzzles, eyes in the back of your head to spot the dangers and lighting reactions to fight off the Dark Lord's minions.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1726370/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1637317083","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1726370/page.bg.jpg?t=1637317083","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1726370/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1637317083","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1726370/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1637317083","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":1783420,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Gothica: The Devil\u2019s Shadow is a single player, steampunk-influenced, adventure puzzle game designed for VR.
