{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1908390/extras/WigmundSwordLogo1.png?t=1689184821\" /><br><strong>Two twin brothers. A fellowship of warriors. And only one true King.</strong><br>We present an RPG set up in a medieval fantasy world inspired by those cultures - Anglo-Saxon and Celtic - who were explored by J.R.R. Tolkien as well. Play as Wigmund, a young warrior tasked with the disinterring of the New Regime's dark secrets. Travel an open-world, rich with outlaw camps, ruined castles, dangerous caverns and forgotten ruins to explore. As in any respectable fantasy story, the dragons will have a special place in the quests. To understand and follow the narrative of the game is crucial for solving these quests.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">KEY FEATURES:</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Unique gameplay for swordsmen</strong></h2>Control Wigmund's sword with gestures, your mouse becoming an extension of his weapon. It is really different from anything else that you've played and it might take practice before you can master it. That is not all, getting out of trouble with dodges and rolls is also required! No boss fight can be a simple stand-still hack &amp; slash but an opportunity to prove your sword mastery. Tapping a single key or your mouse will not get you very far.<br><br><br><strong>Archery</strong>: The archery build offers the opportunity to engage enemies form a safe(r) distance. As you might expect, this is easier to learn and use than the way of the sword.<br><br><strong>Intuitive controls</strong>: Move with WASD, attack once with a left click. Swipe the mouse to your left and your hero will slash to the left, swipe the mouse to your right and your hero will slash to the right.<br><br><strong>Professions</strong>: We have included three professions: <i>Medicine</i>, <i>Crafting</i> and <i>Survival</i>. With <i>Medicine</i> one will be able to craft potions for healing and elixirs that will increase stats for a longer duration. Collecting herbs will play a crucial role in this profession. With <i>Crafting</i> one can create some auxiliary armor pieces, item upgrades and jewels for enhancing items and weapons. Collecting animal hides and mining will be very important in crafting. And finally with <i>Survival</i> one will be able to fish, hunt and create different gastronomic experiences. And yes... with the proper dwarven fishing pole, one might even fish some treasure.<br><br><strong>Talents</strong>: There are available perks with four specializations: two handed sword (&quot;Sword&quot;), sword &amp; shield (&quot;Shield&quot;), bow (&quot;Ranger&quot;) and Exorcist for a melee-caster type of build. Vendors will provide re-specialization runes that will reset all points invested in any talents and attributes for a quick in-game re-specialization for players that would like to try out more than one build.<br><br><strong>Abilities</strong>: Many abilities are available. Some of them reflect the Talent/Perk system. They include (but are not limited to): a holy shield for Exorcists, a Dagger Storm for Rangers and a Shield Wall for Sword &amp; Shield warriors.<br><br><strong>Story</strong>: Discover a complex and intricate story about the unexpected adventures of the hidden knights.<br><br><strong>Allies</strong>: The task is too great for you to handle alone. Build your elite guerilla team of three and venture forth through unfathomable danger.<br><br><strong>Detailed equipment</strong>: In addition to standard equipment items various other character equipment pieces were added, like tomes, knee-guards and arm-guards. Invest the reagents and rewards you collect along the journey in equipment.<br><br><strong>Special attacks</strong>: Crush your foes with devastating special attacks that will give you the upper hand in a battle.<br><br><strong>Preternatural skills</strong>: Unleash various up-gradable preternatural abilities that will aid you in battle, either defensively or offensively.<br><br><strong>Specializations</strong>: You are not limited by classes. Develop your character in favor of speed, health, damage or preternatural abilities.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1908390/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1689184821","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1908390/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1689184821","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1908390/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1689184821","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1908390/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1689184821","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1908390/extras/WigmundSwordLogo1.png?t=1689184821\" /><br><strong>Two twin brothers.
