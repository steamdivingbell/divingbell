{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Welcome to Seclusa!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Seclusa is a blend of casual photography simulator and cozy idle game where you can play as actively or passively as you want. Each area has been handcrafted to be highly ambient and immersive, whether you're photographing the local wildlife or relaxing by the fire as the sun sets.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Demo Overview</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The demo for Seclusa contains most of the full game's mechanics, but has fewer levels, wildlife species, and unlockables. It can, however, be played freely in sandbox mode even if you've experienced all of the content!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3240900/extras/GIF_Photo.gif?t=1733439718\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Snap Photos</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your main objective is to photograph a variety of East African wildlife species under numerous lighting and weather conditions. You won't have access to much at first, but as you level up, you'll unlock more animals and locations, as well as camera upgrades that can completely change the look and feel of your photos.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gain Experience &amp; Level Up</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Fulfill daily tasks, complete photo objectives, or turn on the radio and watch the day go by as your XP bar fills up over time. Leveling up earns you credits which can be used to improve your camera, purchase amenities at the lodge, and even unlock the power to change the weather and time of day on a whim.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3240900/extras/GIF_TimeLapse.gif?t=1733439718\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Photography Sandbox</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With fully unlocked abilities, you'll have the freedom to curate your subject and setting to your liking.
