{"about_the_game":"<i>&quot;All seek inner peace out of life, though the path and what exactly that peace details is something only we can decide for ourselves.

Every elemental class comes tied with its own statuses that shape the flow of battle, and to go with this magical system are equally robust melee specializations. Each weapon has specific abilities inherent to their class, and with every character capable of dual wielding, the customization possibilities are vast.

From the very beginning, you're introduced to those who dream of a new life. As your understanding of each character expands, so does their relations to each other. By the end of the Tale, no one is as they started - all organically affected by the wages of everyday life.<br><br><strong>Riches Abound:</strong> Hidden throughout the world are many treasures, and some require great effort to obtain. Not only will you encounter many traditional treasure chests, but exploration of the countryside will yield fruits from a gladiatorial arena, a shady treasure collector and his riddling runes, a guild of fisherman and the hidden wealth of those who have separated themselves from a world of endless war. Those who go the extra mile to explore will even discover special Mementos that open the door to six fully interactive campaigns by means of the Book of Zilmurik that further flesh out the history of Eylin.
