{"about_the_game":"Wobbler is a racing game where you <strong>accelerate while turning</strong>, and <strong>decelerate while going forward</strong>. These unique physics are designed to be simple &amp; forgiving for more casual players, yet hard to master for those looking for a serious challenge. Wobble your way to first place as you find the optimal routes through a series of unique levels*, and challenge your friends or other players for the best times! Alternatively, cook up a level only you can beat!<br><br>When it comes to racing in Wobbler, <strong>there are only two controls</strong>: <i>turning left, or turning right</i>. Despite such simplicity, you may be surprised just how in-depth these two controls can get!<br><br>In this minimalistic world made up of basic shapes &amp; vibrant colors, you can get up to speeds of <strong>2,000 km/h</strong>! There are levels ranging from Easy to Very Hard difficulty. Some are slower paced with a stronger focus on parkour, routing, and precision, while others are extremely fast paced and will require optimal planning &amp; reaction times to succeed. Level <i>completion</i> should be achievable for most players, but competing for the top may not be for everyone!<br><br>Wobbler has a heavy focus on &quot;<strong>speedrunning</strong>&quot; and includes a few handy technical features such as:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Accurate and consistent built-in timers (tied to physics, with 0.01s precision).<br></li><li>Race replay files: autosaves your last 25, your personal bests for every level, and you can manually save any race you want. They can be viewed at any time, and slowed down or sped up.<br></li><li>File tampering detection: if you manually edit a replay or level file outside of the game, it will say it's been tampered with when you load this file in-game, and prevent you from creating replays with tampered levels.<br></li><li>Statistics tracking: Lifetime stats, as well as 3 sets of resettable stats which can be used to track various types of challenges or accurately time multi-level races.<br></li><li>Ease of file sharing and usage: all generated files are organized within the game's folder, and you can load from any folder.</li></ul><br>Wobbler comes with a <strong>built-in level editor</strong> which is simple enough for anyone to create a level, while also including advanced features for more complex levels:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Grid-based placement: Simpler to use, allows for faster level prototyping, and encourages consistent designs.<br></li><li>Full control over node properties: Despite the grid-based placement, you have full control over scaling, rotation, alignment, and position offset, allowing fine control over level nodes regardless of their grid position.<br></li><li>Access to advanced behaviors: You may place lights, speedboosts, and triggers, visible or invisible, which can teleport the player to other locations, hide/show other level nodes, and more. These behaviors allow you to create complex levels which teleport the player to new areas, unlock/create new areas as the player reaches other areas, or even things like puzzle/maze levels.<br></li><li>Built-in thumbnail generator: When saving a level, a thumbnail is automatically generated, and the camera placement for this can be customized. Alternatively, you can also manually create a thumbnail before uploading your level to the workshop.<br></li><li>Two camera styles: There is the primary top-down &quot;2D&quot; isometric view, allowing for a quick overview &amp; an intuitive linear level building experience, as well as a 3D camera preview to help with adjusting complex structures or levels involving height.<br></li><li>Impossible level prevention: Level creators must beat their own level and include their replay with it before it can be uploaded to the Workshop. Level files may still be shared and loaded privately before being uploaded to the Workshop, so it is possible to have a friend or team collaborate on beating a near-impossible level before its upload.</li></ul><br>The built-in level editor is somewhat primitive compared to others out there, but it has everything you need for both simple or complex levels, while remaining simple enough to be accessible for everyone. We're looking forward to seeing what the community can create with it! Note: The level editor currently does NOT allow importing new models or textures, only using the built-in ones.<br><br>*Early access disclaimer: There are currently a lot less native levels in place than there will be in the future. We're hoping to create up to 36-40 total native levels.
