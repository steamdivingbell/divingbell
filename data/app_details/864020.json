{"about_the_game":"The people of Alcomby once lived in peace. People with the power to transmute matter, called Alchemists, rose to power and reigned peacefully. Then, the world changed when people without these special powers fought back. With the help of The Church, Alchemists were forced to take part in The Great War to save their lineage and keep their rule. Unfortunately, outnumbered, the Alchemists' reign ended, and The Church took control over the land of Alcomby. Now, in these post-war times, The Church is looking to eradicate the Alchemists once and for all.<br />\r\nYou, having experienced the war first-hand, are an orphan. Your parents were killed by Alchemists when you were at a very young age. Thus, you've decided to also fight the Alchemists independently. You are an Alchemist hunter, and you are determined to set things right.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Coming Home","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/864020/bee77f2b4de11b9b6e801d3bddc993d8555d290f.jpg"},{"name":"Our Little Secret","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/864020/43d0ae51e3afaf5ed98e7e3d59ed186ef1b0a54c.jpg"},{"name":"Starting The Game","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/864020/e36127a5a1f64fceb03e22529e9519acea66654d.jpg"},{"name":"Reach the Mainland","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/864020/9066a238bd9272110eb9993ddafce19cae748c88.jpg"},{"name":"Coming to Terms","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/864020/1c700ca5ec95d8c6f442beb11333ce2b15a0683d.jpg"},{"name":"First Blood","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/864020/f13caa9186e9215467af057900e9b22f8a362dfd.jpg"},{"name":"Frozen Over","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/864020/758258df3f61efdd61a24bd6d1026ffe8dc5d865.jpg"},{"name":"You talked to who!?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/864020/96dcd635a3013cb619efcd3bd784a92a88b5d732.jpg"},{"name":"Nightmare!!!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/864020/592be14bef42c85585bd7632e69ed3ef46b0a9fc.jpg"},{"name":"Having Fun?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/864020/1412f379a31176ddef8b45760240667686de46fb.jpg"}],"total":25},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/864020?t=1726187926","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/864020/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1726187926","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/864020/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726187926","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/864020/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726187926","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"Any sexual content that we have marked for this game is not shown in any way, just implied.
