You build railroads, drive trains, collect resources, deliver goods, and watch cities grow. There several types of raw resources that spawn randomly on the map. You can build resource collection buildings to collect there resources and then transport them to manufacturing facilities to convert them into more advanced goods. There are also several different rail cars in the game, and each one is used to transport specific types of goods and resources. Ores can only be transported in ore cars, liquids in tank cars, and so on.<br><br><strong>Resources and goods:</strong><br><br>There are seven raw resources in the game; wood, coal, iron, rock, food, plants, and oil. These resources are collected by placing the appropriate resource collection building on the respective resource. Raw resources can then be transported to manufacturing buildings to be combined into more advanced goods and products. There are ten products in the game; lumber, steel, processed food, fuel, chemicals, medicine, glass, clothing, and plastic. These are created at manufacturing facilities by combining raw resources and other products. There are also six &quot;advanced&quot; types of good in the game; batteries, electronics, circuits, furniture, cars, and appliances. These can only be created at advanced factories, and are manufactured from raw resources and products.<br><br><strong>Rail cars:</strong><br><br>There are six types of rail cars in the game; ore car, log car, box car, tank car, container car, and passenger car. Each car can only carry the appropriate resources and goods. Rail cars are produced at the Train Depot from steel. Make sure to have the appropriate cars for the resources and goods that you intend to transport.<br><br><strong>Villages, Towns, Cities, and Metropolises:</strong><br><br>You can create your own villages and grow them by supplying them with food. Villages start small, but in time can grow and eventually be upgraded into Towns, and then into Cities and then into Metropolises. Towns, Cities, and Metropolises require more types of goods than just food, and you are able to build high density buildings such as low-rise, mid-rise apartments, and highrises.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1483320/extras/StoreGif2.gif?t=1717367532\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Quick Learner","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1483320/b318963864299ed88bb79749e416e259aa6e6dd2.jpg"},{"name":"Scenario 5 Complete","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1483320/8bf0a9971d3b7c5a2c4575f34208a9c37224d034.jpg"},{"name":"Scenario 10 Complete","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1483320/07b85e3f2d20d9d8bfdc5b8ec187b941e3243091.jpg"},{"name":"Scenario 15 Complete","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1483320/9f8a46c0e2302b540669ac005031de08b7e89c87.jpg"},{"name":"Rail Hoarder","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1483320/6f07c1b58fe8dbcd47999761bdaf4721c180daa6.jpg"},{"name":"Building Hoarder","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1483320/63b027def24920abcbb3f380ece99cdb1aab4296.jpg"},{"name":"Rail Baron","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1483320/32aa76aba90e359321c2f025961008bcbea3041b.jpg"},{"name":"Town Hero","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1483320/bb6f56545e3e7c61c452a419f95d6b7ad54b618c.jpg"},{"name":"City Slicker","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1483320/e7a6355280a5b49ffd84a818a31827e455d35d61.jpg"},{"name":"Metropolitan","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1483320/983b90a07e1e269316f8ccd486e728ace13c99a1.jpg"}],"total":40},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1483320/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1717367532","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1483320/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1717367532","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1483320/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1717367532","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1483320/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1717367532","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1483320/extras/ezgif.com-optimize.gif?t=1717367532\" /><br><br>Railroad Engineer is a train simulation game.
