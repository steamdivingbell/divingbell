{"about_the_game":"Supercars and Hypercars - road legal cars designed for performance, with all the technology of the 21st century unbounded by restrictive technical regulations have taken over motorsports as the main source of automotive innovation, with manufacturers pulling all the stops to try bring to the market the best car money can buy. Each of these machines are an expression of engineering creativity that can no longer be seen in top level motorsports. <br><br>With Supercars Pt1, we begin to give these incredible machines their due space in AMS2 - despite the name, this pack features one Supercar and two bona fide Hypercars, each of them with their own design focus and performance envelope:<br><br>The <strong>Corvette C8 Z06</strong> is GM\u00b4s latest reimagining of their classic sports car, and with its new mid-engine design powered by a 670 HP V8 it\u00b4s capable of delivering proper Supercar performance. Despite looking like a million bucks, it\u00b4s pricing is nowhere close to that as the Z06 is arguably the most reasonably priced Supercar on the market.<br><br>The <strong>McLaren Senna</strong> is a far more exclusive machine - this limited-production Hypecar by McLaren Automotive had only 500 models produced. McLaren\u2019s latest ultimate performance offering named after the McLaren driver for its uncompromising approach towards performance is a heavily aerodynamical machine weighing 1198kg, powered by a 4.0L V8 outputting 789 BHP, featuring active aerodynamic components and a range of electronic systems such as its e-diff, which is a brake based electronic differential optimizing the mechanical open differential into a proper performance diff - all properly modelled in AMS2.<br><br>The <strong>Brabham BT62</strong> is even more exclusive, with only 70 units produced by Brabham Automotive to celebrate its 70 years heritage in racing. Weighing 972kg and powered by a 5.4L Ford V8 outputting 691 HP, this dedicated trackday car produces a whopping 1200kg of downforce.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1392091/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1672434273","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1392091/page.bg.jpg?t=1672434273","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1392091/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1672434273","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1392091/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1672434273","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Supercars and Hypercars - road legal cars designed for performance, with all the technology of the 21st century unbounded by restrictive technical regulations have taken over motorsports as the main source of automotive innovation, with manufacturers pulling all the stops to try bring to the market the best car money can buy.
