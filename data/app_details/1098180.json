{"about_the_game":"Charon's Return is a VR coop zombieshooter with puzzles, mini games, steering the cruise ship/government research facility, and rts style core protection.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere's throwable shuriken, a steerable minisub, portal tennis, throwing rubber duckies down slides, miniature golf, remote controlled go kart racing, a boss fight involving Charon and a kraken, fighting a kaiju and a dragon, and of course we have Donald Trump.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCharon managed to break free from the research facility on the cruise ship. The research was going well, so Trump cut the funding. Not his fault! Now Charon is bringing back dead Mayans, Aztecs, and Incas. Not that Trump can tell the difference. You have to stop them by killing zombies, fighting Charon, throwing rubber duckies down slides, and just make it through this crazy cruise ship/government research facility you are on, so you can blow up the south american temples and win the game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1098180/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1578663622","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1098180/page.bg.jpg?t=1578663622","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1098180/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1578663622","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1098180/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1578663622","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Supported","id":53},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"In our game you shoot at zombies, Charon, baby Kraken, hydra's, a dragon, a Kaiju, and a Kraken, throw shuriken at zombies, and hit them with a bat.
