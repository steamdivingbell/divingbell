{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A 41-page artbook featuring the game's art in high quality, a bit about the psychology behind the characters, developer commentary, and more.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>it contains spoilers, so only read it after you've finished all the endings!</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">MyGF will always be free and you do not require this DLC to play the game.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">By purchasing this artbook you will be helping me continue to create more games and fund my future creative endeavors.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A NOTE</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">MyGF is a mysterious story and I like leaving the secrets to your imagination. I love reading how you guys interpret the mysteries and characters differently, and I don't want to ruin that by giving any external 'word of god' explanations - much less put that knowledge in an optional artbook. If I ever were to confirm any theories, it would be in a proper game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Please utilize the little details I've put into this book to help strenghten your theories and change your perspectives on the characters and the story. This is supplemental content that I hope will make your next playthrough or discussion about the game even richer.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">HOW TO ACCESS ARTBOOK</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The artbook is downloaded on MyGF's installation folder, inside the 'MyGF Digital Extras' folder.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Right click the game, then Manage &gt; Browse local files.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The file is a .pdf that can be viewed with any app that opens .pdfs. As the artbook is in extremely high resolution, you might need to zoom out a little to read it properly while on PC.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">USING THE ARTBOOK</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can print out the artbook yourself for personal use, to put it in your room, show your friends, etc. But please do not sell it, physically or digital - I already have a tough time making any money at all from my creations, and it would be really upsetting. I'm a solo dev with zero investors or anyone backing me up financially.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Thank you...</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">I only made this book due to how much you guys love MyGF. Thank you for loving it even when I can't, and for continuing to buy the Another Episode DLC. The DLC's sales are my only recurring source of income at the moment and it really means so much to me.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Thanks to you, I was able to achieve things that I never though would be possible. I'm cooking up a lot of amazing stories, so please look forward to them!</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3425380/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738942400","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3425380/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1738942400","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3425380/6393e7d88e55074ed0690f1d1df4903ee57e4984/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738942400","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3425380/6393e7d88e55074ed0690f1d1df4903ee57e4984/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738942400","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A 41-page artbook featuring the game's art in high quality, a bit about the psychology behind the characters, developer commentary, and more.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>it contains spoilers, so only read it after you've finished all the endings!</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">MyGF will always be free and you do not require this DLC to play the game.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">By purchasing this artbook you will be helping me continue to create more games and fund my future creative endeavors.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A NOTE</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">MyGF is a mysterious story and I like leaving the secrets to your imagination.
