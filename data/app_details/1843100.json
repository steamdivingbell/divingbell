{"about_the_game":"May 1864 three Union armies have been assembled by General Sherman for the march into Georgia. The Army of the Cumberland was the largest command by Major General George H. Thomas. The Army of the Tennessee was the second largest commanded by Major General James B. McPherson. Major General John M. Schofield commanded the Army of the Ohio which was the smallest of the assembled armies. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFacing Sherman was General Joseph E. Johnston and his Army of Tennessee who was outnumbered by 2 to 1 but forces from Mississippi, Mobile and the Atlantic coast were on the way to swell his ranks. Rocky Face Ridge near Dalton, Georgia was Sherman\u2019s first major obstacle. The next was the Etowah River. By June 18th Johnston had taken up his strongest position at the Kennesaw Mountain Line. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy early July Sherman had pushed Johnston back through north Georgia and the next goal was Atlanta.
