Use the <strong>AIRDODGE</strong> to become the ULTIMATE DOGFIGHTER.<br><strong>SPEEDBREAK</strong>- Tilt to the right for a short time and the aircraft will boost forwards accelerating more quickly.<br>A <strong>BLACKOUT</strong> is a negative effect. <strong>BLACKOUT</strong> occurs when the <strong>PILOT</strong> goes upwards for too long.
