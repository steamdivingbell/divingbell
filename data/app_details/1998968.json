{"about_the_game":"Experience the hustle and bustle of packed-in commuters, trains every few minutes, the echo of screeching rails in tunnels with the classic Bakerloo Line, rendered in its entirety within Train Sim World!<br><br>Dating back to 1906, the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway is among the veterans of the London Underground network, serving 25 stations in total, both nestled beneath the city in deep-level tunnels and settled upon the surface in the suburban north-west of London. It didn\u2019t take long for the portmanteau \u201cBakerloo\u201d to appear, a name which it is still known by today.<br><br>It's not just the ancient walls and platforms which have earned a veteran status, the line is served by the clunky and stoic 1972 Mark 2 Tube Stock, the oldest stock on the Underground network. Still hard-working, the 1972 Stock runs day-in, day-out on the Bakerloo, with some individual units clocking in at over 220 miles of working per day. <br><br>Take on the challenge of driving this unique stock and its camshaft controls, master the art of stopping at stations and keeping to schedule across the full working timetable of the Bakerloo Line, now featuring over 640 services!<br><br>Choose how you want to play; drive trains, ride around as a passenger, complete the route tasks, or simply pick a vantage point and watch the action unfold.
