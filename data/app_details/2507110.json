{"about_the_game":"Eris has had a rough life, and to her it feels like she's just living day to day, trying to make things work.

However, there is one place she knows she can go to feel and be herself, an abandoned graveyard just off the path of a tree-lined country road. It calls to her, beckons her to keep coming back, and to keep visiting the Ghosts that inhabit it.
