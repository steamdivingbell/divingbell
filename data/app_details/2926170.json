Push wires as close to their maximum capacity as possible without them overloading! Electricity moves faster the closer to overloading the wire is. Divert your electricity in clever ways to move it at top speed, but be careful not to push your luck or there will be explosive consequences!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2926170/extras/times.gif?t=1724304772\" /><br><br>Just completing each level is not enough. You will be awarded with one, two or three fuses based on the time it takes to charge the batteries. Combine strategic plans with quick thinking in order to achieve the best times! Each level is short enough to allow for multiple retries but long enough to test your abilities.

Complete over 80 levels across the game. Levels start out simple before slowly turning up the voltage! Across the game you will encounter multiple switches, different types of battery, electricity and anti-electricity all designed to test your abilities.

These will test your mastery of the games mechanics and push your abilities further. 'Amped' levels use the same mechanics but in shocking new ways to increase the difficulty.
