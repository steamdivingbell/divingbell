{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>TURN-BASED STRATEGY OF THE NEW GENERATION</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In this game, strategic decisions are more important than reflexes. You will find exciting single and multiplayer modes, as well as earning levels and rewards. Play in strategic standard mode, quick mode, and also in pairs mode with a friend.\u00a0The main goal of the game is to stay alive longer than your opponent.\u00a0A huge list of creatures, heroes, artifacts, skills and abilities will help the player enjoy the game as if he were playing it for the first time, while he is familiar with the basic mechanics and principles of the game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>STRATEGY IS THE WAY TO VICTORY</strong>: Eight players enter the game space, and each player has a chessboard-like board (version of it) on which they can place their units. All actions will take place on this field.</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Before the start of each battle, players will be presented with one + one for each subsequent round increase in creatures from a certain faction.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Units can then be dragged from the hero\u2019s pocket onto the battlefield, after which the battle itself will begin. At least 70% of the total units in the player\u2019s pocket must be located on the battlefield. Units that survive the battle will be available in the next battle.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">At the end of each round you will receive some items. At certain intervals in the match, more valuable items will be available to you.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">At the end of each round you will receive money depending on how well you performed. You will use gold to increase unit growth. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">At the end of each round, you will receive experience regardless of how well you performed, after which you will be able to choose one of the hero upgrades. EXP increases your character's level, which increases the number of units you can place on the battlefield, as well as the ability to increase the growth of more expensive units in the store.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Since players are beaten in separate rounds, they will slowly fall out of the running. This is a smart approach to composition and saving of your team to increase your chances of being the last man standing.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Essentially, your goal is to create a strong hero, form an army suitable for him and overcome the conflict by winning rounds and spending your gold and experience wisely.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>FRACTIONS</strong>:\u00a0Before you start the main game, you will be given the opportunity to choose one of three playable races. The set of these races is provided to the player randomly, since 4 playable races will be available in the game (44 playable fractions at a later stage of development). The  player will also have access to a second one-time random chance to choose a fraction.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>HEROES</strong>:\u00a0After choosing a fraction, you will be given the opportunity to choose one of three fraction heroes. As before, a set of these heroes is provided to the player randomly, since the game will have 12 playable heroes for each race (20 heroes at a more advanced stage of development, which will make it possible to increase their number to 800). The player will also have access to a second one-time random chance to choose a hero.</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each hero and unit has unique active or passive abilities, which allows you to have a huge number of combinations to create your own game strategy. By improving certain abilities of the hero, it makes sense to hire certain units into the army.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your character\u2019s level determines how many units you can place on the battlefield. Don't neglect this! There is a serious advantage that can be gained by having one extra troop on the battlefield than your opponents.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If you place your units correctly, success awaits you! Try to place units correctly, so that those with a lot of HP and close combat stand closer to the enemy, and those who are weaker in HP and have long-range combat are behind.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>ARTIFACTS</strong>:\u00a0After choosing a hero, you will be given the opportunity to choose one of three items. As in previous cases, a set of these items is provided to the player randomly, since about 250 will be available in the game (up to 400 at more advanced stages of development). The player will also have access to a repeated one-time random selection of an item.</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">after each battle you will receive at least one item to choose from.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Once you have made your choice, the item will appear in your inventory. You can then select and drag onto the hero the item that you think will provide the greatest benefit.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When you equip items, think about how it will benefit the hero or specific unit. Also, do not forget about items that do not affect the hero and units on the battlefield, but improve your economy. Choose wisely.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Duel 2x2</strong>:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u201cDuel 2\u00d72\u201d differs from the regular mode in that you and your friend are asked to choose a faction and a hero, and the battle takes place between four heroes at once on the same battlefield.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u201cDuel 2x2\u201d is a more complex mod of the same game, which requires understanding and developing of common strategy with your ally.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>BATTLE PASS</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With the launch of Season 1, the game will feature a Battle Pass with a huge number of rewards. Play, complete tasks to increase the pass level and earn rewards: new courses, skins, profile changes, costumes and other cosmetic in-game items. Many of these rewards are free, just play the game. And if you want more rewards and content, you can purchase a single Battle Pass for all platforms. The paid Battle Pass is not required to play and does not provide any in-game advantages.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>CROSS-PLATFORM PLAY</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Play on any device and battle players from all over the world with cross-platform play. In a hurry? Start a game on your computer and continue it on your smartphone (or vice versa). Your game profile is synced across all devices, so your progress is saved wherever you play.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>RANKED MATCHMAKING</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Everyone starts at the bottom, but by fighting other heroes you will rise through the ranks and prove yourself worthy of the Ramesh reward.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>OFFLINE PLAY</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Sophisticated AI lets you hone your skills even when you're offline. Or, if you want, just pause the game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>SEASONAL UPDATE</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each season we will increase the number of factions, heroes, items, abilities and skills to satisfy the most sophisticated players.
