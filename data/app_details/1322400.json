For example, would you help a merchant back on their feet and make a new friend, but potentially lose out on a profitable deal, or ignore their cries for help to make sure you come out on top? Would you smuggle illicit goods for some easy coins, despite the negative effects it could have on a town's inhabitants? As you make these choices, you are also pitted against time to save your own skin, creating a sense of urgency to amass as many coins as possible.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Bartering System</strong> </h2> More than just buying and selling with currency, <strong><i>Ten Thousand Coins: The Golden Merchant</i></strong> features a system where you can barter goods directly with other traders.
