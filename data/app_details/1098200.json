I have always wanted to develop a driving drift game with a retro cyber style. According to my idea, this game should have a simple drift system that makes it easy for players to play.

This driving system is definitely different from the usual driving system, It is designed for fast drift.<br><br>Please expect &quot;Vaporwave Drift&quot; to be a single (no AI) driving drift game, It's fast, easy, tight, and repeatable, with elements of collection and challenges. In the game you can choose the track you like to drift and challenge the global leaderboard(Total Laps), or you just park your car on the side of the road and listen to the music.
