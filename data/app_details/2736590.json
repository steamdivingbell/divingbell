{"about_the_game":"<strong>Hexplorando</strong> is a <strong>cozy 3D puzzle game</strong> that lets you <strong>discover the landscape and cultural heritage of Europe.</strong> As you correctly place tiles of geography, natural resources, human settlements, and historical landmarks, you will unveil the rich European heritage, starting from Spain, a diverse country with a rich history \u2013 from the lush forests and green mountains of Asturias, spotted with hundreds-years-old stone churches, to the Roman ruins near the sand dunes and breathtaking beaches of C\u00e1diz, among many others natural and historical marvels such as the Alhambra in Granada or the Sagrada Familia cathedral in Barcelona. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2736590/extras/Hexplorando_PuzzleMode_EN_Flor.png?t=1737493370\" /><br>In each puzzle, you start with a set of tiles you can choose from.
