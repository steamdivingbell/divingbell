{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How it plays</h2>Do you know which building is the tallest in the world? What is the most expensive car in the world? Which animal moves faster than all the others? Do you know the sequence in which the most popular game consoles have been released? In the Pictures of Life you will be able to test your knowledge and logic! Take colorful pictures from the magic \u0441abinet and hang them on the wall. Guess the sequence they should be placed in, based on what is drawn on them. It won't be difficult. At first. After hanging the pictures click on the button on the table to check your guess. You will have to pass many levels with different logic of combinations.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The story</h2>From time to time you will see levels with a special set of pictures. At first glance they will have nothing in common. But if you look closely you can see a thread that connects them together. A story will magically unfold before your eyes. The most attentive players will be able to find answers to many curious questions, such as: Who is the main character? How did he get in this mysterious room? What is the room really like? And the main question of the game - will he be able to get out of the room and reunite with those who are so important to his heart? To do this, he will need the player's help.
