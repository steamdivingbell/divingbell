{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2><br>In 'Behind Closed Doors', you play as Ethan, who has an office job at an unprofessional indie company, trying to support his pregnant wife. Behind Closed Doors plays for about 50 minutes, and is split into two sections. In the first half, it is just a normal week for Ethan; waking up, going to work, coming home, go to bed and repeat. But after a few days, something strange happens. Ethan gets an unusual phone call in the middle of the night, and is somehow teleported to another dimension. Ethan must then complete a few trials to get back to the real world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2><br>Work at an office job and build an indie game with your coworkers, and play test it, getting it ready for release. Talk with your colleagues, go home and spend time with your wife. Get sucked into a portal where you can explore multiple different dimensions, as you try to make your way back to the real world, and back to your family.
