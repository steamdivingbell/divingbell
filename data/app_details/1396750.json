{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tomb of the Kirin-Born Prince</h2>This adventure is optimized for five characters with an average party level (APL) of 7. Characters outside this level range cannot participate in this adventure. The adventure includes a lot of dangerous traps, so a party with a rogue or a wizard with high investigation will be incredibly useful. A small character will also be helpful. Plus, it includes a few undead uglies, so clerics will also add value to the party.<br>Note: The dungeon is extraordinarily dangerous. Players who act before they think will find themselves rolling new characters. It may even be recommended that your players create new characters just for this adventure.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Adventure Background</h2><i>By</i> <strong> Dyson Logos</strong><br>The Tomb of the Kirin-Born Prince is one of the older known tombs of the Etturan Dynasty - and one of the few whose location was not lost with the burning of the Tarek Archives.
