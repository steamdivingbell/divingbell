It\u2019s not going to scare hardcore horror fans in the traditional sense, but it will chill you to the bone with its messages. Don\u2019t miss out on this gem of a game.\u201d<br>10/10 \u2013 The Gaming Outsider<br><br>\u201cSaint Maker is easily the best original English visual novel I\u2019ve ever read, and it can easily stand toe to toe with many of the classics in the Japanese industry. The talent shown in this game needs to be supported. Not only does Saint Maker receive my highest recommendation, I now feel a personal obligation to cover Yangyang Mobile\u2019s other titles because of it.\u201d<br>Fuwanovel<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s truly a gift to see more indie experiences like this out in the wild, so both visual novel and horror fans alike should give it our full support, attention and praise. Saint Maker\u2019s design, themes and especially characters make it well worth a shot.
