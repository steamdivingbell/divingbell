{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Korter 1996 is an exploration of loneliness in a point and click adventure game. You can organise and decorate your new apartment and go on expeditions to other people's homes to find more items. While exploring different apartments on the block, you get to solve puzzles that will lead you to more information on each of the inhabitants. How you interact with the items in their apartments will move forward their story and through item dialogues you get to know about their lives.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3086500/extras/kitchen.gif?t=1739531321\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Features</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Move around items and organise to your heart's content (or make a mess)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Hear the thoughts of people who have interacted with the items you find</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Unlock new locations and uncover their mysteries</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Progress at your own pace</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Collect stickers</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Unlock the catalogue</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Redesign your apartment<br></p></li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3086500/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1739531321","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3086500/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1739531321","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3086500/6bafcf99c797d8cd7bf755c6a89db91bf8a7bff2/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739531321","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3086500/6bafcf99c797d8cd7bf755c6a89db91bf8a7bff2/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739531321","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3086820,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Korter 1996 is an exploration of loneliness in a point and click adventure game.
