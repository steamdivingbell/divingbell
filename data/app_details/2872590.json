{"about_the_game":"On an island continent known as Eirea, an eternal war wages between humans. This conflict has been going on for centuries, on and off, a hot debate on how to use resources for the continued development of mankind at the center. Unknown to the people who reside on Eirea, however, a greater, more fated war is about to take place...<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2872590/extras/desc0.png?t=1712372248\" /><br><br>R0: Concourse of Conquest is a strategy RPG with clear inspirations that may remind you of days both old and new, with a deep, rich story and an engaging world that will always keep you coming back for more. Take control of Laelynn Sinceritas and her budding army through a campaign well over 30 hours long, devising strategies and leading your charge to a victory worth celebrating.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2872590/extras/desc1.png?t=1712372248\" /><br><br>War is a terrible thing to happen, much less between humans than it is other forms of life. This much you will learn together with Laelynn as she leaves her idyllic neutral nation of St. Ronika to find her missing father, the King. What begins as a simple running away from home spirals into a long campaign filled with conspiracies, intrigue, and a history deeper than any human on Eirea could have ever imagined. Caught between the ages long war between Raena, a group of allied nations who swear by the use of magic, and Sorl, a societal conglomerate who put the advancements of humankind itself first, this young princess has a long journey ahead of herself before she can truly consider herself a rightful ruler, the reigning Queen of the St. Ronikan matriarchy.<br><br>Though humans have long been waging war on the continent of Eirea, many secrets are left unfound within the annals of the land's history. Ancient dragons who have left their mark on the world, for better or for worse. The presence of something holy and divine that guides the world to its fated path. Legends of what lies beyond the sea of stars that all people look up to at night. Uncover it all in a story that will grip you and hold on tight until you see what the world contained has in store.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2872590/extras/desc2.png?t=1712372248\" /><br><br>Laelynn isn't the only member of her upstanding army. Encounter a wide and varied cast of characters, some quirky, some serious, some brimming with life, and some that are just plain weird. Each character has their own life, their own backstory that is waiting to be uncovered, piece by piece as you explore relationships between them and the rest of the army that they fight and travel with. In a game that is rife with as much personality as R0, you can be assured that none of the characters will let you down.<br><br>Along the main story, you will see many of the characters help Laelynn in her battle for her life and ideals, and as you progress, you'll see the characters evolve in subtle ways as they also experience everything that Laelynn goes through. As well, each character will have their own opinions of each other, their own interactions with the rest of the army, and their own stories to tell. As their stories are told, you will see--and feel--every emotion that passes across their face as they connect their hearts to yours in stories worth delving into.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2872590/extras/desc3.png?t=1712372248\" /><br><br>R0: Concourse of Conquest takes after classic strategy RPGs that sell the idea of 'less is more.' While your HP stat may never go beyond 60, every single point will feel like it makes the difference. Plan your moves ahead of time and play a strategy that you know your opponent will fall naturally into without them even realizing. Be warned, however, for your foe isn't a stupid as they look. Your enemy will have their own strategy they hope to enact, and it's up to your prowess to plan around it. With three levels of difficulties awaiting you, R0 is a good challenge for beginners and exerts alike.<br><br>Of course, you do much more than just compare statistical numbers to one another. Every character has their own personal skill that separates them from the rest, and every weapon, every item, has their own niche and build that causes you to think about who is best suited for what. You're not alone, however. R0 takes dues from many modernizations games like it have went through, so expect to find quality of life everywhere you look, to bring you a smooth experience that is challenging, but not frustrating.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2872590/extras/desc4.png?t=1712372248\" /><br><br>R0: Concourse of Conquest is not just a single campaign that you will finish and put away forever after. Even if it were, the 29 main story chapters, the 7 side chapters, and the 13 challenge chapters give you more than enough to do even on a first time through. However, there's more to it than that. An intricate ranking system that grades you on your turn economy, your player strategy and even your deviousness in playing the enemy into your hands will have you trying your hardest, while multiple difficulties, multiple stories, branching paths, and more will give you reason enough to keep coming back.<br><br>Not only is there plenty to do, there's plenty to read, as well. Lore files, character reports, support conversations, additional scenarios, within R0 is a novel's worth to read to help you dive in and find your cozy spot within the world to observe inside. Unlock files by progressing through the story, reports by playing as a specific character, conversations by pairing your army up with one another, scenarios by completing the game, and much, much more.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2872590/extras/desc5.png?t=1712372248\" /><br><br>Upon release, the main story will be finished, there will be several challenge maps, New Game Plus, and an extra scenario for you to play, but future updates will continue to come out, and they'll all be free as the game continues updating. More support conversations, more extra scenarios, more challenge maps, more game modes, they're all in the works to continue expanding upon the original vision and to continue giving you reasons to come back to the game. Even if you'd rather wait until they all come out, the promise is there after release and the game will never go up in price as the game updates. Perhaps there may even be DLC that expands the game's quality even further...<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2872590/extras/desc6.png?t=1712372248\" /><br><br>Hello, this is Schwer, developer of R0 and part of Cloud Nine Productions!
