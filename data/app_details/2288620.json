{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About This Content</h2><br>On the legendary Colorado narrow-gauge Rio Grande Southern, extraordinary was the norm, and for railroaders and railroad enthusiasts alike, this remarkable underdog of a railroad took on almost mystical qualities. Rio Grande Southern evokes revered railroading names and places \u2013 Windy Point, Ophir, Lizard Head Pass, Telluride, and Pandora \u2013 and images of diminutive Baldwin-build narrow-gauge steam locomotives battling the toughest topography the Rockies could offer on grades of up to 4 percent. <br><br>Now, the extraordinary Rio Grande Southern comes to Train Simulator Classic! <br><br>Created by accomplished developer Milepost Simulations, the Rio Grande Southern route for Train Simulator Classic extends from Placerville to Rico, Colorado, 40 memorable main line route miles that include the climb to 10,250-foot-elevation Lizard Head Pass via the magnificent Ophir Loop. And the route also features Rio Grande Southern\u2019s tough ten-mile Telluride Branch extending from Vance Junction to the remote mining town of Pandora, Colorado. <br><br>The Rio Grande Southern: Placerville - Rico &amp; Telluride route for Train Simulator Classic brings to life one of American narrow-gauge railroading\u2019s most famous steam locomotives \u2013 the Baldwin, 1903-built K-27 class 2-8-2s of the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western as was operated by both D&amp;RGW and RGS.   <br><br>Born of the mind and energy of Otto Mears, the Latvian-born entrepreneur who constructed a Rocky Mountain narrow-gauge railroad empire and was known as the \u201cPathfinder of the San Juans,\u201d the Rio Grande Southern was created to haul precious ores including silver, from the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado. The U. S. Silver Purchase Act of 1890 created an insatiable demand for silver and the Rio Grande Southern, completed in 1891, enjoyed a brief prosperity.  But in 1893, the act was repealed and the market for silver plummeted; for the remainder of its existence, the RGS came under the control of the Denver &amp; Rio Grande, struggled to make ends meet with a mix of ore, timber, livestock, and other tonnage, and became a much-admired underdog struggling against the mighty Rockies for the reminder of its existence until it ceased operations in 1952.   <br><br>During its six decades of existence, the Rio Grande Southern\u2019s underdog status simply made the railroad all the more compelling, and the new Train Simulator Classic route delivers all the magic of the RGS with its scenic and inspiring mountain scenery, towering wooden trestles, twisting right-of-way, steep grades, and remote \u201cOld West\u201d character. <br><br>Along with the classic Baldwin-build K-27, which is included in both Rio Grande Southern and D&amp;RGW liveries (and with and without snowplows), the route features a complete complement of authentic rolling stock, including boxcar, gondola, tank car, flat car, and stock car, many in multiple variants and liveries, plus Rio Grande Southern\u2019s distinctive wooden cabooses in multiple liveries and variations and a D&amp;RGW narrow-gauge caboose. And also included is a selection of eight realistic and challenging freight and switching scenarios putting you to work over the length of the route. <br><br>Experience the extraordinary \u2013 and the magic of legendary Colorado narrow-gauge railroading \u2013 with the Rio Grande Southern: Placerville - Rico &amp; Telluride route for Train Simulator Classic!<br><br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2><br>Eight realistic and challenging freight and switching career scenarios are included:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Winter Northbound Part I<br></li><li>Winter Northbound Part II<br></li><li>Telluride Bound<br></li><li>Mine Run Part I<br></li><li>Mine Run Part II<br></li><li>Cattle Drive Part I<br></li><li>Cattle Drive Part II<br></li><li>Lizard Head Freight</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on the Steam Workshop online and in-game.
