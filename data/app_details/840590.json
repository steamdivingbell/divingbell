{"about_the_game":"ANOIX is a brick breaker of a new kind. You need to protect the ball from going outside of the arena while also destroying everything inside. The game is 3D and you need to think in three dimensions, but you have to protect the ball only in the horizontal plane.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br>- Unique gameplay.<br>- 84 levels.<br>- 5 worlds.<br>- 7 bonuses to collect.<br>- Immersive music.<br>- Realistic physics.<br>- Supporting gamepad, keyboard and mouse.<br>- Achievements.<br><br>ANOIX is a singleplayer game with great levels. Many of them are like logical puzzles you need to solve to beat the level. Fast-paced easy to play and hard to master action arcade. If you like challenging games with relaxing atmosphere, this one is for you. Feel free to try. It's family friendly, great for both casual and hardcore players.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Master of Time","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/840590/349ac83ad2c1e5162da09efacd350971ad4f1af7.jpg"},{"name":"The Winner","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/840590/8aac9d48c536d2fbd751322a2938238bc5d8d3a6.jpg"},{"name":"The Legend","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/840590/dfc077e1e9e4faf890b21f9dd807d3aa380fc00f.jpg"},{"name":"Super Score","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/840590/036308ed1f5ff93ea41ae3291186677d634e515c.jpg"},{"name":"Climber","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/840590/e94e2639ed48b0dd0f09ac124d18bceb113428f2.jpg"}],"total":5},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/840590/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738626856","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/840590/page.bg.jpg?t=1738626856","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/840590/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738626856","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/840590/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738626856","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"ANOIX is a brick breaker of a new kind.
