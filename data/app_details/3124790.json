{"about_the_game":"<strong>Hi, I'm Molly Orshansky, and I'm Overton's creator. </strong><br><br>It's super hard to explain what's inside the box.<br>Inside my box Skinner, we have a practical effect, choose your own adventure game. Me and my classmates have worked together on this diorama and I really hope you like it.<br><br>While I can't tell you much until the box opens, what I can tell you is inside we have wrestlers, and ghosts, and ice ponies, and gigantic lizard men!<br> Also Stewart. He wears stupid Armor. <br><br>Hmmm... I suppose you'll want more than that. But... the mystery! What can I give away?<br>Oh! I know!!!<br><br>We have some amazing youtubers who have voiced the game, and as well a super villain who stole the 4th of July from Philadelphia!<br><br>An amazing vocal performance from Suris with a supporting cast from SquidTips, RemGames, and Lily Simpson.<br>Oh, and did I mention wrestlers?<br><br>This game is all about mystery. The art of the unsaid. THE JOY of not knowing the rules of a new world, and trying to figure them out. In a bygone era, when you got a game, you didn't know the rules. You didn't know the catagories. You read an instruction manual, ignored everything, looked at the pretty pictures and pieced things together to the best guess you could.<br><br>Now, every game I pickup, I know the rules as soon as I go. I know who the characters will represent, and the general idea of what's expected of me. I feel like a magician who has lost the ability to feel wonder while watching a magic trick. <br><br> Overton is a deconstruction of the child like wonder of video games, and the joy that comes with having to figure out the rules in a world you don't grasp fully.<br><br>Our world is a world of optimization, the digital world, optimized to churn out and replicate by it's very nature of being digital. So instead, I built Overton.<br>Overton keeps every element that makes a video game, without a single scrap of digitization. The most advanced the game will ever get is a simple chromakey layering.<br><br>Well, I mean, that's if you don't count the super duper high tech 3d printer that made everything.<br><br>If you don't want ANY spoilers don't read below this part, because seriously, you don't wanna know even this much!<br>-The game is a multi-ending RPG with a series of decisions that alter the unlockables you can obtain, and combat is done through exploring the art of Kayfabe through powerpoint presentation by Dr Nuclear Wynter. <br>-There's also a text based adventure based on the CEOgre, or the PROgress (Puppet laptops)<br>-There's also included a series of real life stories from my life and the insanely crazy jobs I've worked. Like just to give an example, I used to be a carnival barker for a digital live dunk tank.<br><br>If you're looking for advanced features in gaming? <br>That's not here.<br>But if you're looking for a touch based laptop made out of felt you can play on... that's me!!!!
