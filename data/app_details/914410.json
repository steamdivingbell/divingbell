It thrives in a cold mountainous region and has a reputation for growing on sheer mountain peaks and cliffs. It is the only flower known to grow through layers of snow in order to reach the sunlight. When carefully transplanted near the village the Winterflower is considered a blessing which protects the village from harm.<br><br>It is customary for the men of the village to ask the women to the dance by presenting them with rare, difficult to obtain gifts.
