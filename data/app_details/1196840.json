Each God is unique and will come with its own set of powers and abilities. It is up to you to choose a God of your liking to devote your life to.<br>By acts of utter devotion you will gain your God\u2019s favors, they will give you their powers in battle or grant you the ability to become their avatar for a limited period of time. Gods are all mighty, they don\u2019t listen to the mortals\u2019 callings all the time. Some of your calls will go unanswered.<br>You can unlock this power by filling up your devotion bar. Performing certain actions such as finding Runes will grant you more abilities during your avatar state while others like defeating certain enemies, damaging Templar flags or other artifacts will help fill up your devotion bar faster.<br>When your devotion bar is full you will be able to pray and will have good chances to receive an answer from your God. This depends on how many offerings you brought to your God how pleased he is with you and what equipment you have on. In the worst chance scenario, the God deems you unworthy of his time. If you are lucky enough you will become the God\u2019s avatar for a limited period of time, gaining massive powers and a new set of abilities.<br>The choices you make regarding new items will affect the way your devotion bar fills up and the way your God will respond to your prayers.<br>The game provides different ways of influencing your God and how he will aid you in battle.<br><br><strong>---Classes/Builds/Combat---</strong><br>You can choose between three different classes, each with its unique gears and weapons. Characters in Viking Vengeance are visually distinct and grant access to different skills and items that have to be used in combination with the God mechanic. These combinations allow you to build unique experiences every time and influence the way you approach encounters.<br>Each class will have the ability to execute the enemies after their health reaches a certain threshold. Executing enemies will either give you health back or extra blood currency which can be used for reviving, boosting your devotion or for other gains.<br><br><strong>---Level Up---</strong><br>Leveling up in Viking Vengeance consists in receiving options to choose from at certain levels as well as receiving extra stat points.<br>At certain levels you receive options of items and weapons to choose from that are brought to you by the only Valkyrie that is willing to help you. At other levels you will receive options for new skills or upgrades for the current ones.<br>We have designed the characters to have a maximum of 6 basic abilities, one weapon trait ability and one ultimate ability. We hope this will result in engaging experiences.<br><br><strong>---AFTER LIFE---</strong><br>In Viking Vengeance, death comes at a price. <br>Your options will be Reviving on the spot for a large blood cost or going to Valhalla and escape it. When returning to Midgard from Valhalla you will always be marked by Valkeries with different intensity effects, depending on your results in the challenges of the After life. While marked the Valkeries will hunt you and try to get you back to the spirit world. <br>You will have to choose the price of your death, come back marked or be willing to sacrifice your hard earned blood currency. Each option has their downsides, so use them wisely.<br><br><strong>---Monsters &amp; Enemies---</strong><br>In Vikings Vengeance, enemies will be memorable and have different behaviors, strengths and weaknesses. Enemies will only appear in specific areas and they will come with their own specific and unique moves that will require new strategies for their defeat. We aim towards making each encounter different and not just destroy entire waves with one blow. You will remember when a clumsy and slow Jotun will manage to land a hit, you will remember that the Dragur attacks are burning up points from your devotion bar, preventing you from using the power of the Gods. Another intriguing enemy will be the Templar Priest who has a divine shield from his God, making him invulnerable to non God attacks. Whenever you will encounter a new enemy, it will be a new experience.<br><br><strong>---Rune stones---</strong><br>While discovering the world of Vikings Vengeance, you will come across Runes, blessed stones that will offer benefits on your journey. The most important Runes you need to find are the Nine Noble Virtues.<br>Finding all the nine stone is your main mission. It is said that once all the Noble Virtues are together, they will form a powerful legendary weapon of the Gods. This weapon has the potential to change the fate of the world.<br>The Nine Noble Virtues will reveal their origin story by deciphering the mosaics you will gather. You will encounter nine mosaics, one for each Noble Virtue. <br><br><strong>END GAME REPLAYABILITY RAID MODE</strong><br>After completing the story your job is still far from over. Even if you manage to push back the Templar conquest, the War goes on. This time it will be different. This time you will bring the war to them, after giving back much needed hope to your people you will start fighting in the Raid game mode.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1196840/extras/tab_3.png?t=1602941020\" /><br>It all began in the Dark Ages, initially as a trembling flame that turned into a full blown conflict between the two faiths.<br>These were the times when people believed God Wrath was unleashed upon the world. The Enlightened Templars made a peace treaty with the heathens to stop the unnecessary bloodshed. Templars split in two factions, the ones who wanted to earn back God\u2019s favor and the Enlightened Ones. Through much political turmoil, only one managed to survive from the Enlightened Ones\u2019 faction.<br>Insert gif here.<br>The last Templar went on a quest to find the Holy Grail. His only wish was to put an end to the Dark Ages and heal the world. Through his perseverance he managed to find the Holy Grail, put an end to the peace treaty and be proclaimed Emperor by the people.<br>Through this new position and with the aid of the Holy Grail, he restored the Templars\u2019 Order, this time as a military force with the purpose of eradicating all the heathens and avoiding a new Dark Age.<br>Witnessing the unnecessary bloodshed of innocent people, a Templar Sergeant has a change of hearth and turns his back on his fellow Templars during the knight initiation process. What the Templar Sergeant did not know, were his pagan origins.<br>Trying to reconnect with your people, from whom you were taken as a child, and to put an end to the Templar oppression, you will rediscover your original Gods and you will be harnessing their powers. You will find out the legend of an ancient weapon that could change everything.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1196840/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1602941020","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1196840/page.bg.jpg?t=1602941020","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1196840/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1602941020","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1196840/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1602941020","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"War, Violence, Cartoony Gore, Death by weapons"},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1196840/extras/tab_1.png?t=1602941020\" /><br>-3 unique classes to choose from.<br>-Unique level up system with a variety of skills, talents and items.<br>-Worship a God of your choosing to gain their aid in battle or even become their avatar for a limited period of time.<br>-Collect blood and use it for rituals at the Idol Statues to boost your devotion to the Gods and enhance your abilities.<br>-Visit the blacksmith to improve your gear or buy new items.<br>-2 different paths to choose from when you die, each with its own advantages and disadvantage.<br>-An unique story mode that will challenge your imagination.<br>-Execute your enemies to restore your health or gain extra blood that can be used in the revival process.<br>-Collect unique rune stones to enhance the Idol Statues and receive more God Skills.<br>-Use the environment and game physics in your favor, to gain the upper hand in combat.<br>-Pray to your Norse God and push back the Templars.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1196840/extras/tab_2.png?t=1602941020\" /><br>- Raid mode where you go to pillage and loot different Christian settlements - more details soon<br>- Different classes such as Berserker, Shieldmaiden and others.<br>- Arena of Gods where you go to test your might and try out different builds<br><br>The amazing music in the video is by  Danheim, check out his youtube channel<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1196840/extras/tab-gameplay.png?t=1602941020\" /><br><br><strong>---GODS---</strong><br>During your journey in the Vikings\u2019 world you will come across different Idol statues of Gods that you can unlock.
