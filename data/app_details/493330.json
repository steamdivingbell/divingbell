{"about_the_game":"BrashMonkey is pleased to present the Delta Missions Environment Art Pack.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis art pack comes fully loaded with a large assortment of highly detailed and dangerously flexible images and tile-sets,   ready to merge, layer, blend, and tile together as you see fit to create the lush and beautiful yet imposing environments for your next side-scrolling action game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpanning 4 unique environment themes, each offering a large array of image components for creating foreground, mid-ground, and distant layers of depth in 3 pre-made color or lighting variations, when used in art programs like Photoshop or the fantastic and free Krita from Krita.org, the customizing possibilities are virtually endless.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to individual image components, each environment set offers a high resolution tile-set in three common perspective variations for the core of the foreground layer, which can be scaled down to fit the needs of your specific game project's tile size requirements.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBrashMonkey's Environment Art Packs are unique, because they include several Spriter animated props per environment!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can either used these Spriter files in conjunction with one of the many Spriter run-time API's to have silky-smooth tweened animations playing back in you game, or you can export the animated props as full frame images or sprite-sheets at any scale and frame-rate you desire.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMake your video game worlds come to life, with BrashMonkey's Delta
