You can also use WASD to move and the arrow keys to zoom.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Difficulty:</h2>A full range of difficulty is included, but all levels start unlocked, your progress is saved as you play, and you can use hints if you get stuck.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get immersed:</h2>Each painting has its own music to help you connect with the world, as you search for everything.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Replayable</h2>You can restore a small number of hidden objects back into a painting so you can find them again! It\u2019s much harder when there are only a few hidden objects left (especially randomly). You can also use up to 3 save slots so you can replay without progress loss. Alternatively, you can reset your progress for the entire game if you\u2019d like to start over.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Perfect","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2635750/d54ba2b0839e32a7664303f7700846117f5e2162.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Saturn Glow","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2635750/6b73a04590bb01b0a6519f2bc159e07b90055a1b.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Launch Control Room","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2635750/0612c7516b4d93ca3fc2e8e0d0c3af121c00bfa8.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Too Tired To Tidy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2635750/28214e3b2822b1150cb7a2d4b460fd58f4c1ef99.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Cozy Piano Cabin","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2635750/9ef96f39f383cea205e2e57fd1977ffdfc096e30.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the The Map Was Right","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2635750/1715051b7a4799a7d6ce78815c6cd742394bc0a7.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Bread On Legs","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2635750/1c9e29a7324ca5efa14e399877ec0afb21b12b90.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Piano Practice Room","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2635750/7a9f1e2b3a2a87040cdc68746279b4521a622b9a.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Frog Festival","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2635750/ff94a7016d52e0a1bb9df04bb4ba6af8ee73c1e5.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the The Little City","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2635750/775efbba83050427d0f0b7154ffb467a210bfcef.jpg"}],"total":16},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2635750/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714855852","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2635750/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1714855852","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2635750/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714855852","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2635750/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714855852","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Recommended for you</h1><p><br></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>A hidden object game where you must find all the cats and wool to complete each level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2>\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f 15 Unique artworks<br>\u2753 1500+ Hidden objects total<br>\ud83d\udc08 750+ Cats<br>\ud83e\uddf6 750+ Wool<br> \ud83d\udca1 \u221e Unlimited hints if you get stuck<br>\u267b\ufe0f Restore a small number of hidden objects to a painting so you can find them again!<br>\ud83c\udfb5 Music for each artwork<br>\u2328\ufe0f Use your keyboard to move/zoom in if you have no scroll wheel<br>\ud83d\udcbe 3x save slots<br>\ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f Reset progress entirely and play again<br>\ud83d\udd52 Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Context:</h2>The brief was simple.
