{"about_the_game":"Into Oblivion is an immerse interactive novel where your choices shape the story. Beautiful writing and intuitive game design combine to form a truly unique experience - a novel in which your actions affect the story so much it can change completely. Into Oblivion's story dynamically changes depending on your decisions. Storylines branch and weave, combining in various unexpected ways. A single choice can completely change the story - for better or worse.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story Synopsis</h2>Humanity has settled amongst the stars, spreading far and wide across the galaxy. The great war between the stellar systems ended decades ago. Born into an age of relative peace and prosperity, you are free to choose your own path in life. Work for a struggling starship manufacturer, a omnipotent investment megacorporation, the largest military force to ever grace the galaxy or even the most popular religion. However you must take heed for not everything is at it seems. The fate of the entire universe barely hangs by a single thread - ready to snap at any moment.<br><br>So, settle your mind and pray you have what it takes to fly Into Oblivion.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Engine</h2>Into Oblivion runs on a custom game engine developed from the ground up for interactive novels and text narrative focused games. Known as &quot;Simple Contextual Reactive Book Engine&quot; or SCRIBE, it powers Into Oblivion and hopefully more games in future.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2866900/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724908417","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2866900/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1724908417","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2866900/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724908417","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2866900/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724908417","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"- Written descriptions of physical violence such as being shot or stabbed\r\n- Written descriptions of characters dying, including from the player's direct actions\r\n- Written descriptions of suicide and its effects\r\n- Written descriptions of characters using alcohol, legal and illegal drugs\r\n- Written descriptions of violence against vulnerable groups such as the elderly and financially unstable\r\n- Characters speaking in crude language and/or with profanity"},"detailed_description":"Into Oblivion is an immerse interactive novel where your choices shape the story.
