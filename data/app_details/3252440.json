For example, there are the gun type weapons that attack multiple times but have a larger chance to miss; the game-play also has many puzzle and exploration elements that involve mini-games and talking to certain NPCs. The game has a heavy emphasis on story/dialogue and focuses on various topics and ideas in both humorous and serious ways, you also gain multiple party members throughout the game who have different personalities and join/leave your party at certain points in the story. Additionally there are many secrets, mysteries, side areas/dungeons, and people to talk to, so it's usually best to search the many areas that this world has to offer in order to progress and find things you wouldn't otherwise.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3252440/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729491386","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3252440/page.bg.jpg?t=1729491386","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3252440/f5682a1d6910286f444415b8b85fba493936eee4/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729491386","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3252440/f5682a1d6910286f444415b8b85fba493936eee4/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729491386","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"There are various offensive and sexual jokes within the game.\r\nThe game also has some blood and gore and covers some heavy topics (such as suicide, manipulation, and helplessness)."},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Geon is a mostly linear turn-based  JRPG with a setting that has many sci-fi/fantasy elements while also taking place in a not so distant future ruled by a ruthless despot only known as &quot;George&quot;. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Play as a young man who is about to complete the final test before he becomes a member of society.
