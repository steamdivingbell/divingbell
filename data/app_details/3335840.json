{"about_the_game":"<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You wake up on the floor of an old house, confused and not remembering how you got there. As you look for answers, you find diaries written by someone named Jack, who was once trapped in the same situation as you. They contain clues and reveal that the house belonged to Micheal, a kidnapper and murderer, whose cursed soul lures others in to keep doing his terrible acts. The diary explains that the souls of the people he killed are also cursed and trapped in the house. To free the cursed trapped souls and escape, you need to defeat Micheal's cursed soul.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i><strong>Pick Up Items:</strong></i><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3335840/extras/Screenshot_2024-11-08_191112.png?t=1734664229\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i><strong>Manage Your Inventory:</strong></i><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3335840/extras/Screenshot_2024-11-08_202937.png?t=1734664229\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i><strong>Remember To Always Keep Your Gun Reloaded:</strong></i><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3335840/extras/Screenshot_2024-11-08_204230.png?t=1734664229\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i><strong>Hide In The Lockers:</strong></i><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3335840/extras/Screenshot_2024-11-08_191347.png?t=1734664229\" /></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3335840/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734664229","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3335840/page.bg.jpg?t=1734664229","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3335840/9f642770f03048d897c256722b1cd89250ee12a0/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734664229","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3335840/9f642770f03048d897c256722b1cd89250ee12a0/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734664229","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"The Cursed Soul contains horror elements, including loud jumpscares, the use of weapons such as knives and pistols, and violent encounters with monstrous enemies."},"detailed_description":"<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You wake up on the floor of an old house, confused and not remembering how you got there.
