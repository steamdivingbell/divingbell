{"about_the_game":"MetaSpace is a 2D action strategy game in which you captain a ship and manage an outpost in a strange new universe. You are in charge of your faction's endeavours to solidify their position in MetaSpace but many other factions are all trying to gain their own foothold. Make wise decisions to use your time to its fullest or face an insurmountable enemy that grows ever stronger.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Develop your base!</h2><br>Acquire resources by exploring, fighting or mining and use them to upgrade your base. Construct new facilities to better train your officers, upgrade and modify your equipment, build new ship designs and research new technologies! Construct new outposts to expand your territory but be wary of enemy fleets that may launch an attack!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Train your crew!</h2><br>Your officers will gain new skills and traits as they gain experience. Some traits may be helpful such as allowing them to help another officer recover from an injury, while other traits may prove a hindrance. As your officers develop and gain more powerful and rare abilities the prospect of their untimely demise becomes more daunting.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Make Friends or Foes!</h2><br>You'll encounter many factions in MetaSpace all with different traits that affect how they develop, behave and respond to you. Depending on your actions and decisions they may become a great ally or a terrible enemy. Visit their outposts to purchase equipment and hire mercenaries or make new pacts that will help both of your factions succeed.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Highly Moddable</h2><br>The same tools used to create content for the game are available to you! Create your own modpacks featuring ships, events, items and skills. Then share them with your friends on the workshop!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1173960/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731257404","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1173960/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1731257404","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1173960/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731257404","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1173960/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731257404","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"MetaSpace is a 2D action strategy game in which you captain a ship and manage an outpost in a strange new universe.
