{"about_the_game":"<strong>Pocket Wheels</strong> is about the childhood dream of imagining adventures with your toys inside the house. It's a 3d platformer and racing game crossover, inspired by 90s collectathons. You play as a toy car with various abilities like jumping, gliding, and even a grappling hook. There are various vehicles that you can purchase with coins in the toy garage. Coins are collected in one of the many rooms inside the fully explorable house. Every room has a different theme with various race tracks, objectives and collectibles. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1129360/extras/abilities_title.png?t=1732194141\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1129360/extras/abilities.gif?t=1732194141\" /><br><br>Use your jump ability to complete various objectives or extend your wings to get off the track and explore the different rooms.
