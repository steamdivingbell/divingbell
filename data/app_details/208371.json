{"about_the_game":"The EMD GP9 is a great road switcher which can find a home on any of your US routes in Train Simulator. <br><br>Built by the General Motors Electro-Motive Division (EMD) between 1954 and 1959, these 1,750-horsepower diesel-electric locomotives were put to use across the whole of the United States, Canada, Mexico and South America. More than 3,400 examples were built, making the 4-axle \u2018Geep\u2019 one of the best-selling US locomotives of all time. A number of GP9s remain in service today on short lines and industrial facilities, and as switchers for the major railroads, though they can be difficult to spot as they have mostly been extensively rebuilt.
