{"about_the_game":"When the night falls upon the world, darkness gets viscous and prickly, drawing strength and life away from the unwary travelers.

Their minutes of life might be numbered. The traveler is now forced to spend these minutes preparing for the upcoming fight against the dark. <br><br> Perhaps they can find a way to leave the island.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Research and Riddles</h2>In this game you have to explore a large, hand-crafted world full of secrets, puzzles and traps. To get through the Earth's thickness and find a way to leave the cursed island.<br><br>The game offers you 2 types of gameplay: a platformer, with a side view, and a shooter with a top view, placing more emphasis on parkour and battles in different parts of the game, or on exploring mazes, respectively.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Items and crafting</h2>It's up to you to decide exactly how to become stronger in this world. You can either find powerful weapons and equipment in caches around the world, or create it from resources yourself. In any case, the player has more than 80 items at his disposal, among which there are both melee / ranged weapons and unique accessories.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Time is running out</h2>Don't lose your vigilance!
