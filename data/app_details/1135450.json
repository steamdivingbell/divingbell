{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What If Summer Could Last Forever?</h2><br>Summer is a magical time: suspended between past and future, long days and warm nights. One year after saving Kingsport High at the junior prom, you\u2019ve graduated, and you\u2019re working as a counselor at a sleepaway camp before heading off to college. You\u2019re in charge of a cabin full of nine- and ten-year-olds, responsible for taking care of them and teaching them everything you know. But you\u2019re also enjoying a summer of freedom: you\u2019re away from your parents and on your own. <br><br>Camp Cedarcrest has its share of mysteries. Why do the people in the camp\u2019s photos look like they never age? Why is the groundskeeper always lurking on the edges of the camp? Why can\u2019t your friends remember what happened last summer?  And what about the ghost stories? Generations of campers tell stories about seeing the White Lady floating through the woods.<br><br>When you meet the White Lady and her companions, you discover that what\u2019s really going on in the forest is even stranger than just ghosts - and when you find a powerful source of new magic, you also discover that it comes with a high price.
