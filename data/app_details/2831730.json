{"about_the_game":"Millie's back and she's still mad!<br><br>In this latest installment of the long-running Millie Megavolte series, you play as Millie Megavolte, Lance LeTourre, Kilzek Green, Anne Abelle and a ton of new characters too as they fight for what's right (&quot;right&quot; being a relative term here).<br><br><strong>Story Mode</strong><br>The classic! Instead of one big adventure, the story is told through lots of short ones. Every story involves different characters and gives a piece of the bigger picture of what's going on. At first, Millie and Lance set out to stop the Mole King but things get a little more complicated from there.<br><br><strong>Adventure Mode</strong><br>Done with Story Mode? Great! Play Adventure Mode FOREVER! Adventure Mode is a rogue-lite-lite where the areas are randomized and the levels themselves are shuffled.
