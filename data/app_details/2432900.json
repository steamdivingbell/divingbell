As your creator sends you out into the vast maze of machinery to fetch and complete various missions, equip yourself with an armory of weapons and abilities purchased from the corporation that owns you or that you managed to extract from before. Exploring the dark mysteries of the world, a story will come to light that will have you dying over and over again to unfold.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2432900/extras/Forlorn_616.png?t=1718907088\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2432900/extras/Story.png?t=1718907088\" /><br>Humanity has lost their sense of home as earth is now nothing more than a forgotten legend. Knowing only a world of machines and artificial intelligence, humanity has reverted to extremes in order to survive. The enigmatic computer minds known as the Aggregate are as uncaring and as constant as the forces of nature. They maintain the vast incomprehensible workings of this new world known as The Assembly. A corporate slave is born. A cloned human made from flesh and steel. This cyborg  is thrown into an endless cycle of death and rebirth, completing tasks for corporate overlords and being reuploaded to a new body each time it should fail.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2432900/extras/Cybernetic_Abilities_616.png?t=1718907088\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2432900/extras/Cybernetic_Abilities.png?t=1718907088\" /><br>The cyborg's creator is a firm believer in having more hands to get a job done faster, thus, he has equipped the cyborg with four arms. This unique mechanic gives players options for their loadouts that most shooters don't have. Equip more guns for higher firepower, or opt for abilities that can improve movement.

This will make every mission a unique experience and players will never quite know what's around the corner.
