{"about_the_game":"Pixel Puzzles World War II, merging history with the definitive jigsaw puzzler on the PC platform.<br><br>The Battle of H\u00fcrtgen Forest, fought from September 1944 to February 1945 during World War II, was a grueling and protracted engagement between American and German forces in the dense and rugged H\u00fcrtgen Forest along the German-Belgian border. It was marked by harsh weather conditions, dense forests, and fortified German positions, resulting in high casualties for both sides. The battle was part of the broader Allied campaign to push into Germany, and it served as a prelude to the Battle of the Bulge. Ultimately, the Allies secured control of the forest at a high cost, with limited strategic gains, and it remains one of the lesser-known but intensely challenging campaigns of the war.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PACK INFO:</h2><strong>Puzzle Count:</strong> 9<br><strong>Total Piece Count:</strong> 2552<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PACK CONTENTS:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Bradley, Gerow, Eisenhower &amp; Collins - x425<br></li><li>Captured Panzer VI - x330<br></li><li>Fatigued After the Battle - x425<br></li><li>Heavy Infantry Gun - x140<br></li><li>Rest - x330<br></li><li>Resupply - x216<br></li><li>Treacherous Terrain - x216<br></li><li>US Soldiers in the Forest - x140<br></li><li>US Soldiers On the Move - x330</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1760834/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1697152499","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1760834/page.bg.jpg?t=1697152499","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1760834/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1697152499","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1760834/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1697152499","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Pixel Puzzles World War II, merging history with the definitive jigsaw puzzler on the PC platform.<br><br>The Battle of H\u00fcrtgen Forest, fought from September 1944 to February 1945 during World War II, was a grueling and protracted engagement between American and German forces in the dense and rugged H\u00fcrtgen Forest along the German-Belgian border.
