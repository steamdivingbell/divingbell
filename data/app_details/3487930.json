{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Play Checkers, Feel Its Beauty</h2><br>Have you ever played checkers with your parents, grandparents, siblings, or friends, where the most important thing wasn\u2019t the outcome but simply enjoying the game? Do you remember those moments with nostalgia? If so, set aside the tension of competition, relax, and enjoy the game once again. A game that was initially conceived as a gift from a son to his retired father. A father who was the one who taught him to play this wonderful game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br>- <strong>Simple, relaxing, and accessible gameplay experience for everyone:</strong> Whether you\u2019re an adult, a retiree, or a child, you can enjoy the checkers experience where difficulty doesn\u2019t matter.<br><br>- <strong>Play in stunning environments designed by artists for Unreal Engine 5:</strong> Whether indoors or outdoors, you can play in a unique setting thanks to the power of Unreal Engine 5.<br><br>- <strong>American Checkers or &quot;English Draughts&quot; ruleset:</strong> Play one of the most famous and recognized variants in the world.<br><br>- <strong>Nostalgia and Beauty:</strong> Relive those moments of the past where, thanks to Unreal Engine 5, you can almost feel like you\u2019re in front of a real board and pieces. Observe the details of light reflecting on incredibly realistic textures that simulate marble in the pieces and wood on the board. Do you remember that feeling?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Author\u2019s Notes</h2><br>This game aims to offer a <strong><u>NON</u></strong>-competitive experience, primarily visual and relaxing for the player. That\u2019s why the game does not include any multiplayer mode or competitive AI. I know there are expert checkers players looking for a challenge, but this game is not that case.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Special Dedication</h2><br>I would like to take this opportunity to dedicate this game to my father with all my love. He has been the one who taught me everything and deserves this gift, and much more, in full measure. Thank you very much :)","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3487930/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738364547","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3487930/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1738364547","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3487930/dbec2f5e9110a930ca1c4487cf8bc89c4d9d592d/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738364547","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3487930/dbec2f5e9110a930ca1c4487cf8bc89c4d9d592d/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738364547","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Play Checkers, Feel Its Beauty</h2><br>Have you ever played checkers with your parents, grandparents, siblings, or friends, where the most important thing wasn\u2019t the outcome but simply enjoying the game?
