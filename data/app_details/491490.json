{"about_the_game":"The Rockwell B-1B Lancer\u2122, affectionately known as the &quot;Bone&quot; to its crews, is a key element of the American Strategic Long Range bomber fleet. The aircraft, while not technically stealth-capable, is designed to present only a fraction of the radar profile of earlier large bomber types and incorporates extremely advanced navigation, weapons, and avionics systems. Its swing wing technology, combined with four 30,000-lb thrust turbofan engines, creates a beautiful, fast, and instantly recognisable package. The development of this successor to the B-52\u2122 began in the early 1960's and resulted in a contract being awarded to Rockwell in 1970. The B-1A\u2122 first flew in 1974 but only 3 prototypes were built. 1981 saw an order placed for a fleet of 100 B-1Bs\u2122, the last of which were delivered in the early 1990's.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Native FSX model with all FSX features <br></li><li>Authentic virtual cockpit with animations and mousable controls <br></li><li>Many custom interior and exterior animations including automatic wing sweep on load-up <br></li><li>Opening bomb bays with various era-specific payloads <br></li><li>Animated afterburner cans with realistic flame effects <br></li><li>Night lighting textures and effects inside and out <br></li><li>High-fidelity sounds set from Turbine Sound Studios <br></li><li>custom afterburner rumble sound <br></li><li>Many simulated cockpit systems, including the VSD <br></li><li>Researched and authentic flight dynamics <br></li><li>37-page PDF illustrated user manual in .pdf format</li></ul><br><br>**Note \u2013 this aircraft does not feature a 2D panel<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/491490/extras/BOEING.jpg?t=1537268909\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/491490/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1537268909","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/491490/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1537268909","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/491490/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1537268909","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/491490/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1537268909","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Rockwell B-1B Lancer\u2122, affectionately known as the &quot;Bone&quot; to its crews, is a key element of the American Strategic Long Range bomber fleet.
