This demo has a few puzzles so you can see what the game play is like to help you decide whether or not you want to commit to buying. On the full version you will encounter 7 levels of puzzles, traps, monsters, robots and more! You'll also get to drive a high-performance truck and shoot a mini-gun....!

If your hardware has less than 1Gb of video memory and you don't have DirectX support then the game may not run smoothly. The game is designed to be played using an Xbox360 controller; keyboard/mouse control is optional - but the game won't feel as good to play (and using a laptop trackpad is not recommended).
