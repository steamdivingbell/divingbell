He can increase his health, armor, speed, and his average damage by using potions, honing machines, sacred rocks, and beetles. There are three types of potions available and they affect Heragos' core stats when used whereas sacred rocks help him fight against his enemies during missions and combats. Heragos can use the honing machine to improve his weapon in three different specs: sharpness, weight, and durability. An NPC blacksmith is required to upgrade the weapon to the next level. Players can collect beetles by slicing clot worms, digging up beetle nests, and opening beetle chests, and can use them in the stat menu to dynamically increase/decrease sub-stats of Heragos.
