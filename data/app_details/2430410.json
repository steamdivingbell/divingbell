{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DESCRIPTION</h2>If you enjoy games centered around the concept of the Backrooms, you will find this game intriguing as it adopts a school theme. &quot;Myth&quot; is an online co-op horror game designed for up to 4 players, where you and your friends can delve into the mysteries of a haunted school while unraveling intricate puzzles. As a character in the game, you embark on a desperate quest to locate your missing friend. However, the school authorities have suppressed any information regarding the disappearance, compelling you and your friend to take matters into your own hands.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Goal</h2>The goal of this game is simple: for each level, you need to find a password, and in order to obtain the password, you must solve puzzles.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2430410/extras/4-cropped.png?t=1685690714\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LEVELS</h2>The game consists of 4 primary levels, each specifically crafted to present players with diverse puzzles and Entities. However, it is not as easy as it may seem, as the Entities possess formidable hunting abilities (similar to soul-like games), and survival relies on your ability to discover and exploit their weaknesses.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2430410/extras/3-cropped.png?t=1685690714\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ENTITIES</h2>In this game, Entities have the ability to swiftly eliminate players. To ensure survival, you must actively seek out their weaknesses by either testing your own abilities or studying relevant notes and clues.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PUZZLES</h2>Myth features 4 primary puzzles within the game, each requiring approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour to solve. In certain levels, the password will be randomized, meaning that if you die, you will need to repeatedly tackle that particular puzzle from the beginning.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2430410/extras/2-cropped.png?t=1685690714\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FEATURES</h2>Proximity Voice Chat: Engage in voice chat to communicate with other players.<br>Entities: Each entity possesses unique strengths; discover their weaknesses to increase your chances of survival.<br>Spectator: When playing with friends, you have the opportunity to collaborate and act as their eyes even after you have perished.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2430410/extras/1-cropped.png?t=1685690714\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Dump way to die","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2430410/593fb07c01ee2edecaedfd3d598e567b239cc0b9.jpg"},{"name":"Secret plan expose","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2430410/02a63bb162ad660e7191a7e511f421caa6147533.jpg"},{"name":"Eagles eyes","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2430410/c418f93f0a4064f53e565428480721ef61d55920.jpg"},{"name":"Totally Genius","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2430410/400a5fa10c6c5be31e96a80ff1052165b79c83cd.jpg"},{"name":"Why We still not JUMP!!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2430410/a1752ea3b3dfab53595d751499eed7749954140e.jpg"},{"name":"Survival!?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2430410/6af688bc1b1c8a13e62b3905503aad4d915d7b95.jpg"}],"total":6},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2430410/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1685690714","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2430410/page.bg.jpg?t=1685690714","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2430410/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1685690714","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2430410/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1685690714","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DESCRIPTION</h2>If you enjoy games centered around the concept of the Backrooms, you will find this game intriguing as it adopts a school theme. &quot;Myth&quot; is an online co-op horror game designed for up to 4 players, where you and your friends can delve into the mysteries of a haunted school while unraveling intricate puzzles.
