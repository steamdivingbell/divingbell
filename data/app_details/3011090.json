{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3011090/extras/pe_steammaincapsule.png?t=1717026839\" /><br><br><strong>BETRAYAL!</strong>  As the Prime Evil, you were once the greatest force for bad there was in your slice of the universe...until you got a knife in your back for all your efforts.  Risen again as a lich, you're back to claim what's yours in this comedic cartoon adventure -- with a mixture of roguelite character-building, intense action, and a vast array of spells and weapons, there's no shortage of ways to have fun as you blast your way back to power.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>CHOOSE YOUR PATH</strong></h2><br>Choose from an array of starting classes, from the all-around Archarcanist to elemental classes like the Scorcheror and Toxigician and even the melee-focused Bruisomancer.  Develop further builds from enhancements traded for souls at the Shrine of B'Gokk. Particularly enterprising players may even unlock additional specialty classes with game events or special rewards.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>ALWAYS OUTNUMBERED, NEVER OUTGUNNED</strong></h2><br>Wield an extensive armory of procedurally generated magical weapons, from magic wands to enchanted sledgehammers.  Learn a grimoire's worth of spells, from simple light enchantments and minor curses to arcane tornadoes and globes of invulnerability that set would-be attackers aflame.  Master the power of The Most Annoying Bomb In Existence!  No explosion is too loud, no hex too humiliating for your enemies as you make your way through the worlds of the Inverse Tower toward your return to the throne.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>CHOOSE YOUR (MOSTLY) FRIENDS AND (DEFINITELY) YOUR ENEMIES</strong></h2><br>Interact with a eclectic mix of oddball characters, and navigate the personalities of Councillors whom you recruit for benefits and quests - abuse them too much, though, and you'll have a rebellion on your hands!  Recruited Councillors will provide unique benefits and equipment along with quests that can bring needed resources to the Prime Evil's coffers.  On the other hand\u2026they hate each other as much as they hate you.  Keep them at each other's throats instead of your own, however, and you'll reap the benefit.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>BUILT FOR THE ETERNAL STRUGGLE</strong></h2><br>Rise, fight, die, and rise again: now a member of the undead, the Prime Evil can never be put down for long.  The floors of the Inverse Tower are everchanging, which can only mean new layouts and new benefits as you charge forth.  And with the help of the Shrine of B'Gokk and the dread chicken-goddess's hunger for souls, you'll be able to permanently upgrade your character any time you come back successfully from a run with those unfortunate spirits in pocket.  Eventually, the Prime Evil <i>will</i> return to the great power they have lost -- it's all just a matter of time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>AN AESTHETIC TO DIE FOR (AGAIN, AND AGAIN...)</strong></h2><br>A comedic story and beautiful cartoon aesthetic drives Primest Evil's game experience.  Enjoy a combination of hand-painted art and cel-shaded 3D models, as well as a full original soundtrack!","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3011090?t=1717026839","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3011090?t=1717026839","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3011090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1717026839","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3011090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1717026839","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Captions available","id":13}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3011090/extras/pe_steammaincapsule.png?t=1717026839\" /><br><br><strong>BETRAYAL!</strong>  As the Prime Evil, you were once the greatest force for bad there was in your slice of the universe...until you got a knife in your back for all your efforts.
