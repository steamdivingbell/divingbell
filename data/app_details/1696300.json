The pirate ship has 3 viewing angles, which are the pirate first-person view, the third-person view on the boat, and the aerial flight view. Players can admire the misty sea level and huge pirate ship from the third-person perspective. Switch to the pirate perspective and explore the internal structure of the pirate ship.
