{"about_the_game":"A true Viking like yourself would never settle for mediocrity, thus, you shalt have the finest gear. Whether you like your conquering style classical or fancy, we\u2019ve got you covered. Two amazing high-end player skins are waiting for you, ready to get besmirched with zombie blood. And since we\u2019re already speaking about blood, you\u2019ll be able to butcher your enemies with a brand-new, shiny sword, axe or shield, which, too, come in two versions! Serve the Infected some old-school slaughter or burn them with fire! Whatever\u2019s to your liking. Finally, you didn\u2019t think we\u2019d leave you without your ship, did you? We made some modifications to adapt it to the new environment and now you can raid Harran like a king in this true raider\u2019s ride.
