The more wounded a character, the more bloody and battered they look. First blood splatters appear when their Hit Points go down below 80%. <br>Of course, not all creatures in Pathfinder: Kingmaker can have bloodstains at all. As you would expect, those who don't have blood - elemental and incorporeal creatures, for example - are not affected by this feature. Also, while humanoids and animals bleed red, this isn't so for others: for example, the undead show black stains on their clothes, and plants drip green sap.<br><br>To clean up your wounded companions, you need to restore their Hit Points by either letting your party rest or using healing abilities.<br><br><strong>Players may control the visibility of the new feature with a special setting - &quot;Bloodstains&quot; - which can be found on the &quot;Game&quot; page of the Options menu.
