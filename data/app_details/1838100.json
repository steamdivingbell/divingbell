{"about_the_game":"Your 3D conveyor transportation and machine processing sandbox construction kit.<br><br>Using conveyors, machines and logic modules you will create inter-connected logistics that produce and store all manner of objects from the basic <strong>raw blue ore</strong> through to the fabled <strong>golden cube</strong>. Conveyance rewards progress with faster conveyors, faster machines, and smarter logic modules. The end game though isn't necessarily to strive to unlock all these things (although that is super fun), rather, it is to explore, construct and improve your small table-sized world of creation to look and behave exactly how you think it should.<br><br>Streamlined, compact and efficient...or ridiculously over-engineered...it's up to you!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><br>Your construction toolkit includes 12 machines and 5 logic modules, as well as a uniquely powerful conveyor system to join all of the inputs and outputs together. Conveyance is also fully 3D which means you can go up in the world and create various &quot;levels&quot; of machinery, connections and componentry. All machines, except for the ground-based Miner, can operate as high above your humble creation as need be.<br><br>The casual gameplay of Conveyance is underpinned by a sandbox play style with zero time limits.
