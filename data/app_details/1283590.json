{"about_the_game":"A final project of my college freshman year.

I tried to reach the level of Chinese ink paintings but failed a little bit, but still, I believe this game looks adorable.<br />\r\nWell-made Level Design: I'm not boasting this. Both my professor and my peers praised it. &quot;It is difficult but you still have the motivation to continue playing.&quot; One of my classmates said.<br />\r\n- Yeah, these are the reasons that you should download and try my game. It's free so why not -<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDon't ask me what's the background story because I don't even know. Just created an adorable character and let her jump around.<br />\r\nProbably not adorable enough cuz my drawing skill isn't that good, but I did spend tons of time on art and programming. I believe the game is free of bugs after a couple of playtesting, but just let me know if it has.<br />\r\nBy the way, the majority of this game was solely developed by myself within a month.
