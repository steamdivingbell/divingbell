{"about_the_game":"Casual third person game. Collect mice in Gamelin's main square! If you can dial 300, the gate will open and you can go outside. The game has two endings to choose from: either drown the mice in the river, or let them go for a walk in the forest. In fact, this is a remake of &quot;Snake&quot;, but the game mechanics have been significantly redesigned, there are noticeable differences that giving the game originality. Thanks to the 3D graphics, the game looks completely different. The camera position is easy to adjust at will, gamepad is supported. Character control is very simple and does not require any special skills.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Epic Final","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1786330/a6e9ad0502b46fcec28502b1aed1c62e15c6a5be.jpg"},{"name":"Merciful finale","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1786330/aa44592a40b77e10fe310c3232980321662ff8e2.jpg"},{"name":"Both Final","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1786330/9d4eff0ac04b81eba5ef0d42ffd18e21cca52e18.jpg"}],"total":3},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1786330/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1635599593","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1786330/page.bg.jpg?t=1635599593","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1786330/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1635599593","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1786330/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1635599593","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":1786340,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Casual third person game.
