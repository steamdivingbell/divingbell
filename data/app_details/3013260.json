Using the fantastic mods provided by the community, you can load historic rosters each year of your career!  Start any year you like and play consecutive single seasons all the way from the 1940s to the present day, with extensive year by year stats for every team and individual players, along with career stats!  Track season and career leaders and franchise history, even as teams move!<br><br>As you begin each new season PSF allows you to see which players were added to each team via the draft or free agency, or trades, as well as which players retired.  PSF provides you with an extensive encyclopedia of cumulative stats on each team including head to head records of all teams over all of the seasons you play.<br><br>Animation is still the retro graphic you love, but vastly improved, and you can now select custom scoreboards on the coaching and animation screens!  You can also select any custom color for the network box and sports ticker!  The engine and AI are improved even over before!<br><br>For people new to PSF, it is based on a realistic game engine that was developed for a Master's project and then fine-tuned over many years with great feedback from users.  But it's not just a text game!  You can watch any game played live, can coach against the AI or another player, can simulate entire weeks or even seasons, and the game results aren't affected!<br><br>Because the foundation was in the coaching, the game results ARE greatly affected by plays called - formations, shifts, motion, coverage, everything that a coach can set in a play, including substituting players!  Of course, weather, refs, and injuries can impact you as well!<br><br>BUT PSF doesn't box you in!  You can change rules, tweak injuries and penalties and other realism settings, and choose how YOU want to play the game.  The game is highly customizable, and you can run the whole league as a commissioner, play behind the scenes as a GM for one or more teams, coach from the sidelines, or even watch games in the stands as an observer \u2013 and you can play any or all of these roles at any time.  <br><br>As coach, you can design your own plays and juggle your lineup.  As GM, you can draft the next unstoppable quarterback, sign former stars off the waiver wire, convince a retiring player to stay on another year, and more.  As the Commissioner, you can even modify league rules to reflect changes in football history.<br><br>As a fan, you can watch the highly-developed computer game coach both teams, and a running sports ticker tracks other games.  In the upcoming version, you can now zoom in on the field and customize your scoreboards, including a new broadcast box version.<br><br>You can also create simple pick-up games, which I also call quick games or exhibition games, where you can pair any two teams from any leagues, you can set the game\u2019s weather, change the rules, and even create situations, such as being down by 4 with 2:00 left in the game.<br><br>Whether you coach, watch a game played live, or run quick simulations, the engine treats every game the same, so you get the same results whether you watch it or sim it.<br><br>BUT WAIT, there's more!  The community has created dozens of historical and fantasy leagues, including art sets, schedules, and everything you need to play for thousands of hours!  With the historic careers, you can load real rosters for every season!<br><br>UPDATE: I have implemented the 2024 kickoff rules!","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3013260?t=1726709572","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3013260/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1726709572","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3013260/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726709572","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3013260/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726709572","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This new version of the highly customizable statistics and ratings based Pro Strategy Football game is even more amazing!<br><br>PSF's realistic engine for on-field results, excellent AI that <strong>never </strong> cheats, and fun visuals are just the start!
