{"about_the_game":"LowPolis is a friendly-paced city builder game where you become the ruler of a rising community. Begin with a handful of resources and pave your way to a truly majestic kingdom.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build to bring prosperity to your citizens</h2>It all starts from a small village in a faraway land. You will need water, food, and basic resources. Set a settlement, expand, and make sure that your subjects get what they need to grow. Be careful though! If you make a misstep on the way to greatness, you will be overthrown and forgotten.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Advance and unlock more structures</h2>Farms, decorations, and defensive structures come into play as your domain thrives. Complex goods require work and resources, which come from longer production chains. Use what civilizational advance gives you to achieve even more.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Reshape the cityscape with upgraded buildings</h2>Your population consumes more and new needs arise as the realm grows. Yet improvements come with progress. Choose from a variety of next-tier buildings and meet increasing demand. Discover majestic buildings that change the view of your lands.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Stand strong against fire and disease</h2>City development comes with its challenges.
