{"about_the_game":"Legend of the wizard is an exploration game where you can play as a wizard any way you desire. We can all agree that the powerful, wise and magical are synonyms for being a wizard. But are all wizards born powerful, full of knowledge or magic? No, we believe wizards are all commoners who underwent unimaginable hardship in order to become a true wizard. The path to greatness is the experience we want to bring to you.  <br><br>In this game, you can choose to be an alcoholic who pukes on NPCs or monsters alike; a wondering vagabond gathering information or begging for money; a street thug who blackmails, or even knocking people unconscious with a brick; a chubby lord who uses the money to solve any and all problems. The player can play as any of the 14 unique characters. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1106690/extras/91.png?t=1577268674\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1106690/extras/92.png?t=1577268674\" /><br><br>In the course of the game, the player will face many different choices.
