{"about_the_game":"This is a <u>2D simple puzzle game</u> where the player follows the mouse and you cannot touch any obstacles or you will have to restart the level. You will have obstacles in your way to make the levels more difficult like spinners, chasing blocks, disappearing blocks and more. You will collect coins along the way and try to be as precise as possible to get through small passage ways and openings. Being simple to learn, this game is for everyone. Challenge yourself to speed through each level as fast as possible. Try your best to get through them all! More levels will be added with new obstacles for you to have to create new strategies to get around. This game can be very triggering but when you complete a level it feels good!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Starting Off!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2261680/a8258adb624f104b4bc04aa4b1fdc1ee163546bf.jpg"}],"total":1},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2261680/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1694287283","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2261680/page.bg.jpg?t=1694287283","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2261680/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1694287283","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2261680/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1694287283","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This is a <u>2D simple puzzle game</u> where the player follows the mouse and you cannot touch any obstacles or you will have to restart the level.
