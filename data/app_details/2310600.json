{"about_the_game":"<strong>27.08.2014</strong><br><br>What if I could invent a way to change identities, becoming a different person almost instantly, choosing a new self, as though from a catalogue? Just pop a pill\u2014and new identities emerge in your memories, as though you were looking into the future rather than the past. They would stay on your mind, swapping and switching, until you make a choice. Then you pop one more pill, and the future you like, the future of your choice, becomes your present in a couple of nights. Another thing required would be a program capable of scanning the subconscious and recording everything that happens there. All you would have to do for it to work is lock yourself in a small room to produce a dense aura\u2014required to transfer data from the subconscious to the program. Think about it: it only takes two things, a program to scan the subconscious and a pill to activate the identity changing process. Two things pave the way to my dream.
