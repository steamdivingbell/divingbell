In response, humanity launched a strike on the Strogg homeworld...it failed, but you survived. Outnumbered and outgunned, fight your way through fortified military installations and shut down the enemy's war machine. Only then will the fate of humanity be known.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get Both of the Original Mission Packs </h2><br>Quake II includes both original mission packs: \u201cThe Reckoning,\u201d featuring 18 campaign levels and 7 deathmatch maps, and \u201cGround Zero,\u201d featuring 15 campaign levels and 14 deathmatch maps.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mission Pack: The Reckoning </h2><br>In the first official expansion pack for Quake II, you are part of an elite commando force that must infiltrate a Strogg site.
