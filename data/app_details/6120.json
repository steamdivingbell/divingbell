{"about_the_game":"Shank is the cult-classic revival of the sidescrolling beat-em-up. Play as Shank in an over-the-top grindhouse game, packed to the rim with enemies, bosses, combos, and more by the award-winning team at Klei Entertainment. The 2D sidescroller beat-em-up is finally on Steamplay, now with improved controls and tuning updates based on popular feedback! Shank will have you shooting and slashing your way through hordes of enemies in a stylized slaughter fest. Embark on a brutal path of blood soaked revenge as Shank battles his way through the criminal underground in his quest for retribution. Boasting fast-paced bloody action, silky smooth controls and a signature pulpy grindhouse art style, Shank is a must-play for action fans.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Violent graphic novel art style:</strong><br><br>Beautiful and fluid graphic novel art and animation styled by veteran director Jeff Agala. <br></li><li><strong>Weapon-based combo system:</strong><br><br>String together endless combos of mayhem and destruction on the fly and pummel your opponents to the ground using an exhaustive arsenal of weapons.<br></li><li><strong>Gorgeous, fully animated story cinematics:</strong><br><br>Watch Shanks brutal story unfold through beautiful fully animated cut scenes.<br></li><li><strong>Brutal Boss Battles:</strong><br><br>Over 8 different massive and unique bloody boss battles.<br></li><li><strong>Two-Player Local Co-Op:</strong><br><br>Murder with a friend.
