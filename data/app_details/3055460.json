{"about_the_game":"Welcome to SHADOW PUPPET! A short horror game made by one guy in his free time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What to Expect</h2><br>This is a short, atmospheric horror game where you're forced to wander through your own memories, now completely devoid of life. Something follows you in the shadows, moving only when you do. Light is your only friend here. <br><br>You can interact with parts of the environment physically, such as pulling open doors and picking up objects. Getting out won't be simple, as you'll have to solve a few simple puzzles along the way.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">When you die, things don't always stay the same</h2><br>This game features semi-procedural generation, so expect to come across multiple variations of areas upon restarting! There are no checkpoints, and the game can be completed in under half an hour.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">There are two difficulties, each with their own ending</h2> <br>Once you complete it the first time, feel free to try again in Paranoia Mode, where you'll uncover the truth about your situation and how to break free for good.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3055460/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1720797021","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3055460/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1720797021","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3055460/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1720797021","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3055460/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1720797021","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to SHADOW PUPPET!
