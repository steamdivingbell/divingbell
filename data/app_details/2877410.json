{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A fresh take on card games</strong></h2>Deckbuilding is at the core of Tuggowar. We love that moment when you discover a new combo piece and a range of possibilities pop into your head. The game scratches this creative itch by giving you a randomized card shop to build your deck with each match. Variety keeps things fresh, even after 1000 hours. <br><br>Better yet, you won\u2019t be facing opponents who've just copied a tournament winning deck from the internet. Beat the player, not the meta.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A level playing field where creativity shines</strong></h2>A cornerstone of Tuggowar is that it is not pay-to-win. You have a fair shot at rank #1 no matter the size of your collection. The way this is achieved is by mirroring; when your opponent owns a card, you get an equal chance of playing with it.<br><br>Another is balance - we care a lot about each card being good in the right situation.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A splash of RTS</strong></h2>We love the mind-games and counter dynamics of Real-Time Strategy games. In Tuggowar, you can anticipate and react to your opponent much more than in classic card games. Just like in an RTS, where you are constantly scouting and adapting to the enemy\u2019s gameplan. <br><br>We've also cooked up a cool battle mechanic instead of just getting your opponent from 30 to 0. This tug-of-war map adds interesting strategic options like rushing or defending until you pull off your epic combo.","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2877410/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724671235","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2877410/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724671235","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A fresh take on card games</strong></h2>Deckbuilding is at the core of Tuggowar.
