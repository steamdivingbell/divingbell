The style of the novel is not accidental, it comes from the opportunity to tell the story more simply and easily, as well as to participate in it.

As a result, he decides to make a change, to get out of his house and meet some new people. He gets the chance to attend an unusual speed-dating event, not in the city centre, but at a local landmark on the city outskirts. The location is a beautiful lighthouse located in a rocky area.
