{"about_the_game":"Probee<br>A fast paced, team based arena game, in which the players control cybernetic athletes to measure their skills at Ultimate Frisbee and Parkour. But what is a state-of-the-art robot without their team? Strategically place yourself around the arena to catch your team\u2019s passes. Catching a frisbee scores points according to how many targets have been hit during its flight no matter who threw it. This makes intercepting enemy shots a valid and valuable strategy.<br><br>Concept<br><br>We envisioned Intergalactic Frisbee to be a galaxy wide aired sports event watched by millions. The arenas are modified remnants of an old civilization called \u201cHumans\u201d. This serves an educational purpose of showing these relics to the entire galaxy and allows us to model after modern architecture. The athletes are special purpose built robot models to allow quick maneuvers, wall running around the map, throwing and even magnetically catching the frisbee.<br>Our concept phase was amidst the Covid pandemic, so we quickly settled for an online multiplayer game.<br><br>DISCLAIMER: This is a finished student's project, you <u>wil</u>l encounter bugs - which will probably not be fixed.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1881250/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1658507351","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1881250/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1658507351","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1881250/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1658507351","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1881250/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1658507351","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Probee<br>A fast paced, team based arena game, in which the players control cybernetic athletes to measure their skills at Ultimate Frisbee and Parkour.
