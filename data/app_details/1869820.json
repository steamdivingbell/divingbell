{"about_the_game":"This expansion brings three playable civilizations of India to Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition for the first time, with three fully voiced campaigns and new achievements. The Indian civilizations provide a broad range of added content, including nine new units, 15 exciting new single player missions, new buildings and new achievements.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">3 new playable civilizations </h2><br><strong>Bengalis </strong>\u2014 Navigate the winding rivers and dense jungles of Bengal as you build a thriving economy to fuel unstoppable armies of elephants. The Bengali unique unit is the Ratha, a sturdy chariot that can switch between melee and ranged attack modes. <br><br><strong>Dravidians </strong>\u2014 Seize control of the lucrative Indian Ocean trade routes and utilize advanced metallurgy as you build one of the wealthiest sea empires of medieval Asia. The Dravidian unique units are the Urumi Swordsman, a warrior wielding a scathing flexible sword, and the Thirisadai, a massive vessel that dominates the high seas. <br><br><strong>Gurjaras </strong>\u2014 Ride swift mounts across the fertile fields and open plains of western India and unleash diverse armies of sturdy warriors upon your enemies. The Gurjara unique units are the Shrivamsha Rider, a speedy cavalry unit that can dodge enemy attacks, and the Chakram Thrower, an infantry unit that unleashes volleys of deadly metal discs.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">3 Brand-new Full Campaigns </h2><br><strong>Babur </strong>\u2014 Nearly a century after Tamerlane\u2019s death, his descendants are still fighting for supremacy in Transoxiana and Persia. The youngest among them is Zahir ud-Din Muhammad \u2013 also known as Babur, \u2018the tiger\u2019. He dreams of restoring the crumbled empire, but another wave of invading horsemen from the northern steppes is about to change everything. In this campaign, you will play as the Tatars and Hindustanis. <br><br><strong>Rajendra </strong>\u2014 The dread of inevitable corruption plagues the ambitious Rajendra Chola as he navigates the harsh political climate of south India. Can Rajendra escape moral decay as he expands the empire that he inherited from his father, or is his fear of corruption the true enemy within? In this campaign, you will play as the Dravidians. <br><br><strong>Devapala </strong>\u2014 Guided by the teachings of Mahayana Buddhism, Devapala rules a rich and vibrant empire. However, as dangerous rivals threaten his realm, the ambitious emperor finds it increasingly difficult to balance his policies with his morals. Will the ends ultimately justify the means, or will Devapala\u2019s quest for his own enlightenment and that of his subjects fail? In this campaign, you will play as the Bengalis.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1869820/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1682554199","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1869820/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1682554199","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1869820/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1682554199","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1869820/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1682554199","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This expansion brings three playable civilizations of India to Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition for the first time, with three fully voiced campaigns and new achievements.
