Each mission summons a different time period in Ancient Mesopotamian history, providing comprehensive historical experience. Players must carry out tasks important to the specific time and place of each mission, including the construction of historical monuments.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1157220/extras/banner2.png?t=1671731335\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Monuments</h2>During the campaign players will not only build complex ancient monuments, but design them too. Nebuchadnezzar features an in-game <strong>monument editor</strong> giving players complete control over their buildings. From structural design to color scheme to final details: it\u2019s in the hands of the player. Will you recreate history or make history?

Expand your experience with the full support of mods from new buildings, new goods, production chains, and even new maps, missions, and campaigns. It is almost entirely moddable. Localizing mods will also not be a problem. You can create mods in multiple languages and/or add languages to existing ones. This applies to the base game as well.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Settler","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1157220/8aaa77f79f3df6265752d153f6d3b13116586168.jpg"},{"name":"Shepherd","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1157220/308366707e5d35ac6087c0fcf37eed9570f805e4.jpg"},{"name":"Digger","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1157220/3133620f1af887b619b42fd61d4f741a88337c81.jpg"},{"name":"Builder","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1157220/3ecd937bb1946d33e6cabd9384ac836e39d33776.jpg"},{"name":"Trader","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1157220/444a7d42fcb084aace6b193e97421ac0ca642388.jpg"},{"name":"Scribe","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1157220/729413c77f715d80239028d3092f4ba2aa748129.jpg"},{"name":"Sargon of Akkad","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1157220/55dc302d84798c0768b79a3cfc0d492a4ef9ff63.jpg"},{"name":"Ur-Nammu","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1157220/20a22d1ab6df26d161e9bfe117dc255491811fe4.jpg"},{"name":"Hammurabi","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1157220/7ec31f56308f13aed78bb4d84dd422602e7c5cca.jpg"},{"name":"Kurigalzu","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1157220/bf6a93655fd5b8dd7f082037cd931fa99e643538.jpg"}],"total":48},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1157220?t=1671731335","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1157220?t=1671731335","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1157220/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1671731335","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1157220/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1671731335","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Nebuchadnezzar is a classic isometric city builder game inviting players to experience the mysterious history and culture of ancient Mesopotamia.
