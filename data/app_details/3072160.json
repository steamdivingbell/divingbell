{"about_the_game":"Rebel Fury is a solo or two-person turn-based strategy wargame based on the Rebel Fury boardgame created by the legendary game designer Mark Herman.  The game includes six historical battles: Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Chickamauga, Chattanooga, the Battle of the Wilderness and Spotsylvania. <br><br>Players can battle human opponents online or play against the game's AI.  There is a special solitaire-only scenario with a simplified AI for learning the game.<br><br>Rebel Fury features gameplay based on the historical wargaming boardgames of the 70's and 80's. Players maneuver markers that represent their units on a hexagonal map that mimics the gameboard and cardboard counters of traditional boardgames. Turns are completed in an &quot;I go, you go&quot; style, wherein players alternate their turns with their opponent until one player passes. Once that happens, a random number of unopposed actions are given to their opponent. Pass too early and you risk giving your opponent the opportunity to maneuver completely around your forces. Combat is resolved through die rolls modified by terrain, battle line factors, and the use of artillery support. Attackers benefit from supporting units. Defenders benefit from being in defensible terrain.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3072160/extras/Miniscreenshot.png?t=1740068337\" /><br><br>Rebel Fury expands upon the low-complexity Gettysburg system featured in C3i Magazine #32. <br><br>Each side has an historically accurate order of battle that encourages the player to attempt to outdo the generals of history.  Each battle has a unique set of victory conditions that mirror the strategic goals of history.<br><br>This design features a new system of Civil War combat akin to the old SPI Blue and Gray Quads. Each game in Rebel Fury is quick-set-up, quick-playing, and deeply interactive. The density of counters in each scenario is low, allowing you to see and experience the big picture of the battle.<br> <br>Rebel Fury places you, the player, in the role of the Army Commander (Lee, Burnside, Hooker, Bragg, Rosecrans, Grant). You maneuver your army to find the enemy\u2019s flanks, concentrate your forces for an attack, and determine where to commit your artillery assets.<br> <br>Units are portrayed at the Infantry/Cavalry division level. The Civil War Heritage series game system features a new Zone of Influence/Zone of Control mechanic that controls unit formation (March/Battle) based on their proximity to your opponent. As your units close with the enemy, your forces naturally break into battle formation, where they then maneuver the last distance to engage. Unlike most hex and counter wargames, this system allows you total freedom to move units in any order multiple times, unleashing the full range of historical tactics in a simple and clean format.<br><br>Combat features a differential combat system with few but significant factors that capture the key features of Civil War division level combat. Units are rated for quality, artillery support, supporting units, and terrain. The game features artillery duels with the occasional Exploding Caisson result. The Civil War Heritage series combat system accurately depicts the ability of units to launch multiple waves of attacks on the same position, capturing the back-and-forth nature of many famous combat duels.<br> <br>Each battle features special units and situations, such as Wilder\u2019s Brigade of mounted infantry (Chickamauga) plus other famous units and personages.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3072160?t=1740068337","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3072160/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1740068337","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3072160/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1740068337","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3072160/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1740068337","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Rebel Fury is a solo or two-person turn-based strategy wargame based on the Rebel Fury boardgame created by the legendary game designer Mark Herman.
