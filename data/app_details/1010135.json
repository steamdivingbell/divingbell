{"about_the_game":"New and challenging railroading awaits you on the bustling Train Sim World: Northeast Corridor New York route with this DLC that includes Amtrak\u2019s unique SW1000R diesel switcher and distinctive ex-Metroliner Cab Control Car.<br><br>Amtrak employs yard switcher locomotives at its major terminal locations, such as New York\u2019s Sunnyside Yard, Washington, D. C., Chicago, and Los Angeles. Among Amtrak\u2019s roster of diesel switchers is the venerable and unique \u201cSW1000R.\u201d Originally constructed by Electro-Motive in the 1950s as SW9 and SW1200 switchers, ten members of what became Amtrak\u2019s SW1000R roster were acquired second-hand by Amtrak and rebuilt by locomotive remanufacturer NRE. <br><br>The SW1000R, which retained its classic EMD end-cab design after rebuild, is a 1,000-horsepower, four axle (B-B) diesel that is nimble and ideally suited for yard and shop switching duty -- and now you have the chance to put the veteran diesel to work around New York\u2019s famed Sunnyside yard complex!<br><br>Originally developed in the 1960s by the Pennsylvania Railroad and U. S. Department of Transportation and built by the Budd Company, the electric-multiple-unit Metroliners were one of America\u2019s first ventures into high-speed rail and were also a design predecessor of Amtrak\u2019s Amfleet passenger equipment. <br><br>Operating over the Northeast Corridor, the Metroliners served for two decades, with Amtrak assuming their operations in 1971. But even with retirement as \u201cEMUs,\u201d the Metroliners found new life, as Amtrak converted 29 of the ex-Metroliner cars into cab control cars. <br><br>The cab control cars have served Amtrak from coast-to-coast but see a majority of their use on the Northeast Corridor south of New York City and are noted for their regular assignment to Amtrak\u2019s New York \u2013 Philadelphia \u2013 Harrisburg \u201cKeystone\u201d services, making them an ideal addition to TSW\u2019s Northeast Corridor New York route!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Amtrak EMD/NRE SW1000R diesel switcher<br></li><li>Amtrak ex-Metroliner Cab Control Car<br></li><li>Accurate, true-to-life performance and handling<br></li><li>Highly detailed, feature-rich, driving cabs with accurate true-to-life performance and handling<br></li><li>Authentic and detailed sound recordings, recorded from the real locomotives<br></li><li>Includes three engaging scenarios and interactive tutorials for Northeast Corridor New York<br></li><li>Operable in Service Mode in Northeast Corridor New York<br></li><li>Powered by Dovetail Games\u2019 proprietary SimuGraph\u00ae vehicle dynamics engine and Unreal Engine 4\u00ae technology<br></li><li>Download size: 153.5mb</li></ul>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1010135?t=1728569348","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1010135?t=1728569348","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1010135/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728569348","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1010135/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728569348","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"New and challenging railroading awaits you on the bustling Train Sim World: Northeast Corridor New York route with this DLC that includes Amtrak\u2019s unique SW1000R diesel switcher and distinctive ex-Metroliner Cab Control Car.<br><br>Amtrak employs yard switcher locomotives at its major terminal locations, such as New York\u2019s Sunnyside Yard, Washington, D.
