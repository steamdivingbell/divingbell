{"about_the_game":"Midnight Havoc is a 2D, top-down pixel art game with a simple premise...KILL!!! Play as a mild mannered recluse who has been cursed with the mark of the beast, as the moon rises so does the beast within. Hunt your prey, consume their heart, and grow stronger. Will you be a terrifying predator that lurks in the shadows catching your prey unaware or a bloodthirsty monster tearing apart all that get in your way? The choice is yours, but I must warn you, the attention of humans is not something to ignore. Gain too much attention and you may be faced with greater foes and equally greater firepower. Throw off the trail and reduce suspicion by returning in the day to tamper with the evidence or avoid ever raising suspicion to begin with by planning out and locating vulnerable prey before the hunt begins.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2456290/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1723086739","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2456290/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1723086739","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2456290/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1723086739","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2456290/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1723086739","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"The mature content includes depictions of blood and gore that will primarily be during the night phase when the character is attacking NPCs as well as the hiding and disposal of victims during the day phase.
