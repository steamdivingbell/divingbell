{"about_the_game":"The Oito Line is a 105.4 km long line connecting Matsumoto Station in Nagano Prefecture to Itoigawa Station in Niigata Prefecture. The 70.1 km route between Matsumoto Station and Minami-Kotani Station, which is under the jurisdiction of JR East, is well-known as a stop for customers visiting the mountain climbing and snow resort areas represented by Shinano-Omachi and Hakuba. The &quot;Super Azusa&quot; limited express train runs directly from Shinjuku Station, and the line is also used as a commuter and school route in the Matsumoto area.
