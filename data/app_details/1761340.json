{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Goal</h2>Deploy from your own camp to the stranded island in the middle of nowhere. Explore the island to find clues about its origin, collect as many resources as possible, and then find a way off the island.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Place</h2>You will act on a large island, offering a wide variety of ways to explore it. Each location on the island has its own unique atmosphere and fauna. Cities have plenty of bounties but are more dangerous. The forest area may seem like a safer place, but you never know who you will encounter in godforsaken places. But you always can go down into the catacombs if you have nerves of steel.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Natives</h2>You will encounter a variety of creatures on the island. Create your own strategy for exploring the island. You can choose to be quiet and stealthy or loud and provocative, it's up to you. But remember, all your actions have consequences.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Face other players</h2>You can cooperate with your friends or strangers to make the most of your expedition. Alternatively, you can explore the island alone and enjoy the benefits of a solitary adventure.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1761340/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729926217","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1761340/page.bg.jpg?t=1729926217","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1761340/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729926217","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1761340/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729926217","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"The game has a realistic atmosphere.
