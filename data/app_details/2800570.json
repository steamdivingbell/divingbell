Every game is a completely new adventure with 15 factions, human opponents, and hundreds of heroes, items, traits, and spells!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Asynchronous Multiplayer</h2><br>In Deus Proxy you play through hand-crafted PvE and one-of-a-kind PvP encounters. Any army that wins a PvP encounter becomes an adversary in other player\u2019s games. You see the enemy armies before picking your cards and designing your own army, which rewards drafting a diverse deck to counter the challenges you might face instead of playing the most &quot;meta&quot; cards.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Comprehensive In-Game Information</h2><br>Tired of &quot;wiki games&quot; that require you to constantly alt-tab to see what a powerup does? Every spell, item, hero, unit, trait, buff, faction and game mechanic is explained in a searchable in-game compendium. When designing your army, an overlay tool is present to quickly view any stat of every unit on the field. Within seconds you can discover ways to counter your opponent.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Endless Theorycrafting</h2><br>Every game of Deus Proxy is a possibility to try new strategies and find new synergies! There are no implicit faction bonuses, all bonuses come from items and spells related to that faction. Your plant-based army might focus on empowering ranged units to entangle far-away targets, giving army-wide regeneration bonuses to make your treants walking tanks, or just being immune to the acid rain your mage caused. Because you have 1-3 battles per turn, it is vital to keep your armies adaptable for each new challenge!<br><br>Heroes can equip any item that you obtain, and can cast any spell they have the slightest proficiency to cast. A huge variety of builds are possible, and the traits and stats a hero has are only a suggestion of what they're capable of when properly equipped.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2800570/extras/hero_selection.gif?t=1736712722\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2800570/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736712722","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2800570/page.bg.jpg?t=1736712722","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2800570/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736712722","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2800570/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736712722","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Deus Proxy contains war and some general depictions of violence, but the animations are simple and free of gore and blood.
