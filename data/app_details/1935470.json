{"about_the_game":"<strong>The Tales of Bayun</strong> is a narrative adventure game with RPG elements in a grim Eastern European and Slavic fantasy setting. A unique world based on fairy tales and legends. Fascinating stories with unexpected plot twists. Authentic characters with their own secrets and motivation. Tough moral choices with unpredictable consequences. Will you overcome all the twists of fate or go unsung with a knife in your back?

Earnestness and kindness rub shoulders with betrayal and devilry. Someone has a stroke of luck and in the shake of a hand turns into a noble person. Another one got kicked in the teeth and thrown to the wolves. Sorrow and happiness, wealth and poverty, good and evil \u2014 everything is bound so tightly, that those bonds can\u2019t be broken.
