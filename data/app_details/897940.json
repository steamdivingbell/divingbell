All cats love tuna. Don\u2019t let the can of tuna disappear into its mysterious portal and then leave the high cats famished.<br><br>Getting high will give your cat boost, so there is no time to blink when your cat has the catnip, eat quickly by completing a random generated sequence of buttons to get high and pass the catnip to the next player, if you are too slow the other cats will start getting snappy.
