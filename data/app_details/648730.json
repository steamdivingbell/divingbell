{"about_the_game":"Embellish your landscape with the River expansion!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe River expansion lets you embellish your landscape while changing up the starting location. The River is made up of 11 tiles, which replace the starting tile. Take turns placing the River tiles while also deploying meeples. Once you\u2019ve used up the River tiles, continue playing as usual with the other tiles. You must follow the illustration, as always. This expansion lets you more evenly distribute the landscape you\u2019ll create over the course of the game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/648730/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1694002573","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/648730/page.bg.jpg?t=1694002573","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/648730/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1694002573","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/648730/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1694002573","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Turn Notifications","id":32},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Embellish your landscape with the River expansion!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe River expansion lets you embellish your landscape while changing up the starting location.
