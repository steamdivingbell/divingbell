{"about_the_game":"Everett Isle is an exploration-based puzzle game. You wake up on a mysterious isle, without any memory of how you ended up there. To make your way off the island you'll have to traverse it's diverse set of areas, from abandoned caves, to broiling volcanoes, finding artifacts and puzzling your way through Everett Isle's many challenges.<br />\r\nEverett Isle is comprised of Five Main areas the player must progress through to find their way off the isle. You'll need to solve environmental puzzles using your wit and logic to reactivate the isle's abandoned mechanisms, and find more than the original explorers could have. It's a short and sweet adventure lasting around 1.5 hours, as well as hiding a secret ending for people explorative enough to find it.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Like Clockwork","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2097670/4b566d1c96d313510aed982d06bb63b042889b6d.jpg"},{"name":"A Shocking Discovery","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2097670/d0e7cf0e408353006cc99c2f56769b8494793fc4.jpg"},{"name":"A Relic from the Past","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2097670/f3962cd0048830b64033358a431659a1227a306f.jpg"},{"name":"A Diamond in the Rough","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2097670/23e98aaa77e7bc5e657bf3fc9a9161186cf57270.jpg"},{"name":"The Key to Home","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2097670/43932d228b5ce17c10223ebef85f9e1dd6636b8a.jpg"},{"name":"What does this go to?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2097670/c58225f69205184f4b3bee3919f680ff0d44b71d.jpg"},{"name":"I wonder what this is used for...","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2097670/143b6c1a09ea0ab60fe1df1a6f4bc315ef2271ce.jpg"},{"name":"Castaway no More!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2097670/0bd1c7d9ab4be4a5d04e23232f15eda79d9bb781.jpg"},{"name":"See Ya Sucker!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2097670/373c864039b617c4c52f39dd40b329bc7a74bf11.jpg"}],"total":9},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2097670/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1662172964","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2097670/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1662172964","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2097670/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1662172964","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2097670/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1662172964","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Everett Isle is an exploration-based puzzle game.
