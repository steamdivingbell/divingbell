{"about_the_game":"&quot;We need to talk...&quot;<br><br>Those words shattered everything, ruined <i>everything.</i> Alone with your darkest thoughts, you find yourself in a waking nightmare. The world is broken, fragmented, and your memories inescapable horrors. Sinister whispers bombard you, the world nearly impossible to navigate, and creatures move in the shadows. As a voice you thought long buried goads you, a simple light shines. A glimmer. Hope.<br><br>In Passing is a first-person 3D platformer set within the confines of a broken mind. Undertake a harrowing journey of recovery, tackling the relentless throws of toxic thought as you make your way back through fragmented memories. Jump, dash, and race through a mind intent on destroying you, pushing against the insidiousness of depression. Duck out of the way of turrets, vault over chasms, run along walls, and re-assemble the shattered pillar of self at the center of the maelstrom of melancholy swirling around you. <br><br>Featuring striking visuals, a gripping tale of a broken mind, challenging platforming, and a beautiful soundtrack from Lucas King, In Passing challenges players mechanically and mentally. <br><br>With care and poise, even the most broken mind can be healed.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Leap to the Grave","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1172090/130193df0b1077badddfba0f5415c0cfd6bd40ed.jpg"},{"name":"Monkey See","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1172090/886224a98534e30f98a36f643e6744e014342775.jpg"},{"name":"Desk Jockey ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1172090/254bf0e88cda9e0bef2d823b4600e715b1a0057d.jpg"},{"name":"Look at this Photograph","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1172090/25ce31a62333fcc99370ac9878656f5b627f4fb5.jpg"},{"name":"Snack Pals","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1172090/25c1483319060f32a8c6b1266710c9d94696494a.jpg"},{"name":"Gotta Go Fast!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1172090/533bae4d5adb010d4d02a324fc8343b90d1956e6.jpg"},{"name":"It's Outta Here!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1172090/cd630d5acf5aa85461386620fa8fc2c9d627e2e6.jpg"}],"total":7},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1172090?t=1571911795","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172090/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1571911795","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1571911795","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1571911795","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;We need to talk...&quot;<br><br>Those words shattered everything, ruined <i>everything.</i> Alone with your darkest thoughts, you find yourself in a waking nightmare.
