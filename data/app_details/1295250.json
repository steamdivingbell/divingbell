{"about_the_game":"Command Z Presents Future Fragments a virtual reality installation created by Michael Ziga with soundscapes by Silvio Buchmeier. Connor Hanwick, and Palmer Foote. The virtual gallery places participants in three successive museum spaces, filled with sculptures reimagining classical figuration, gothic aesthetic, and modernist forms. The viewer is encouraged to interact with the relics by throwing them across the spaces towards destruction, contrary to traditional museum experience. The works are designed using 3D scans anonymously taken from The Metropolitan, Louvre, Uffizi, and Acropolis museums. The scans were digitally manipulated to create new sculptures from old, building the future from fragments of the past.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1295250/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1590000630","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1295250/page.bg.jpg?t=1590000630","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1295250/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1590000630","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1295250/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1590000630","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Command Z Presents Future Fragments a virtual reality installation created by Michael Ziga with soundscapes by Silvio Buchmeier.
