However, AI War 2 has presented some truly unique technical challenges, mainly involving running insane amounts of AI and simulations in a massively parallel fashion.  We've been able to harness the power of modern multi-core processors to a degree that most game simulations cannot, and our challenge from 2020 onward has been to bring that into the multiplayer realm.
