In the VR / game technology, the main attempt to solve the following questions:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>1. Create a VR game without vertigo. VR experience process, for most people, is more easily dizzy, the average time to feel dizzy about 15 minutes. The game is committed to solving this dizzy problem, playing CUBE-C process, excluding the personal physical reasons,(such as discomfort or vision problems) you will not feel dizzy;<br></li><li>2. Good interactive VR world. The game tries to give player the full sense of control in the VR world(The price to pay for this is that the game's model is crude, but it does not affect your senses.), including: free walking and games;<br></li><li>3. Good VR interface. While trying to ensure the interactiveness of the game, CUBE-C tries to make a viable game interface for a scalable, actionable and interactive game.<br></li><li>4. Relatively Open World. For the time being there is no one designed open world game specifically for VR. CUBE-C provides a relatively open world: you can walk anywhere in the map and interact with objects in the environment without feeling dizzy;<br></li><li>5. New groundbreaking physical world. The environment is full of physical objects and has been interacting in real time (environmental objects or players). Physical computing has become more common as computer technology advances, but the use of such large-scale physical collisions is unprecedented. This requires a lot of optimization while exploring the VR game production, and the gameplay. The game is trying to maintain a large number of physical objects while ensuring the playability.<br></li><li>6. Some of the above are still being improved, and now as the PC's screenshot is really nothing interesting to see, you have to personally experience! So now there is no way to make a good promotional video.I hope you are willing to try CUBE-C! Thank you!</li></ul></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>This is a Brand New, Fun, Casual VR Game!
