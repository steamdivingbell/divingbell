{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Put together an obstacle course with wrecking balls, electrifying towers, mines, and all manner of contraptions and watch the poor contestants try their hardest to stumble their way to the finish.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is a single player game where you design an obstacle course. First you lay out the path that the contestants need to traverse and then add on obstacles. These include punch walls, wrecking balls, mines, and over a dozen others. Based on how far the contestants make it and how spectacular their wipe out, you earn varying amount of points. Earn enough points to unlock more options when constructing your course and move on to new levels with different constraints. The gameplay is closest to &quot;battle simulator&quot; type games where you setup the stage and watch the chaos unfold, except the contestants battle against your devious designs rather than each other.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game uses cutting edge tech to simulate human like behavior for the contestant NPCs. The characters are fully physically simulated and have been taught (via reinforcement learning) how to flex their muscles to move.\u00a0\u00a0</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3474820/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738610414","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3474820/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1738610414","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3474820/18f1b97f3270083c63ccb4aafffaad6a3a6c8925/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738610414","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3474820/18f1b97f3270083c63ccb4aafffaad6a3a6c8925/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738610414","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Put together an obstacle course with wrecking balls, electrifying towers, mines, and all manner of contraptions and watch the poor contestants try their hardest to stumble their way to the finish.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is a single player game where you design an obstacle course.
