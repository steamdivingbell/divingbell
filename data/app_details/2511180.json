{"about_the_game":"Ever imagined a world where mechanical skill and actually playing the game was what mattered? Yeah, we have too. We grew up playing pixel shooters for most of our childhood, and we've had to watch the genre shift in a way that isn't healthy for the community. So we decided to take the genre in a better direction. We made Pixel Royale 3D to gather the community to a place where they can have fun with the genre again, and most importantly where their voices can be heard again. One of our main goals is to build the game around the community, after all, without a community, there wouldn't be a game!<br><br><strong>Pixel Royale 3D</strong> is a pixelated FPS with a high focus on <u>aim and strategy</u>. With <strong>6</strong> categories to use in-game, there are virtually endless combinations to fit any play-style.
