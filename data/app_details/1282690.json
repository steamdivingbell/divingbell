{"about_the_game":"The fate of the world is in your hands. New and old enemies threaten the peace you worked so hard to achieve 24 years ago. Your search for the Alpha Ceph continues, but this time you'll also need to expose the truth behind the C.E.L.L. corporation. It won't be easy, but your Nanosuit helps you clear a path to victory. Craft a stealthy attack to defeat your opponents quietly, or decimate the enemy with a blaze of brute force. There's no wrong way to save the world.<br><br><strong>Game Features:</strong><br><br><strong>Master the Seven Wonders.</strong> The evil C.E.L.L. corporation turned New York City into a sprawling urban rainforest housed in a giant nanodome.

You'll have an arsenal stocked with Earth's finest military tools, like the Predator Bow. Use it to unleash a Super-thermite arrow and counter heavy artillery fire. Facing a group of opponents walking through water? Fire just one Electro arrow and defeat them all at once. .<br><br><strong>Assess, adapt, attack.</strong> Choose your path and approach.
