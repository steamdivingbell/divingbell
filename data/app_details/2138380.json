Beautiful, profoundly engaging and eventually resonantly simple, this work pushes the parameters of our understanding of the potential for the impact of gaming to provide a life-saving web of connection, support and joy for those who may be otherwise isolated and challenged by society. We emerge from its immersion into a reality with a kinder light and a brighter horizon.\u201d<br>Tilda Swinton<br><br>\u201cBy turns gripping, sad, and poignant, it\u2019s one of the great moving image attempts to understand mental illness from the inside out.\u201d<br>IndieWire<br><br>\u201cAt a time when virtual reality fuels the fantasy of a metaverse that allows us to free ourselves from certain limitations of the physical world, Goliath uses this technology for the opposite purpose: to make us experience the struggle and suffering of many men and women in the grip of great psychological difficulties, very real and too often forgotten.
