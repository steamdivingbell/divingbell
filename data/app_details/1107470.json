He's not very strong. He doesn't have magic powers or a sword that vanquishes darkness. He can fly! ... But only for a few seconds at a time. He's a pale and squishy little guy who isn't even <i>that</i> good at the one thing that makes him special. Yet, in spite of all of this, he's about to go on an incredible adventure, see and do some amazing things, and overcome his weaknesses through clever-thinking, compassion, and a stick-to-it attitude like no other!<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1107470/extras/Game_Features.png?t=1585513902\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Thoughtful, resource-management-based platforming<br></li><li> You can fly!<br></li><li> A totally-interconnected, hand-crafted 2D world<br></li><li> You CAN'T attack directly (that's rude)<br></li><li> Figure out clever ways to deal with conflict<br></li><li> Use items found in the environment to solve problems<br></li><li> A bundle of optional side-content!<br></li><li> You can ride an octopus<br></li><li> Hats!
