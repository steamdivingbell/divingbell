Engineers replaced all the materials with modern ones, supplied iridium energy lines, and scientists developed a device called an \u201caxion core\u201d. The principle of its operation was not disclosed to the public, but one press release stated that this energy core could break the barrier between ordinary and dark matter, and was also capable of creating a vacuum break between axions.

The pirates were able to penetrate the destroyer\u2019s shields, and one of their shots hit the wormhole generator.
