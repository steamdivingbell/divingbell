{"about_the_game":"XENOMARINE is a dark, atmospheric, sci-fi/horror themed roguelike in which you play a space marine exploring an alien-infested space station. Starting out with little more than a crowbar, you will fight to survive against over 120 increasingly powerful alien species, as you progress as far as you can through infinite randomly generated levels. <br><br>With no starting classes, develop your character into the ultimate fighting machine by means of in-game choices: create a unique build each time you play by finding and choosing between a large and distinctive range of unique usable items and individually upgradable weapons and armor. And although the focus in Xenomarine is on items rather than skills, there are also 70 skill levels to be learned you gain experience from combat and from randomly generated missions.<br><br>NEW in Ascension Edition: Search for the truth behind the alien infestation and gain control over extraordinary multidimensional technology with an all-new storyline and game mechanic that gives the option to 'win' the game.<br><br>WARNING: This game is hard: expect to die soon and often when first starting out! Also, in the default 'roguelike' game mode, death is permanent - meaning you will have to start again from level 1. But don\u2019t worry: each playthrough will be different because so many parts of the game are randomly generated (in a way that\u2019s carefully fine-tuned for balance).
