But you can already see good approaches. Multiplayer capable so you can play with your friends. Just switch off for a few hours, do some sounding, building etc.Constant updating of the game, the developers listen to the users. And try to adapt it to your wishes Cool game\u201d<br>100 \u2013 Instant-Gaming<br><br>\u201cYeah its an Early Access Game. The Game is not finished at all. But the setting in general is very interesting. The mechanics are good and the game gets constant updates.\u201d<br>80 \u2013 Instant-Gaming<br><br>\u201cI like the game Reminiscent of Rust and The Forest Especially the Forest, which didn't have much in the beginning and became really good in the end.
