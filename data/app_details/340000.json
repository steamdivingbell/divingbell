{"about_the_game":"You are the last known human in the universe, and all that's left of you is a disembodied head. Seeking clues to your fractured past, you must travel through a hostile world of machines using a special helmet that allows you to dock into and take control of any robotic host body. As you launch from one body to the next, you'll start to discover that things are not quite what they appear to be, and the fate of humanity has yet to be decided...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFresh from Double Fine Productions, Headlander is a retro-futuristic, side-scrolling, action-adventure game set in a world inspired by 70\u2019s science fiction. It is a world of automation, a utopia gone wrong in which all of humanity have transferred their minds into robotic imposter bodies and are ruled by a deranged computer. Brought to you by Double Fine Productions (Psychonauts, Broken Age) and Adult Swim Games (Duck Game, Jazzpunk), Headlander is guaranteed to be the ultimate head trip.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"The Dawn of Man's Head","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/340000/63112f5eae4ab3d929fc0a356fa7dc5cdf716669.jpg"},{"name":"Probe the Pleasure Port","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/340000/7d5d68e794657eb474ffd5e265d6f1d18b77f055.jpg"},{"name":"Messages From Space","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/340000/13626bd44d5d18bb0b6d9db72ac2629812d3d95c.jpg"},{"name":"Brown Out","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/340000/fe71cca63cb89493f18f5c8c625205df7a944a64.jpg"},{"name":"God Created the Dater","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/340000/e887aa1a1790329c04cd7fc9953deb4d01ff549d.jpg"},{"name":"Dynamite with a Laser Beam","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/340000/51214e4bc4e92f8ce4eedaa7972f6e7eebe9b229.jpg"},{"name":"Le Voyage dans la Lune Citadel","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/340000/3918a0f2547bebe605f5df5ae75c1b7fb1beffd2.jpg"},{"name":"Star Crash","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/340000/1a0fc25a957a629eb48ea5bd5272677990af7de1.jpg"},{"name":"Winters is Coming","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/340000/dde78a5efe20feea8d3fee92be869808e66b39fe.jpg"},{"name":"Colossus: The Methuselah Project","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/340000/f5c1446c18018d31b6d19dadfaa492aef86522d3.jpg"}],"total":31},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/340000/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727390283","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/340000/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1727390283","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/340000/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727390283","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/340000/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727390283","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"You are the last known human in the universe, and all that's left of you is a disembodied head.
