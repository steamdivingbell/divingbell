This game wants you to crave exploration, and to craft your way to success.<br><br><br><strong>Features</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Core Abilities</h2>From the beginning of the game, players are able to perform a few core abilities: hover, dodge, and shield/deflect. We have created several more core abilities, but these will be unlocked throughout the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Spells</h2>Players can craft and cast dozens of unique spells with Gems. Soon we will be adding the &quot;Mod&quot; socket, which allows players to attach special effects to their spells! Over time, we will improve the visuals (such as element color and texture), crafting cost, and power of all spells.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Elemental Barriers</h2>Players will encounter Elemental Barriers that require specific spells to break. In a typical metroidvania, players are required to unlock abilities that enable them to progress. In addition to <i>ability-driven progression</i>, we hope to push that standard by instilling a <i>crafting-driven progression</i> design.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Critters</h2>Little monsters run amuck in this world! You must craft spells powerful enough to defeat them. These critters drop Gems, Dust, and XP. Over time, each critter will be tailored to have their own unique stats, loot drops, and behaviors. Currently their combat stats are slightly imbalanced, and their AI is kinda dumb, but we will be improving this with more player feedback.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Boss</h2>Heart Lock has one unique boss fight. A dark, mysterious manifestation haunts you. Upon defeating this boss, new gameplay modes will be unlocked.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Pillow Fort</h2>Relaxing as a park bench, and comforting as a campfire. The Pillow Fort gives players the means to become stronger, and customize their stats to be more effective in combat. In addition, the Pillow Fort allows players to listen to music, or even <i>build your own pillow fort!</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Loot</h2>All around the world, players will loot various items to help them on their journey. Loot currently includes Gems, Dust, XP, and Charms. Players can equip Charms to increase their stats or movement speed.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">World Traversal</h2>As players explore, they will encounter plants that grow beneath their feet. As the game intentionally has no map, Tracking Flora was added to help players keep track of places they've already explored. It's quite pleasing to watch the world come to life around you!<br><br><br><u>What this game offers</u><br><br><strong>An experience derived from Dark Souls and Super Metroid</strong><br>Though Heart Lock draws inspiration from their mechanics, Heart Lock provides a lighthearted &amp; whimsical atmosphere. We hope to offer joy in using Heart Lock's character abilities and tools.<br><br><strong>Alternative gameplay intensities</strong><br>Heart Lock is designed to be a relaxing experience, however players can unlock alternate gameplay modes to face new challenges.<br><br><strong>An engaging spell crafting system</strong><br>This is the core mechanic of Heart Lock that sets it apart from other similar games. This mechanic is so important that we have intentionally left out physical weapons. Your spells are your weapon, and you should have plenty of them to experiment with throughout your journey.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1717050/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1666987182","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1717050/page.bg.jpg?t=1666987182","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1717050/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1666987182","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1717050/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1666987182","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BIG UPDATE!!!</h2><br>Heart Lock has been abandoned in favor of our new project, Angel Droid.
