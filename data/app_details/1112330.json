But what price will he pay for it?<br>In an attempt to build a criminal empire, he kills almost everyone with whom he worked, but events unfold quite differently than he imagined. Power and money corrupt him and he becomes only the pitiful shadow of the man who was at the beginning of his journey.<br><br>To end the suffering of such a monster can only another monster. William. Bloodthirsty maniac that saves the world from other bloodthirsty maniacs for money. He is a true professional. He is clever, strong, and everyone who underestimated his ability to shoot instantly regretted it. William never lost in battle. He considers himself almost invulnerable, because of which his arrogance knows no bounds.

Anyone else in his place would have noticed the changes that occurred with Mason, but not him. Lester followed him even in those moments when Mason's mind was filled with thoughts of another betrayal.
