{"about_the_game":"3D Joys is more of a utility and is short for 3D Joysticks. <br />\r\nIt's called that because it's based on Joysticks used in  <br />\r\narcades. 3D Joys allow the player to go 6 different directions  <br />\r\ninstead of 4 directions like from a regular Joystick with the help <br />\r\nof VR controllers. The player can summon their 3d Joystick at the  <br />\r\nposition of their hand by using the grip button and choosing from  <br />\r\nup, down, right, left, forward or backwards motion done with a VR controller.<br />\r\nTesting their hand eye coordination in the process. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n  <br />\r\n<br />\r\n  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nVR Memory Cube is the first addition to 3D Joys. Test your memory <br />\r\nand maybe possibly improve it with a color remembering game like <br />\r\nthe classic Simon game. Basically, the game is to remember a sequence <br />\r\nof colors on a cube while each side of the cube will light up different  <br />\r\ncolors that will resemble your cube which is the 3D Joystick around your hand when you summon it.<br />\r\nOnline Leaderboard has been implemented for the people that want to show off. <br />\r\nOffline Leaderboard is also an option. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOculus Rift is the only VR headset I tested this game on. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe future of 3D Joys will depend on its growth because there is  <br />\r\nonly one person working on this project which is myself and I am <br />\r\na college dropout student with a Digital Arts Media Certificate. I started <br />\r\nworking on this project when I had my first Computer Programing class, <br />\r\nwhere I learned Python and which made me pursue other programming <br />\r\nlanguages like C#. Unity is the engine that I am using to make this game. <br />\r\nI am not a professional. I try as hard as I can to bring my vision for <br />\r\nthis game into fruition and it may take longer than someone that knows <br />\r\nwhat they're doing but I hope you see the potential and come along the ride <br />\r\nthat is 3D Joys. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n@WhoDisz","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"First!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2025280/5b6c4b9b1dae6c57fa035f7e8d178a35c1482400.jpg"},{"name":"10 right!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2025280/afdb811a242bc1c55a7401bf912672d3581c6df7.jpg"},{"name":"20 right!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2025280/180ed26af12d9101edbb15cb503c5d918d2455ae.jpg"},{"name":"40 right!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2025280/8a2fce7ffc42d3c18a2d17feab5d9a6043bf90f9.jpg"},{"name":"100 right!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2025280/20e80ee9e2162765297d97e395ea4ccfca285cb5.jpg"},{"name":"200 right!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2025280/b2cb841ca39b416cbfcb8537c8eb21e570a6a290.jpg"},{"name":"2x speed","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2025280/706829250ec617ece22b562f364bb2880d750e78.jpg"},{"name":"Online Leaderboard","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2025280/d4d285dbb1f5558b0fe1497950e1242ac17058e1.jpg"},{"name":"Offline Leaderboard","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2025280/c2a178084d85013c7be79c496a93281dc75a1ac0.jpg"}],"total":9},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2025280/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1682941746","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2025280/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1682941746","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2025280/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1682941746","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2025280/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1682941746","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"3D Joys is more of a utility and is short for 3D Joysticks. <br />\r\nIt's called that because it's based on Joysticks used in  <br />\r\narcades. 3D Joys allow the player to go 6 different directions  <br />\r\ninstead of 4 directions like from a regular Joystick with the help <br />\r\nof VR controllers.
