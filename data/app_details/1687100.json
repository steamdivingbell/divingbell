A match scheduling system is now available, and crossplay is coming soon.<br><br>Finally, if you are purchasing this because you expect the feel of a boxing game that has many YEARS in development then please PASS for now. This game is less than EIGHTEEN MONTHS through development (with one dev). If you're joining us for Early Access, expect ROUGH, but please don't hold that against us in your reviews at this point - we have gone to great lengths to warn you. We're building this game because we love boxing and PvP, and we are learning as we go. <br><br>*NOTE that a dedicated Oculus/Meta/Quest2 version is now available in AppLab. Search &quot;Era of Combat Boxing&quot; or see our Discord for a link. Crossplay features between AppLab and this Steam version are also now available. <br>************************************************************<br><br>Use the solo training exercises, take on the AI, or jump right into what EOC Boxing was designed to do and challenge your friends to three different match types including exhibition, amateur or professional ranked fights where your reputation, stats, virtual cash, and boxer\u2019s title is on the line. <br><br>EOC is a physically demanding game that will push you to improve your cardio and your core. But you'll need some space to add this energetic workout to your routine. Make sure you have at least 1.5m by 2m of unobstructed space to swing and then tell your family members to stand back - WAY back. Or better yet, pick up another headset and challenge them to a no-impact, no-holds-barred grudge match to prove your unconditional supremacy! (separate VR rooms <strong>highly </strong> recommended)<br><br>We want to stress once more that EOC is currently <strong>Early Access</strong> and we are looking for <strong>your </strong> feedback, so if you love boxing and don't mind giving us a glove (er hand), we're all ears about how we can make this game the best that it can possibly be. <br><br>What\u2019s coming up in the very near future? We\u2019re glad you asked! Greater player customization, multiple avatars of gender and race, server moderated multiplayer cash, careers, and titles. A large expansion of the single player mode (we started with multiplayer in mind and need some AI polish during Early Access to give you the solo challenge you deserve). We'll be launching a number of AI opponents to make you sweat on your way to the top in upcoming free content upgrades as we move toward completing our Early Access roadmap. You\u2019ll progress through different venues and earn your place in the hall of champions. <br><br>EOC Boxing was designed from the ground up to support multiplayer VR and we want to ensure that EOC strives for realism while striking the balance in playability. We trust that Early Access already offers players a stable and challenging multiplayer experience that is above all else, entertaining.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Amateur","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1687100/b9f1dc2ed934db82836fe0f18948c1f0f233883b.jpg"}],"total":1},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1687100/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1697082108","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1687100/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1697082108","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1687100/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1697082108","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1687100/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1697082108","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Era of Combat: Boxing is a multiplayer VR experience that strives to reward physical and martial prowess.
