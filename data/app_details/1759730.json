For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:<br />\r\n\ta) Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.<br />\r\n\tb) Canada.
