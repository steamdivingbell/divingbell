However, to make it outside she'll have to pass through all the dangerous areas of the facility, fight hostile genetic experiments, and defeat the ones who've held her captive.<br><br>After having been contained there for years, she'll use the full extent of her abilities to make it out and gain her freedom!<br><br><strong>What is Geneticognito?</strong><br><br>Geneticognito is a 2D platformer with combat and stealth mechanics. Levels consist of hazards that can either damage Rane directly, or detect her. If Rane is detected, security robots will appear through doors, and the exit door to the level locks itself.
