{"about_the_game":"Ducks and Gooobers is a simple Tower Defense game with unique features and gameplay. You can choose between different unique towers to fight off over a dozen different enemies. You get the opportunity to build a strong front line using a combination of towers and blocks to stop the Ducks and Gooobers from pushing. Synergy between tower and block will be key to surviving the longest. Each tower has multiple unique upgrades that allow for countless different combinations. You will fight the enemy on multiple different battlefields. Each battlefield has its own distinct problems and challenges that you will face. As you progress the maps will only get harder so you must adapt. You will not only be competing against the Ducks and Gooobers but also against other players for the longest time survived. Play now and prove yourself the strongest Duck and Gooober slayer this world has ever seen.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Pass the Castle Map","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/911660/9c5cfc71a0c2fada2adf9d6196acf0aec3bc47f6.jpg"},{"name":"Pass the Desert Map","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/911660/b090bfb36daa42537f09262a7ae3ada04c6ca4c8.jpg"},{"name":"Pass the Snow Map","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/911660/9c5cfc71a0c2fada2adf9d6196acf0aec3bc47f6.jpg"},{"name":"Pass the Rocky Road Map","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/911660/9c5cfc71a0c2fada2adf9d6196acf0aec3bc47f6.jpg"},{"name":"Pass the Magma Map","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/911660/b090bfb36daa42537f09262a7ae3ada04c6ca4c8.jpg"},{"name":"Pass the Mountain Map","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/911660/9c5cfc71a0c2fada2adf9d6196acf0aec3bc47f6.jpg"},{"name":"Pass the Beach Map","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/911660/9c5cfc71a0c2fada2adf9d6196acf0aec3bc47f6.jpg"},{"name":"Pass the Stoplight Map","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/911660/9c5cfc71a0c2fada2adf9d6196acf0aec3bc47f6.jpg"},{"name":"Pass the Ghostly Paths Map","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/911660/9c5cfc71a0c2fada2adf9d6196acf0aec3bc47f6.jpg"},{"name":"Medieval Tower Only","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/911660/9c5cfc71a0c2fada2adf9d6196acf0aec3bc47f6.jpg"}],"total":16},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/911660/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1534537930","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/911660/page.bg.jpg?t=1534537930","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/911660/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1534537930","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/911660/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1534537930","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Ducks and Gooobers is a simple Tower Defense game with unique features and gameplay.
