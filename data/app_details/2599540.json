{"about_the_game":"Cube Battlefield: 2048 is a rogue-like top-down shooting game with infinitely generated levels. In this game, you will shoot down your enemies with various bullets, also leveling up your troop from a single cube to an army of cubes with different abilities. With the coins you collect from the battlefield, you can strengthen your cube abilities and thus beat more levels.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unleash the Power of Cubes</h2><br>8 different cubes with various abilities are waiting for you to unlock! Cube 8 can use a rifle gun, Cube 16 can freeze enemies, and what Cube 64 can do will impress you. You can control all these cubes simply by point-and-click, and they will destroy the cube enemies into pieces!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2599540/extras/CubeShooting.png?t=1696208736\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Leveling up Your Army</h2><br>Only a single tiny cube in the beginning? No worries! You can expand your armed forces by collecting coins from beating your enemies. The more coins you collect, the more cubes you will have! All these cubes will align nicely together waiting for your command to initiate their attack!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2599540/extras/ManyCubes.png?t=1696208736\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Enemies are also Cubes</h2><br>Most of the cube enemies can be broken down into smaller cubes! Each of them owns a special ability. Some cubes can slow you down, and some cubes can shoot poisonous bubbles. Would you be able to eliminate all of them and survive?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2599540/extras/ManyEnemyCubes.png?t=1696208736\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Infinite Levels</h2><br>All the levels are generated on the fly, and you have infinite levels to beat! However, you will always start from Room 1 after you lose all your cubes. How far can you reach? Let's test it out!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2599540/extras/Wasted.png?t=1696208736\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2599540/extras/StartRoom.png?t=1696208736\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Upgrading Cubes with Coins</h2><br>A plethora of cube abilities are upgradable! Use coins to boost your cube to a higher level! How about making the rifle shoot 15 bullets at a time? Or shooting a bullet that can reach the furthest enemy? You can only get more powerful each time you are reborn.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2599540/extras/upgrade.png?t=1696208736\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2599540/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1696208736","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2599540/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1696208736","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2599540/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1696208736","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2599540/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1696208736","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Cube Battlefield: 2048 is a rogue-like top-down shooting game with infinitely generated levels.
