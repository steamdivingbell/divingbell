{"about_the_game":"K3LVN is a sci-fi action platformer where the player is a creature who\u2019s been experimented on and is trying to escape the space station lab where they\u2019re being kept. K3LVN is able to change their state of matter to alter their behavior. The three states usable are the Gel state which is the default bipedal state, the Liquid state which makes K3LVN smaller and grants the ability to climb on certain walls, and the Solid State, which turns K3LVN into a ball to roll around and gain momentum.
