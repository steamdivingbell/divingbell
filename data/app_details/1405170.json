Chinese history books since the Tang Dynasty have been called &quot;big food (y\u00ec)&quot;, while Western Europe is used to call it the Saracen Empire. The Arab Empire has gone through 626 years. There are four major caliphs (632-661) and the Umayyad dynasty (661-750) and the Abbasid dynasty (750-1258).<br><br>We have seen many books about the Arab Empire, but have you tried a realistic Arab Empire world? In real life, we cannot go back to the past, and we cannot empathize well with the culture of that era. But in the VR field, we can enable you to enter an extremely real world by using virtual reality equipment. The historical journey in the era of the VR Crusader is to simulate the virtual world of the Arab Empire. You can feel the desolate and dry desert environment of abandoned small villages, experience the suffering of the people's life in the Arab Empire, and see the splendid castles of the Arab Empire. You can walk freely in the game, you can appear in any corner of the palace, you can also stand on the castle and look at it, it will grow alive in front of you. The immersive and immersive feeling brought by VR technology is unmatched by other technologies.<br><br>We have built several simulated scenes for this game. You can choose any scene to start your tour. At the same time, in order to prevent you from being bored during the tour, we have also designed a game session to find the treasure chest to bring more fun to your tour. Every time you find a treasure chest, you will get different points. The more treasure chests you find, the more points you will accumulate; don\u2019t underestimate this point, this point will bring you a huge surprise after the game is over Big gift package. In addition to the game items to visit the scene, we also provide fishing game items imitating traditional fishing, bow and arrow hunting games and snake games. I have to say that the snake-eating game is very good for our shoulder and neck health. At the same time as the game, we are constantly exercising our cervical spine. It is really a very good game.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1405170/extras/3.png?t=1659580730\" /><br><br>Arabia\u2019s hectic territory stretches from the Indus River and Congling in the east, to the Atlantic coast in the west, to the Caucasus Mountains, Caspian Sea and southern France in the north, to the Arabian Sea and the Sahara Desert in the south, with a land area of \u200b\u200b13.4 million square kilometers.
