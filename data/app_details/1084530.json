In the game, you can mine asteroids to gain money and spend it on building and defending your own custom maze.  The game takes place in deep-space where you command a spaceship that is in charge of defending a space station from attack. The game is divided up into two phases separated by a timer. The first being, &quot;Explore&quot;, where you use your spaceship to mine asteroids that are defended by marauding pirates and then use the proceeds to purchase maze blocks, upgrades, and defensive equipment such as turrets and ships. Once the timer reaches zero the enemy will attack your Starbase.
