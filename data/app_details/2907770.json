{"about_the_game":"Get big laughs while you point and click to search for clues and solve mysteries with Hollywood's most deranged private investigators, Frankie and Suede. Be immersed into a cinematic experience with slapstick characters in this film noir comedy adventure. From High life to lowlifes, hobnob or interrogate to get big information about the big case. Collect items to help you solve puzzles, open doors, crack safes, decode letters, and more. Use Suede\u2019s deep search on items and furniture for fingerprints and fibers then match them to suspects in your own private crime lab. Use Frankie\u2019s disguises to outsmart your enemies, and gain entry to private offices or elitist social clubs. Help crack the case and restore Tinseltown back to normal, at last by Hollywood\u2019s standards.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2907770/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714950412","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2907770/page.bg.jpg?t=1714950412","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2907770/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714950412","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2907770/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714950412","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"The Frankie and Suede game depicts dead cartoon characters, blood, smoking, drinking, and jokes with light hearted sexual innuendos and double entendres.
