{"about_the_game":"Space base is an expansive tower defence game, where you run the forces of your very own planet as you try to defend against oncoming fleets of alien ships and otherworldly foes. Use all the resources that you can muster to put together the best defence possible, to make sure your planet is as safe as it can possibly be.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn space base, you are provided with a variety of different planets to take on as your own, each with their own gimmicks and features, ranging between dwarf planets with lower health, to planets with circling rings that may impair shots. Choose whichever planet fits your playstyle the best, or simply go for the greatest challenge, it is really up to you!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou also get to make the selection between a variety of difficulties and game modes to play through to make the game as interesting as possible to play. Is the game not challenging enough? Crank up the difficulty! Want to add a bit of extra spice to the game? Try one of the different game modes such as blueprint to add the extra change to the game to try and make your experience more unique and fun!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour arsenal in the game is ever expanding, with lots of options to choose from before entering your next war. As you only have a limited amount of tower slots, it makes for a fun dilemma of choosing what would work best for your next run! Either select the towers that provide the best utility for the run, or try something new if you\u2019re up to it! The variety of towers come in a range of different classes, from military and support classes ranging through to different futuristic and appliance classes, so there is no shortage in different options for you to test out!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you play through the game, you will encounter a range of different enemies and bosses, ranging from a fleshy blob of alien eggs all the way through to the god of the cosmos, known only as Astro. The range of different enemies and randomisation of which bosses you may face in a run allow for a different variety each run, and as different weapons work better against different enemies you never know what the best option to take in may be!","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3089200?t=1733738506","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3089200?t=1733738506","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3089200/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733738506","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3089200/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733738506","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Space base is an expansive tower defence game, where you run the forces of your very own planet as you try to defend against oncoming fleets of alien ships and otherworldly foes.
