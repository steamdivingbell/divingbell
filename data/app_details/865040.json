I never could have imagined how its release would alter the direction of my life. Through it's success I was able to  now support myself as a full-time game developer. These last few years in game development have provided me with so many amazing opportunities. I couldn't have done the majority of this without the great support of the community that appeared out of nowhere to play my silly little arcade game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"></h2>Super Bit Blaster XL is the next evolution Bit Blaster. Since it's release I have learned a lot more about Unity and C# and so I have reworked many aspects of the game. I added a new Co-Op mode, Vs Mode, improved the GFX, new translations, new Easter eggs, and various other new things. I also completely overhauled the control scheme due to feedback; while it's still not a Twin-Stick shooter, overall control is so much more responsive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/865040/extras/004_sbbxl_gif.gif?t=1732298295\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"></h2>My decision to release this as a separate title as opposed to an update on the original is because the changes are all so drastic I wouldn't want to upset the flow of the original Steam game that people seem to love. I also have learned a lot from (fellow) developers about self worth so the price will be higher than a single dollar this time around. i'm sure there will be folks keen to pick apart this decision as greedy or selfish but I imagine the people that really enjoyed the original and want to support indie creators will understand my choices.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"></h2>I greatly appreciate your feedback and will do my best to ensure lengthy support for my games.
