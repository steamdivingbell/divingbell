{"about_the_game":"<strong>Calturin and Clone </strong>is a  2D co-op action RPG where you can either play as a lone adventurer or with a fellow wizard. Mainly focused on difficult boss fights and other challenging encounters that are not combat, Calturin and Clone will test you and your friend's skills to the limit. You and your ally play two mages that enter through a series of portals where you must defeat whatever the portals bring.<br><br>Calturin and Clone is an incomplete game that I released for free, and only has 4 bosses/puzzles and some bugs. Because multiplayer was too hard I stopped developing this version, and started over with the game Calturin as single player, that has many more bosses and a story.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1359110/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724239982","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1359110/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1724239982","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1359110/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724239982","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1359110/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724239982","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Calturin and Clone </strong>is a  2D co-op action RPG where you can either play as a lone adventurer or with a fellow wizard.
