{"about_the_game":"Ghoulboy is a retro-inspired style action platformer. Exciting new platformer that combines the action-RPG genre with hack 'n' slash gameplay. 2D action, heroic characters, gloomy environments, demonic bosses, these all seem to excite players a lot. Pixels will be combined with other cool retro elements and the result will certainly be something that will meet the needs of PC gamers. Once in-game, users will get to control a heroic character who will often be seen throwing a spear to create additional platforms. To boot, puzzle and combat elements will further enhance the experience. You wouldn\u2019t want to miss out on it. With the gold that you collect, you can increase your health level, your arsenal of weapons to be thrown away.<br>Slay as many monsters as you can, collect loot, avoid dangerous traps and defeat menacing bosses.<br>Ghoulboy brings back the look and feel of the very best classic retro platformers from the 90's, introducing refreshed and engaging gameplay mechanics.
