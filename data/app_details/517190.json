As the player, you\u2019re responsible for using your force gun to bounce the ball away from the screen boundaries, into powerups, and against pesky enemies!<br><br>In the game, you'll be able to best yourself by reaching new high scores, reaching your longest time survived, or even through mastering enemy wave challenges!

You must use your force gun to properly guide your ball with the power of physics! However, as the timer ticks, things get dangerous.

Some of these guys are bigger and stronger than others, so you have to be ready to fight challenging bosses as well. But be careful, as hitting these guys from the wrong angle might knock you out of bounds and fulfill their goal! <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/517190/extras/thePowerups615.png?t=1543763940\" /><br><br>Cloning. Rapid fire. Hyperspeed. Weapons. The powerups in Rebound can do it all! Don't let these enemies get you down, because at the end of day, you'll still get some help.
