{"about_the_game":"<strong><i>This game contains flickering/flashing lights and loud noises.</i><br><br>The Thing at the Window is a short horror game that was initially developed from December 2018 through October 2019 and then shelved for a few years while we took a break to experiment with other ideas. Please note that while the game is playable it's still in alpha so expect it to be rather rough around the edges. I strongly suggest playing in the dark with headphones for the most immersive experience (which I mean, it's a horror game so that kind of goes without saying). The game can be kind of LOUD at times but that is by design. I don't recommend turning the volume down too much or you won't be able to hear crucial audio cues.</strong><br><br><i>You live with your father in the rural American midwest.
