{"about_the_game":"This is a cross platform multiplayer online action game.<br>You start the game as a tiny bacteria (cell) in a petri dish. You must try to survive by avoiding attacks by bigger players. At the same time, you eat food and become a bigger and bigger cell, until you are large enough to eat other players.<br><br>The game is very immersive and has very active gameplay with a lot of action. All your enemies are real people, so you must find a good strategy to become the biggest cell on the gamefield! Anyone can become big in one moment, or lose all their progress in the next - so be careful :) Game mechanics are similar to other .io games which you probably already know - but this is not agar or diep!<br><br>This game was made by the same developers of Agar.io and is constantly updating with new and unique features!<br><br>Warning! This game is very addictive and takes alot of effort from you to survive with so much action.<br>So if you die in the beginning, be patient, and improve your skills :)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How to Play Senpa.io</h2>Senpa.io is simple to play, you simple use your mouse cursor to navigate around the screen, and you use space to split your cell, and W to eject mass.
