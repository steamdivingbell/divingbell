{"about_the_game":"Scrap Seas is an action-roguelike about customizing your murder-boat to battle robots, dieselpunk pirates, sea monsters, and huge bosses!  Use your firepower and maneuvering skills to destroy your enemies in fast-paced gameplay.  Travel through a randomly generated campaign of battles, broken up by shops and random events.  Just don\u2019t die, because death is a permanent condition!<br><br><strong>FIGHT!</strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1535810/extras/robotRammingSkirmish-ezgif.com-optimize.gif?t=1725203256\" /><br>Use your fire power and maneuvering skills to sink ships, robots, and other stuff.  Destroy your enemies, and save those you care about.  Use your boosters to ram into enemy ships head on or to flee like a coward.  Just make sure you don't DIE, because if you DIE you'll die forever, and it's pretty easy to DIE. <br><br><strong>BUILD YOUR SHIP</strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1535810/extras/shopClip.gif?t=1725203256\" /><br>Start with a boat and fight your way to an AWESOME BOAT!  Take that boat and fill it with every kind of cannon, laser beam, and whatever the hell else you can find.   You can also collect comic book panels which can provide a variety of buffs to your ship.  Ah, and don't forget about melee weapons.  Every boat worth piloting needs some buzz saws, or at least some electrified spikes.<br><br><strong>PLOT YOUR COURSE</strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1535810/extras/overworldTokenMovement.gif?t=1725203256\" /><br>Navigate your way around a generated map.   Ensure that you have enough supplies for your journey.  Choose your battles wisely...or unwisely, I don't care.  I'm not your dad.  <br><br><strong>USE YOUR WORDS!</strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1535810/extras/overWorldEventClip.gif?t=1725203256\" /><br>Are you a hero or a coward?
