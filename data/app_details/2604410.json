Like fate itself. <br><br>In our first real gig after graduation, following some training, we were quickly faced with our first assignment: design a MINI-GAME in just one month.<br><br>As you might have guessed, &quot;Bride into the Cave&quot; is the result of our collective effort.<br><br>The protagonist of &quot;Bride into the Cave&quot; is a girl named Miaofei. With a beautiful smile and jet-black hair, Miaofei's gaze is remarkably determined and resolute. She is quiet, doesn't speak much, but harbors a strong curiosity and eagerness to learn about everything. From a vague outline in our minds, she has now come to life, a character known by countless people. Among us are there is a folklore lover, a skilled storyteller, a talented artist, and a coding wizard. Looking back, Miaofei's story would have been incomplete without any one of us.<br><br>When it came to deciding the gameplay, our internal opinions were surprisingly aligned. Our initial intent was to pay homage to the predecessors of Chinese puzzle games, so we decided to make this game a combination of narrative and puzzle-solving, with a touch of suspense. The essence of Chinese suspense lies not in excessive blood and gore but in an atmosphere that subtly infiltrates your minds. We spent a considerable amount of time researching literature, even reaching out through friends of friends to confirm the meaning behind the Miao language songs, all to ensure the details were worth scrutinizing. Introducing female script, a unique Chinese script system for women, added an innovative touch to our puzzles.<br><br>We hope you enjoy playing this game, and Miaofei's story as well.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2604410/extras/devstory_update_en.gif?t=1718174822\" /><br><br>Currently, we've all been engaged with our work and have limited time for this game to be honest. However, all of us are determined to see this project through to completion for our audience. We will carry on with this title until it becomes an official release for the public eye.<br><br>So here's a small wish: <br><br><strong>PLS WISHLIST US! </strong><br><br>Seeing the wishlist count grow every day is the motivation that brings us together after work, continuing to strive for our dream!<br><br>Of course, being a group of novices, this is our first work. If there are any rough or green aspects, please bear with us and offer your guidance!
