It\u2019s a puzzle game, but also a cooperative multiplayer arena, and is a real-time tactics game that\u2019s also procedurally generated. Look, a bunch of jargon will only obscure the fact that ConnecTank rules.\u201d<br>Kotaku<br><br>\u201cMixing genres in video games is a process of taking a little from Column A, a touch of Column B, and a liberal sprinkle with Column C, hoping the whole thing doesn't blow up in gamers' faces. While there's no shortage of explosions in ConnecTank, this hybridized puzzle/strategy game manages to achieve a sort of controlled chaos that's almost a masterclass in contradictions.\u201d<br>4/5 \u2013 Common Sense Media<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1597200/ss_9c068245a2de8da385d7cd1aa917014ee8e3428d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633719952","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1597200/ss_9c068245a2de8da385d7cd1aa917014ee8e3428d.600x338.jpg?t=1633719952"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1597200/ss_fd26bcbf5c8a059e4ff92310ef7b8aa872666d9b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633719952","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1597200/ss_fd26bcbf5c8a059e4ff92310ef7b8aa872666d9b.600x338.jpg?t=1633719952"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1597200/ss_ee7bb6fdb77fb866558cf48facbf5cc87141dd73.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633719952","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1597200/ss_ee7bb6fdb77fb866558cf48facbf5cc87141dd73.600x338.jpg?t=1633719952"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1597200/ss_19dc3edf257cfad18dce3aaaaf5ef231b98eeae0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633719952","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1597200/ss_19dc3edf257cfad18dce3aaaaf5ef231b98eeae0.600x338.jpg?t=1633719952"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1597200/ss_8d520022a37b42f61cc5903046a11527c57c2bd7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633719952","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1597200/ss_8d520022a37b42f61cc5903046a11527c57c2bd7.600x338.jpg?t=1633719952"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1597200/ss_59d9cf7f6bc4c142ec0fbf31c1a5ca2a80398db8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633719952","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1597200/ss_59d9cf7f6bc4c142ec0fbf31c1a5ca2a80398db8.600x338.jpg?t=1633719952"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1597200/ss_3dbfbb4b8e1845ac3afa3ed37865ee19a5a0a319.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633719952","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1597200/ss_3dbfbb4b8e1845ac3afa3ed37865ee19a5a0a319.600x338.jpg?t=1633719952"}],"short_description":"ConnecTank is an action game for one to four players where you step inside a big honking tank.
