You can play in parallel or in turn against other human players. When playing in parallel you use the same set of tiles and the best scoring play stays on the board, all players getting their score. Steam lobbies are used, with the first computer hosting the game server and everyone being a client to the host. You can auto join/create a new lobby, choose a lobby to join or create a new lobby. Manually creating a lobby you can set it to &quot;Friends only&quot;. While waiting for a game to start everyone can play an anagram game and text each other. The lobby leader can decide if there will be any computer players, the board to play on, the tiles to use, the rules in play and how and when the game will start. If the lobby leader drops out, then someone else's computer should fill the role. When the game is about to start, the lobby owner will automatically start a server and the server will pass the game setup to the clients.<br>- If you don't want to play against other people then in local/single player mode, you can always choose to play against the computer (note that some of the computer players are exceptional at playing the game) or on your own in Patience mode.<br>- You can play against the clock, either by defining a round length or by setting the overall active time that can be taken, or not have a clock and just take your time.<br>- Non-rectangular boards based on areas you can't place tiles (Design your own 2D collage backgrounds, then use the board designer to define where you can place tiles, and set where bonuses and score traps are).<br>- 3D boards. Want to try playing around a cube? In this game you can. (Design you own 3D boards, define 3D shapes with the Voxel designer, then use the Board designer to specify where you can place tiles, and set where bonuses and score traps are).<br>- Cylinder boards, go around and around...<br>- You can set the game rules, e.g. choose to play words left and/or right and up and/or down the board. Set how blank/wildcard tiles score.<br>- Scores are based on the value of the tiles and where you place them. Try to use bonuses the board may have, but avoid any scoring traps.<br>- Multiple sets of tiles to play (make up your own tile sets).<br>- Tiles can contain single or multiple characters. Blank tiles can be replaced with contents of other tiles (e.g. multiple characters where applicable).<br>- Multiple computer players with different playing styles and vocabulary that they will use.<br>- Game modes where you can vote to attack (for double scores) or defend (prevent double scores). Play these when you think it's going to benefit you and not everyone else, because everyone gets the score boost if it happens (when all playing in parallel).<br>- Adjustable interface layout. Drag and resize things like the score panel, clock etc.<br><br>While playing you can either drag individual tiles from the tile rack onto the board or you can pick which tiles to place and where to start placing them from. When placing selected tile(s) you can either gesture which direction they should be placed (eg click and drag the mouse in the required direction) or click on the arrow control on the tile rack to specify the direction, then click on the tile to start placing from.<br>To remove placed tiles you can click on them with the secondary mouse button or click on a cancel button.<br><br><br><strong><i><u>CODEWORD</u></i></strong><br><br><strong>Letters of the alphabet have been replaced with numbers.
