{"about_the_game":"Meet Bob.  Bob is lost and can't find his way home. Help Bob navigate through the Tower of Contrivance. Bob is distressed, which has caused him to move at random. Guide him through all 50 levels through whatever means necessary. Bob is a good boy. Protect Bob at all costs! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach level is a self-contained puzzle. Levels progressively get more complicated. If Bob or any part of the level gets out of control, you can reset the level at any time. It is a simple game with a simple premise, but it is not so simple to complete. It will test you. Relax and go with the flow.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"The Beginning","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1234540/bc5b6b705fcbc42137a82b541ef88891d77dea9a.jpg"},{"name":"Level 5","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1234540/ec377b3f62fa7b1dad27fd7f7204b37fd41aea30.jpg"},{"name":"Level 10","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1234540/8c230c4ca7631f0890c5a36c14f8de91a48a176a.jpg"},{"name":"Level 15","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1234540/864be527b51bef6313c8a99d642a299342136a7d.jpg"},{"name":"Level 20","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1234540/4f2e150659227ea9f39204b48c1d677bdb8ae259.jpg"},{"name":"Level 25","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1234540/950b08330782c638983ea1e605208cde6e5f767b.jpg"},{"name":"Level 30","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1234540/7ad0dae0dced821ef9540071f8419036173d38ac.jpg"},{"name":"Level 35","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1234540/c987f5122240438c69ce31634163e9987f63a16a.jpg"},{"name":"Level 40","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1234540/7f165d2ca06256482d5d348835ba254ad7be1729.jpg"},{"name":"Level 45","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1234540/4e2bc767f9df54b9cb14a486102130c1227c740a.jpg"}],"total":51},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1234540/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1667082388","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1234540/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1667082388","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1234540/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1667082388","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1234540/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1667082388","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Meet Bob.
