{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Pathfinder RPG - Campaign Setting: Giants Revisited</h2>No creatures demonstrate smaller races' relative insignificance better than the eerie and awe-inspiring giants, whose humanoid visages and cyclopean strengths exude an aura of both familiarity and terror.
