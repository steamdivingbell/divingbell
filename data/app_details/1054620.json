{"about_the_game":"A short 2-3 hour adventure turn-based RPG where you play as a bat, a rat, and a wolf, and descend into a multi-level dungeon in order to get revenge on the humans that murdered your family! Instead of playing as heroes in a typical RPG you assume the role of the monsters they fought along the way. Recruit two other monsters along the way, and become more powerful than you've ever dreamed possible.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What's in it for you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?????????????????</h2><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A courageous bat protagonist.</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>More than 10 challenging levels of dungeon combat.</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A steep difficulty that beckons you to master it.</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>No clothes!
