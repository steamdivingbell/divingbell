{"about_the_game":"Rebuke the overwhelming cloud that seizes your consciousness by finding the things that mean the most to you in this world or attempt to escape it by finding one of three doors available to you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLarge black arrows tether you to the doorways, but they are strongest when they\u2019re furthest away. In order to open a door you must visualize it by focusing on the door long enough to paint a mental picture of yourself opening it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou may also visualize other people, places, or things by looking at them long enough to reclaim some clarity. At times it may help you to rotate so that you can get a new perspective on things that you had previously so routinely overlooked.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSometimes you might not be able to visualize what you want, no matter how sure you are that you want it. That\u2019s okay, we all have our hang-ups. I sometimes forget how to talk to the people that know me best. It could help to divert your attention elsewhere briefly or simply move on. I trust your judgement.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you begin to feel your pulse quicken, it may be a sign that you should finish up any business you have. Some people don\u2019t get any indication, but even fewer heed any warnings they are given. It\u2019s up to you to decide what\u2019s important, as long as you know why you\u2019re doing it.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1214892/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1601647010","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1214892/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1601647010","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1214892/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1601647010","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1214892/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1601647010","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Rebuke the overwhelming cloud that seizes your consciousness by finding the things that mean the most to you in this world or attempt to escape it by finding one of three doors available to you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLarge black arrows tether you to the doorways, but they are strongest when they\u2019re furthest away.
