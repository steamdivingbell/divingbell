{"about_the_game":"<strong>(EDIT: 4/5/2021)<br>Just a quick message to you looking to play this, this game is frustratingly hard, has a lot of ridiculously &quot;blink-and-you'll-miss-it&quot; secrets, and a lot, A LOT of unfair death mechanics. As I was still learning a way to properly implement puzzle techniques with the story I wanted to tell, I had a poor perception of how hard this game was to play because I could only see the game-play as the developer. At the time (to me) all the puzzles seemed painfully easy, but of course that's because I was the one who built it (pretty dumb, right?). I was more focused on creating a strong atmosphere and REALLY overhauling the visual aesthetic which was pretty lackluster in the very first version (I still love how this game turned out visually :D), and I still feel the story itself is a strong one.<br><br>As for the puzzle logic, the narrative flow, and how well the game-play and story are meshed together, it's a mess. I do think there are several mechanics that worked really well, but there's just too many that are so clunky and unpolished it hurts to think about. I'm shocked to find people are STILL giving this game a chance and it hurts watching them struggle through puzzle mechanics I know now could've been implemented far better. If you want to play this game regardless, go ahead it's free, but just know you'll be in for a rough time.<br><br>I want to redo this game so much, but life is getting in the way ATM. If I do finally sit down and redo this, I'll be sure to post an update here, but for now I won't be making any promises.<br><br>I'd like to thank everyone who played The Hunt-Rebuilt already. You've all given great constructive criticism and were super polite about it. Thank you sincerely, giving honest feedback with a kind attitude is the most important thing you can give any developer :).
