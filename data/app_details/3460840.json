In <i>Gloamvault</i>, there is no limit to which monsters you can merge or how often you can do it. Merging works best when both monsters have similar abilities. If they don\u2019t, there is a small chance that the &quot;main&quot; monster will inherit abilities they don\u2019t share.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>How many merge combinations exist?</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Too many! Each monster can have multiple abilities from the 25 existing ones, with varying values. The same monster can even appear with different abilities as long as they fit its types. This results in a huge number of possible merge combinations.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Can you really charm any monster?</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Yes! The lower the enemy monster's HP, the higher the chance of a successful charm. You can also boost your chances with upgrades or items\u2014but beware! The deeper you go, the harder it gets to charm.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>What makes this a roguelike?</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">While not a traditional roguelike, <i>Gloamvault</i> features permadeath, no saving, a focus on procedural content, grid-based movement, turn-based combat, and more. One could argue that it checks many boxes from the Berlin Interpretation of what defines a roguelike. But in the end, you\u2019ll be the judge!</p></li></ul></li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3460840/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738685042","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3460840/page.bg.jpg?t=1738685042","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3460840/c5dc820bf50256de6b07b094ad54e2b5aa718b6d/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738685042","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3460840/c5dc820bf50256de6b07b094ad54e2b5aa718b6d/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738685042","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"grim dark fantasy with all kinds of undead or evil creatures that fight each other"},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3460840/extras/desc_header.png?t=1738685042\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3460840/extras/desc_hello.png?t=1738685042\" /></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>&quot;90s Black Metal Monster Collector&quot;</i></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You are a resurrected evil wizard.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Charm any monster you encounter to build up your army.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Over 500 different monsters to fight.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Use your dark magic to merge two monsters together.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Spend points to get upgrades.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Cast spells to influence the battle.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Collect items to further enhance your build.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Try to reach the depths of the dungeon... or die trying.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each dungeon is procedurally generated, making each run unique!</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Inspired by crazy build games like Path of Achra and aesthetics of old school first person dungeon crawlers like wizardry.
