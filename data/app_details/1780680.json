{"about_the_game":"Dreadful Wake is an intense survival horror FPS with punishing rogue-lite gameplay, with diverse level design governed by procedural generation. Trapped within ever-changing mazes, a story of unanswered questions, enveloped in the fog of fear. Why are you there? What are those things?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTry finding your way out with limited supplies, deciding when it is time to stand your ground and engage in combat or sneak past to save supplies and health for later encounters. Play single-player for a riskier survival or try your hand at a two-player online co-op where you must work together to survive increasingly challenging scenarios. Permadeath is a core mechanic; death results in all progress being lost.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Limb Dismemberment -<br />\r\nUse limb dismemberment to your advantage, with unique changes in behavior for each enemy, ie. Skin Crawlers will slow and become more feral, and Splitters will rip open their own ribcage and charge in an unhinged fury.  Any limbs that glow red and can be used for consumption to gain back lost health. There are plans to further explore this concept.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n - Lore -<br />\r\nIt is extremely important to me that the lore of the Dreadful Wake is rich and deep. Throughout each run, you will be able to discover information about where you are, why you are there, and what the heck the creatures are. There will even be hints that give you an upper hand. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n - Level Design -<br />\r\nHeavily inspired by Liminal Spaces or The Backrooms, created using generated level design. There will be a mix of procedurally generated (built entirely from the ground up) and randomly generated (built from pre-assembled rooms stitched together) as well as some handcrafted levels sprinkled in. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n - Inventory Management -<br />\r\nStaying prepared is a necessity in Dreadful Wake. The inventory system is a &quot;Jigsaw Inventory&quot; similar to Resident Evil 4 and Tarkov. You will have to manage your inventory, fitting only what is most necessary and leaving behind items you find least useful. Magazines do not auto load themselves, if you have two half-full mags and you would like to consolidate them, you will have to do that manually. This forces you to pay attention to your ammo count and make sure you are ready for each encounter before they occur.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1780680/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1636329579","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1780680/page.bg.jpg?t=1636329579","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1780680/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1636329579","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1780680/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1636329579","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Limb dismemberment is a core game mechanic, with lots of blood and body parts."},"detailed_description":"Dreadful Wake is an intense survival horror FPS with punishing rogue-lite gameplay, with diverse level design governed by procedural generation.
