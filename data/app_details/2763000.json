{"about_the_game":"A cargo airplane crashed somewhere in the vast areas of the Amita mountain range. It was carrying a large shipment of beagles headed to the CutLab, a huge animal testing facility. The lab is upset about losing its precious testing material and is deploying a biohazard division determined to reclaim its &quot;property&quot;. They operate under strict orders: seize usable specimens, dispose of the rest! We are sending our elite animal rescue squad to save as many dogs as possible before the lab's grunts confine them back to the life of endless misery. <br>Go!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2763000/extras/strip8.gif?t=1710457282\" /><br><br><strong>Rescue: The Beagles</strong> is a challenging platformer/runner with unique parallax based gameplay.
