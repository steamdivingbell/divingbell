{"about_the_game":"Above: The Fallen is a 2D side-scrolling, puzzle - platformer game that is centered around travelling upwards instead of to the left or right. The goal is to climb the trees of an ancient and mystical forest in order to break through the canopy. You must manipulate two main characters at the same time throughout the game, solve puzzles, and avoid the hazards of this dark forest.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/715490/extras/lore.png?t=1577205738\" /><br><br>Mankind has been driven from their homes among the trees by the Night King, a nightmarish beast whose origin has been lost to time.

They often find themselves in situations that require them to work together to solve puzzles and progress up to the canopy. Each character is controlled with one half of the Gamepad. This offers an additional challenge and requires you to think about each character's positioning before moving. If you don't get the hang of it right away, don't worry, it won't be long before you're climbing through the jungle like Tarzan.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/715490/extras/gamepad.png?t=1577205738\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Single Player or Co-op mode!</h2><br>Bring a friend along with you as you adventure through the world, solve puzzles and work together to defeat the Night King.
