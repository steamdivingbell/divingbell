{"about_the_game":"<strong>The Darkest Paths - The House</strong> is a Single-player Psychological Horror Game, adapting the VHS-Style format to give you the best horror experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story Summary</h2><br>You take the place of Michael Holster, a journalist who used to live in Ravens Hollow, a small-city near a beautiful large forest. However, in this beautiful small-city weird, strange, and sometimes scary events unfold. People going missing, weird symbols popping up, and murder cases. Michael, who at a young age moved away from Ravens Hollow, decides to go back and investigate some of the strangest cases from his old hometown, hoping to gain some fame, make money with his articles, and maybe even get some closure.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Psychological Horror</li></ul> <i>TDP is at its core a Psychological Horror Game that utilizes atmosphere, audio, and the setting to create fear and anxiety.
