{"about_the_game":"<strong>Welcome to 52Beatup!</strong><br><br>52Beatup is a Deck-Building, Fast-Paced (Like Really Fast-Paced), Fighting Game!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Why &quot;52Beatup&quot;</strong></h2>the Name '&quot;52Beatup&quot; is based on the Joke card game &quot;52 Pickup&quot;, where you'd throw all of your cards into the air and force people to pick them up. <br><br>In thematic symbolism, I am throwing away all forms of the traditional fighting game &quot;Honesty&quot; for this game. This is not an &quot;Honest Grounded-Based Footsies&quot; game. You can, under the right circumstances, get one shot on round start. Chip Damage is pretty heavy. Counter hits do insane damage. And with the right cards, you can make the grappler move fullscreen in a blink of an eye.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Cards?</strong></h2>After every round, 3 cards will appear with certain buffs that each player can pick (The loser of the round, of course, goes first). These cards have varying effects, here's an example of some!<br><br>-400% Damage if you land the first strike (If the opponent blocks, this card is nullified)<br><br>-Level up both of your Special moves, up to a maximum of 3 times!<br><br>-More Speed (Specifically Movement speed. Frame data will not change.)<br><br>-Lifesteal<br><br>-Faster, and Longer Dashes<br><br>Want to be a zoner with next to no speed, but as a tradeoff, you have more HP than a grappler? How about giving the Grappler a half-screen, unreactable mixup with incredibly high speed? With the right luck, any build is possible! <br><br>52Beatup is a first to 5 or Best of 9 game. This is also why the game is incredibly fast-paced. Combos are high damage, very freeform, but very fast. Chip damage is very high. There's a Guard Meter that depletes VERY fast.<br><br>52Beatup does not have highs or lows, just Mids. To compensate, every character has an instant 8-way airdash, and grabs can be used out of dashes.<br><br>You start with ALL resources round start. To balance this, both of your special moves cost 1 bar of meter. You can do a LOT with meter, and have a lot of it, but its up to you to conserve it, because you will run out fast if you go willy nilly.<br><br>This Game Relies on a good deal of RNG! The game has a built-in luck system to stop a player from obtaining an incredibly strong card early on and proceeding to steamroll. Additionally, cards that completely change matchups or data of characters aren't in place.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2543950/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1711883958","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2543950/page.bg.jpg?t=1711883958","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2543950/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1711883958","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2543950/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1711883958","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":2690140,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<strong>Welcome to 52Beatup!</strong><br><br>52Beatup is a Deck-Building, Fast-Paced (Like Really Fast-Paced), Fighting Game!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Why &quot;52Beatup&quot;</strong></h2>the Name '&quot;52Beatup&quot; is based on the Joke card game &quot;52 Pickup&quot;, where you'd throw all of your cards into the air and force people to pick them up. <br><br>In thematic symbolism, I am throwing away all forms of the traditional fighting game &quot;Honesty&quot; for this game.
