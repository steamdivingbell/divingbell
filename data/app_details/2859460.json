However, you can also pull up and overlay any map on any other game (as long as the game is not using fullscreen mode) with a quick and simple hotkey press.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h2><br><strong>Q: Is this a subscription service?</strong>  <br><strong>A: </strong> No! You buy a license for MapHub once, and it's yours forever. No strings attached.<br><br><strong>Q: Do you provide curated maps?</strong>  <br><strong>A: </strong> No, we provide a general-purpose tool and a platform for the community to collaborate. While we have uploaded a few demo samples on the Steam Workshop, these are not part of the product itself but rather demos to get the community started. You're buying a software license, not any map or map service.<br><br><strong>Q: Can I draw map tiles or icons inside MapHub?</strong>  <br><strong>A: </strong> No, you'll need to bring in such assets from a different source. You can import them as JPGs or PNGs or use our in-application tool to generate icons (but not tilemaps) from emojis or text.<br><br><strong>Q: Can I keep my maps private, or will they be automatically published in the Steam Workshop?</strong>  <br><strong>A: </strong> You can set the visibility of your maps to Private, Friends Only, or Public. MapHub will automatically sync the content to Steam's cloud, so you don't have to worry about losing your work when you move from one PC to another. That said, you can, of course, choose to keep all your maps private.<br><br><strong>Q: Does MapHub's overlay work with fullscreen games?</strong>  <br><strong>A: </strong> A game can <strong>LOOK</strong> fullscreen, but internally, it might be using the &quot;real&quot; fullscreen mode offered by the Windows Operating System, or it might &quot;fake it&quot; using a borderless window mode. MapHub's overlay will work only in the latter case: without getting too technical, taking over draw calls of another executable might be considered a cheat by some anti-cheating software, and for this reason, our philosophy is to be unobtrusive, so a &quot;real&quot; fullscreen overlay won't work. MapHub doesn't give you any unfair advantage, as you can alt-tab or use a second monitor to view any map without MapHub. The drawback is that we cannot offer you an overlay over fullscreen games. MapHub works better on a dual-screen setup or by simply alt-tabbing a borderless windowed game. Always check your game's options to see if they offer a borderless windowed mode\u2014most of them do.<br><br><strong>Q: Can MapHub work without Steam?</strong>  <br><strong>A: </strong> No, the nature of the Steam Workshop API and Steam Lobby makes MapHub a Steam exclusive. We do not have plans to make a version stripped of such features.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2859460/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732893424","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2859460/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1732893424","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2859460/bea8ca0145f588fa679f5f297799a582688c7e7d/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732893424","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2859460/bea8ca0145f588fa679f5f297799a582688c7e7d/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732893424","categories":[{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"With MapHub, you can <strong>create</strong> your own <strong>lootmaps</strong> with key <strong>points of interest, categories, screenshot attachments, and quest tracking</strong> and join a new and exciting community!<br><br>MapHub has been built with native <strong>Steam Workshop Support</strong> and <strong>Steam Social Features</strong>: this means that you can share your maps with the community or browse maps made by other players, all from the comfort of an application designed for gamers, by gamers.<br><br>Invite your Steam friends into the MapHub lobby: <strong>coordinate with a built-in chat and shared drawing tools</strong>.
