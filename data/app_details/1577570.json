Every trapped dog requires some skill or knowledge to rescue. The more dogs you find, the more levels you can unlock.<br><br>There's lots of scary monsters trying to stop you from protecting your friends, but your bark blast will mow them down! We've included multiple costumes for you so you can fight in style.<br><br>Juno can't jump, so you'll be traversing levels by bouncing on springs.
