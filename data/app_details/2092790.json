Now the Wok cities are in ruins and the surviving inhabitants are hiding in caves. But at the moment when it seemed that the ancient civilization had come to an end, a group of young Woks decided to give one last fight. To do so, looking at the mighty machines of the humans, the Woks began to steal parts and assemble their own machines.
