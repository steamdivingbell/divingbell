No two levels are the same, no two game sessions are the same. As you progress through the levels you get to collect items for your inventory : weapons, shields, and dozens of other type items.

That's how you build your deck in this game: as you go. <br><br>When you encounter aliens, you will engage with them in a card-battle: Either you or the alien will choose the first card, depending on who attacks who. And then the other picks his card. Defeat the alien, and move on to the next!  Card battles are <strong>swift</strong>, and to the point. <br><br>The game will randomly generate <strong>events</strong>, <strong>alternate routes</strong> and decide what effects <strong>plant-spores</strong> have on you or the aliens.
