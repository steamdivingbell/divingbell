{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Description</h2>Reprise your role as a supernatural assassin in Dishonored 2. <br><br>Praised by PC Gamer as \u201cbrilliant\u201d, IGN as \u201camazing\u201d and \u201ca superb sequel\u201d, declared a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d by Eurogamer, and hailed \u201ca must-play revenge tale among the best in its class\u201d by Game Informer, Dishonored 2 is the follow up to Arkane Studio's first-person action blockbuster and winner of more than 100 'Game of the Year' awards, Dishonored. <br><br>Play your way in a world where mysticism and industry collide. Will you choose to play as Empress Emily Kaldwin or the royal protector, Corvo Attano? Will you make your way through the game unseen, make full use of its brutal combat system, or use a blend of both? How will you combine your character's unique set of powers, weapons and gadgets to eliminate your enemies? The story responds to your choices, leading to intriguing outcomes, as you play through each of the game's hand-crafted missions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2>Dishonored 2 is set 15 years after the Lord Regent has been vanquished and the dreaded Rat Plague has passed into history. An otherworldly usurper has seized Empress Emily Kaldwin\u2019s throne, leaving the fate of the Isles hanging in the balance. As Emily or Corvo, travel beyond the legendary streets of Dunwall to Karnaca, the once-dazzling coastal city that holds the keys to restoring Emily to power. Armed with the Mark of the Outsider and powerful new abilities, track down your enemies and take back what\u2019s rightfully yours.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Assassins </h2>As fully voiced characters, Emily Kaldwin and Corvo Attano now bring their own perspectives and emotional responses to the world and story. Use each character\u2019s set of powers, gadgets and uniquely-tuned weapons in creative ways as you explore the world \u2013 whether you fight your way through the city streets or sneak across the rooftops - and which enemies you decide to eliminate or spare. <br><br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Supernatural Powers</h2>Advanced bonecharm crafting and all-new upgrade trees allow you to customize your powers in vastly different ways. Become a living shadow to silently stalk your targets, link enemies so they share a common fate, or mesmerize your foes and dominate their minds. Choose from nearly infinite combinations of violence, nonlethal combat, powers and weapons to accomplish your objectives.<br><br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Imaginative World \t</h2>From the grimy, rat-infested streets of Dunwall to the lush, exotic coasts of a decaying Karnaca, immerse yourself in stylized locales created by Arkane\u2019s premiere art and narrative teams. The world is a character in its own right, rich with story, architecture and eclectic characters. It is also punctuated by signature mission locations, such as the Dust District, ravaged by dust storms and warring factions, and a madman\u2019s mansion made of shifting walls, deadly traps and clockwork soldiers. <br><br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Void Engine</h2>Dishonored 2 is beautifully brought to life with the new Void Engine, a leap forward in rendering technology, built from id Tech and highly-customized by Arkane Studios. Designed to support world-class art direction and take full advantage of the powerful hardware this generation has to offer, the Void Engine allows for significant advances to all game systems, including responsive stealth and combat Artificial Intelligence, lighting and graphical rendering, impressively dense urban environments, and story presentation.</li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Imperial Seal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/403640/02620037f426b657c0a610c9482483af71bf1067.jpg"},{"name":"Jewel of the South","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/403640/5ca017bc3e47ff0140858cce82dd9baa5fdcaa3e.jpg"},{"name":"The Beast Within","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/403640/12ea971b334eeb4f0660cf2044fc07a26228f276.jpg"},{"name":"Labyrinthine Mind","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/403640/db120f24438f05d7f08cc0c1ca9595d42ca2f138.jpg"},{"name":"A Night in 1849","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/403640/2003f207461d4e5d3163be89b0e3aa73635e6465.jpg"},{"name":"Spirit Thief","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/403640/0386e9bd1d5549ef2f7554888f55200eb8497648.jpg"},{"name":"Down with the Duke","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/403640/a30195bf9ce7210eaec7e2c453e7cad4b47c713f.jpg"},{"name":"The Greatest Gift","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/403640/55a4cb1afb189d57035740638ee95e5de06a9dc1.jpg"},{"name":"Freedom of Speech","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/403640/0d61186fe1ba89c10edfc2a672abf434cc2ae582.jpg"},{"name":"Morbid Theft","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/403640/14e202f83122803e5d5378e140450cb3ad3f3004.jpg"}],"total":50},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/403640/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726161101","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/403640/page.bg.jpg?t=1726161101","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/403640/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726161101","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/403640/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726161101","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play on Tablet","id":42},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":596060,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<h1>Free Bonus Content</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/403640/extras/Dishonored2_FreeUpdate_BlackandWhite.jpg?t=1726161101\" /><br><br>Logging in with your  account will get you the following new modes in Dishonored 2:<br><br><strong>Mission+</strong><br>Take a trip back in time to any previously completed mission from the campaign and experiment freely with all powers and weapons.<br><br><strong>Black and White</strong><br>Feeling moody?
