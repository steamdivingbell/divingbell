Her Vortex Breach IV is different in that, instead of making spells cast from it deal additional damage, it permanently increases the amount of damage that spell deals by 1 for the rest of the game. This effect can stack multiple times on the same spell. This breach also cannot be opened; it can only be focused. Xae also starts the game with a personal supply pile, the Vortex Deck, that only she can gain cards from. The Vortex deck contains 6 spells, one at each cost from 2-8, tiered in ascending order. Thus, she can only buy the least expensive spell. Once that spell is bought, she may ladder up and up.
