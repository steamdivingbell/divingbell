The closer you fly, the more energy you net!<br><br>-Fire your weapon while flying close to enemy fire and absorbing to perform powerful &quot;Risk Shots&quot;. Enemies destroyed by these powered up shots will turn into energy to power your shield. The best defense is a risky offense!<br><br>-Fly like an ace pilot and utilize Barrel Rolls to quickly cover vertical space &amp; modify your attack!<br><br>-Unleash the Barrier Breaker once the B-Meter is full to inflict huge damage on everything in sight!<br><br>-Playing for points is fun again as higher scores are awarded for explosive bursts of destruction and taking risks! Destroy multiple enemies at once and utilize &quot;Risk Shots&quot; to string together combos and increase your score multiplier!<br><br>-Experience different facets and paths to the story based on your performance and actions taken during missions!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Mission 1: S Rank","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/833950/233eaba43e693d4cf1d2c93a6be160791f3651b7.jpg"},{"name":"Mission 2: S Rank","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/833950/73e516c116e00a12313a673b6f19c3b361dc5097.jpg"},{"name":"Mission 3: S Rank","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/833950/504c0e95fc35bafaa1ae09fb7b90e66c754b1bc0.jpg"},{"name":"Mission 4: S Rank","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/833950/84d2ec80b70774aa49c09f83a0bd0027a4b6e2ce.jpg"},{"name":"Mission 5: S Rank","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/833950/ba6191f2ba1372d617913db4760a86a8032bc412.jpg"},{"name":"Mission 6: S Rank","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/833950/364e1ddd4d263757635830beb1229eb91358c008.jpg"},{"name":"Ending A","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/833950/820c1b300f38b775b0edb02404df4a384ceacba6.jpg"},{"name":"Ending B","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/833950/a830a472268074884497dc3881164158ffe7a661.jpg"},{"name":"Ending A All S Rank","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/833950/31c342e115e9a442cfb558a03138d98b01743108.jpg"},{"name":"Combo - 128x","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/833950/4e700e21b29dda0792668dfaa756e32a3cd7f974.jpg"}],"total":19},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/833950/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1614612590","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/833950/page.bg.jpg?t=1614612590","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/833950/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1614612590","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/833950/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1614612590","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h1>Digital Deluxe Edition</h1><p>The Deluxe Edition includes a digital concept art book and original soundtrack.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>In the distant future, humanity has discovered a method to replicate matter through the use of a Dimensional Gate.
