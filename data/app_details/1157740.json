{"about_the_game":"<strong><i>Iron Meat</i></strong> is a fast-paced, run-and-gun shooter that immerses players in a world overrun by The Meat--an all-consuming interdimensional biomass. With a mix of classic arcade and console mechanics, players will battle against mutated victims and machines, dodge bullet barrages, and crush bosses in nine levels of gore-ific brutality. As Vadim, fight back against The Meat and stop the terrors spawned from scientist Yuri Markov's experiments on the Moon.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1157740/extras/Iron_Mat_GIF_1_Run_and_Gun.gif?t=1733424742\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MULTI-PHASE BOSS FIGHTS</h2><i>Iron Meat</i> pays homage to classic run-and-gun titles from the past, with intense boss fights fixed into multiple phases.
