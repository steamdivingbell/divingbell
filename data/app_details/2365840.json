{"about_the_game":"Prepare for an immersion into a mildly cynical first-person-shooter experience with tower-defense and adventure gaming elements that unveils the true essence of corporate exploitation. Embark on a journey as an unwittingly indentured security associate on Mars, trapped in the clutches of a heartless megacorporation demanding you work for peanuts defending their assets while occasionally trying to kill you for the insurance money. Your role? Collect and defend dirt.  Literal, unadulterated dirt, from the ground. And before you assume there's a fun euphemistic meaning behind &quot;dirt,&quot; -- perhaps corporate espionage? -- nope, think again!; it's plain ol' dirt. Fancy, astronomically-priced dirt, sure, but it's still just dirt. Yet, don't let that dampen your spirits because the pay is nothing short of extravagant. You'll get a slice of the pie for every ounce of soil you muster forth.  Upon your triumphant return, assuming you survive, a generously meager fraction of your collected dirt's value will be transmuted into your earnings, and it will be a lot more than you'd ever have made on Earth.  Quite possibly surpassing the net worth of your entire hometown. If, against all odds, you survive the scant days it takes to clear your debt, and provided you don't splurge at the company's convenience store, Earth will welcome you back, a wealthy dreamer.
