{"about_the_game":"Erusal is a reading-heavy horror adventure game.  It is best experienced in a dark room, alone, while wearing headphones.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbandoned by your friends, you leave for the day to tear up a new part of the mountains on your quad bike. It feels good to be outdoors. The wind whipping past makes you feel alive. You weave between the sparse trees. Then, a harsh pain across your chest. There was a cable tied between those last two trees! The bike keeps going, but you are stopped mid-air. Then you fall into darkness. You wake up dazed. There is a woman outside digging...but digging what? It doesn't feel right. You have to get out of here!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDiscover the secrets of the town of Erusal, escape a horrible maniac, and get spooked by this epistolary horror.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/509230/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1471066564","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/509230/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1471066564","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/509230/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1471066564","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/509230/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1471066564","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"This story contains light descriptions and depictions of violent crime."},"detailed_description":"Erusal is a reading-heavy horror adventure game.
