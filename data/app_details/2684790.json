{"about_the_game":"<strong>William and Sly</strong> is a classic pair of platforming adventure Flash games. Play as the agile fox, Sly, assisting your closest friend William. These non-linear adventures are perfect for when you want to curl up on a rainy afternoon to explore gorgeous landscapes, take in hand-painted visuals and bask in its meditative soundtrack. The gameplay emphasizes ease of movement, with sleek platforming, and no fall damage.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">William and Sly</h2>In our introduction to this world, William's fantastic teleportation system has been deactivated, and it is up to Sly to fix it. Activate the stones, play around with mysterious fairyflies, and gather up mushrooms. The heart of the game is in exploration, venturing beyond the central task, and seeing what intriguing discoveries can be made in every corner of this sprawling landscape.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">William and Sly 2</h2>The troublesome gnomes have stolen and scattered the pages of William's journal! Alongside this main quest, you will discover shrines that offer up side quests and new abilities. Building off the serene, cozy gameplay of the original game, William and Sly 2 offers light puzzles to solve and more narrative touches to build up this world. But worry not, there are still plenty of mushrooms to munch and delightful secrets to uncover.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Bonus Game: The Everloom</h2>On high cliffs overlooking an open sky, a group of strangers is trapped in a shared dream. In this classic pixel art adventure from the golden era of Flash games, play as a boy caught in a tangled web of intrigue. Talk to characters to learn their stories and use the items they give you to find solutions to their problems.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Weather Mage","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2684790/4a9cef8f8646d55df9b91a4544c9d6e7552b31f3.jpg"},{"name":"Dominus Lux","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2684790/45081e907436c2e8d4aa29476abea1081df1055f.jpg"},{"name":"Sensitive Nose","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2684790/53dd99ade588e3fb0c332bbd14c7afcef0388e71.jpg"},{"name":"Deviation","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2684790/d4e86aacce5bb6698e1d84ea0d11aa2c3100b48a.jpg"},{"name":"Resolution","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2684790/d2651496ee1fb429ba44bab67226fbee886995dc.jpg"},{"name":"Flight","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2684790/899b51626caf12f79661de26f392406ae1331f9a.jpg"},{"name":"Sly Fox","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2684790/f437c3391b6078b021a8debafef853e6eff6dad7.jpg"},{"name":"Disillusioned","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2684790/8145e2d78475240583026880a00032d5c4029871.jpg"},{"name":"Dazed and Confused","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2684790/de04d0f903e1cea2d5429622fcafe2d51bfec91a.jpg"},{"name":"Happy Thoughts","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2684790/64dab97af6671a7c96bffd6bd32914abbbc3044b.jpg"}],"total":14},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2684790?t=1725398950","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2684790?t=1725398950","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2684790/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725398950","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2684790/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725398950","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>William and Sly</strong> is a classic pair of platforming adventure Flash games.
