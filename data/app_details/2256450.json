As a bodiless AI programmed for violence, you must play as the same enemies you fight against- weaving a path of indiscriminate (and ideally stylish) carnage through hordes of very quirky robots until your mysterious objective is reached. Switch control at a moment\u2019s notice between eight unique enemy types, each with a distinct moveset and playstyle, and their own arsenal of upgrades to unlock. In addition to a shooter, RAM is a frenetic real-time puzzle of planning who your next host will be, how to dispose of your current body once you are forced to abandon it, and which enemies would be best turned against which others to clear each room as efficiently as possible.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2256450/extras/Banner2.png?t=1732338920\" />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2256450/extras/VarietyReel.gif?t=1732338920\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Digital pets.
