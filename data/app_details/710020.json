{"about_the_game":"(Note: pre-release development on this project is on hold indefinitely.) STARCATCHER is an experimental wave-based arcade game, currently in development. It's simple, unique, and intensely hard. Protect the heart!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFEATURES<br />\r\n- Intense, single-screen arcade action<br />\r\n- Challenging skill-based gameplay<br />\r\n- A huge array of color-switching weapon+shield combos<br />\r\n- Unique design -- the heart is your hitpoint<br />\r\n- Pulsing, frenetic visuals and game speed<br />\r\n- Innovative and highly varied enemy waves<br />\r\n- Instant restarts<br />\r\n- Full controller support<br />\r\n- Local and online leaderboards<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGAMEPLAY<br />\r\nAs waves appear, your goal is to shoot enemies with your matching-colored gun (blue) and intercept shots with your matching-colored shield (yellow). Your character is invincible (no need to dodge), but if anything touches the heart, it's game over. It starts simple, but soon you will have to make complex choices and have fast reflexes to survive. Every few waves, you'll evolve, getting an all-new weapon and shield combo. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWEAPONS<br />\r\nMaster a wide array of weapons, each with its own drawbacks and advantages. Some, like the Laser and Rail, are piercing instant-hit weapons, others provide a wide areay or offer a fast fire rate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSHIELDS<br />\r\nEvery shield has a unique shield burst (performed by pressing Shield while jumping). Use them to clear screenfuls of bullets, erect a shield around the heart, or even hover and fly. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEXPERIENCE<br />\r\nEnter a trippy arcade world of giant voxel text and glitchy glowy lights. You will die, a lot, but instant restarts and non-resetting music keep the joy flowing.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/710020/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1537777555","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/710020/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1537777555","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/710020/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1537777555","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/710020/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1537777555","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"(Note: pre-release development on this project is on hold indefinitely.)
