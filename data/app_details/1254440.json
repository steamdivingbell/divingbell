{"about_the_game":"During a long trip, you get into an accident from which one of the residents of an abandoned, destroyed and overgrown village hundreds of years ago rescues you. When you wake up in the house, you will not be able to look around right away, poor eyesight is in the way, since the owner of the house left glasses on the bedside table. Having examined the surroundings, in addition to strange signs and frightening creatures, you notice: a forgotten camping site, an old gas station, a broken communications tower, an abandoned factory where residents used to work, and even a football field! However, the looters did their job, but still left some things that you will need to get out of here in various ways, until the creatures that settled these lands drove you crazy and killed you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn order to successfully leave the territory, you have to explore the location where you will find many puzzles: from entering code values to revealing mysterious symbols with what comes under your arm or foot: notes, objects, floor slabs. On the way you will come across hostile creatures with whom you should avoid contact. Depending on the actions, a new way will open up to leave the mystical place and it will not always be successful. Find the right chain of events and survive in Glasses Nightmare.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n\u00a0- 6 scenarios: uncover all the secrets of this place or try to leave in another way.<br />\r\n\u00a0- cunning enemies: even if you hid, they will try to find you.<br />\r\n\u00a0- many puzzles, solving which you will achieve your goals<br />\r\n\u00a0- free gas, you only need a canister!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"ChooChoomber","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1254440/9c0671c1f92a98e397c58d5e32a401915cab9cc9.jpg"},{"name":"Open sesame!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1254440/bab750b2f602c69818d0e49599d0220b4e354391.jpg"},{"name":"I've seen everyone","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1254440/c1f629d32af61cf8cb094f6e161b42e8d182efba.jpg"},{"name":"My regards","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1254440/7b4027655e168a628886121fc4d9166a7b8bdd4e.jpg"},{"name":"Something went wrong","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1254440/0f78627bd636ff595610faacf5913f4f37485e7c.jpg"},{"name":"Forrest Gump","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1254440/507ebb3e92f26180150e11ff7295cf70ec5b63ea.jpg"},{"name":"And you Brute!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1254440/c0b8be90e7b112ceaac3d55fab9e102df6cda8da.jpg"},{"name":"Boom!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1254440/adc382b76f3e3cd8a833a6807906dce4e34785de.jpg"},{"name":"Technological progress","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1254440/0ba3fb56a18e2da2fd59be083a2d4cc0e44f3e54.jpg"},{"name":"Technological error","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1254440/d4db10cadc2f88c7e64badcc43c63eb295d2b47c.jpg"}],"total":13},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1254440/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1584047859","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1254440/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1584047859","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1254440/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1584047859","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1254440/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1584047859","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"During a long trip, you get into an accident from which one of the residents of an abandoned, destroyed and overgrown village hundreds of years ago rescues you.
