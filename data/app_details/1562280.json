{"about_the_game":"Enjoy the joyfully bouncy Original Bamerang Soundtrack by Lucien Guy Montandon!<br><br>Check out Bamerang the game!<br><br><br><br>&quot;Finding the aesthetics for the Bamerang soundtrack was a challenging and enjoyable experience. I imagined those characters making music at the end of a long fight. How would their music sound and what kind of instruments do they play? There is a bit of an organic-esoteric influence, which stands for the culture of the characters. <br>And there is the world, which is very colourful, and that brought the pop in.
