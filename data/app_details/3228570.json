{"about_the_game":"Hop 'n' Marty is a retro 3D platformer for the modern age.<br><br>Journey through sprawling worlds, from the house of a giant to the desolate streets of a classic horror game. <br>Find all of the different collectables and meet the eccentric inhabitants of the each world. Some may even help you on your quest. <br>Rescue the captured pygmies who have been trapped in cages and bring them back to safety.<br>Each world in Hop 'n' Marty offers an entirely new style and new challenges to overcome, so there really is something for everyone.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Meet Hop and Marty</h2>You play as Marty, the white-tufted marmoset, and his pet, roommate, and general life advisor, Hop, the poison dart frog. On most days they can be found relaxing at home in the rainforest, but today is different. The pygmy marmosets have all been kidnapped by the heartless Captain Hookbeak. What he plans to do with them is not known, but it surely can't be good. Marty wastes no time in springing to action to return the pygmies home and put a stop to Hookbeak's plan. Hop is slightly more reluctant to get out of bed but still goes with him.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A return to the platformer golden age</h2>Inspired by the classic 3D platformers from the 90s, Hop 'n' Marty evokes the feeling of childlike joy that came with that era of gaming, both through its visuals and gameplay. The art of Hop 'n' Marty was made to the same specifications as classic 3D games and is rendered using the same resolution and lighting of that era (With HD options if you prefer a newer look). The gameplay pays homage to all the best 3D platformers that came before, as well as other classic games of other genres as a love letter to the era that got many people into gaming.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A colourful cast of characters</h2>Hop and Marty are not the only characters you'll meet. Every world has characters to discover, bursting with personality and charm. These NPCs can be spoken to and may even give you quests. With humorous and often sarcastic dialogue from our heroes and classic voice-mumble sound effects, every NPC is worth talking to and getting to know.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What's in this demo?</h2>This demo features a slightly adapted version of the full first world. Explore at your own pace and try to collect all 10 Pygmy Marmosets and 100 Bananas.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3228570/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727285482","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3228570/page.bg.jpg?t=1727285482","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3228570/38de061d206e589a741a6e4480c8628f9d007b7a/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727285482","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3228570/38de061d206e589a741a6e4480c8628f9d007b7a/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727285482","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Hop 'n' Marty is a retro 3D platformer for the modern age.<br><br>Journey through sprawling worlds, from the house of a giant to the desolate streets of a classic horror game. <br>Find all of the different collectables and meet the eccentric inhabitants of the each world.
