{"about_the_game":"A strategy about ecology, where players can capture territory and build different buildings; And the choice between green and polluting buildings is important and affects both the world and the interaction between players. If both players make mistakes, then the world dies and both players lose.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CAPTURE TERRITORY</h2>Buy neutral or enemy cells for the accumulated resources of money or influence. Surround the enemy or go to the other side of the map.

Adapt to your opponent's strategy. Build polluting, neutral, or cleaning buildings that use different resources: coal, oil, river flow, nuclear, sun, wind, fusion power, or hydrocarbon cleaning.<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES</h2>Upgrade technologies of different buildings. Use coal with less pollution for the world. Learn to obtain solar energy more profitably than coal. Cleanse the world with advanced hydrocarbon capture technologies.
