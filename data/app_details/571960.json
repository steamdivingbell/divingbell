{"about_the_game":"The Alaskan tundra is a harsh landscape with short summers and long, freezing winters. Most plants grow very low to the ground to withstand high winds, and many animals have white coats to blend in with snow during the wintertime. Despite its unforgiving climate, the tundra is still home to a wide variety of flora and fauna.<br><br>Twenty-three new species are being added including caribou, arctic bumblebees, polar bears, moose, arctic wolves, white spruce and cottongrass. In Tyto Ecology, players must think critically and problem-solve to balance their simulated biomes, including in the new Tundra, where their decisions determine if life succeeds or fails.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/571960/extras/Tundra_Banner.png?t=1482529534\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/571960/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1482529534","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/571960/page.bg.jpg?t=1482529534","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/571960/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1482529534","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/571960/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1482529534","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Alaskan tundra is a harsh landscape with short summers and long, freezing winters.
