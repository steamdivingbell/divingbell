{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>This is the demo version of Call of Elyndra. It doesn't yet have a lot of the features mentioned in the description, nor is it representative of the quality of the full version.

More details about the contents of the demo can be found below.</i></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fight, Farm, Discover!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Call of Elyndra combines action RPG gameplay with cozy farm mechanics. You will take control of the hero who had a prophetic dream, telling them to leave their country and go to Elyndra. And there will be a lot of work to do - currying favour with the locals, tending to your farm, and saving more than just Elyndra from an upcoming invasion will be no easy tasks! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3170230/extras/CoeGif2.gif?t=1734113020\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The story revolves around you becoming a part of the local community during a time when a war brews. You'll team up with 2 other adventurers, traverse varied lands, repel an invasion, and uncover the truth about the surrounding world. While you may not have what it takes from the get-go, you will grow alongside your companions and the community. You will also grow tomatoes, cucumbers, and such, for you will be given a plot of land to farm and support the people of Elyndra. This means that you can play the game any way you want - you can do both farming and adventuring or focus entirely on either of those! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3170230/extras/CoeGif5.gif?t=1734113020\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game combines the best of titles like the oldschool Zelda games with the likes of Stardew Valley while having its own style and identity.
