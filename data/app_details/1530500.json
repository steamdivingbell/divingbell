{"about_the_game":"With the best drivers at the wheel, the Audi Quattro A2 became a rally legend. It was a multiple winner of the Driver and Manufacturer World Championships at the start of the 80s, and impressed rally fans with its power and agility. Considered the Group B standard-setter, the technological revolution it spawned means that even today it remains a favourite amongst rally fans. The first car with 4-wheel drive and a Turbo engine, the result was an absolute beast! Driving this car in WRC 9 is a genuine challenge, just like in real life!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1530500/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1631779170","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1530500/page.bg.jpg?t=1631779170","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1530500/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1631779170","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1530500/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1631779170","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"With the best drivers at the wheel, the Audi Quattro A2 became a rally legend.
