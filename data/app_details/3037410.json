{"about_the_game":"Crush in your rainboots and hop into your boat! We are going fishing in Fish Idle 2: Underwater Mystery, a unique idle fishing arcade featuring smooth graphics and intuitive mechanics. We have no time to swing a fishing rod, so let\u2019s streamline the process!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SIMPLE AND EASY FISHING</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3037410/extras/GIF-5.gif?t=1731773198\" /><br>Let\u2019s start with the basics. It\u2019s all about automation: fish start biting as soon as you approach them, and resource indicators keep you informed while you focus on managing your Fish Kingdom effectively. The game offers advantageous upgrades to enhance your idle fishing abilities, helping you become a true fish tycoon. You\u2019ll still need to steer your boat to chase fish schools and avoid obstacles, so don\u2019t get too distracted by your economic prowess!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">UPGRADE YOUR FISH KINGDOM</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3037410/extras/quests_and_craft.gif?t=1731773198\" /><br>Once your hull is full, it\u2019s time to get upgraded! Improvements in fishing speed let you catch more and rarer species, while increased storage capacity allows you to hold more catches in your boat. Boost your boat\u2019s speed and defense for impact protection, and enhance your fishing rods to cast multiple lines at once. It\u2019s all about maximizing your gains in the most efficient way, so you\u2019ll have to use your head to figure out the best way to success!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MAKE IT BIG</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3037410/extras/GIF-1.gif?t=1731773198\" /><br>Just like in real life, becoming a fish tycoon involves various ways to profit from your catches. The Idle Fish Farm allows you to invest and get passive income, while the Black Market lets you upgrade your Fish Kingdoms beyond OSHA standards. The Bots Shop enables you to hire hunter, fisher, and cargo ships to fish and deliver catch for you, boosting your income. If day trading is your thing, there is a Currency Exchange that has some special benefits. Tax fraud is not a crime, it\u2019s an obligation if you want to make it big.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">NOW GO FISH</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3037410/extras/GIF-2.gif?t=1731773198\" /><br><strong>Get ready to dive into the Fish Kingdoms and become the ultimate fish tycoon in Fish Idle 2: Underwater Mystery!</strong>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"First Catch!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3037410/99c8627230a9fd74975e3ccef7a91954bb9db634.jpg"},{"name":"Casting Beginner","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3037410/318dff81c4a0b01f3bf1da45ba1db4c9abaacc8b.jpg"},{"name":"Smooth Sailor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3037410/58c499e49bb31fddf610bd8b0457e661d8dedd9f.jpg"},{"name":"Seasoned Angler","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3037410/e15c75e261a5082d88eac7804217fab60678df27.jpg"},{"name":"Master Fisherman","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3037410/bf0eeccac4f7d53ae6bdb8f7afebeac6e6183373.jpg"},{"name":" Ocean Explorer ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3037410/8f902dcad34761ad76f144351132b0890f3a2c61.jpg"},{"name":"Legend of the Seas","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3037410/d726f32ed4a97c93feebb42dcd913829546e267e.jpg"},{"name":"Sailor\u2019s Start","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3037410/084df2f3e06501fdb7c8ad5aafc462b781d2d6f6.jpg"},{"name":"Calm Waters ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3037410/be720cb3c696ac5ece5293b56e0047c863e6e318.jpg"},{"name":"Storm Chaser ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3037410/f7e1fd01257cc12a6e0b1b3371805087a44bdd4f.jpg"}],"total":30},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3037410/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731773198","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3037410/page.bg.jpg?t=1731773198","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3037410/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731773198","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3037410/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731773198","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3037680,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Crush in your rainboots and hop into your boat!
