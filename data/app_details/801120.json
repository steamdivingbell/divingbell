{"about_the_game":"Gustav Kirchhoff is annoyed because nobody appreciates his circuit laws! You get transported to his secret lair and won't be able to get out until you show mastery!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first-person game &quot;Kirchhoff's Revenge&quot; teaches the basic concepts of electrical circuits; players need to solve puzzles by assembling macroscopic circuit elements such as batteries, light bulbs, wires, volt meters, and ampere meters. These circuit elements snap together into functional, three-dimensional structures. Moving &quot;charges&quot; are indicated, so as opposed to real circuit elements, currents are visible. Puzzles increase in difficulty and complexity, while side rooms and pre-assembled circuits offer opportunities to learn new concepts. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame play is strictly based on solving puzzles, there are no dexterity or timed challenges. Once players succeed, they actually get a Schwarzw\u00e4lderkirschtorte, which they may dispose off as they see fit. The cake is not a lie.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game has been used in physics courses at the high school and introductory college level, and it is now made available as Early Access to the wider community.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/801120?t=1577841296","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/801120/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1577841296","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/801120/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1577841296","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/801120/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1577841296","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Gustav Kirchhoff is annoyed because nobody appreciates his circuit laws!
