{"about_the_game":"<strong>Random Raiders</strong> is a Guild Manager Simulator that puts you in charge of a newly-started raiding guild in the fictional MMORPG 'World of Guild Quest'. Recruit the best players you can find - balance their classes, volatile personalities and overcome the inevitable drama in order to become the best guild on the server.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Create a Guild</h2>Design a bitchin' banner by choosing a shape, icon, and colors in our banner editor. Name your guild Backstreet Boys. Change the name to something sensible. Hit the random button by mistake while letting out an audible puff of air in frustration. These are all features we provide.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Recruit your Members</h2>Sift through the applications to find what you need to take your guild to the next level. Need a patient priest that can dispel, played by some guy named Alejandro who lives in Burgos in Spain? We got you covered. Maybe recruit that loot-hungry tank, played by some girl named Frida from Svendborg in Denmark? Whatever floats your boat.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Go Raid!</h2>Send your team on raids to improve their skills and gear. Watch in horror as your team brutally fails against an obviously inferior boss because the main tanks' potato PC gave out in a critical moment.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Compete against the NPC Guilds</h2>Improve your standing on the leaderboards by killing more raid bosses. Kill enough bosses and you may even find yourself at the top, beating legendary guilds like Agitation Later, Aragon and Swahilum.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1305980?t=1591644462","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1305980?t=1591644462","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1305980/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1591644462","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1305980/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1591644462","categories":[{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Random Raiders</strong> is a Guild Manager Simulator that puts you in charge of a newly-started raiding guild in the fictional MMORPG 'World of Guild Quest'.
