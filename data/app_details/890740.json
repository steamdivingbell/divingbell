All commands can be entered by typing, while some more commonly used commands have been added to buttons to make general play a bit more pleasant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game features an intricate 5 act story-line full of wry humour, multi-enemy battles, boss fights, multiple quests and hidden post game content. While it is a text game, we've added images, a musical score, and sound effects to round out the experience and make it something we hope you will truly enjoy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur custom engine is fully moddable, with simple tools for budding creators to make their own adventures within any world they wish to create, the only limit is your imagination!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Mercy Killing","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/890740/53c6dce3c466748cfaa4e889effa1771d145dad4.jpg"},{"name":"Clumsy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/890740/6384be7a9e2e2e07a33c0b2cf83500b4f88a6e86.jpg"},{"name":"Cumberdale?!
