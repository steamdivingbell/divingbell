{"about_the_game":"Fractal Evolution is a 2D space exploration RPG with life simulation elements inspired by Conway's Game of Life.<br><br>You will explore a universe, fight monsters, and complete quests, with the ultimate goal of returning life to the universe in the form of single-celled creatures called Fractals. Each planet begins with just two unique fractals that breed with each other, and ultimately spawn a network of creatures competing for resources and constantly evolving. Study the evolution of these creatures and eventually gain items that allow you to engineer their genome. Every universe is unique, and runs on a non-deterministic simulation that follows two simple equations. One for physics, and the other for biology.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1504890/extras/explorePlanets.gif?t=1626274452\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1504890/extras/fightMonsters.gif?t=1626274452\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1504890/extras/Fractal_Evolution_GIF-downsized-3.gif?t=1626274452\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1504890/extras/Fractal_Evolution_GIF-downsized-2.gif?t=1626274452\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1504890/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1626274452","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1504890/page.bg.jpg?t=1626274452","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1504890/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1626274452","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1504890/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1626274452","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Fractal Evolution is a 2D space exploration RPG with life simulation elements inspired by Conway's Game of Life.<br><br>You will explore a universe, fight monsters, and complete quests, with the ultimate goal of returning life to the universe in the form of single-celled creatures called Fractals.
