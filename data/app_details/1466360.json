{"about_the_game":"A single-player adventure full of wonderful landscapes and beautiful musics for PC, it tells a deeply emotional story of a lovely friendship. Solve puzzles, sneak around creatures and use your spherical shield as your only protection. Attack using the same shield with speed, or by countering. <br><br><br>This shield protects you from incoming attacks. Anything inside will be safe, but most of the enemies deal enough damage with one strike to destroy it. Hopefully, it'll buy you enough time to escape and reach safety. <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1466360/extras/ShieldA1FullScreenSuperOptimized.gif?t=1692185471\" /><br><br><br>The dash can be used to dodge attacks, tho the creatures will be quite quick to strike so you better watch out ! <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1466360/extras/DashB3FullScreenSuperOptimized.gif?t=1692185471\" /><br><br><br>As you gain speed while holding the shield activated, the protection becomes an attack. The faster you go the more damage it deals so using your shield while going through boosters will help a lot fighting the creatures. Gravity can also be used to produce the same effect. <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1466360/extras/ShieldAttackA1FullScreenSuperOptimized.gif?t=1692185471\" /><br><br>After learning the Counter ability, as you activated your shield, an added sphere will  scale up. If you use the shield at the same time you get attacked, the Counter will be hit before the shield and you'll have successfully countered the attack. The energy of the incoming strike will be converted and transferred into a blast that'll deal damage to the nearby enemies. However you will loose enough energy in the process that you won't be able to use your shield until recovering using a crystal.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1466360/extras/ShieldCounterBlastA2FullScreenSuperOptimized.gif?t=1692185471\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1466360/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1692185471","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1466360/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1692185471","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1466360/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1692185471","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1466360/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1692185471","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A single-player adventure full of wonderful landscapes and beautiful musics for PC, it tells a deeply emotional story of a lovely friendship.
