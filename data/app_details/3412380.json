{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Generate music by creating a factory!</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Aster Symphona is a game about automating the production of materials and unknowingly creating interesting beats and even music. While playing, you will set miners to gather minerals and refine them with nearly 80 recipes. Each with their own sound and timing allowing for countless combinations.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Automate</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Mine the 6 mineral types, smelt their ores into ingots and transform them by rolling, pressing, and assembling. Aster Symphona's building design is set so that different pieces of the building are different inputs. This means that recipes are set by the order and placement of the materials in the buildings. No need to set recipes here!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Transport</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Move materials across asteroids with belts weaving between your buildings and factories or through buildings with short-range teleporters. Ship products large distances and between asteroids with trains.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Levels</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Every level is a puzzle. Complete each one by depositing the requested materials to the hub. The levels are self-contained, so mistakes and imperfections in your design will not cause problems later. Feel free to be as unique with your factory as you wish. Recipe ratios are important. But, by ignoring them you to create a sound special to your playthrough. The levels are designed to push your spacial problem solving. Needing for you to be compact with your factory design, getting harder with each level completed.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3412380/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737155590","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3412380/page.bg.jpg?t=1737155590","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3412380/84a89a358ad701e0f1a2008d58d2a59b31f745e9/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737155590","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3412380/84a89a358ad701e0f1a2008d58d2a59b31f745e9/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737155590","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Generate music by creating a factory!</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Aster Symphona is a game about automating the production of materials and unknowingly creating interesting beats and even music.
