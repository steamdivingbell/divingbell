{"about_the_game":"Your father descended into the catacombs to kill Death and claim eternal life. <br>He failed, and cut you out of his will, leaving everything to his cat.<br>Your revenge? Succeeding where he failed.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EXPLORE</h2>Delve into Death\u2019s domain and become strong enough to defeat him. But be cautious: the maze shifts every time, and the Reaper's scythe is never far behind you. Keep your lantern bright and full of oil to fend off the darkness.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CATCH, THROW, AND BASH</h2>You start every run as the fragile and fearful young poet, Samuel Durant. His cane can reflect projectiles, but it\u2019s barely strong enough to squash a spider. Luckily, he has a talent for catching, and by grabbing items, he can either use them or throw them at his foes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BUILD YOUR SKILLS</h2>By collecting and assembling your prayer beads, you get stronger, more agile, and more resilient. Powerful relics synergize and transform your strategy. But the most important ability will always be your skill as a player.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SLAY YOUR PREDECESSORS</h2>You aren\u2019t the only seeker who has ventured into Death\u2019s domain. Powerful Severed Souls who craved eternal life also dwell in the depths, becoming twisted by their desire. The regions they inhabit have warped to the shape of their hearts, and you\u2019ll have to watch out for unique traps and enemies that share their realms.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2935710/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730139572","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2935710/page.bg.jpg?t=1730139572","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2935710/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730139572","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2935710/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730139572","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Your father descended into the catacombs to kill Death and claim eternal life. <br>He failed, and cut you out of his will, leaving everything to his cat.<br>Your revenge?
