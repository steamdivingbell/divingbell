{"about_the_game":"A timeless classic with mechanics already known from beat 'em up's and mixed mechanics with other genres, including a parry system, for a more fluid gameplay! Familiar and unfamiliar places are part of this multiplayer  2.5D universe where present-past-future times intertwine while an exciting narrative unfolds to prevent the end of time itself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nREPROACH OR APPROACH?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWithin the traditional gameplay of a beat 'em up, we implement a new mechanic to the genre. We can Parry an attack and choose if we continue to beat 'em up or flee for a moment and wait to rethink our strategy. Because the enemies have different patterns, we have to know when it's time to be aggressive or take advantage of a mistake they make. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE TIME AND TRAVELS <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe have 10 different stages to beat. Each of them has unique boss battles in different time periods, and one after another, we know more about Stout's journey through awesome cutscenes. The main goal of the game is to close time rifts and rendezvous with the rest of the gang to discover what happened and what caused all this mess. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWho is right in this situation?
