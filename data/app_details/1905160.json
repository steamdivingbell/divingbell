{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dudelings: Arcade Sportsball</h2>&quot;What if you crossed Pong with foosball?&quot; That's the age-old question we set out to answer with <i>Dudelings: Arcade Sportsball.</i><br><br>Along the bottom of the playfield are a series of neutral characters (let's call them <i>&quot;Dudelings&quot;</i>). Up to two players cycle through these Dudelings during a match, controlling one at a time. Dudelings under player control can jump, dash, and punch their way to victory.<br>Use your Dudeling to control the ball, defend your goal, and go on the offensive!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Arenas</h2>There are six arenas in Dudelings (five standard and one unlockable).
