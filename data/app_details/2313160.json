{"about_the_game":"<strong>Hodgepodge Hunch</strong> features a new kind of gameplay in which you'll cook up ingredients you've collected all while conversing with other characters to find out just who the traitor is. Up to four players can join in at a time, but if you're short on players, never fret\u2014you'll be joined by trusty (or not-so-trusty) CPUs. No need to worry about how many players you've assembled, unlike board games. You're sure to enjoy this who-done-it game either way.<br><br>Hodgepodge Hunch is a who-done-it game where everyone chips in to make a hotpot dish. Collaborate with your buddies to collect ingredients in the dungeons and whip up a delicious feast. There's just one problem... A backstabber may be lurking among you who'll throw your dinner plans awry... Find out who it is while making the dish of your dreams!<br><br><strong>Game Rules:</strong><br>Players are divided into one of two groups: the Staff and the Spies. Each group works to fulfill certain conditions to win. The Staff\u2019s goal is to cook a delicious hotpot, venturing into dungeons to collect ingredients and charms that, when combined, have the potential to generate high scores. Staff can also \u201cban\u201d other players to protect the final product, reducing the number of ingredients they can put into the pot. The Spy\u2019s job is to thwart the Staff\u2019s efforts. Certain ingredients are forbidden from the pot, or else the dish will transform into a dreaded Hodgepodge. The Spy\u2019s goal is to sneak these forbidden ingredients into the pot without raising suspicion from the Staff. The Spy can also spread false rumors to make the Staff suspicious of each other.<br><br><strong>CPUs and Solo Mode:</strong><br>Hodgepodge Hunch features CPUs that can join in the game, so no need to worry about having enough players\u2014an all-too-common issue with who-done-it games.
