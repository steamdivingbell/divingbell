Choose a key and a scale to quickly change the way a sequence sounds.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Relative Signals</h2>Carry MIDI data across multiple pathways with relative assignments for every attribute a Point object may have, such as MIDI Note, Channel, Velocity, Duration, and more. Good for ascending sequences and arpeggios.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Support For Other Operating Systems</h2>Midinous is being developed in a cross-platform framework that will allow it to run on either Linux or Mac operating systems as well as Windows.
