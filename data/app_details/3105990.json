In The Territory of Egg 2, I have incorporated this feedback to upgrade the gameplay, further enhancing the strategic elements and build diversity. Additionally, I have introduced powerful Heroic Eggs, more new skills, and new enemies. For the visual effects, I partnered with a collaborator to fully improve the art, making the gaming experience more comfortable. In terms of content, the The Territory of Egg 2 features even more new levels than the Generation 1, with each level offering multiple difficulty modes for players to challenge. I hope these changes will provide a better experience, and I look forward to receiving more suggestions and feedback from you.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3105990/extras/\u82f1\u7075\u9f50\u805a_\u5171\u536b\u738b\u56fd_en.png?t=1728635348\" /><br><br>In addition to building the 6 basic eggs and 20 advanced eggs from the original &quot;The Territory of Egg&quot;, you can also awaken 6 types of Heroic eggs with different skill traits on the map.
