In classic Roguelike fashion, you explore random rooms, fight different creatures and upgrade your equipment along the way. Death is part of your journey, so don't give up, learn the ball control and the synergies to successfully move forward through the dark depths of the underground.

Leverage the angles and layout of the rooms as well as the behavior of the different enemy types to create a barrage of violence.
