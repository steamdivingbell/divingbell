{"about_the_game":"Quantism is a learning program for everyone who is interested in chemistry. The subjects range from chemical symbols and safety, all the way to complex chemical behavior and even history. The software is perfect for total amateurs or beginners, but also for professionals who want an easy-access software to revise their knowledge. All of the topics are ordered in a logical and structural way. At the end of each chapter, there is a test. If you pass this test successfully, the badge of that topic will light up on your profile. After a certain amount of chapters, there will also be an exam. The amount of content in each exam roughly corresponds with one year of chemistry at school (science option). Our goal is to explain everything as simple as possible, we don\u2019t hide our content behind complex words. Chemistry is really interesting and essential and we truly hope to bring it to more people through this educational software.
