{"about_the_game":"Rogue Realms is a major expansion to Hero\u2019s Hour, focusing on the wilderness and untamed lands - and the strange creatures, cults and societies that live there. For every great empire with a shiny crown, a downtrodden rogue realm lies in wait, looking for an opportunity to stake its claim.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The new Rogue faction<br></li><li>67 new units<br></li><li>24 new heroes<br></li><li>12 different towns<br></li><li>28 new skills for heroes new and old<br></li><li>A new set of units for each of the 12 factions<br></li><li>25 new town buildings for various factions<br></li><li>New war-machines, new map types, and more</li></ul><br>The Rogue faction is like no other - it represents the neutral creatures, combining new and old to form 12 bands, each of which has their own heroes, unit lineups, and special skills.

These changes include buildings such as the Summoning Circle, available to Pyre, Tide and Delirium players, which allows you to create units depending on what spells you know. There is also a new unique building for each of Arcane, Pyre, Horde, Tide, Earthen, Pillar and Delirium, which gives impactful passive bonuses, such as gaining elementals when picking up ore on the overworld map, or gives experience whenever you lose units.<br>Finally, Rogue Realms adds in a lot of new hero skills. Some of these skills fit neatly within old playstyles, while others require you to think up new strategies - such as the Avatar skill, which gives you permanent elemental units whenever you cast a spell - but only if you already have other skills that make you good at casting that element of spells - such as the old Pyromancy skill, or the new Fire Heart skill.<br>In full, Rogue Realms aims to offer a new way to play - both with the strange new faction, and for each of the old factions.
