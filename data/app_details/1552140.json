A peerless archer. The one person in the dungeon with any common sense...?!<br>Shuuran may be known by many names, but of all her myriad guises and duties, none is more important to her than her role as her sister\u2019s keeper.<br><i>\u201cHow about a drink, my sister?\u201d \u201cSister, allow me to give you a back rub.\u201d \u201cA funny thing happened to me today, Sister.\u201d</i><br>Some theorize that her very overprotectiveness is what rendered her sister so reckless and unrestrained, but that theory doesn\u2019t bother Shuuran.<br>Her sister is happy, after all\u2014and if Shunran is happy, then her little sister is happy as well. She has some sympathy for the human Shunran has grown fond of, but sees him as a necessary sacrifice.<br>In this way, she\u2019s as selfish as Shunran herself.<br><br><i>\u201cLet me start by apologizing for my sister.\u201d</i><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552140/extras/chara07_eng.png?t=1724986055\" /><br><strong>Renfa</strong> <i>(Voice: Kazane)</i><br>TYPE: Human / JOB: Hero (Adventurer)<br><br>Even in this demon-queenless age, a hero has still risen to... hold down the fort. Renfa, a hero with no great foe to slay, has instead made a career as an adventurer.<br>Just one woman, fighting monsters with her friends, coping with a hopeless manga addiction.<br>It isn\u2019t the glorious battle like her ancestors got, but it\u2019s a living. It\u2019s been a thousand years since the Demon Queen was around, so her family has had the time to get used to it.<br>Naturally, Renfa hasn\u2019t been slacking. Adventuring keeps her sword sharp and her muscles honed, just in case.<br>The manga situation is similar, actually. She\u2019s preparing, preparing a vast library of vicarious experience, just in case she ever needs to engage in romance herself.<br>Even as the Demon Queen\u2019s resurrection approaches, Renfa circulates through the comic shops of the land, hunting for the next addition to her fearsome arsenal of fandoms...<br><br><i>\u201cAs the hero, I cannot permit the Demon Queen to exist.\u201d</i><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552140/extras/chara08_eng.png?t=1724986055\" /><br><strong>Shaoren</strong> <i>(Voice: Minami Hokuto)</i><br>TYPE: Human / JOB: Panda Rider (Adventurer)<br><br>This girl has the blood of a hero in her veins, but in her chest beats a heart that wants to be free! Of course, her big sister is the hero and she\u2019s a free spirit too, so nobody has raised any complaints in particular.<br>Shaoren rides astride her panda, going where she will. <i>\u201cOoh, what\u2019s that over there? That looks fun,\u201d</i> is usually all the motivation she needs. <i>\u201cOoh, a new dungeon? Sweet! That looks so cool,\u201d</i> is enough to keep her entertained, and entertainment is enough to keep her happy.<br>Will meeting Kazuto inspire a change in her...? No, probably not. She is who she is, and that\u2019s what makes her great.<br>That said, one does have to question what exactly is wrong with that \u201chero\u2019s bloodline.\u201d If it\u2019s supposed to produce duty-bound champions of the light, it\u2019s not exactly working so great...<br><br><i>\u201cI\u2019m an adventurer, and you\u2019re not my mom!\u201d</i><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552140/extras/chara09_eng.png?t=1724986055\" /><br><strong>Minmei</strong> <i>(Voice: Ichigo Momoi)</i><br>TYPE: Human / JOB: Odd Jobs (Adventurer) (Thief)<br><br>Minmei is the upstanding kind of thief, not the kind who goes around stealing stuff!<br>When you sign up at the Adventurer\u2019s Guild, you get a survey:<br>- Are you light-footed? <i>(YES!)</i><br>- Do you have quick fingers? <i>(YES!)</i><br>- Can you hide your presence? <i>(YES!)</i><br>The results are in, and voila, you\u2019ve been branded for life as a Thief!<br>Sounds unfair, right? But I got used to it! Minmei will say, or she would if you asked her, but you won\u2019t, because none of this matters.<br>When we introduce Minmei, it\u2019s not about the fluff text\u2014it\u2019s about the furballs!<br>Minmei is an admirer, an acolyte, an aspiring apostle at the feet of her gods: Cats in general.<br>She fights for feline-kind! She grows cat ears sometimes, plus a tail!

Hobby or not, she could never permit it!<br>Shishun comes before Kazuto as an avenger, the long arm of the law come to judge his crimes. Unfortunately, she comes before Shuuran too... so that\u2019s not going too well for her.<br>It\u2019s a knock-down, drag-out brawl for the ages!
