{"about_the_game":"Time for some serious clutch-kicking sideways action with 4 epic Japanese rides soaked in tradition, legacy, and pure tail- and elbows-out fun. Become one with the \u201cHachiroku\u201d, the one and only 1985 Toyota Sprinter Trueno GT Apex (AE86); win it all with the unconquerable 2002 Nissan Silvia (S15) Spec R Aero; and find glory with Nissan\u2019s legendary \u201cZ\u201d cars - the 2020 Nissan 370Z, and the 2021 Nissan Z Proto, months before its official debut.

In the European Touring Cars Championship, it beat everything the world could throw at it for four consecutive seasons. In Japan, it became the go-to ride for the street-racing \u201chashiriya\u201d crowd. And in the hands of the \u201cDori-Kin\u201d, it defined the sport of drifting forever. Power, poise, performance: an icon of motorsport.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- 2002 Nissan Silvia (S15) Spec R Aero + Race Conversion<br />\r\nWith a 6-speed manual and limited-slip\u2019 diff, this Nissan may have become a drift legend with no less than seven D1 championships, but at heart, it remains a potent circuit racer. The Nissan Silvia S15 dominated the All-Japan Touring Car Championship in the early \u201900s and, upgraded, remains a force in club racing around the world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- 2020 Nissan 370Z + Race Conversion<br />\r\nIt\u2019s time to experience the thrill of the legendary Z. Half-a-century of race-won pedigree comes to the 2020 Nissan 370Z, with its world-first SynchroRev Match that auto-blips for performance-orientated downshifting, the fourth gen 3.7L V6 pushing 332hp to the rear wheels at a screaming 7,000rpm, and a 55/45 weight bias that shifts to an almost impeccable 50/50 when you nail the throttle. Lightweight, quick, and everything you\u2019d ever want from a \u201cZ\u201d.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Nissan Z Proto + Race Conversion<br />\r\nGet into the new Z generation months before its release into the world. Simulated for Project CARS 3, the new Nissan Z Proto has all the visceral cues of epic Z-design - long hood, short rear deck, and wheels pushed out to the corners. The Nissan Z Proto stays true to its DNA and then adds a modern twist to its iconic styling and comes with an all-new twin-turbo 3L V-6 and manual 6-speed box. The Z has always been about the intimate connection of driver to machine.
