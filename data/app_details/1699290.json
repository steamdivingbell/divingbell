{"about_the_game":"Cult of Personality is social deception game for 2-8 players that bends the rules of what players can see, do, and hear... In life, and death! <br><br>Your cult's goals are to complete a forbidden ritual and summon your deity to bring about the end times! However, some of your would be cultist pals have been disillusioned from your cult's enchantment, and will do everything in their power - especially cold-blooded murder - to stop you!<br><br><strong>Now with Multiple Gamemodes!</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Ritual</h2>For 5-8 players, The Ritual is a classic social deception mode with some twists! You play as a Cultist - working together with your Cult to complete the ritual, or a secretly selected Defector - using deception, combat, and the power of <i>possession</i> to stop them!<br><br><strong>Trials</strong><br>to complete the ritual, you'll be tasked with group &quot;trials&quot; that must be completed by working together. Complete the trials (involving the occasional blood sacrifice), then finish the ritual in darkest depth of the castle.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>A simple but effective directional combat system takes the place of voting and Insta-kill in Cult of Personality. Defectors must catch Cultists unaware for the kill, and if you're suspicious that one of your fellow cultists isn't devoted to the cause, take action and attack!<br><br><strong>Possession</strong><br>The game doesn't end once you enter the great beyond! As a ghost, you can possess objects and NPCs around the map to help complete the ritual, or kill the remaining Cultists to stop it. As a Defector you can even possess living players; making them attack peers, or sabotage the ritual to cast doubt on their allegiance...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hide &amp; Seek</h2>For 2-4 players, Hide and Seek is a less socially intense arcade mode. Players take turns being the seeker, while the rest of the lobby hides. The seeker must find (and kill) all the hiders before the timer runs out. If they manage to kill everyone, they win the round. If not, all the hiders win. The first player to reach a score limit wins the game!<br><br><strong>Other Features</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> light-based Visibility - In fire or torchlight, player color and names are visible, but stray into the darkness, and only silhouettes can be seen.
