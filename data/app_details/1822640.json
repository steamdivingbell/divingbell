Combat is resolved using your Rogues primary stat and a D10. If the two combined are greater than the monsters combat stat, your Rogue hits the monster. If it's less, the monster hits your Rogue. If equal, both are hit. Damage can be negated by discarding an armor or by playing a skill or magical item. Potions and food can be consumed at any time to increase your health and prevent your death. Some monsters have a weakness to specific thematic loot and are vanquished immediately such as when the Medusa gets a look at her face in the mirror's reflection.
