Our objective is to create a cozy farming game for busy students and working professionals to play while going about their daily routines and responsibilities. The game revolves around using a Pomodoro Timer - a technique where a person sets a goal to focus for 25 minutes, and then break for 5 minutes, allowing for them to stick to a schedule and improve their concentration. This may be especially beneficial to those with ADHD, that thrive off gamifying chores and tasks.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">PacaPomo provides rewards for completing Pomodoro Timers by progressing time on the farm and giving Sol - a currency solely used for adopting new alpacas and expanding the farm. New alpacas are unique, bespoke characters that have different personalities and stories. They are acquired randomly through adopting from the Alpaca Sanctuary, giving players a sense of excitement for each new addition to their farm.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Players are allowed to choose from a slider their focus and break times (25 - 150 minutes for focus, 5 - 30 minutes for break) and the rewards scale according to amount of time completed. We also have advanced options like adding long breaks, auto-switching to the next Pomodoro, and plan to add more features to our pomodoro to allow for as much player freedom and ease of use. There is also a report card that tracks daily, weekly, and monthly progress.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">After completion of a Pomodoro work session, crops will grow, new Alpacas can be adopted, and the occasional event pops up for interaction. There are also terraces on the farm, which can be unlocked using PacaPomo's currency which allow the player to expand their play space and unlock new mechanics and features - some include an orchard, a training gym, and a pond. We will continue developing the game past launch to add more activities, Alpaca characters, and farm progression, which will offer players engagement long-term.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In today's fast-paced world, many struggle to balance work, responsibilities, and leisure time.
