My name is Rodrigo and I am the developer of Shadows of Kepler. You may not know it, but the production of Shadows of Kepler is stopped. It's stopped until I have the money to bring back a good team to finish the game. The programmer of Shadows of Kepler used the C ++ language. Due to my limitations in that part, I was unable to continue the production. On the other hand I started a new game in January 2020, this time a solo project called Parallel, the production is going very well and you can check out some gameplays and trailers on YouTube, I also did a Steam page. <strong>With your support in this new game, after the launch I believe I can bring Shadow of Kepler's team back.</strong> The guys are amazing and I was really sad that I didn't have the money to keep them working. They all have other responsibilities and roles, but for me game development is my main goal in my life. For me there is no happiness if I am not thinking of doing something nice to make people have fun. I hope you understand my point. if you want to help me and help Shadows of Kepler, I ask that you follow the Parallel videos on YouTube and add the game to your Steam wish list. I'll put the links here. <strong>Do not lose faith on Shadows of Kepler, because I will work with game development for the rest of my life and Shadows of Kepler has great potential to be a good game. I just need to have the right conditions and make it happen.</strong> Thanks<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1121510/extras/parallelworld.png?t=1691040031\" /><br><br>Website: <br><br><br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1121510/extras/EN-horror-game-PATCH.png?t=1691040031\" /><br><br>Hello guys, let's take a look to the latest news.
