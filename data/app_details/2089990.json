{"about_the_game":"<br>Dash is a small fox born in dark Riddle Wood forest. In the game you get into his role of a teenage forest guardian who is always up to something crazy. He sticks his nose to literally anything, that is out of normal. One day he discovers a secret base of three pigs that lived in the same forest for years. His brain immediately invents tons of theories and he's keen enough to uncover their secret business. At first he thinks he is a normal fox living in a normal forest with basic pigs, but what he discover, will blow his mind. Take Dash on an unforgettable journey through the Riddlewood and expose the three &quot;little&quot; pig's true identity. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2089990/extras/dash_jump_platform2.gif?t=1731138987\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Discover multiple locations in the forest, even those, that were hidden from the rest of the forest animals.<br></li><li>Jump and smack enemies<br></li><li>Solve hidden Riddlewood mysteries<br></li><li>Race and run<br></li><li>Enjoy the minecart ride<br></li><li>Discover and try new game mechanics<br></li><li>Explore open world locations with free play<br></li><li>Take the pig's business down<br></li><li>Play in Day &amp; Night sceneries<br></li><li>Watch dialogues and cutscenes to reveal the forest truth<br></li><li>Collect Fir Cones and gems</li></ul><br>All images, graphics, gameplay mechanics and other in-game content are subject to change and does not represent final product.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2089990/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731138987","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2089990/page.bg.jpg?t=1731138987","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2089990/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731138987","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2089990/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731138987","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<br>Dash is a small fox born in dark Riddle Wood forest.
