Recalling the games I've played before, the combination of horror and puzzle elements was very appealing to me, which inspired the idea to create this game. This is my first game to be released, and I've put a lot of effort into it. Although it's an indie game, I strive to provide players with a &quot;refined&quot; experience. Due to my limited experience, there may still be shortcomings in the game. I hope everyone can offer suggestions, and I will consider them and continuously improve the game.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3047090?t=1739876270","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3047090?t=1739876270","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3047090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739876270","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3047090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739876270","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Overview</h2>A horror game supporting up to 4-player online co-op.<br>Players will become Ghost Exorcists, accepting ghost report commissions and traveling to various locations to carry out their exorcism duties.
