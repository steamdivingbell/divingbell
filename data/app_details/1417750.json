{"about_the_game":"It's tough farming on an ever-changing mountain - when the mists roll in, everything disappears! Still, the mountainside has good soil and its twisty trails hold treasure and secrets. Use your skill at farming, crafting, and alchemy to hold back the vanishing mists. When they inevitably arrive, return to the abandoned village of Oncewas with your goods. As you rebuild it, the returning villagers will unlock new upgrades and powers for future farms.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Skill-based Farming</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1417750/extras/planting_zoomed_optimized.gif?t=1690596007\" /><br>The peculiar crops that grow on Moondrop are particular plants. They must be matched up with their neighbors in order to flower and flourish. Exotic plants will warp across the farm, clone themselves, or eat neighboring crops. A farmer who can wrangle these weird and wily crops will make a substantial profit. The famously finicky mistberry is difficult to grow, but it will hold off the vanishing mists and keep the farm in place for a few more days.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Explore a Shifting Landscape.</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1417750/extras/lanterns_v4.gif?t=1690596007\" /><br>Every hike up the misty mountain offers a new trail to explore.

Return to the mountainside and begin anew. Use the knowledge you've learned and the seeds that you've earned to build a better farm.
