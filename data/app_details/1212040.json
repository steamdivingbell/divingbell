Sadie has to juggle between guiding her dogs to be normal human beings while also going through a breakup and looking for a job.  The main strength of the storytelling is dialogue. Dark humor and sarcasm are peppered throughout the game, even on Sadie\u2019s monologues.\u201d<br>Bishie Holic<br><br>\u201cThe humor in this game is top-knotch and has the right balance of absurdism and down-to-earth character interaction that, despite the premise, I never felt disconnected from the journey.
