{"about_the_game":"RUINED is an exploration-centric RPG inspired by old-school NES legends!<br><br>Each day, you wake up to a world swarmed with monsters. As you explore and defeat enemies, the day will pass and night will come. But, it will never go. The morning only comes when you go back to sleep, or die. As the night progresses, more and more monsters will appear growing stronger and stronger. However, you are not alone in this world. Every enemy in the game drops seeds that allow you to grow identical monsters, except fighting with you rather than against you! Seek out the most powerful monsters in the world and defeat them so they join your side against the onslaught! Forge your army, explore the mysterious mountains to the north, and find why the world is RUINED!<br><br>WARNING: RUINED is not for the faint of heart! This world does not come with a minimap during the journey, or any map for that matter! There is no explicit tutorial or a marker showing where to go.
