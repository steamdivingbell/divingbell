{"about_the_game":"The most popular blocks fall down game of all time now in retro VR room. Play it with keyboard or game controller.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrepare for the retro blocks, geometric shapes composed of four square blocks each. A random sequence of blocks fall down the playing field . The objective of the game is to manipulate these block object, by moving each one sideways and rotating it by 90 degree units, with the aim of creating a horizontal line of ten units without gaps. When such a line is created, it disappears, and any block above the deleted line will fall. When a certain number of lines are cleared, the game enters a new level. As the game progresses, each level causes the blocks to fall faster, and the game ends when the stack of blocks reaches the top of the playing field and no new blocks are able to enter. Some games also end after a finite number of levels or lines.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/660820/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1499744645","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/660820/page.bg.jpg?t=1499744645","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/660820/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1499744645","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/660820/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1499744645","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"The most popular blocks fall down game of all time now in retro VR room.
