{"about_the_game":"Moscow: somewhere in the near future. The city and perhaps the Earth's surface has turned into a radioactive ash. Survivors are living a savage lifestyle: they kill each other, they rob each other, they eat and rape each other (sometimes both at the same time). Those who decided that they could not exist in such conditions began to live under the ground. \u201cThe underground people\u201d is how they referred to themselves and you are one of them. The times have changed and it is time for you to make your own journey into the big world. The biggest problem is that the people on the surface do not know about your existence. They have heard about \u201cunderground people\u201d, but they consider those rumors to be fiction. Your objective is to prove to them that you do indeed exist and that you also possess the ability to adapt to the extreme conditions of the wild radioactive desert. Moreover, you will be responsible for provisioning your fellow brothers and sisters, who are staying underground. <br />\r\nFeatures of the game include:<br />\r\n-Enjoyable retro-graphics <br />\r\n-A post-apocalyptic theme<br />\r\n-Extremely detailed characters <br />\r\n-A cozy bar as a location <br />\r\n-A unique system of character development; you write it yourself and it is applied to your adventures. <br />\r\n-Mercenary-girls that will help you during your journey <br />\r\nAnd a lot more.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"A smart purchase","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/513230/9a1383ffd12ab2a4429e1db94b7e0fdf119c5aaf.jpg"},{"name":"Pau-chika-pau-pau","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/513230/cd190c81dfd80335100ee77b2416a13b439f97e9.jpg"},{"name":"Filthy animal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/513230/fd20e169e0ab310a683590401bfe3ba15067222f.jpg"},{"name":"Tolerance","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/513230/9588c922fa943cb3895b795efbaa066e66f9415b.jpg"},{"name":"It\u2019s a Trap!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/513230/eb2214b7ae6c457ea3bccca356b8e4d2e39b6913.jpg"},{"name":"Multicultural","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/513230/e2c85cac959e768a0a5cc8376caba1d26b4bd075.jpg"},{"name":"Asian fury","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/513230/90437ee38ea235ff6305866a825537a3d985dc18.jpg"},{"name":"Bipolar disorder","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/513230/2b6fda0a99a14f162f63c8bdea51b9c2293751bd.jpg"},{"name":"Never thought that I'd see the San Francisco again","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/513230/2d9c22b1067d71df316e3da888aa28341131698b.jpg"},{"name":"Ineducable","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/513230/b728b78518f5a7375106200f2e8d20eae97a5867.jpg"}],"total":28},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/513230/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1664658842","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/513230/page.bg.jpg?t=1664658842","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/513230/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1664658842","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/513230/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1664658842","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Moscow: somewhere in the near future.
