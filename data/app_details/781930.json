{"about_the_game":"Count Dookie is out spreading farts everywhere. You are the town sheriff who has the Dookie's weakness - a flashlight! Shine the light on him to make him go away. Unfortunately, he seems to keep coming back every night. What a nightmarish job, but you can handle it. Right, Sherif?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore each playthrough, you spin the Wheel of Dookie. This will change the dynamic of each play. Sometimes, there will be more farts. Sometimes, there will be extra moonlight - allowing you to see the Count much easier. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery night it is your job to patrol the outskirts of town for anything harmful to the people. Count Dookie appears every night. He is a very slippery opponent and doesn't want you to catch him. Every time you go to flash your light on him and miss, he will waddle away. If you land a direct hit with your flashlight, he will dry up and be gone for the night. Each time you attempt to use your flashlight, it will use some of your battery. If your battery runs out, then you will lose and won't be able to stop the Count for the night. The battery does recharge slightly over time. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a great game for someone looking to spend a few minutes trying to catch the Count, and doesn't require the player to be engaged for hours at a time.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"1st time getting the Count","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/781930/162447f6015bdf9b8fab987502eb83372d75458b.jpg"},{"name":"2nd time getting the Count","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/781930/f7d7b680d8a14035c3f9403e40bdfc9456851f25.jpg"},{"name":"3rd time getting the Count","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/781930/a1a7fc32960029298f90c15f583a583bbce8a36b.jpg"},{"name":"4th time getting the Count","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/781930/a22be02004f4b520574b4caf47adafc771532763.jpg"},{"name":"5th time getting the Count","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/781930/2ffd16ece6f43128417495f6e2c83ed62b049362.jpg"},{"name":"10th time getting the Count","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/781930/e939e22466a6d32c2d6d09b683911cad5e2d6c29.jpg"},{"name":"15th time getting the Count","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/781930/17113843fc0c0a682ae545285ddbb8af0e622854.jpg"},{"name":"20th time getting the Count","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/781930/b2f728b671930a517ea299e8d118b28eaafb1462.jpg"},{"name":"25th time getting the Count","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/781930/5d814348cdb068164814cd5c53979017cfb45433.jpg"},{"name":"30th time getting the Count","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/781930/669216980cb13dd91adc23b4133ae05fb8f36765.jpg"}],"total":19},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/781930/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1520252673","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/781930/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1520252673","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/781930/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1520252673","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/781930/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1520252673","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Count Dookie is out spreading farts everywhere.
