{"about_the_game":"About Utopia: It is a game that plays with a view that looks down on the 2D top view. You can avoid the incoming enemy's ammunition by moving and sliding, and handle the enemy by matching your attack with the enemy. The goal of the game is to strengthen the character and achieve the reconstruction of the final Utopia Island by eliminating the boss at the end of the dungeon to complete the main quest and the auxiliary quest with various goals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame Story: Utopia Island, known as a fertile paradise all year round, was considered a legendary island. Then one day, a mercenary caught in a storm accidentally reaches the coast of Utopia. From the landscape to the topography, it resembles Utopia Island, but the atmosphere of the desolate island turns out to be a desolate ruin, with the door of hell opening on the island and the demons pouring out, except for some villages. Islanders asking foreign mercenaries to solve the island's problems. Mercenaries must build up their strength and solve the island's problems in their own way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdditional explanation: Utopia is a game that incorporates RPG into the top view ammunition game, and avoiding enemy ammunition and adapting my skills to enemy will be a major gameplay factor. Through the combat system of the above-described game, players can clear quests granted by NPCs and strengthen themselves to strengthen existing skills or acquire new skills. Dungeons with high difficulty will have to think about what skills to use and what tactics to play.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2199250/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1669292887","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2199250/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1669292887","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2199250/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1669292887","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2199250/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1669292887","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"About Utopia: It is a game that plays with a view that looks down on the 2D top view.
