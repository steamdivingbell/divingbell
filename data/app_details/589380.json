Leap your way across the beautiful pond and see what's on the menu.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Arcade Mode:</h2>Catch tasty insects in Arcade Mode and beat the high score. But watch out for those nasty wasps \u2013 they'll leave a bad taste. This makes the dragonflies (slow motion) and ladybugs (night vision) taste all the better.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Survival Mode:</h2>Or outrun the stork in Survival Mode. Become a true survivalist when it comes to dodging the huge stork. Eat or be eaten! Can you eat enough insects before the stork catches you? If you can, the next one will make things even tougher for you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Party Mode: </h2>And if you fancy a hopping competition with your friends, Party Mode is exactly what you're looking for.
