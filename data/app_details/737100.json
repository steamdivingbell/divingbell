A lower latency also means a higher skill ceiling, which is important if you want to play competitively.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Creative Missions</h2><br><br>In Squarewave Maker's creative missions, you will be asked to solve creative problems mixing level design and music composition.  <br><br>Creative missions will act as a tutorial for presenting you all the Squarewave Maker's creative tools.  <br><br>With the creative missions, we will also introduce you to musical knowledge (chords, arpeggios, rhythm patterns...) and synthesizer programming to make it possible for you to create crazy tones. <br><br>Creative missions will teach you all the basics you need to know to experiment and implement your own rhythmic challenge ideas!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Audio Toolbox</h2><br>Squarewave Maker comes with a complete audio toolbox for creating playable music. <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Note sequencer</strong>: It's the standard piano roll you get in music software like Ableton Live or FL Studio.
