It is through completing these objectives that each hero can earn points for their team. There are nine different objectives in the league. In Witches Eye the heroes must hold the eye to score points but at the same time the eye is also slowly killing them. Chicken Chase has teams fighting for control over chickens by carrying them back to their pen, but you can also play dirty and steal the enemy chickens.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/362310/extras/feature_banner_4.png?t=1615955295\" /><br><br>All of Dungeon League\u2019s modes are available to play online.
