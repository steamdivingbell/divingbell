{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>The Time Forgotten</strong> drops players into the heart of a stunningly realized, immersive world: every dinosaur for itself. In this world there can only be one left standing; search for Evolution Points through exploration, combat, and major choices on your dinosaur.

You get to design your dream selected dinosaur <strong>(You customize each dinosaur in the game to your liking)</strong> You'll be able to choose the starting traits and what your dinosaur will look and be, but that's roughly the very beginning. New skins, color schemes, and other fun cosmetics will be unlocked the better you do in the game. You develop your dinosaur's strengths and weaknesses through the use of a large array of different evolution paths-from armored plates to razor-sharp claws to heightened senses.</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong><u>Evolution</u></strong></p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Survival requires evolution. You stride through the map, finding Evolution Spires scattered throughout the island. Small ones hidden inside caves, Massive towering spires standing sky-high in the landscape. But with each evolution, you're going to be preparing your dinosaur for the opponents you'll face in combat in a grueling game of brains versus brute strength.</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><u><strong>Exploration</strong></u></p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The island is your hunting ground-a tremendous evolving world complete with multiple biomes and unforeseen hazards. Trek through sakura forests, or across desolate plains. Climb the towering mountains over the island. Frozen peaks and desert sandstorm-every biome has its terrors and possibilities. Beneath it all, a network of underground caves: bioluminescent caverns lighting up with that ethereal glow; volcanic tubes whirling with that burning, fiery lava; and slippery, noisy ice caves where the frost just shatters off the walls. And through it all, the island lives: storms rage on, the sun sets, and the merciless Firestorm drives survivors closer together, as the circle closes in with the match's exhilarating conclusion.</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong><u>Progression</u></strong></p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Every single fight is another milestone in the history of your dinosaur. Survive long enough to gain XP and level up, and new cosmetic options open up for letting you be unique. Select new traits like running speed increases or stamina increases and work your style of play. Prestige your dinosaur at the maxed level to reset abilities for exclusive rewards: rare skins and colors mark you as a veteran survivor. However, the prestige level is bigger, where failing in much higher stakes will set back experience. Always give the best in every match.</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong><u>The Loop</u></strong></p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Adapt or perish. No two games will ever be the same in The Time Forgotten, but with each start of a match, something else would happen. Every time you start a new game, the layout of the caves is different, blocking off-and sometimes opening-areas you might not have been able to access before. Moreover, with heavy weather and natural catastrophes, the island gets reshaped, and places that could be reached earlier become unreachable, while previously secret resources appear. Even changed behaviors of the wild and the unforeseen events upset even the best-laid plans. Then, surviving isn't solely fighting, It is tactical warfare in mastering the island itself, reading dangers, making split decisions that sometimes turn to one's advantage.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>A Dinosaur Battle Royale</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Time Forgotten is an extreme test of Primal survival. Choose your dinosaur from one of three classes, each one of which corresponds to a different kind of combat style. There's Apex, the king in terms of raw power; damage is his game. Bruisers are pretty strong in themselves but can also take a lot of damage while keeping field control through shields and other defenses. The Devious class can hold its speed and stealth in order to outmaneuver bigger enemies, ambushing them with special abilities and dodging bites and other attacks. Each class will be balanced through another in a circle-of-strategy manner, much like rock-paper-scissors, so that every and each encounter will be tense due to the clashes in strengths versus vulnerabilities. Choose your class, sharpen your abilities, and then let your instincts run wild to become the apex predator in this island.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3279760/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737768171","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3279760/page.bg.jpg?t=1737768171","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3279760/b83ffcb8383bfabc9052447c856f96e02feddf41/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737768171","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3279760/b83ffcb8383bfabc9052447c856f96e02feddf41/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737768171","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"HDR available","id":61}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>The Time Forgotten</strong> drops players into the heart of a stunningly realized, immersive world: every dinosaur for itself.
