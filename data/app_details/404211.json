This means you can find the Blue Comet train located in the Kickstarter County session menu. That isn\u2019t to say you can\u2019t go and place it in Surveyor yourself like before, but we thought some of you will want to just get in and drive!<br><br>The Blue Comet addon pack recreates the excitement and splendour of this remarkable train. Stunningly detailed and making use of up-to-date smoke, sound, physics and script features, the Blue Comet promises to be a satisfying addition to your Trainz collection.<br>The package includes the Baldwin G3s pacific locomotive in early condition, in both blue and black liveries, and a custom cab interior.
