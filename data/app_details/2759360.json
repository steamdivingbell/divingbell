{"about_the_game":"An innovative blend of futuristic looks including a fully molded and painted EPO body wrapped around a high-performance airframe makes the Blade\u00ae Eclipse 360 an eye-catching addition to any RC pilot\u2019s collection. It\u2019s designed to be capable of smooth hovering plus scale-like and sport flying for intermediate pilots, yet is also capable of aerobatics and even mild 3D in the hands of experienced pilots. The expertly-tuned FC6250HX flybarless control system includes optional-use SAFE technology for angle limits and automatic self-leveling to help prevent crashes in Normal mode, and no limits in all other flight modes \u2013 plus Panic Recovery to \u201cbail out\u201d at the push of a button if you ever need it! The powerful brushless main and tail motors are connected to a Spektrum Dual Smart ESC that delivers real-time telemetry data to AirWare\u2122 equipped transmitters, and they\u2019re compatible with common and popular 3S 2200\u20133200mAh batteries. Digital, metal-geared servos, an aluminum head block, and carbon fiber main rotor blades deliver reliable and precise control for the factory-assembled airframe. The lightweight yet durable body is equipped with LED navigation and landing lights along with hard mounting points for the low-profile skids that provide a streamlined \u201cgear up\u201d look, or you can install the included wheel set for a different look and ground handling experience. And it\u2019s all delivered in a model that\u2019s ready to bind to your favorite Spektrum transmitter to offer a unique helicopter flying experience you can\u2019t get anywhere else!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759360/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1715813458","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759360/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1715813458","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759360/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1715813458","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759360/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1715813458","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"An innovative blend of futuristic looks including a fully molded and painted EPO body wrapped around a high-performance airframe makes the Blade\u00ae Eclipse 360 an eye-catching addition to any RC pilot\u2019s collection.
