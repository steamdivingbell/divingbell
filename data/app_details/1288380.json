{"about_the_game":"It's not easy being a hero, especially if your city already has a superhero. Especially if that superhero has super strength and can fly! But what happens when a bunch of evil-doers with the power to glitch out reality itself take over a building, grab a few hostages and manage to overpower said superhero?<br>Well, it is up to YOU, of course, to step up and prove to everyone that you are more than just a two-bit hero! Are you up to the task?<br><br>-------------------------------<br><br>Two Bit Hero is a classic retro metroidvania - a retroidvania if you will - that sees you taking on the role of hero. Citizens have been trapped inside a skyscraper and you have to get in, power up, defeat the bad guys, save the people and get out again. But be careful when you encounter a glitch in reality, for it will transport you to a different reality altogether!
