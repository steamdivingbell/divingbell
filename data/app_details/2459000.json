Build impregnable fortresses across multiple biomes using an intricate building system that allows you to design your defenses with full freedom and strategic creativity, adapting your plans to the surrounding environment.

Use your hard-earned resources to build structures that grant access to previously unreachable parts of the map, or construct fortifications that deny the Horrors access and provide your troops safe vantage points. <br></li><li>Build cheaply and quickly using wood, or establish quarries and use durable stone to better withstand the onslaught. Keep an eye on structural integrity and load-bearing columns as falling pieces will kill friend and foe alike, often creating unique opportunities to crush numerous enemies with cleverly placed vulnerabilities. <br></li><li>Adapt your fortress to growing needs as you acquire new tools and expand in an attempt to secure all the resources needed to sustain a powerful defensive force.
