{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dimensions!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Solve puzzles by removing dimensions, flattening yourself into a 2D plane or 1D\u00a0 line, allowing you to interact with the world in new ways.  Squeeze through narrow gaps, climb steepest slopes, and traverse the widest chasms.  Being a little blue sphere with eyes has never been so mind-bending!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> </h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Levels!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each level introduces obstacles that you must find your way around (or through) to collect the spinning object that beckons you through the space.  Getting past these obstacles isn't a matter of speed or precision, though.\u00a0 They will instead test your understanding of the mechanics, your spatial reasoning, and your powers of observation.  You must think in 3D while you are 2D, and in 2D when you are 3D.\u00a0 Somewhere along the way you'll have to get comfortable with 1D as well.\u00a0 It will take more than a little brain-power to discover how these modes interact with slopes, blocks, corkscrews, and more.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Occasionally, you will find &quot;Comment Blocks&quot; (some obvious, some hidden) which contain the philosophical writings of a woman, dumped haphazardly throughout the source code of a device she is building.  A device that she is determined to complete, and that, unexpectedly (and unbeknownst to her), created the world your character inhabits.  The more Comment Blocks you find, the more you learn about her past, her dedication to completing this project, and the details of the project itself.  You will undoubtedly have questions, will you find all the answers?</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2141790/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733260492","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2141790/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1733260492","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2141790/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733260492","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2141790/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733260492","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dimensions!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Solve puzzles by removing dimensions, flattening yourself into a 2D plane or 1D\u00a0 line, allowing you to interact with the world in new ways.
