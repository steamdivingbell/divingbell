Although the setting is fictional, it's influenced by real events from the Cold War, with references to war, ideological conflict, and state-controlled violence. Players will encounter morally complex decisions, such as choosing between harsh tactics to maintain order or risking chaos by granting more freedom. The game features mature language that reflects the intense and often ruthless political atmosphere, and some choices may lead to state-sanctioned actions that imply or result in violence, though these are not graphically depicted."},"detailed_description":"Politburo Simulator is a turn-based strategy game that puts you in charge of a fictional Communist country, Savlenko.
