This campaign scenario lasts 30 turns of 3 days (June 6th till September 3rd, 1944).

This short campaign scenario lasts 22 turns of 3 days (June 30th till September 3rd, 1944).  [22 turns]<br><br></li><li><strong>Race for Cherbourg</strong>: Getting hold a deep-water fully-equiped port was essential for the pursuit of the campaign, and there was only one possible target: Cherbourg. Can the Allies reach it in time, or will the German defend it for long enough to create a logistical nightmare for the enemy?. This scenario lasts 4 weeks (6th to 26th June 1944).  [7 turns]<br><br></li><li><strong>Operation Cobra</strong>: The scenario covers the famous operation that finally led the American forces under Patton and Bradley breakout from Normandy, after trashing the German front at Avranches.
