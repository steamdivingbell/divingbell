The theory proposes if you were given 12 spoons at the start of the day and each task you wanted to complete in the day cost a spoon, how would you spend your day? It highlights the invisible struggle of these conditions - energy. Energy is limited, and energy management becomes a crucial skill that can get overwhelming. This is the experience of many people with chronic mental and physical conditions.
