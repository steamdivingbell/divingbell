{"about_the_game":"<strong>Mystic Land</strong> is a project that started all the way back in 1994 when couple of friends had the idea of creating a fantasy role playing game that would be a mix of best elements from computer FRP games like Wizardry, Might and Magic and Eye of the Beholder.<br>The game saw a couple of attempts to be born back then, but it wasn\u2019t to be. Partly because we were just too young and \u201cgreen\u201d back then, partly because, you know, \u201clife happens\u201d\u2026 we drifted apart, started our professional jobs and other ventures. You know, we grew up.<br><br>But, after more than 25 years, we found all them early unfinished DOS versions, maps, concept art and documentation lying on old disks collecting dust. We also found a lot of sketches and ideas on paper (that miraculously survived the 25+ years).<br>And so the decision was made - it\u2019s time to develop this thing.<br><br>We are still determined that Mystic Land will be the best old-school computer fantasy role playing game with all the goodies from the 90s like turn based grid movement and combat, lots of (meaningful) skills and attributes and (hard) puzzled to solve.<br>Saying that, we will also add some quality-of-life improvements like full controller/mouse/keyboard support and easier inventory and battle strategy management.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2513200/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726909899","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2513200/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1726909899","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2513200/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726909899","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2513200/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726909899","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>Mystic Land</strong> is a project that started all the way back in 1994 when couple of friends had the idea of creating a fantasy role playing game that would be a mix of best elements from computer FRP games like Wizardry, Might and Magic and Eye of the Beholder.<br>The game saw a couple of attempts to be born back then, but it wasn\u2019t to be.
