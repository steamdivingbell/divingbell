This is a portfolio project that I made for a class during the summer term around June and July, time span of 8 weeks, and total hours spent on this project is roughly 90 hours. This is developed inside my own engine that has been created in the past school year. I did the Art and Audio as well, using Aseprite and 1BITDRAGON, the art creation time also count towards the project time, while audio is done after the project due date. Due to my lack of skill in art and sound, those part of the game are less complete.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Future Plan</h2>This is the first self guided project for the school and there is still two more to come.
