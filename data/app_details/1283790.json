No problem, you can enjoy many things to do in the office. You can buy a soda or a snack, eat a burger or make a coffee and it is recomended to do it often or you're gonna have problems. You also have to use the toilets and wash your hands (this is important), if you're not clean and smell weird, you won't be able to use vendor machines and people will avoid you. You can also have a walk outside to play basketball or smoke a cigarette if you're a smoker (we encourage you no to smoke and find other ways to be happy).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1283790/extras/gif3.gif?t=1590618380\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Gameplay</strong></h2>Talk to your colleagues to know if they need something.
