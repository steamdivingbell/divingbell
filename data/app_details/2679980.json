{"about_the_game":"Players drop fruits one by one at any time and stack them up.

The fruit falls onto the plate following a ballistic trajectory.<br />\r\nOn the plate, collisions are calculated using 3D physics simulation.

SUIKA DISH is a fruit-based drop game.<br />\r\nPlayers transform two fruits of the same kind into one larger fruit of another,<br />\r\nThe goal is to make a watermelon in the end. Players compete for a score that is added each time a fruit is changed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSUIKA DISH has three features.<br />\r\nFirst, there is no time limit, so you can play at your own pace.<br />\r\nThe second feature is that the fruits are not dropped, but instead are launched. The fruit is launched and flies through the air on a ballistic trajectory, and players can predict the movement of the fruit after it lands and rolls, and think about where to aim.<br />\r\nFinally, the third feature is the ability to calm the fruit when it makes a crazy move.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSUIKA DISH does not have a time limit, but it satisfies the player's need to advance the game as quickly as possible.<br />\r\nSUIKA DISH allows for a rapid-fire sequence of fruits to make the game go faster. A large number of fruits can be dropped onto the plate in a short time.<br />\r\nThe interval between consecutive shots is automatically adjusted according to the size of the fruits in front and behind.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe physical calculation of SUIKA DISH is performed in 3D. As a result, fruit movements are more complex and require more difficult predictions.<br />\r\nIf a player is able to change fruits in the same turn that the fruit is thrown in, it becomes a combo and a bonus is added to the score.<br />\r\nEach successive combo increases the score bonus.<br />\r\nOne of the interesting features of SUIKA DISH is the ability to calm down the movement of fruits. As the game progresses, the fruit may move unexpectedly. In that case, the player can stop the movement of the fruit by performing an action. This is called calming. It is not a so-called pause, but it reduces the speed of the fruit to zero. This is a movement that is not possible in reality.<br />\r\nThis is a powerful fruit stop function, but because of is powerful, there are pitfalls to be aware of.<br />\r\nIf the fruit is flying on a ballistic trajectory in the air at the exact moment when you use the fruit stop, the fruit will plummet.<br />\r\nWhat if the fruit is still flying outside the dish?<br />\r\nThe fruit will lose speed, plummet, and fall outside the plate, ending the game.<br />\r\nKeeping that in mind, players can make the game progress more easily by occasionally calming the movement of the fruit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSUIKA DISH is a new game that incorporates interesting and fun features in addition to simple rules.<br />\r\nI hope everyone enjoys this game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you for your interest in SUIKA DISH.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEstimated playtime<br />\r\n<br />\r\n10 minutes~60 minutes<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVideo distribution and live commentary limitation<br />\r\n\u30fbVideo distribution and live commentary using the gameplay is permitted under non-commercial and commercial situations <br />\r\nthrough the internet video distribution service.<br />\r\n\u30fbMonetization is permitted only by the intrinsic monetization service of the video distribution service.<br />\r\n\u30fbWe expect you to add the game title and the STEAM store page URL of this game to the video title or the video description.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe are not responsible for any damages caused by our products.<br />\r\nThis note will be updated without notice.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"SUIKA on Plate 30","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2679980/5b4623cdc42d8a928cd136ed620a37a4ae0613d0.jpg"},{"name":"SUIKA on Plate 27","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2679980/12f65b23fc62024afa44257677ebba10f8be403d.jpg"},{"name":"SUIKA on Plate 24","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2679980/80acb8319876ead352156fa98a68d3b0c89da934.jpg"},{"name":"SUIKA on Plate 21","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2679980/c3e9766401c439f42658342224c12d51dec83a9f.jpg"},{"name":"TWO SUIKAs on Plate 30","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2679980/5fa69a3c23f16ffc155cbec3dcd539de4ebf0191.jpg"},{"name":"TWO SUIKAs on Plate 27","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2679980/70450eb182292d709e7c51b4f38cc6e15bebe192.jpg"},{"name":"TWO SUIKAs on Plate 24","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2679980/72d54b9f3d7bdf6ab26f2fe31c7517fd00046b8e.jpg"},{"name":"TWO SUIKAs on Plate 21","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2679980/9dbff7bb623f09318eca104c42ffbce1e4f4dd26.jpg"},{"name":"SUIKA on 36","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2679980/ff41481b8fc5c5515b763d5fd327942e00f6fe9c.jpg"}],"total":9},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2679980/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1702259861","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2679980/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1702259861","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2679980/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1702259861","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2679980/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1702259861","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Players drop fruits one by one at any time and stack them up.
