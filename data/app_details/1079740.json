{"about_the_game":"As gunshots rang out in the streets of France, one man was writing feverishly. On January 2nd, 1852, in the midst of the bloody French <i>coup d'\u00e9tat</i>, a little-known Victorian poet had a nightmare. His terrifying dream took the form of a poem, and upon awakening, he wrote it down verbatim. This strange dream-poem would become known as &quot;Childe Roland To The Dark Tower Came,&quot; written by Robert Browning, and now, over a century later, is considered by many to be one of the greatest works of poetry in the English language.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">This is a personal interpretation of that poem.</h2><br>I first read this masterpiece during a very difficult time in my life, and I want to share something of what I gained from it. To achieve this end, I have illustrated, animated, or otherwise represented each line in the format of a &quot;visual novel,&quot; to best show you what I see in my mind's eye when reading it. An innovative adaptive soundtrack (designed so no player will ever hear the same tune) has been scored by the incredible Michael Becze.<br>Hopefully you can gain something powerful, or at least beautiful, from this experience.<br><br>Yours,<br>-Yitz<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1079740/extras/cuthbert_avi_smaller.png?t=1588649133\" /><br>[Please wishlist+follow this project in order to receive an email notification when it releases]","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1079740/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1588649133","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1079740/page.bg.jpg?t=1588649133","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1079740/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1588649133","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1079740/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1588649133","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Commentary available","id":14}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"As gunshots rang out in the streets of France, one man was writing feverishly.
