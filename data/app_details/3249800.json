Unlike many other bullet hell games, Touhou Renkyouto focuses both on verticality and horizontality.

With enough P-points, you'll also be able to get out of a tricky situation by bombing your way out and clearing the screen of those pesky bullets. At the end of every level is a tricky boss fight, each complete with several intricate bullet patterns, which will require all your wits and P-points to beat.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">At the end of every level, you'll be able to buy a new items from a pool of 14 unique items.
