We began working in UE5 in February 2023, and we have been relying on trial-and-error as well as Epic Marketplace assets and YouTube tutorials to create our first game ever. We are extremely passionate about this project, and we worked hard to make it our own, but we are also aware that it isn't perfect.

They began exploring and building relationships with indigenous peoples on distant planets.

When their home started dying, the Galactic Council decided it would be best for humanity to split up. They started scouting planets they had previously discovered, testing to see which ones could be terraformed to become habitable. Once a planet was deemed viable, they began negotiating with native leaders to see who would take them in. This was a slow process, as some native groups were much less willing to house newcomers than others. The indigenous peoples that agreed to the treaty did so with the condition that humans would only terraform a small part of their planet so as not to disrupt the overall environment too much. Gradually, the Council was able to start sending groups of people to settle in these newly terraformed areas, known as Population Zones.

But eventually, the humans began arguing about how to govern themselves. Humanity was divided, and a faction known as MilCorp splintered off.
