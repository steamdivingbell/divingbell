Meet the specifications required by the manufacturer's mission or build your own crazy creations. With no details left to spare, everything from the type of vehicle frame used to the paint color of the tailgate is up to you! With over 150+ vehicle parts and many more to come the possibilities are endless!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Stage It!</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1634070/extras/Object_Placement_GIF.gif?t=1672281496\" /><br>Prepare for impact! Well not just yet. As an official Crash Test Engineer you will need to set the stage for your momentous event. Configure the crash floor with a variety of cement barriers, blockades, barrels and a few other wacky items. Maneuver the 750 ton portable barrier into its final resting position. Aim the high speed cameras placed throughout the facility to ensure every angle of impact is captured. There's even a tunnel that can be moved into one of five possible angles of attack!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Load Em Up!</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1634070/extras/vehicle_placement_gif.gif?t=1672281496\" /><br>In the vehicle bay, configure the vehicle selections for impact. Place five different types of crash test equipment on your crash test subjects. To buckle or not to buckle is up to you, with four unique crash test dummies. You choose when and where our friend &quot;Steve&quot; the dummy gets seated. You can even bring his whole family along for the ride too!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> 5.4.3.2.1! </h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1634070/extras/crashing_cart.gif?t=1672281496\" /><br>Right then, Let it rip! Flip the switch to engage the cinematic stage lighting. Press the start button and send your creations hurtling down the crash test halls at speeds over 60 MPH or 100 KPH! Let the carnage unfold at your own pace: in slow motion or high speed. Watch as the glass breaks, metal crumples, airbags deploy, and vehicle parts fly!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Grab the Data!</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1634070/extras/probe_capture_gif.gif?t=1672281496\" /><br>Once the lights come back on, it's time to collect the critical impact data. Use the Measurement Master M2000 to record changes to your creation's shape after the crash. Download the onboard crash data from the Data Logger and Crash Test Dummies to determine if your occupants survived. Finally compile your results and see how your vehicle creation\u2019s ratings match up. Only then, will you see whether or not you have what it takes to be a Crash Effects Inc.
