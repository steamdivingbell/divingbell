{"about_the_game":"Settlements Rising is a city-building and colony management simulation game set in medieval times. The game offers extensive depth with dozens of professions and resources available to the player. Each profession features villagers with their own animations and work cycles, creating a living colony experience in the game. It allows for micromanagement through trade, limited resources, production chains, and production data.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2378910/extras/Simulated_villagers.png?t=1738750878\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2378910/extras/SimulatedVillagersGif.gif?t=1738750878\" /><br>Villagers have their own life cycles. They can work in over 35 different professions. Each villager has needs for hunger, energy, health, and warmth. When they're hungry, they eat, and when their inventory runs out of food, they purchase more. When their energy depletes while working or during cold weather, they return home to rest. They are born, grow, receive education, and eventually age and pass away. They gain experience in their jobs. They acquire character traits either from birth or later in life.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2378910/extras/EnhancementCards.png?t=1738750878\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2378910/extras/EnhancementGif.gif?t=1738750878\" /><br>At specific intervals, you will be presented with a set of random cards from which you can choose the one that best suits your needs. You can use these enhancement cards according to your requirements. These cards are for single use, but you can choose to save them for future games.

Traders visit your village at regular intervals. They buy some resources and sell others. The prices vary from one trader to another, allowing you to buy low and sell high. Additionally, build trading ships and manage your resources by trading with neighboring villages based on the resources they import and export.<br><br>Construct exploration ships for exploration missions and send them out.
