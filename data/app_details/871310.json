ARC Savior is a top end space shooter that resembles the likes of Mass Effect, Star Fox &amp; Star Citizen all mixed into one mega space fighting experience. With its customizable ship and weapons options to its huge open battleground,  ARC Savior really hits the nail on the head in bringing a great immersive experience. I would highly recommend this title as one to watch for those who, like myself, have a great love for space shooting related games.\u201d<br>The Sound Architect UK<br><br>\u201cArc Savior is amongst the most impressive single person projects I\u2019ve seen in gaming. What makes Arc Savior stand out is it\u2019s sheer scope and scale for a one person project. The game controls incredibly well on PC, with snappy and responsive locomotion and aiming.\u201d<br>Geek Ireland<br><br>\u201cArc Savior excited us with its tasty explosions and dazzling particle effects.\u201d<br>GamEir<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/871310/ss_011ecd5f2fdefd6ba7bc93c917b8707b0a5eba6d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1556214549","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/871310/ss_011ecd5f2fdefd6ba7bc93c917b8707b0a5eba6d.600x338.jpg?t=1556214549"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/871310/ss_9fa669a5bb41c53b3a8f13ae41005a381fd9ae61.1920x1080.jpg?t=1556214549","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/871310/ss_9fa669a5bb41c53b3a8f13ae41005a381fd9ae61.600x338.jpg?t=1556214549"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/871310/ss_33bf6997a3ca74f59e317786a3bc31f24bd6714d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1556214549","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/871310/ss_33bf6997a3ca74f59e317786a3bc31f24bd6714d.600x338.jpg?t=1556214549"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/871310/ss_516293009dab12ef41594ae71d00b0af991e146d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1556214549","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/871310/ss_516293009dab12ef41594ae71d00b0af991e146d.600x338.jpg?t=1556214549"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/871310/ss_db1557963fbe26aee7a0983c4ad65e0b8dd49bb9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1556214549","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/871310/ss_db1557963fbe26aee7a0983c4ad65e0b8dd49bb9.600x338.jpg?t=1556214549"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/871310/ss_bff98837fea3bf7a0549a7b414b6df1b452fa9c8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1556214549","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/871310/ss_bff98837fea3bf7a0549a7b414b6df1b452fa9c8.600x338.jpg?t=1556214549"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/871310/ss_806265b8db8fb1f93a7068908d92b7d5850f171f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1556214549","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/871310/ss_806265b8db8fb1f93a7068908d92b7d5850f171f.600x338.jpg?t=1556214549"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/871310/ss_38382c6fb574fb54b82425a759c82558b677dcf8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1556214549","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/871310/ss_38382c6fb574fb54b82425a759c82558b677dcf8.600x338.jpg?t=1556214549"}],"short_description":"Discover a beautiful and brutal universe through three immersive stories.
