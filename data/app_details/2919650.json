{"about_the_game":"<strong>Cookard</strong> is a cooking game where you run a restaurant by <strong>stacking cards</strong> to prepare and serve dishes to customers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Prepare Dish</h2>Every dish requires a certain set of steps and ingredients, which can typically be completed by dragging ingredient cards (such as Egg, Dough, Honey) to utensil cards (such as Oven, Stove). You can always check the Recipes section if you're at loss. As the game progresses, you'll unlock more recipes to cook!<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2919650/extras/dish.png?t=1724300858\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2919650/extras/Cookard_-_2_Whisking_Dough.gif?t=1724300858\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2919650/extras/Cookard_-_3_Baking_Baguette.gif?t=1724300858\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Serve Dish</h2>Dragging a 'Customer' card on top of a 'Table' card will reveal their desired dish.

It's good idea to sell them in the 'Trade House' to get coins in return.
