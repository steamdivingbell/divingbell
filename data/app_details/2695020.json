{"about_the_game":"The Magnavox Odyssey was the world\u2019s first video game console. It was released in 1972 and by the time production stopped several years later it had sold over 350,000 units. In total 28 games were made for the Odyssey. The most famous game from the platform is &quot;Table Tennis&quot; which served as the direct inspiration for Atari's &quot;Pong&quot;. <br><br>Not only was it the first console but the Odyssey is also a unique piece of hardware. There is no CPU or memory to emulate. Instead the Odyssey is a collection of circuit boards, each controlling a key element of the system such as the ball, the wall and each player's dot. It is a very misunderstood system!<br><br>Now you can experience the wonder and strangeness of the Odyssey with Magnavody! <br><br>Magnavody is an open source simulator of the Magnavox Odyssey with a focus on accuracy, historical authenticity and fun. Magnavody is a homage to the games on the system in a modern package designed to be played on modern hardware. Your Steam purchase supports future development.<br><br>Magnavody has the following features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Emulates the system design of the Magnavox Odyssey (1972) - the unit controllers, cards, spot generators, gate matrix and flip-flops<br></li><li>Controller support designed to best simulate the strange and awkward dial controllers of the original<br></li><li>Authentic 4:3 mode (see the games as they were originally presented)<br></li><li>Optional enhanced widescreen (16:9) mode (see the games fill the screen as they were originally designed to do)<br></li><li>Optional CRT overlays (add static, waves and other retro effects)<br></li><li>Toggle on screen elements to choose your own level of immersion<br></li><li>Two player support<br></li><li>Support for digital overlays (some games originally came with plastic overlays)<br></li><li>Some quality of life improvements such as &quot;quick load&quot; and &quot;reset controllers&quot; to make it easier to use.<br></li><li>Original and modern rules.
