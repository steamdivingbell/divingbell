Few ever return from their expeditions into the deep jungles.  So, if you are brave enough, the &quot;Jungles of Maxtheria&quot; awaits!<br><br>- Explore the jungles, water, underground and above looking for treasure and keys.<br>- Collect the treasures to gain gold coins.  use the market to buy and sell inventory items that you will need such as torches, bullets, knives, bullets, grappling hooks and oxygen tanks.<br>- Find keys to open doors and treasure chests.<br>- Use the signs for relevant information.<br>- Use the torches underground to see.<br>- Use the oxygen tanks for breath under the water.<br>- Use the grappling hooks to jump over far to reach places.<br>- Climb up and down the vines.<br>- Avoid the traps, tar pits, sand traps and other obstacles along the way. <br>- Avoid the baddies or use the bullets/knives to thwart them off.<br>- Find the lost treasure.<br><br>- Multiple Language Support:  English, Espanola, Francais or Deutsche.<br>- Start a new game or load the previous saved game.<br>- Choose to play as any of the four characters:  &quot;Hot Spot&quot; Harvey, his cousin Roxy Roks, Junior or Missy.<br>- Play the standard game with baddies or, if needed, choose to play with less baddies.<br>- The UI Layout at the top of the screen can be changed depending on your input device:  Joystick, Keyboard or user configurable.<br>- Choose to play on a touchscreen device by turning on the touchscreen overlay.<br><br>- Full help section with instructions and controller diagrams.<br>- First Time Training:  Go through a step-by-step quick start guide to learn all that you will need to know to play.<br>- Input Settings allows you to remap the keys/buttons to whatever you want.<br>- Ability to delete the 'Player Prefs' area which deletes all of the saved information.<br>- Ability to independently change the volume controls for the sound effects and the music.<br>- If you choose to turn on the touch screen, then you have the ability to pick one of many onscreen layouts (left and right handed).<br><br>- Six huge stages to explore with many hours of enjoyment.

This is updated and improved for your gaming pleasure.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1384450/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1606409584","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1384450/page.bg.jpg?t=1606409584","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1384450/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1606409584","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1384450/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1606409584","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Search for the lost treasure of the infamous &quot;Jaxton Max&quot;.
