{"about_the_game":"<strong>A new adventure based on retro times!</strong><br><br><i>MoonBright is an RPG video game based on Mexico of the 2000s!</i><br><br>In this adventure, you control Ruwz, a newcomer to Puerto Pimiento. The Lunar Festival is about to be celebrated, and everyone is excited to participate in the grand event! But something has happened, and the Moon was hit by a laser! Fragments of it have fallen to Earth, and these fragments have a special power and are filled with lunar energy! This energy causes different effects on the person who possesses the fragments.<br><br>Ruwz and his group of friends will have to venture throughout the region to restore order to the world.<br><br><strong>Friends are the strength!</strong><br><br>In your adventure, you will meet many people, and some will offer you their friendship! Friends saved on your phone can be called into combat, and each one has a different effect, so knowing who to call is an important thing to consider.<br><br>Some characters will ask you to prove your worth to earn their friendship, so complete different missions to add them to your list and have them fight by your side!<br><br><strong>An interesting mix!</strong><br><br>In MoonBright, there are different ways to fight the Inanimados. Don't let the name confuse you; these enemies are more alive than ever! Different objects have come to life when impacted by the lunar fragments, and to recover them, you'll have to face them in classic turn-based battles. You might feel a sense of nostalgia with the style of these battles, as we designed the system based on our favorite games!<br><br>But that's not all because there are also BOSSES! Each area has its respective final boss, and these battles completely change the perspective, going from turn-based combat to Tactical RPG! Since it was designed from the beginning, the same moves you use in turn-based battles are also used in the new style, making it easy to adapt to the change! And just when the boss is on its last legs... unleash an ALL-TOGETHER move for a cinematic and satisfying finish!<br><br><strong>Explore, Collect, and Share!</strong><br><br>The world is ready to be discovered, and there are collectibles everywhere. We know we did the right job because seeing them in the game fills us with nostalgia for the 2000s style.<br><br>Complete different collections of cities and places, and who knows, something might happen in the end if you get them all...<br><br>Apart from all this, there are different activities and mini-games to discover, from a game of marbles to a Tazos duel?! There are many things to do, and we hope each of them makes you feel like you're in the good old times!<br><br>Don't forget to capture memories of your adventures with the Photo Mode, play with different filters, stickers, and other resources to create stunning photos. We look forward to seeing your best creations in the future!<br><br><strong>From Bernetic Studios with Love!</strong><br><br>At Bernetic Studios, we strive to bring the best experience to you. MoonBright is our opportunity to share our emotions and feelings, apart from being a time capsule to a wonderful era.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2678360/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1699309641","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2678360/page.bg.jpg?t=1699309641","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2678360/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1699309641","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2678360/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1699309641","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>A new adventure based on retro times!</strong><br><br><i>MoonBright is an RPG video game based on Mexico of the 2000s!</i><br><br>In this adventure, you control Ruwz, a newcomer to Puerto Pimiento.
