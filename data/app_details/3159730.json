We currently have three modes for users to play. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">1: Regular Flashcards (These show the hidden side of the card when you press Enter. You can type in a guess before revealing the answer. This is a great mode to use if you don't want to have to respond exactly as the hidden part of the card was written.) </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> 2: Multiple Choice Elimination (This mode gives you four possible answers to choose from. Correct answers delete the card, while wrong answers restore a random card.) </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">3: Type Response Elimination (This is like mode 2 but you must completely answer from memory. Capital sensitivity can be turned on for an extra challenge.) </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Flashcards cannot currently contain image, video,\u00a0 or sound. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>What is Retro Elimination Flashcards?</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Retro Elimination Flashcards feels like something that should have been made a long time ago. With features like saving flashcards as text files so that you can make copies and keep them wherever you want such as on the desktop, on a flashdrive, or both! Making cards that have a follow up question after the question, or changing the colors of the text and background. These felt like they shouldn't be new and yet I couldn't find anything like it; so I decided I had to learn programming and make it myself. My goal was to make a flashcard software that can be customized to meet the needs of any user.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3159730/extras/hchgchg.jpg?t=1737742126\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Description</strong> </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">   You can choose Multiple Choice or Type response. By default you work on five cards from a deck at a time, but you can change this number to whatever you want in settings. If you get a card correct it deletes and a new card from the full deck goes into Cards in use, replacing it. If you get a card wrong it stays in Cards in use, and you can expect to see it again soon. Capital sensitivity can be turned on or off but is off by default.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3159730/extras/gjgcgvyyy.jpg?t=1737742126\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">   The display side of the cards can be changed to back side. Cards can have a follow up question (Two part cards). Two part cards are only counted as correct if both parts are answered correctly. This software is customizable but by default correct answers delete the card and wrong answers restore a random card unless all cards are already in use. Card restoring can be turned off if unwanted by changing Minor Set Back to Off. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Minor set back can be changed to restore all cards or any number of cards but restores one card by default. Minor set back can be set to trigger after a certain number of wrong answers but is set to one by default. You can have many different customized settings saved at once, just load the save file and play!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3159730/extras/Capture.jpg?t=1737742126\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Keep in mind!: Alt Code (It's Unlikely you'll ever need to know this, but I feel it should be explained for the few of you that do.)</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the above image look at the apostrophe in my answer and the apostrophe in the correct answer. They are not the same. If you get a question correct but the software says it's wrong then at least one character is different between your answer and the correct answer.\u00a0In the above image I got the question wrong because one apostrophe was typed by holding ALT while typing 0146( ALT code) and the other is from my keyboard. (I also didn't capitalize Ihnen, but I was playing with capital sensitivity off so that's not why I got it wrong.) This is  only a concern if you copy and pasted flashcards from a place that used Alt code. if you typed the cards yourself you'd know you used Alt code. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">(Some Alt code is not supported on Windows 11 terminals like the smiley face for ex. \u263b\u2665\u263a(Therefore it's not supported for this software on Windows 11.)  On Windows 10 if you want to study smiley faces go for it.\u00a0\u263b\u2665\u263a You can type anything on Windows 10. Unfortunately, they removed support for some alt code on the Windows 11 terminal. The Windows 11 terminal also doesn't come back up on it's own after saving or loading flashcards. You have to click on it at the bottom of the screen because it stays minimized.(It ignores the code I wrote that tells it to go full screen) This is shown within the first minute of trailer number 2. The Windows 11 Terminal gets the job done but it's a downgrade from 10.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Future Improvements</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Estimated times for new content and other improvements.
