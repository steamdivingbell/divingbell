If a general with low friendship value becomes the governor, you have to hurry up and reward or give treasures.Each general has his own preferences and concepts, the so-called Tao is different and not to be discussed.The game tries to close to the romance, and it is more difficult to log in generals with different Tao.These generals may reduce loyalty every turn, and if they are appointed as governors, it will be more troublesome.Friends who are not familiar with the Three Kingdoms can understand through the general's biography, and visit the generals they want to keep more, which is the work of the lord.Generals with a friendship of 100 can be unlocked and played in the next round.Of course, the internal affairs system retains the necessary general and material transfer, personnel rewards and exile, etc.And using strategies to destroy the enemy's city or reduce the general's loyalty (you can dig corners or let the enemy's governor stand by himself, and the wise can be  addition, each city has different facilities, each of which will trigger specific events, such as treasure trading, special troop formation, private soldier formation... or even stargazing divination.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2766760/extras/\u5355\u6311.gif?t=1726269607\" /><br>Finally, it is the adventure layer of the game, which is also a major highlight of this game.First, different generals will be encountered on the big map, which can expand the protagonist's social circle.At the beginning of the game, it is common for the protagonist to be rejected when visiting generals with great differences in phase or reputation.You can imagine the scene in the Three Kingdoms through the novel, when the unknown protagonist visits Yuan Shao in Nanpi...Therefore, it is very important to expand the social circle through channels such as taverns and city adventures.You will encounter immortals such as Zuo Ci on the big map, and after accepting the trial, you will gain special skills or talismans, which can play a great role in the  addition, there are various exploration events for players to taste in the city's taverns and other facilities, as well as in the wild exploration, such as suppressing bandits and discovering treasures.The treasures in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms also make an appearance one after another, such as the Red Hare horse, a pair of male and female swords, which can improve the general's attributes and skills.Different general events may also be triggered in the city, and the choices made will affect the goodwill between the protagonist and the different generals in the city.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2766760/extras/\u63a2\u9669.gif?t=1726269607\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2766760/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726269607","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2766760/page.bg.jpg?t=1726269607","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2766760/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726269607","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2766760/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726269607","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This is a Three Kingdoms strategy role-playing game where players can take on the role of any general that appears in the game, embarking on an interesting journey through the Three Kingdoms period.The game focuses on the process of cultivating generals, with a rich set of adventure exploration events and interactive events between generals.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2766760/extras/\u5927\u5730\u56fe.gif?t=1726269607\" /><br>You can choose to start the game as a feudal lord or, like the Sleeping Dragon, work the land in Nanyang and rise to prominence after being recognized by a lord!When playing as a governor, you can help your lord conquer cities and unify the realm, or, like Sima Zhongda, raise a private army and stage a rebellion.The evaluation of a general is no longer a numerical value but a rating that grows as the game progresses: S, A, B, C, D.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2766760/extras/\u5b9d\u7269.gif?t=1726269607\" /><br>Although this may not fully reproduce the shock brought by the scene of Guan Yu, a novice archer, cutting down the fierce general Hua Xiong while warming wine, it can still bring similar fun.For example, Zhang Liao, rated A in martial prowess, challenges Xu Huang, also rated A (or even S), to a duel.
