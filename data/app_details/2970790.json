{"about_the_game":"The might of Metrolink takes a turn out of sprawling Los Angeles for an east-west express in Train Sim World 5. Dash between highways and city blocks in bullet-esque fashion, soaking in the sun and soaring to the industry-laden outskirts of the San Gabriel Mountains along the San Bernardino Line. <br><br>Open the throttle on Metrolink's regional passenger service with 2 icons of Californian rail. The striking MP36, often dubbed the Baby Bullet, works in tandem with the modern F125 \u201cSpirit\u201d on the daily duties out of LA\u2019s Union Station. Facing East, diesel equipment duty takes passengers on a sunny trip to San Bernardino. Run back in the cab of Rotem, with mixed bi-level formations in-between, offering a different perspective for the returning rush towards LA.  <br><br>Experience the challenge of sticking to a schedule on a single-track line. Delays are tantamount to chaos if you hold up other services! Take on the roles of Metrolink in new ways; play as a conductor to check tickets and safely dispatch your train. With Free Roam, explore the route in your own way, and if you own the more mountainous Antelope Valley Line and/or Cajon Pass, hop between each route for never-ending Californian fun! <br><br>The daily suburban commute awaits, connect the sprawling LA metropolis and race to the foothills of mountains with Train Sim World 5: San Bernardino Line!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2> <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li>57-mile San Bernardino Line, from LA Union Station to Downtown San Bernardino <br></li><li>MPI MP36 diesel locomotive in Metrolink livery <br></li><li>EMD F125 diesel locomotive in Metrolink livery <br></li><li>Bombardier Bi-level trailers in Metrolink livery <br></li><li>Hyundai Rotem Commuter trailers and cab car in Metrolink livery <br></li><li>Highly detailed, feature-rich, driving cabs <br></li><li>True-to-life performance, suspension and handling <br></li><li>Accessible Tutorials on the Training Center <br></li><li>A variety of Scenarios and an authentic Timetable <br></li><li>Additional freight timetable layer for owners of Cajon Pass <br></li><li>A selection of Route Tasks to complete <br></li><li>Explore the route and trains in Free Roam <br></li><li>Hop between Cajon Pass and Antelope Valley Line (available separately) on foot <br></li><li>Livery Designer, Formation Designer and Scenario Planner compatible.
