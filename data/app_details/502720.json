The size and temperature of the star they orbit, their distance from that star, the type of surface, atmosphere, and liquids present (or not) determine how a planet will look once landed on. Players will be able to land, depart and return to planets, exploring their surfaces as well as underground cave systems repeatedly, while keeping the same features intact on each visit.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Exploration</h2>Fuel, ammunition and oxygen will all have to be carefully managed if the player wants to survive the long search for an earth-like planet. While many planets will be too hot or cold, or without an atmosphere, there are also worlds of liquid methane, ammonia, sulphuric acid and more, that have developed their own unique evolutionary cycles. Each kind of alien plant, tree or animal is pieced together randomly, making for a unique experience for each player.<br> <br> <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/502720/extras/Robot_fight.gif?t=1732719078\" /><br><br>The Star Explorers universe is not a friendly one though, it can be cruel and indifferent to the struggles of its inhabitants. If you're not careful, you might land on a planet that's just too hot, or too cold, or enveloped in a cloud of corrosive acid, and not live to tell about it. Upgrading your space suit will open these otherwise impossible worlds to further exploration.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Inventory, Upgrading and Crafting</h2>Exploration will allow the player to discover many things, including tools and resources that will help in further exploration.  Among these are raw materials, weapons, armor upgrades and blueprints that allow you to craft helpful items.  Armor upgrades will increase your space suit's resistance to heat, cold and other environmental hazards. Some weapons allow you to access areas that may be closed off to less experienced adventurers.  <br>  <br> <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/502720/extras/Cave.gif?t=1732719078\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Caves and Ancient Ruins</h2>Star Explorers may be the first interstellar dungeon crawler.  Traversing the dark, hidden places and caves is necessary to find the resources required to complete the game. Discover the crumbling remains of an ancient culture and learn the secrets of its mysterious people.  In Star Explorers, exploration and investigation are rewarded with special items and locations that many players may never find. If you are someone who likes to look around every corner, then this is the game for you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Generative Design</h2>Almost everything in Star Explorers is produced generatively.  From the locations of stars and nebulae, to the surfaces of planets and their features, every location is different, and every play-through offers unique challenges.
