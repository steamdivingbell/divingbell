(Arcane Renaissance) in the World of Vyen. Mayor Nelly of Utania Village has started decorating everything with Christmas lights and pretty stars. She had everyone in the village prepare delicious meals and treats for the holidays, and they planned on celebrating Christmas Eve together as a whole village. But one day, the biggest Christmas hater of them all, Frinch, the Goblin King, threatened Utania Village that he would ruin Christmas and destroy everything. We must protect the holidays at all costs! Thankfully, Mayor Nelly found Mercenaries willing to lend their aid in protecting Christmas and preserving the holiday spirit. Help Mayor Nelly and her friends by forming your Heroes of Christmas to fight King Frinch's army! <br><br>But wait, how are we sure that King Frinch is the only adversary to the holidays?
