{"about_the_game":"Hey Gamers,<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Overview</h2>This is a top-down survivor shooting game, where your goal is to kill as many enemies as possible. In this game, the world and enemies generate around you, creating a bullet hell scenario where you are constantly struggling to survive. Enemies will spawn off screen and will face and head towards you, so be on guard at all times.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2> <ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Tutorial<br></li><li>Score and High Score (based on number of enemies killed)<br></li><li>Epic sound track by Gabe Orellana<br></li><li>Cool sprites from the Youtube channel Brackeys</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About the Developer</h2>Hello, I am a young game developer, currently in my senior year of Uni, majoring in Civil Engineering. I have been learning Unity on my off-time for four years now and am finally publishing my first game to Steam. Last year I made several mods for the game Endless Legend, and even made a Youtube channel teaching people how to mod the game. I will try to update the game as frequently as I can, but that all depends on the amount of work I have.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Future Plans</h2>I plan to add a story to this, as well as add more music and better graphics. As for the gameplay, I plan to add RPG elements to make the game more dynamic. I also plan to improve the AI so that enemies can dodge bullets. Technically that is a feature already, but because there are many bullets on the screen, the AI doesnt have enough time to dodge all of them.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1743120/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1679533410","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1743120/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1679533410","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1743120/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1679533410","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1743120/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1679533410","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Hey Gamers,<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Overview</h2>This is a top-down survivor shooting game, where your goal is to kill as many enemies as possible.
