{"about_the_game":"There you were, ecstatic that you had been chosen to serve as the grand wizard's newest apprentice.

Yes you barely know any spells and now you've got to hunt down the world-ending abominations but I'm sure it'll be fine. You'll get stronger as you traverse through the almost randomly designed worlds and will have the option to learn some new spells along the way. Plus the enemies will drop money which can happily be transmuted into further upgrades for you.

It is played from a top-down perspective and rewards you even greater the further into a world you get before dying. To help get further, you can level up your character, becoming stronger as you do.
