{"about_the_game":"Playable character Toxik Karess has such a rebellious soul that he has somehow coerced the prison warden into allowing him to wear his tight leather outfit within the brick wall confinements.  Likely the source of the threats the warden felt was due to the venomous nature of Mr Toxik Karess.  While other prisoners have normal balls, with the exception of one fire ball inmate, Toxik Karess has balls so poisonous that one touch can make anyone deadly sick.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nToxik Karess has the ability to change all balls reflected with his paddle into a surging ball of venom that can put other inmates in a cloud of toxic gas which slows them down considerably due to the illness inflicted. He is immune to getting ill at the touch of his own balls but loves it when other prisoners touch his balls!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1131440/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1567168194","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1131440/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1567168194","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1131440/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1567168194","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1131440/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1567168194","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"Intended for a mature audience as this DLC and game it expands on includes suggestive sexual humor and material that may not be suitable for younger people."},"detailed_description":"Playable character Toxik Karess has such a rebellious soul that he has somehow coerced the prison warden into allowing him to wear his tight leather outfit within the brick wall confinements.
