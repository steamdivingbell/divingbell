However, they aren't without their fair share of skeletons in the closet, and you need revenge.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3151980/extras/EverythingIsABullet.gif?t=1727998321\" /><br><br>No ammo? No Problem! Everything is a bullet if you throw it hard enough. When your gun runs dry, there's another one waiting for you in the arms of the nearest enemy. Weave in and out of combat, juggling the security team's whole arsenal in the process. With over 15 guns to pick up, ranging from pistols to snipers and rifles to grenade launchers, you'll always be able to pack a punch. If you ever find yourself without a weapon, just &quot;convince&quot; the nearest employee to lend you theirs with a swift kick to the mouth.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3151980/extras/ExpressiveMovement.gif?t=1727998321\" /><br><br>Express yourself with a robust movement system that allows for on the fly adjustments and pin point accurate positioning! You'll be dashing, wall jumping, double jumping, crouch sliding, slide hopping, grappling, and more with each run. While there is plenty of options available to you, everything was made with players of all skill levels in mind. From first time movement shooter players, to professional speed runners, you'll feel right at home here!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3151980/extras/ChooseYourPath.gif?t=1727998321\" /><br><br>Every run lets you choose your own path up the tower. Do you stick to combat runs that grant lots of money and potential upgrades? Do you challenge the Elite Guard for huge rewards? Or maybe leave it up to chance and roll the dice in an unmarked location on your map that could be anything!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3151980/extras/CallToAction.gif?t=1727998321\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3151980/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727998321","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3151980/page.bg.jpg?t=1727998321","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3151980/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727998321","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3151980/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727998321","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3166510,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3151980/extras/Welcome.gif?t=1727998321\" /><br><br>Welcome to SECOND ESSENCE INC., where for the right price, you too can enjoy eternal life!
