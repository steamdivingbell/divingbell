Sometimes the medbay may be overrun with aliens, other times maintenance might be running off of emergency power, new challenges and areas await you every single game. Sometimes you step into the shoes of a battle-hardened janitor, making a daring escape for unknown horrors, other times you may take the role of an unexperienced security guard, with barely enough ammo to get by. Every station unique, every story unique<br><br>Looking for more information? Beta access? Development info?
