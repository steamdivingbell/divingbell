Whether he can actually save the world and bring home the glory is another question entirely.<br><br>And so we enter this retro-inspired RPG world where YOU determine the outcome! Your choices will determine the fate of Hero Man and the world at large. Help Hero Man save the world of Somewhere from the sinister Lord Doldrum ... or do nothing of the sort if you so please! Will you help bring peace to the world or break the story line in some horrible way? The answer is up to you!<br><br>In this satirical take on an old-school JRPG, you'll guide Hero Man on a journey that is very brief and meaningless indeed, and find up to 18 fun, heroic, and grisly endings that take 2-20 minutes each!
