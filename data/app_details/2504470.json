I got your back!<br><br><strong>Get ready for a Zen-like experience</strong><br>Doodle Taxi's main thing is being a chill taxi driving simulator game. Enjoy this beautiful world as you cruise around and color it in while unraveling the story!

Not getting paid? Get mugged? No. A cabbie can get cursed by a witch and lose his sight. What if that witch is unable to control her powers in this world? What happens then?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2504470/extras/car_start.gif?t=1733495443\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WHAT THE CAR!?</h2><br>This is a car game obviously. And we should have cars, more than one. Unlockable, locked behind some in-game currency. But don't worry, you can earn all these without spending real money. This is a game by a gamer who misses old days for the gamers who are sick of those modern tricks to squeeze more and more money from player. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2504470/extras/car_finish.gif?t=1733495443\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">STORY WISE, WHAT'S GOING ON?</h2><br>You can play forever, there is a high replayability. Story part? Eh, this one is pretty straight forward. You can easily understand and enjoy core gameplay even more. It's not a Shakespeare, but this witch is quite the poet!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A BANGER SOUNDTRACK</h2>When I say banger soundtrack, be sure that I'm telling truth. I'm so glad that so many talented indie musicians donated their awesome songs into this one, including;<br>Abstraction / Cat Temper / Obsidian Contraption / Colourful Energy / Dragon-Orb / Vercin Featherix / No Lake / Nelson &amp; Bernstein / SparraLIMB<br><br><strong>Wrapping up</strong><br>So drive your car fast and careful, keep that 'being a good driver' meter at green, deliver customers on time. That's the name of the game.
