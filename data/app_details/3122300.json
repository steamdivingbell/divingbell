{"about_the_game":"Highlights of SCP FATAL FLEE Made with Unreal Engine<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis puzzle adventure game is made by a sixteen-year-old high school student. He has taught himself UE Engine for about five months, and  uses three months to finish this gamemaking. This  game has the following features:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirst, the puzzles in the game are related to the characteristics of SCPs or the facility's systems. Players need to solve puzzles to unlock new areas or find key items. These puzzles may include combination locks, logic puzzles, environmental puzzles, etc. Players need to explore the SCP Foundation's facilities designed like labyrinths with multiple rooms, corridors, and hidden areas, adding to the challenge of exploration and the atmosphere of tension.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSecond, the game has diverse Endings. Depending on the player's choices and puzzle-solving methods, the game may have multiple endings, which may cover successfully escaping, being trapped, or triggering special events related to certain SCPs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are also many innovations in this game.<br />\r\nFirst, the level design is divided into light containment area, heavy containment area and office area. This game is different from the previous SCP games in that other SCP containment need to go to the control room to open the door lock of light containment area leading to heavy  containment area. This version needs to explore the underground area of SCP 939, press a button, and then go to the control room to open the door lock to lead to heavy containment area.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSecond, Chinese elements have been added in this version, such as some internet hot stalks, which increase the interest of the game and make players laugh while being frightened.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThird, the SCP characters in this version have added some new special effects, which are more concrete. For example, in the previous game version, door B ending seems a little hasty, but in this version, SCP682' s performance in door B is more concrete and vivid than before, and it is more powerful. Besides, in the player will enter the red area of 106\u2019s dimensional pocket after being touched by SCP 106. And the red area in this version is different from the previous version, SCP 106 will suddenly rush to the player's scene, which will cause visual and psychological shock to the player.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3122300/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731674215","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3122300/page.bg.jpg?t=1731674215","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3122300/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731674215","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3122300/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731674215","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Highlights of SCP FATAL FLEE Made with Unreal Engine<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis puzzle adventure game is made by a sixteen-year-old high school student.
