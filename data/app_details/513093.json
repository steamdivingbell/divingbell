{"about_the_game":"The British Railways Class A2 Livery Pack, which requires the LNER Peppercorn Class A2 'Blue Peter' Loco Add-On to use, enables you to drive the A2 as it appeared under British Railways ownership in the 1950s-60s. <br><br>The Arthur Peppercorn-designed A2 Class locomotive was built at Doncaster Works between 1947 and 1948. The design was a move towards modernity, with features such as a self-cleaning smokebox and electric lighting prominent in the out-shopped locomotives. The class was designed for express passenger work and all locomotives were initially turned out in LNER\u2019s apple green livery, with repainting into British Railways\u2019 Brunswick green livery beginning in 1949. All locomotive names followed LNER\u2019s tradition of using famous racehorse names. <br><br>The British Railways Class A2 Livery Pack for Train Simulator includes the A2 in BR Brunswick Green, with clean and weathered variants, and with both early and late British Railways logos.
