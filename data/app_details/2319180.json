The puzzles are designed to challenge your problem-solving skills and provide an immersive gameplay experience. Additionally, you'll engage in swordplay, make sudden choices critical to your survival and wield magic to defeat the horrific monstrosities that lurk in the area.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game's mechanics offer an engaging RPG experience that will keep players hooked for hours. You'll be able to wield and improve different weapons, use a detailed inventory system, build traps, concoct potions, improve skills, and discover new spells to aid you in your journey.
