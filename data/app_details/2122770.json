{"about_the_game":"A 2 player turn-based strategy game with hack n slash element in a fantasy setting.<br />\r\n Players secretly set up their pieces and terrain tiles on their half of the 8x8 battleboard and once both players are ready play commences. Pieces move and attack in a fashion similar to Chess, white moves first  then black while other pieces impede your movement. Pieces capture other pieces by moving to occupy the enemy square and removing the enemy piece. Capturing is always the end of your turn. Whoever captures the opposing King first wins however there is no check as in Chess.<br />\r\nTiles<br />\r\nMountains x 4 (red)<br />\r\nThis tile is impassable to all units except Dragons. Only Crossbowman may attack Dragons that are on mountain tiles. Players may not have more than two contiguous mountains.
