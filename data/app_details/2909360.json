{"about_the_game":"Welcome to Beat in Zero, a deck-building RPG where randomness and strategy intersect.<br>In Beat in Zero, you can always see your opponent's hand, but the path to victory is not so simple.<br>Each turn, you must roll the die of fate and make the best possible move at limited cost. Anticipate your opponent's next move and develop your own strategy.<br><br>Build your deck from the cards you have obtained and make the best choices.<br>However, one mistake could end it all.<br>With the game over, your adventure record will be lost and you will not be able to walk the same path again.<br>Make careful decisions and use many cards to reach the &quot;Card of Zero&quot;.<br><br>Each time you clear the game, new cards are unlocked, further deepening the game. Even if you are defeated, your score will accumulate and you will eventually have a chance to unlock new cards.<br>The replayable nature of the game allows players to build different decks for the same characters, providing a completely new experience and playing strategy each time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"></h2><strong>Btattle Features</strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2909360/extras/Battle.gif?t=1717686118\" /><br><strong>Open hand strategy</strong>: Play with all cards in the enemy's hand visible.
