{"about_the_game":"Recruit a huge cast of friends from four different base classes that branch into over a dozen variations, and always build the best party for the job! Explore one long, twisting dungeon that only gets more perilous the further you go, with plenty of optional quests and side areas to unlock! The original Dungeon Travelers game takes place in a separate world from the others, drawing characters instead from the fan-beloved world of the PS2 anime classic <i><strong>To Heart 2</strong></i>.<br><br><strong>Prepare at the Guild!</strong><br>Whenever you stop for a respite from exploring, you can identify your new gear, reequip and restructure your team, or even upgrade your characters' classes along branching paths!<br><br><strong>Explore the Dungeon!</strong><br>The Auto-Map function will fill in the grid with each step, letting you know where you are and where you've been. Be careful, though! Don't try to go too far at once...<br><br><strong>Battle &amp; Collect Monsters!</strong><br>The deeper you delve into the dungeon, the more dangerous the monsters will become.
