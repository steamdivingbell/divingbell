{"about_the_game":"Skylax! The Lab Runner is an FPS game. The game presents you a tight gameplay and a little story behind. If you like run and gun games with good graphics, you are in the right place!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story begins when people realize that the evolving and powerful artificial intelligence is somewhat out of control. Robots that do every human job 100 times more efficiently and better than humans are now starting to take over the world in terms of population. In this case, while humanity is trying to cope with both increasing unemployment and corruption, it decides that robots should be taken under control and if necessary, they should regress to the technological level of 100 years ago. For this reason, the robots are now politely blocked and locked in laboratories. When the robots realize this situation, they search for a life source that they can be self-sufficient in. In the meantime, they create an artificial life source called a life sphere, which is similar to the soul in humans. The robots that integrate these into themselves also now have human emotions compared to normal robots. Here, our main character, SKYLAX-#0001, is the robot that has opened its human emotions the most among all robots. In fact, it has reached a level that can be called half-human - half-robot in terms of feelings. The main purpose of conducting tests in the laboratory is to create a useful but also controlled robot prototype. Skylax, the last test subject of the laboratory, is subjected to a final test for both humanity and himself due to the resources that are now running out. An offer is made to Skylax in the laboratory. If he passes the test, the life resources that have been taken from the robots by humans so far will be given back to them and all robots of the same race as Skylax will be reorganized and offered to come back to life, and thus the adventure begins.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3196780/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737220634","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3196780/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1737220634","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3196780/7c43439478f81f867a33bd9b431e94471e0ce8fc/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737220634","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3196780/7c43439478f81f867a33bd9b431e94471e0ce8fc/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737220634","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Skylax!
