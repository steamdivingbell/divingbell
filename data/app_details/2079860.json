{"about_the_game":"A lone celestial warrior travels across his cosmic and forsaken afterlife to rid the evil taking root. Each locale writhes in shadow and decay where horrifying, lovecraftian-inspired monstrosities lurk. Through combat prowess and careful exploration, the warrior must be vigilant with his mental constitution as he traverses his once-idyllic lands to cleanse them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFragments of the Afterlife showcases Souls-like inspired combat set in an afterlife in the faraway cosmos, where the wisps of animals and mortals live after death.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFragments comprises four domains, each adapting a unique biome with fantastical yet grounded landscapes. The game takes inspiration from famous mythologies and imbues them with conventional dark fantasy elements. For instance, one domain contains a ruined city under the moonlit shade of a towering tree. In this domain, a Caretaker \u2013 one of four elemental guardians \u2013 oversees each domain until our warriors return.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe theme of perseverance is rooted in his journey. He is a fallen celestial tasked with reclaiming his afterlife and to achieve this must vanquish his Caretakers in the form of climactic boss fights. They, now twisted in mind and body, serve the Shapeshifter, who is hellbent on blanketing the afterlife in total darkness.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2079860/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1696807247","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2079860/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1696807247","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2079860/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1696807247","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2079860/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1696807247","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"The developers describe the content like this:\r\n\r\nThis Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence or Gore, General Mature Content"},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"A lone celestial warrior travels across his cosmic and forsaken afterlife to rid the evil taking root.
