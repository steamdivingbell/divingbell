Reading a diary left by the estranged son, a Catholic mother (Hadley Boyd) finds a way to transcend herself and her grief by imagining him alive and in love. With heart-wrenching performances by Michael DeBartolo and Christopher Vo in volumetric video and the storytelling potential of spatial sound, Ark allows you to enter her imagination and co-create the lovers\u2019 intimate dance through your body position and movements. An Intel Studios Original co-produced with Cloudred.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Attic</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1447740/extras/MH-scene1.jpg?t=1614296650\" /><br>The viewer finds herself in a dimly lit attic bedroom, a place that seems to be stuck in time, heavy with memory. Here, you assume the passive role of an observer in a 360\u02da environment. Unable to move, you can examine the memorabilia-laden surroundings and begin to get an idea of time, place and what the story might be about. Mary-Helen begins reading her son\u2019s diary.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>El Matador</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1447740/extras/scene2-alt.jpg?t=1614296650\" /><br>As Mary-Helen begins to imagine her son\u2019s world, you are transported to a beautiful beach at dawn. Sebastian and his lover Alex appear, like a daydream nearby in the landscape. We allow Sebastian to break the 4th wall and directly implicate you in the scene. We position you quite close to the two men, just outside their personal space as you listen to their conversation. As Mary-Helen finds freedom in her imagination, you too now have the freedom to move around the beach as the experience transforms into 6DoF.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Memory</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1447740/extras/dancers-on-the-beach.jpg?t=1614296650\" /><br>The scene crossfades to an abstraction of the beach. Sebastian and Alex begin an intimate dance. Depending on how you move in the space, the dancers appear to respond to your presence. The performance has been choreographed as a series of segments, each visitor sees only 5 out of possible 24 combinations within each play session. Replay it to see other potential variations, follow the blue glowing lights to hear Mary-Helen reading Sebastian\u2019s diary entries. Raise both arms to gain a new perspective, point your arms forward to fly!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Back in the Attic</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1447740/extras/MH-scene4.jpg?t=1614296650\" /><br>As the lovers fade away, you are now back in the attic. It is the magic hour. The room is lit with a flat, golden light, reminiscent of the light on the beach. With a return of detail and color, it feels like the room has come back to life. Mary-Helen contemplates her new found sense of self.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Note</strong></h2><i>Queerskins: ARK</i> is a room scale experience. It can be adjusted for available space:<br>\u2014 Small (10\u2019x10\u2019 / 3x3 m)<br>\u2014 Medium (20\u2019x20\u2019 / 6x6 m) \u2014 Default<br>\u2014 Large (30\u2019x30\u2019 / 9x9 m)<br><br>Subtitles are available in English, Spanish, Italian and Polish.
