The nearby volcano hasn't ceased erupting, support for neighbouring towns has lessened and kobold brigands terrorize the countryside. What's more, the Golden Candelabra, an artifact that protected Dawnsbury for generation, has been lost that same night.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">But now new heroes may rise up: you play as the Dawnsbury Four, a group of childhood friends who have trained for years under the tutelage of the town mentor Roderick, and are now finally ready to embark on their first quest: to find and retrieve the Golden Candelabra and bring it back to Dawnsbury where it belongs.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">But even that may only usher in further dangers and provoke whatever sinister force is behind all these woes...</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Accurate to tabletop</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dawnsbury Days uses the rules of PF2E, the second edition of a powerful tabletop OGL ruleset, and strives to remain as faithful to them as possible, so that the gameplay of Dawnsbury Days mirrors your experiences when playing with friends around the table.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You play exclusively in turn-based mode on grid-based battlefields, and you can preview and review all dice rolls required to make attacks, saving throws or to deal damage.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game also tries to replicate the elusive 'feel' of a tabletop roleplaying game, with story, characters and encounter design all in service to that goal.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Deep character customization</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You choose your characters' ancestry, heritage, background, class, subclass, ability scores, skills, feats, spells and items \u2014 and that's just at level one.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">On each level up (up to level 4, which is the level cap), you select from additional feats (and for spellcasters, spells) to further customize your character.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There is a wide variety of weapons, armor and consumable items to complement your character.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">But you can also choose to skip all of that and use one of the eight pregen characters which are pre-built for each level, complete with items.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Additional scenarios and modding support</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Besides the main adventure path, you can also fight additional scenarios with minimum story but with the same engaging gameplay.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can also download custom encounters created by modders for an additional challenge and variety. Some of these can be really difficult and unique!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dawnsbury Days is fully moddable.
