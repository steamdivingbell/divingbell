{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Star Vortex is a top-down ARPG space shooter that follows the formula of classic titles such as Diablo 2. Humanity is fighting wars on all fronts. Suddenly a new threat appears out of nowhere and begins attacking the human forces. Earth must be warned about this new danger and it is up to you to escort the mothership back home to deliver the unsettling news.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2675890/extras/animation1.gif?t=1738744149\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You play as a pilot of a fighter ship who must venture out into the space sector to find the gateway keys that will allow the mothership to reach Earth. Throughout your journey, you will gain experience allowing you to level up and upgrade your ship from a small frigate to a massive battleship while collecting equipment that synergizes with your build and playstyle. Explore randomly generated sectors fighting elite enemies and bosses then work your way up through difficulties.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2675890/extras/design.png?t=1738744149\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Along with creating an ultimate build to match your playstyle and searching for the best equipment you can visit the shipyard on the mothership to design your perfect ship. Starting with a small frigate, as you gain experience and level up, you can increase the size of your ship, from a small fighter to a destroyer to a cruiser and finally a huge battleship.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2675890/extras/animation2.gif?t=1738744149\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Unlock new weapon and equipment slots allowing you to increase the total number of weapons and equipment that you can use at one time. From lasers to projectile weapons to rocket launchers and automatic turrets, the possibilities are endless as to how you fit your ship.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Every aspect of the ship is available for you to design. From its appearance to the placement of the weapons and equipment slots, you are free to design your ship how you see fit. Save your favourite creative designs and share them with friends and the community, with a ship design import and export option.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2675890/extras/explore.png?t=1738744149\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Randomly generated sectors make every game different but your navigation system will help you plot your course. How you tackle your exploration of a sector is your decision to make. Do you take charge and head directly for the boss or do you take your time and explore levelling up? Perhaps you will take a detour to scavenge for rare and legendary upgrades and equipment. The choice is yours, but danger lurks in every system.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2675890/extras/animation3.gif?t=1738744149\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Not all systems are the same, some contain environmental dangers such as heat which without protection will cause your ship to burn, or corrosion that will damage your ship over time. There is also the threat, where the invaders can attack without warning. All could be peaceful as you collect the spoils of battle only to suddenly, be invaded by this strange new and relentless enemy. You must always be alert and prepared, as with great rewards come great risks.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2675890/extras/destroy.png?t=1738744149\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Put your equipment, upgrades, and skills to use and lay waste to your enemies throughout your journey.
