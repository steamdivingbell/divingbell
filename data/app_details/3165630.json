{"about_the_game":"&quot;  Starfinder 2 RPG - Starfinder Playtest Society Scenario #2: It Came from the Vast!<br> <br> A Starfinder Second Edition Playtest adventure designed for 5th-level characters. <br> Countless derelict and abandoned starships litter space--some damaged beyond repair, some containing valuable cargo, and others empty save for the dead. The Xenowarden starship <br> Bloom is one such ship. During a routine survey mission to a newly discovered dwarf planet in the Vast, the crew of the <br> Bloom collected a variety of biological and environmental samples, secured the samples for further study, and departed, plotting a course through the Drift to a mobile research laboratory in the Pact Worlds. <br> The <br> Bloom that emerged in Pact Worlds' space was much changed--unresponsive, careening out of control, and with no sign of the ship's crew. Explore the biomechanical corridors of the <br> Bloom to uncover the fate of its missing crew and face off against a dangerous, alien predator that can't be allowed to survive. <br> The <br> Bloom is haunted. That's the least of your problems. <br> Welcome to the Starfinder Playtest! You can directly shape the future of the Starfinder Roleplaying Game by participating in a fun and rigorous playtest period using the Starfinder Playtest Rulebook and one of several playtest adventures--including Starfinder Playtest Scenarios! Each Starfinder Playtest Scenario is a short, single-session adventure designed to be played in 2-3 hours and written by a member of the Starfinder Team. <br> <br>  This product is not a PDF or accessible outside of Fantasy Grounds.
