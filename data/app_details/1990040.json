{"about_the_game":"Enjoy a long-awaited reunion with the Boron in X4: Kingdom End, the fourth expansion for X4: Foundations, which completes the collection of the main factions in the X Universe. Discover the unique Boron ships, and fly them through distinctive systems, on a journey of discovery. Visit fascinating places, uncover old secrets and make new acquaintances.

Flickering lights on a previously inactive jump gate are causing a stir. Joining forces in the name of cooperation, a multifactional expedition sets out to investigate the phenomenon.

X4: Kingdom End introduces a wide variety of Boron ships of different classes, which excel with their fluid designs, their wavelike shell animation, and their distinctive grace and uniqueness. Come aboard and experience what may very well be the most breath-taking ships in the X-Universe.
