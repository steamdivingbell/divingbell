To play the Lord of Storms expansion, you must start a new game of Nox Archaist. You cannot import a saved game from the pre-expansion version. The Lord of Storms Expansion includes the complete original storyline along with the expansion content, so once you start a new game you will be able to play the full Nox Archaist scenario. To activate the new content, talk to Lord Estintar in Nourtheld Castle. Ask him about STORMS. After doing this, you can continue with your current quests, or you can work on the quest given by Lord Estintar.<br><br>Like all of the Nox Archaist quests, you can start the Lord of Storms with characters at any level. Nevertheless, the Lord of Storms content is designed for a level 4 or 5 party that has been trained and is using level 4 or 5 gear. For players who want to focus more on puzzles and have less challenging combat, a level 5 party would be better. Parties below level 4 may find the adventure too challenging, while those significantly above level 5 may be overpowered. For players who want to dive into the new content, the expansion includes two pregenerated parties of levels 4 and 5.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2388930/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1683086153","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2388930/page.bg.jpg?t=1683086153","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2388930/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1683086153","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2388930/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1683086153","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You have learned of Lord Estintar\u2019s suspicions that the cult has something to do with the increase in storm activity.
