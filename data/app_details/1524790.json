{"about_the_game":"An experimental, minimalistic art game that explores a single emotion and takes only a few minutes to play through. Loneliness is a simple top-down exploration game where the only available input is movement.

It was featured prominently by Extra Credits (Season 4, Episode 3: Mechanics as Metaphor) and others,  and received a variety of accolades, including being nominated for the Extra Credits Innovation Awards. Other people said the game was the worst thing they'd ever played--but at least it wasn't on Steam.<br><br>This is a <strong>10th anniversary release</strong> that is true to the original game, except that the end screen has been notably removed, as described at the game's home page.
