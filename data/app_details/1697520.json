{"about_the_game":"MakeDungeons is an animated and 3D virtual tabletop simulator with tools designed to integrate any tabletop game inside it, and play them among friends. Also,  you can use a simple scripting system to make events and NPC (Non-player character) behaviours to create a living world. Players can select a pre-made adventure and begin playing immediately, or create one for themselves. So, you can play your favorite TTRPG and their modules in a video game style, such as Neverwinter and Baldur\u2019s Gate series.

The Virtual DM completely takes over the role of a DM and your game is run based on events that is set for the game.
