Compete with yourself and the entire Steam Community to see how quickly you can collect all the items.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe second mode is a PVP multiplayer mode that allows up to four players to battle on unique maps. Knock your friends out and throw them off the stage to secure yourself victory. Be careful of the bombs as they will mess up your day. It is known that if a player takes a bomb to they face they may find themselves thrown directly at the camera...ouch. The multiplayer mode currently has 3 beautiful maps, with more set to be released. The candy junction map features a real time fully interactive chocolate liquid simulation that has never before been added into any video game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n**Note: Multiplayer requires the use of at least one gamepad**<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can make use of Steam Remote Play and invite your friends from all over the world to play the multiplayer version of Grocery Grab! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game will bring you nothing but joy as you take control of a cute little character who lives in a silly world of force/mass interactions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnjoy the experience.","achievements":{"total":0},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2403730/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1689932315","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2403730/page.bg.jpg?t=1689932315","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2403730/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1689932315","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2403730/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1689932315","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":2461320,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"This fast paced active ragdoll physics game is divided into two sections. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first mode is a single player speed running game where the player is in a grocery store and has to collect food items as quickly as possible whilst avoiding customers and an angry boss.
