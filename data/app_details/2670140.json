{"about_the_game":"Give your players some gorgeous faces to look at when they\u2019re talking to NPCs with Seraph Circle Crystal Portraiture! Jo Seraph is back with another faceset pack in their beautiful painted style, this time with neck up images of 24 unique characters. Facesets and pictures for each character let you choose whether you want to use faces in messages or busts in your game, and grayscale and negative versions can help you create the perfect cutscene. Create memorable moments with recurring NPCs such as a troublemaking man with wavy hair and a piercing near his eye and his friend with a bowl cut, a thin-faced woman with hair tied in a bun and her pigtail wearing daughters, a brother/sister duo with curly hair and kind eyes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach character comes with 4 hair colors and 5 skin colors, leading to a whopping 576 different images to help you populate your world! Have your heroes buy equipment from a blonde man with a rounded face and infectious grin in one town, while a white-haired version runs the pub in a city across the world. Or have a redhead run every town\u2019s inn but use a different face for each so that it seems like only redheads are allowed to own inns. As a bonus this pack also includes legacy portraits of Jo Seraph\u2019s older works, with even more character facesets in a more anime/cartoon style, so you can choose the right style to fit your game\u2019s aesthetic.
