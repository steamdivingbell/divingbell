You face mutated, carnivorous plant life, mind-bending anomalies, living computers, fanatical cults, space vampires and more as you traverse its many regions in a desperate search for resources and allies. Explore dark infected caverns, soar past glistening technological landscapes, and navigate chaotic mineral fields, all animated in Klei Entertainment's signature hand-drawn 2D style.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SURVIVAL AT ALL COSTS</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1766500/extras/Dread_Pilots_SurviveAtAllCosts-V2.gif?t=1731528738\" />The life of a Dread pilot is short and cheap. Combat can pay off if you have the advantage, but it\u2019s perilous if you don't. Explore carefully, judge the risks well, and always keep an eye on your tenuous connection to reality or you may just find yourself blown to pieces - or worse. Sometimes information gathering, trade, and diplomacy is the more prudent option.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE RIGHT TOOLS FOR THE JOB</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1766500/extras/Dread_Pilots_RightTools-v2.gif?t=1731528738\" />You arrive in the Dread in a simple cargo ship with limited capabilities. To survive you\u2019ll need to buy, borrow, or steal something better. Upgrade your ship by fabricating parts with the resources that you find. You can cozy up to a faction to gain access to their technologies, or 'liberate' that technology the hard way. Build your pilot's skills as you go to unlock new ways to solve problems - but these skills bring trade-offs with them that you\u2019ll need to navigate.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LIVE OUT YOUR OWN STORY</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1766500/extras/Dread_Pilots_Ven_Loop.gif?t=1731528738\" />The Dread is alive with possibilities, and uncompromising with its consequences.  Interconnected ecosystems of flora and fauna will both help and hinder you. Everyone you meet can either aid you or thwart your will.

Buddy up with powerful factions from the chemically cheerful Trading Guild, to the rock-worshiping Xenoliths. Each pilot you meet remembers what you've done, and they aren't shy about holding a grudge. Make the right contacts, and you'll have friends to call on when you need them most.
