{"about_the_game":"Rebuild the Calendar of Selardi to experience <i>Werewolf: The Apocalypse \u2014 The Book of Hungry Names</i> as one of the relentless hunters of the Galestalkers or as a member of the secretive and ruthless Ghost Council. Even if you don\u2019t join one of those tribes, use the Calendar to unlock more Gifts once you swear yourself to a Patron Spirit. Unlock entirely new Gifts that let you steal magic from your enemies with Crow, shatter mystic bonds with the Hummingbird Prince, or call down lightning with the Stormcat.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3200880?t=1731611033","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3200880?t=1731611033","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3200880/e0bdbc50c5cdffaa495245851ef9a22ea55ed84f/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731611033","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3200880/e0bdbc50c5cdffaa495245851ef9a22ea55ed84f/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731611033","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Rebuild the Calendar of Selardi to experience <i>Werewolf: The Apocalypse \u2014 The Book of Hungry Names</i> as one of the relentless hunters of the Galestalkers or as a member of the secretive and ruthless Ghost Council.
