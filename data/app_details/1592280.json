It draws inspiration heavily from F.E.A.R. in terms of action set pieces, while mixing exploration elements from Half-Life, along with some more modern features.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1592280/extras/STORY.png?t=1739223518\" /><br>The story takes place during a violent invasion on Selaco, a massive space station that's home to the surviving refugees after the fall of Earth. You play as Dawn, an ACE Security Captain who, with her recent promotion and high level security clearances, is digging deep into the truth behind Selaco's murky history. Before she can finish her investigation, Selaco is rocked by explosions and armed invaders. While Selaco may take place in a large-scale conflict, much of it will be the personal story of Dawn, the center-piece of the game.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1592280/extras/FEATURES.gif?t=1739223518\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A lengthy story-driven campaign</li></ul>Selaco is a story-driven experience, and we don't say that lightly.
