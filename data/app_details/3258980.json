We also sought to create environments that closely resemble real life, spending considerable time crafting many art assets independently rather than piecing together pre-made ones from asset libraries.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">However, as the producer, I made many mistakes during this process.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">First, I severely underestimated the complexity of developing the game\u2019s content. As development progressed, the trials, errors, and continuous learning caused time to slip away much faster than anticipated.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Additionally, I mistakenly led the studio into a scam, resulting in the waste of a substantial amount of time and resources. Worse still, we lost the fruits of our hard work. These failures severely damaged the trust among the studio members.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Ultimately, we had to face the reality of disbanding, and the team members each sought new directions for their careers.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">By mid-year, I managed to settle the remaining debts. Afterward, I reached out to an old colleague from the studio. Over the past few months, the two of us recovered and reorganized some of the original art assets, and in our spare time, we completed the early version of <i>Unwhole Hill\u00b7LAKE</i>. Unfortunately, due to the lack of sufficient time, the game will not include English localization at launch, and for that, I sincerely apologize. We plan to release additional levels and English localization by Christmas.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">After experiencing these ups and downs, I\u2019ve come to deeply understand the importance of steady and deliberate progress in game development. Moving forward, we will be much more cautious, learning from past lessons and striving to deliver a more sincere and high-quality game to all of you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3258980/extras/HighresScreenshot00003.png?t=1730458259\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Thank you for reading this far, and I hope to witness the completion of the game alongside all of you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Plutinos<br>September 27, 2024 \u2013 Evening</p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is a first-person puzzle-solving game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the northwest outskirts of Cangling City lies a lesser-known national nature reserve, Ping Lake.
