{"about_the_game":"<strong>Sudoku</strong> (\u6570\u72ec s\u016bdoku, digit-single) - is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9\u00d79 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3\u00d73 subgrids that compose the grid (also called &quot;boxes&quot;, &quot;blocks&quot;, or &quot;regions&quot;) contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. <br><br>Killer Sudoku puzzles include all the rules of regular Sudoku but add in dashed-line 'cages' which must sum to given values. Killer Sudoku is also sometimes known as Sumdoku, Mathdoku or Addoku.<br><br>The name 'Killer' Sudoku arises because of the wicked twist on the standard Sudoku puzzle, since you must not only place each of the numbers 1 to 9 (or 1 to the size of the puzzle) into each of the rows, columns and bold-lined 3x3 (or other size) boxes but you must also place the numbers into each dashed-line cage so that they add up to its given total - and without repeating a digit in a dashed-line cage. \u00a9<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 100 killer Sudoku Killer puzzles<br></li><li> Level's progress save<br></li><li> Beautiful minimalist design, multiple color themes<br></li><li> 10 ambient relaxing soundtracks<br></li><li> Steam Achievements<br></li><li> Trading Cards, Badge, Emoticons and Backgrounds (Coming soon)<br></li><li> Cross-platform Steam Cloud saves<br></li><li> As always - Windows, Mac and Linux support</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/861270/extras/su.png?t=1646329081\" /> <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/861270/extras/sj.png?t=1646329081\" /> <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/861270/extras/sk.png?t=1646329081\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Easy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/861270/9c4361798f03a2300bd628ebde416bf9fa1aa031.jpg"},{"name":"Medium","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/861270/4163078a0e1471382c0c081d298b6b77c5fbc0b0.jpg"},{"name":"Hard","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/861270/cd80800c37384f08d4607f56b55672a5fef5d8fd.jpg"},{"name":"Killer Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/861270/60ca34196193cfb3dd1540a8f01ce2f98e1d36d0.jpg"}],"total":4},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/861270/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1646329081","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/861270/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1646329081","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/861270/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1646329081","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/861270/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1646329081","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Sudoku</strong> (\u6570\u72ec s\u016bdoku, digit-single) - is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle.
