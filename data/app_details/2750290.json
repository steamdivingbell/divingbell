{"about_the_game":"Toki Pona Island is 2D language learning adventure game!<br><br>After a teleportation incident, you wake up on a tropical island inhabited by a variety of interesting locals.

Slowly, but surely you'll acquire more of the language, learn to understand the grammar, and build familiarity with common phrases.
