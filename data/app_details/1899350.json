Borrowing from the mechanics of some &quot;idle&quot; and &quot;roguelike&quot; games, progress is made by banking funds for future runs after you are margin called, and upgrades can enhance the speed of simulation, increase margin equity, unlock advanced indicators, and per its name, engage automation techniques.<br><br>In gamifying a process known as &quot;backtesting&quot; in economics, Trade Bots players test their own trading strategies against 5,000+ real, historic stock/ETF/crypto data dating back to as early as the 1950s to present day. Over the course of the campaign, design intricate trading bots using a custom-built visual node editor.
