{"about_the_game":"Rejecting the dogmatic vision of the machine and its endless production, you are cast down into darkness. But in the darkness, a bargain is struck with a foe of old. Ascend the machine citadel with eyes open, and bring a reckoning upon those who ruined the world before it was all iron, blood, and bones.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2741830/extras/embed_roguelitemetroidvania.png?t=1733963034\" /><br>Explore the machine citadel, find secret paths to hidden chambers, and establish a foothold in the belly of the machine. Return to a safe haven with your plundered skulls to discover new and unusual items. Or instead, set your sights on conquest, assemble a clutch of potent items, and risk it all against the monstrous denizens that lurk in the dark corners of the citadel. But beware, your mayhem in defiance of the machine will not go unnoticed - enemies assembled to defeat you will grow in potency and number the longer you wreak havoc.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2741830/extras/embed_explorethemachine.png?t=1733963034\" /><br>Death Machine mixes the wonder of classic metroidvania exploration, with exciting combat powered by a versatile roguelite item system.

Careful consideration when crafting your build will help you unlock certain pathways not accessible otherwise.
