My ultimate goal is to make mental health therapies more interesting and more accessible by transforming them into games/apps. However that process will take a lot of research, time and resources, so for now I am happy with making simple apps that help people de-stress, relax, and perhaps gain some skills while they are it. My main interest is in treating anxiety disorders and insomnia! Your support truly helps me making my goal come true! :)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-------------------------------------------------------<br />\r\nAbout This Game:<br />\r\nUsing the concepts of mindfulness and arts therapy in aiding relaxation and releasing mental stress; and inspired by a patient of mine, who finds art helpful in managing her anxiety disorder, however struggles to get started due to lack of confidence in her skill. <br />\r\nHopefully with Zen Arts, anyone, regardless of age or skills, can make great arts! The only limitation is your imagination!<br />\r\nThere is no winning or losing in this game, simply a sandbox to hopefully make your day a bit better!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1593570/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1619185132","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1593570/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1619185132","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1593570/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1619185132","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1593570/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1619185132","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Relax in nature sounds and create mesmerizing pendulum paintings with a simple click.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSuffering from stress, anxiety or sleep difficulty?
