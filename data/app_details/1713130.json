{"about_the_game":"<br><br>Aledorn is an RPG game that brings back several time-tested principles in a mixture of fantasy RPG/Dungeon. It\u00b4s primarily made for (and from) hard-core gamers and those who prefer games with high challenge level. As we\u2019ve already mentioned, our game has three basic features. Firstly, in the exploration GUI, you\u00b4ll get the chance to experience the world of Aledorn from the first person view in the same way as it was common for many classical dungeon crawlers. This GUI will serve for most of non-combat actions such as exploration, opening of treasure chests, searching for secrets, interaction with NPCs, collecting of herbs etc.<br><br>The second GUI will \u201caccompany\u201d you during numerous travels between game\u2019s locations. We\u00b4ve decided to avoid the profaned vast generic \u201copen-world filler&quot; creation so that we could invest more time and resources into improvements of the main game locations. This way, we\u00b4ll be able to make each of them more unique and unforgettable such as the locations from Baldur\u2019s Gate or Fallout series used to be. Apart from these fixed locations await you countless random encounters and secret areas which add to the player\u2019s feeling of being a part of a rich and living world.<br><br>An interesting part of travelling is the management of camping. When your characters need to stop for a while in the open, they may be assigned various actions via the camping management GUI. The results of these actions will strongly affect party members\u2019 statistics, possesions and overall group\u00b4s performance. The third (and for us also the most challenging and important) feature of Aledorn is its combat system. Combat GUI combines the isometric view and bird\u00b4s eye perspective to offer the maximal battlefield overview. The combat system of Aledorn also strives to get as close to the reality as it\u00b4s only possible. We want to avoid unnecessary frustration caused by restrictions of our combat system. We are especially proud of our battlegrounds. There are almost no predetermined battlegrounds for the duels that await our players. Combat GUI will place all party members and enemies at the same spot they were standing at just before the combat commenced. That means, clever maneuvering and decisions in the exploration GUI may put you into advantageous position at the beginning of combat and everything you see during exploration will be present and potentially usable during the fighting. <br>Apart from that, you may expect all the fun stuff of a classic RPG such as: party creation (with unique races and class selection), complex system of attributes, perks and skills, NPC with branched dialoque options, magic, alchemy, complex quests with multiple solutions and outcomes, detailed inventory management and difficulty settings, that apart from challenge level directly enable/disable many hardcore gameplay features.<br><br>Aledorn will be a combination of puzzles, branched dialogue options, tactical turn-based combat, quest-solving and last but not least intriguing and complex RPG-system. We were inspired by several masterpieces of the RPG/dungeon and strategy genre. Namely: Betrayal at Krondor, Realms of Arcania: Shadows over Riva, Might &amp; Magic, King's Bounty and Fallout series.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1713130?t=1723319533","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1713130/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1723319533","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1713130/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1723319533","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1713130/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1723319533","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":1923260,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<br><br>Aledorn is an RPG game that brings back several time-tested principles in a mixture of fantasy RPG/Dungeon.
