{"about_the_game":"Eris has had a rough life, and to her it feels like she's just living day to day, trying to make things work. She has always had a hard time connecting with others as the men and women in her life didn't stick around long enough to build meaningful relationships, and sometimes it feels like the whole world is against her. Therapy has helped Eris cope with her anxiety and depression, but it's expensive and hasn't always worked in the way she needs. However, there is one place she knows she can go to feel and be herself, an abandoned graveyard just off the path of a tree-lined country road. It calls to her, beckons her to keep coming back, and to keep visiting the Ghosts that inhabit it. They give her the encouragement she desires to keep moving forward, but things aren't always what they seem. Eris will learn to put her trust into an unlikely source and will discover her destined path is hiding in the shadows.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n------<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCasting Shadows is a story-driven psychological horror RPG that encourages the player to put trust into an unlikely source, overcome obstacles that may be blocking their destined path, and help others in need.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTurn-based combat is incorporated for the sake of the story, but leveling is not the focus of the game. Players will be encouraged to help those in need, rather than outright end them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeautiful pixel style graphics and hand drawn character/creature portraits with a dark gothic aesthetic paint the scene for an emotional dive into the unknown.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2506340/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1705277127","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2506340/page.bg.jpg?t=1705277127","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2506340/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1705277127","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2506340/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1705277127","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"This game contains content that includes flashing lights, jumpscares, and sensitive topics like mental health struggles, manipulation, and talks of self harm.
