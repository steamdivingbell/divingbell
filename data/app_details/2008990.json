{"about_the_game":"Call Hating is a DOS-era retro-inspired point-and-click game that answers the question &quot;What could go wrong?&quot; <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Call Hating, you play the role of an aging, forgetful work-from-home worker who hasn't exactly kept up with the latest technology in your home office. When your smartphone breaks and your internet connection goes down, it's up to you to reclaim your bandwidth using obsolete and outdated tech around your house. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith plot and narration inspired by classics such as The Stanley Parable and Portal, Call Hating is a work-from-home simulator wrapped in an escape room, stuffed with minigames, and baked in a 500-degree oven of dark and fourth wall-breaking humor.
