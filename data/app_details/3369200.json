Every year adventurers from all around the world gather on a forgotten island to test their shooting-skills. The arena, simply called &quot;The Lodge&quot;, was once a flourishing holiday resort but the place was shut down after a devastating zombie-virus took over the island. Since those days the little spot under the Polynesian moon is infamously known as the... BLACK ISLAND.

The goal is to score points by shooting enemies and bonus-objects within a time-frame of 5 minutes. Climb up the high-score table and reach the rank of black-belt (or even the legendary red-belt). As the time-counter progresses, your enemies are getting more aggressive and are furiously throwing dragon-fire and zombie-slime at you. Although you have unlimited ammo at your disposal, you are required to reload your gun regularly! Some enemies leave bonus-objects in the arena after they vanish. These bonuses can be cached and stored in the inventory, to be released in a strategic moment or used immediately as they appear.
