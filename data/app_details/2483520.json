{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>&quot;Quest Girl&quot;</strong> is a lighthearted, fun, and adorable game that focuses on casual puzzle-solving as its primary gameplay, with adventure and nurturing as secondary elements.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Backstory:</strong><br>A long, long time ago, the stars were scattered across the earth, leaving the night sky in complete darkness. During those times, people lived in fear and hopelessness, with no light from the stars, no dreams, and no hope. The goddess of creation shed a crystal-clear tear, which streaked across the night sky like a shooting star and descended to the earth...</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The inspiration behind this game came from my female friends, who often complained that the action-platformer games they liked were too difficult and unfriendly to casual players. So, I wanted to create a simple and relaxing game for them, focusing on jumping, clicking, and finding objects.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game is designed with a storybook-inspired cartoon art style, combined with a 3D environment for exploration and adventure. It incorporates casual combat and action elements. Since I find complex numerical systems overwhelming, the game features an easy-to-understand system\u2014simple enough for elementary school kids! :)</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The goal is to present players with a cute and visually pleasing experience with simple text. There are no complex stats or mandatory achievements\u2014just a relaxing experience where players can wander around, enjoy the scenery, and skip even the easiest platforms that anyone can pass. After all, this is a fairytale world, haha!</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2483520/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736910645","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2483520/page.bg.jpg?t=1736910645","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2483520/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736910645","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2483520/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736910645","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2558000,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>&quot;Quest Girl&quot;</strong> is a lighthearted, fun, and adorable game that focuses on casual puzzle-solving as its primary gameplay, with adventure and nurturing as secondary elements.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Backstory:</strong><br>A long, long time ago, the stars were scattered across the earth, leaving the night sky in complete darkness.
