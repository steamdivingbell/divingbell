{"about_the_game":"Porta-Tower is a roguelike tower defense game where you can pick up and move your towers to better cover the enemies' path.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Move Your Towers</h2>A tower's placement is important, so when a position becomes suboptimal, pick it up and move it! How much you want to move them will depend on what type of towers you have. Long-ranged towers can be left alone for longer while short-ranged towers will need to be moved more frequently to stay in range of enemies.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2180950/extras/Moving_Towers.gif?t=1736391225\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Upgrade Your Towers</h2>When you've gathered enough crystals, move your tower to the upgrader and upgrade it. Be careful, though, as moving a tower to the upgrader will take it out of the defense until you put it back in position.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unlockable Towers</h2>As you play, you'll unlock new towers to be used in future runs. Expand your collection of towers to destroy enemies in whatever way you want.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2180950/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736391225","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2180950/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1736391225","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2180950/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736391225","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2180950/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736391225","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Porta-Tower is a roguelike tower defense game where you can pick up and move your towers to better cover the enemies' path.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Move Your Towers</h2>A tower's placement is important, so when a position becomes suboptimal, pick it up and move it!
