{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A young hen is torn between staying loyal to her family and dreaming of something more. Meet the charming and very different residents of the farm. Who would you trust, and who would you stay away from? Or maybe first impressions can be deceiving?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Investigate an old mystery or simply take a walk around the farm, but remember: your family is watching every decision you make.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">They say the grass is greener on the other side, but in a strange forest, the most important thing is not to lose yourself. What can a little bird do? Tame a predator? Save an innocent life? Solve a crime? Just remember \u2014 you can't go higher than your wings can take you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Experience the fleeting freedom you don\u2019t truly have.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Get Out Of The Woods is a non-linear, modern visual novel that explores familiar social conflicts. Immerse yourself in the story, make choices, and empathize with the characters. In this game, you play as a sentient bird coexisting with other intelligent animals, most of whom are not thrilled by your presence. Enjoy the atmosphere, unravel mysteries, and listen to unique soundtracks!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game will consist of 3 chapters. The first chapter introduces you to the world and sets the direction for the entire game, which will develop according to one of the 4 endings of the first episode.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3427260/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737397831","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3427260/page.bg.jpg?t=1737397831","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3427260/f6acc4a3e1b0f46e73f17aa551486f85ece5bef6/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737397831","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3427260/f6acc4a3e1b0f46e73f17aa551486f85ece5bef6/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737397831","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A young hen is torn between staying loyal to her family and dreaming of something more.
