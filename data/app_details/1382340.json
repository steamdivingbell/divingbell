{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Pathfinder 2 RPG - Lost Omens: Gods &amp; Magic</h2>No fantasy setting is complete without a pantheon of powerful deities for its characters to worship or fear.

Within this volume you'll find details on the gods and non-deific faiths of the Age of Lost Omens from the perspective of their clergy and lay worshipers. You'll also discover new domains, feats, and spells to customize your character, and an exhaustive index of hundreds of deities from the Pathfinder setting you can worship (and the mechanical benefits of doing so).<br>An indispensable resource for both players looking to flesh out their characters' motivations and Game Masters aiming to bring the evil cults, zealous evangelists, and holy warriors of their campaigns to life, <i>Pathfinder Lost Omens Gods &amp; Magic</i> is an essential addition to any Pathfinder Second Edition campaign!<br><i>Written by:</i> <strong> Robert Adducci, Amirali Attar Olyaee, Calder CaDavid, James Case, Adam Daigle, Katina Davis, Leo Glass, Joshua Grinlinton, James Jacobs, Virginia Jordan, Jason Keeley, Jacky Leung, Lyz Liddell, Ron Lundeen, Stephanie Lundeen, Jacob W.
