You need food supplies for feeding your people, gold for buying cards, and a military to defend your kingdom. With randomized decks, you cannot always get the building you need. For example, you priotized to purchase military cards to create a mighty army to destroy any monsters that attacked your kingdom, but now you do not have enough food supply for your people, and hunger is happening. To prevent this, always plan for the future. If one of your economies starts to go bad, the fall of his kingdom may come faster than you expected. Create a strong economy to feed your cats enough food to survive and defeat any monster who dared to attack.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">COMBO YOUR BUILDINGS</h2> <br>Time passes quickly as you build your kingdom, and what buildings produce alone is not enough to survive. You need to combo your buildings! So you can't produce enough food, and hunger is at the door? Just combo your wheat farm with your mill. You do not have enough gold to buy the next card, and you need to produce more gold. Just combo your grocer with your farmer cats. With 30+ Buildings, you can build the combo your kingdom needs. With easy-to-use menus, you can see how much each building produces and consumes and which buildings it can combo with.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2516900/extras/ezgif-4-bd89260d57.gif?t=1716810235\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DIFFERENT LANDS, DIFFERENT MONSTERS</h2> <br>As you progress through your journey, you will realize that not every land consists of trees and grass. Some lands are full of volcanoes, icebergs, or sand as far as the eye can see. You and your people need to adapt to this new and harsh environment. Also, do not forget the monsters who live in these lands. Every land comes with its own unique monsters and bosses! Create and improvise new strategies for each environment.
