{"about_the_game":"Capsule is a challenging VR escape game developed for the HTC Vive and Valve Index. It is set in a fictional 1982 and takes place in a fallout bunker following a nuclear attack. Explore the environment, examine items and solve puzzles in order to leave the bunker in time to be rescued. Throughout the bunker the player can find audio tapes, recorded previously by the character that they are assuming during game play, that offer insight pertaining to the situation they are currently in. Capsule is designed to be played best at room scale where players navigate by a simple teleport mechanic. Controls are minimal and, overall, game play is designed to be intuitive and immersive allowing the player to focus on the environment around them. The solutions to the puzzles in the game are randomized, so that the player wont be able to simply remember combinations and solutions from their last play through, this ensures that subsequent play-throughs and speed-run achievements retain a certain level of challenge.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Speed Run","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/891490/6918e3e9612cb132807dfb694e4f8fac20cb41a7.jpg"},{"name":"Not your first rodeo","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/891490/435fb5085b33aa079033a43445ea3ba2e579e292.jpg"},{"name":"Quick Study","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/891490/c68ab23b0bf88b2103283f56a808d8b79cf80565.jpg"},{"name":"Perfect Run","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/891490/bd1a1d9fa4799d94296c4dfd14dfaa7576f23cd3.jpg"},{"name":"Fan Club","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/891490/b644eb87db50687fcd1bf5977ebd998ce3dd4e82.jpg"},{"name":"Ultra Instinct Super Speedrun","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/891490/d7f6e4c4b54378263a7b8121cf56367617e6e631.jpg"},{"name":"Morse Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/891490/c9f7dd6bd048826ba2b590404d0f9a8989bef067.jpg"}],"total":7},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/891490/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1573911011","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/891490/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1573911011","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/891490/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1573911011","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/891490/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1573911011","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Implied alcohol and tobacco use."},"detailed_description":"Capsule is a challenging VR escape game developed for the HTC Vive and Valve Index.
