{"about_the_game":"<i><strong>Couch multiplayer is back - Blocked! is a local multiplayer party game for 2-8 people that is all about being easy to pick up and start playing.</strong></i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2><br>Every player controls a square block that can move, jump and interact with the playing area and other players. Your task is to beat your friends in a series of minigames, ranging from well-known classics such as snake and road crossing, to more unique ones like bomb tag. No skill will be left unchallenged - speed, quick thinking, patience, strategy and reflexes will all come into play.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><strong>Focus on playability: </strong> The game can be played with a controller or keyboard - 4 players can play using controllers and an additional 4 players can play on the same keyboard (if you can manage to sit together tight enough). In the spirit of the easy to play nature of the game, extra players can <strong>join in on the fun at any time!</strong> Even if you're right in the middle of a match, another member can simply pick up a controller and join without as much as pausing the ongoing game. <br><br><strong>Fun for anyone at anytime:</strong> All the minigames are designed to be playble by anyone, regardless of their prior gaming experience. You also don't need any preparation time, going from starting the game to starting a match in mere seconds.<br><br><strong>Lots of content:</strong> 16 playable minigames (so far) taking course in over 30 different environments.<br><br><strong>Playable on any PC:</strong> The artstyle is based on low-poly meshes, meaning the game can run even on old or low-power hardware.<br><br><strong>Play over the internet with Steam Remote Play Together</strong> Not in the same house? No problem! You can use Steam Remote Play Together and play over the internet without buying a second copy.<br><br><strong>Include your personal touch:</strong> The game includes dozens of hidden cosmetic items to spruce up your block, all of which are unlockable simply by playing the game.<br><br><br><br><br><strong> Important info: </strong> Only 4 players can play using a controller - you will need a keyboard to play with all 8 players.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"What Have You Done","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2017330/b5c02cf716498ba5efdf5dd17eae9b815da7f2ab.jpg"},{"name":"Getting Started","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2017330/7c5bc55f6933170d93d2f3da2dad071d367b7a4c.jpg"},{"name":"Get Cheesy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2017330/d9c77b8fa76642055a7c70da55260718ee08467d.jpg"},{"name":"Bricked In","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2017330/865e74b6d6ab91a044636b3c381e21a8e3d18b36.jpg"},{"name":"Speed Sorter","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2017330/22932d6b2d1bbf38625b31125084edc91f61972a.jpg"},{"name":"Marathon","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2017330/a3d25c8509a67db7077febcb3921df7da84bd059.jpg"},{"name":"Sweaty Palms","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2017330/e46a940cf9c9c6836a1bd03b457445e157c6db81.jpg"},{"name":"Perfect Rhythm","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2017330/b3e7bc648750c72553baa3d481a823831fb2ee9e.jpg"},{"name":"Explorer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2017330/f5e4c85d32cf1467ae4e5de10228c3ea190da2db.jpg"},{"name":"This is Rigged","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2017330/45ae15d061e2471c602c1a4fdb228fab49d381ed.jpg"}],"total":10},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2017330/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1682456180","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2017330/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1682456180","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2017330/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1682456180","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2017330/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1682456180","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<i><strong>Couch multiplayer is back - Blocked! is a local multiplayer party game for 2-8 people that is all about being easy to pick up and start playing.</strong></i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2><br>Every player controls a square block that can move, jump and interact with the playing area and other players.
