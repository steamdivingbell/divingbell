{"about_the_game":"Mythren is a Social Sim RPG where you live each day deciding how to grow as a tamer with Mythren.  You will train, grow your bonds, increase your social stats, and explore the Wild Isles to gather resources, increase levels, and find items.  In doing so you will find out what it means to be a team.<br><br><br>Mythren takes place over the course of many months following your protagonist (Kaiya or Kai) as they unexpectedly become a tamer, and go on an adventure looking for a place they can call home.  On your journey as a Mythren tamer, you will explore the Wild Isles of Cochant and the Mythren, and learn what it means to find your own path.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Real-time Combat</h2>No more taking turns!  In Mythren, you get to control your Mythren\u2019s action in arena brawler-style combat.  The combat system allows you to string together jabs, heavies, specials, and skills to create devastating combos.  Skills make your Mythren invulnerable for a short period of time, so if they are timed well they can be used to dodge incoming damage.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Darkren Fights</h2>Mythren battles aren\u2019t just about fighting other tamers.  There are creatures in this world called Darkren that don\u2019t play by the same rules.  They can group up to fight you in mob battles.  Some special Darkren may be encountered as bosses with different attack patterns, and will require using all of your abilities to take them down.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Customize Your Teams</h2>Mythren focuses on building up a bond between you and your Mythren.  This means that you can create your own builds, allowing you to choose your Mythren\u2019s playstyle.  Along with this, you can also swap between Mythren teams, allowing you to further customize their combat style.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Grow Your Bonds</h2>Growing the bond between you and your Mythren is extremely important in our game!  Taking them into battle allows them to grow stronger, but in order to evolve them and gain access to new abilities, befriending your Mythren is key.  Every Mythren species in the game will have a unique personality, and it's up to you to get to know them better.  Your home island and the city of Cochant are the best places to raise your bond with a variety of different activities.  It\u2019s also possible that you may find some unique interactions on the Wild Isles\u2026<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Manage your time</h2>Every day, you get to decide how to raise your Mythren and grow as a tamer! Whatever you choose to do, each activity will consume an activity point, and after you consume all your activity points for the daytime, time will transition from day to night, providing you with various other activities to do, with replenished activity points for the evening.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gain Social Skills</h2>Becoming a better Mythren tamer means you need to grow as well!  Kaiya / Kai have a lot to learn about opening up to others, and the time you spend with your Mythren will reward you.  Raising your social skills allows you to choose different dialogue options, and has a variety of beneficial effects while training your Mythren.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1560150/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725657352","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1560150/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1725657352","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1560150/5db796293938c2db0473df1c4cc7fe15173a87af/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725657352","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1560150/5db796293938c2db0473df1c4cc7fe15173a87af/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725657352","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Mythren is a Social Sim RPG where you live each day deciding how to grow as a tamer with Mythren.
