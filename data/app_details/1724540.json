It\u2019s not a difficult game to pick up and learn, and the gameplay forces you to make some tough decisions. While the consequences of your actions aren\u2019t seen, the foundation is in place for an interesting story. As gameplay continues to involve more operations and consequences roll in, the makings of a unique crime game are firmly established.\u201d<br>Keen Gamer<br><br>\u201cHere's a strategy-oriented adventure game about surviving, or maybe even flourishing, as a money launderer for a Mexican drug cartel. As you might expect, this is high pressure work and one wrong move could lead to disastrous consequences, so every business decision comes with double (triple?) the pressure it otherwise would. To make things worse, you've got the cops and other criminal upstarts to worry about. This is a tycoon game essentially, but with a strong narrative component centered around diplomacy, hard decisions and often tense negotiation.\u201d<br>PC Gamer<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1724540/ss_c7ae477f4b03705a3a87f441eee1da69b713a3ef.1920x1080.jpg?t=1698061456","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1724540/ss_c7ae477f4b03705a3a87f441eee1da69b713a3ef.600x338.jpg?t=1698061456"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1724540/ss_1b8e96efae8428d6aaabeed38d109839c093a9b9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1698061456","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1724540/ss_1b8e96efae8428d6aaabeed38d109839c093a9b9.600x338.jpg?t=1698061456"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1724540/ss_e2b05c280ccc5435b9cff25910babe4f180ed9bb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1698061456","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1724540/ss_e2b05c280ccc5435b9cff25910babe4f180ed9bb.600x338.jpg?t=1698061456"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1724540/ss_fb5c32bd5ca22dd4c308d3e25b3d37feb95e8fc6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1698061456","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1724540/ss_fb5c32bd5ca22dd4c308d3e25b3d37feb95e8fc6.600x338.jpg?t=1698061456"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1724540/ss_274630af1f1f22013daf477c64f0bdaa73e7ab15.1920x1080.jpg?t=1698061456","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1724540/ss_274630af1f1f22013daf477c64f0bdaa73e7ab15.600x338.jpg?t=1698061456"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1724540/ss_d834a414df7b34cf95142a28e221e75cf7b1c07e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1698061456","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1724540/ss_d834a414df7b34cf95142a28e221e75cf7b1c07e.600x338.jpg?t=1698061456"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1724540/ss_598910561f16bfc56e4ef3d6266759bedb4458d3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1698061456","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1724540/ss_598910561f16bfc56e4ef3d6266759bedb4458d3.600x338.jpg?t=1698061456"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1724540/ss_f9654f7259b14b58840f0f5741f58a0101c32cc2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1698061456","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1724540/ss_f9654f7259b14b58840f0f5741f58a0101c32cc2.600x338.jpg?t=1698061456"}],"short_description":"It is a strategy/adventure game set in a small, quiet town.
