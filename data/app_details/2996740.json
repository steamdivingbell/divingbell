{"about_the_game":"The powerful army of the enemy was seizing cities one by one in the lands where the war was intensifying. Despite the defenseless soldiers of the city resisting under the leadership of their heroes, they eventually fell under a dark shadow. Among them was a young and brave soldier. He had been a warrior who was there for them every moment since the beginning of the war. However, victory was not on their side.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe young soldier taken captive began to live dark and hopeless days in the enemy dungeons. The days filled with torture and oppression couldn't break him even a bit. He stood tall against the cruel face of the enemies. But with each passing day, rather than losing hope, he grew stronger.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver time, he realized that escaping from the dungeon was impossible. But that didn't mean giving up for him. On the contrary, the fire within him burned even brighter. In every dark corner of the dungeon, he searched for traces of his freedom. He would fight with courage to overcome the enemy and gain his freedom.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story of our hero was not written behind the iron bars of the dungeon, but with hope and determination within.
