As customers come into your store and approach the counter, they will have an image and a timer above their heads. The image depicts what item the customer is requesting. The orange image behind the image of the item will slowly disappear as a customer waits in line and for their item, this represents a customer\u2019s patience. Patience will be important because if a customer\u2019s patience runs out, they will get upset and leave the store, causing you to lose your sale. When a customer approaches and you want to make a sale to them, you need to tap on the icon above their head. When you tap on the icon the store inventory will open and you must then tap on the correct item and then confirm so that your pharmacist can go to the back of the store and grab the item. The pharmacist will return and give the item to the customer making a sale. You can use upgrades within the store too. There are several upgrades you can acquire and next to each upgrade there is a description telling you what it does. Then you can continue working until the end of the day is reached.<br>\u2003<br><strong>Main Game - End of Day Graph</strong><br><br>At the end of each day you will be taken to a screen that will show a box and whisker graph that is generated by your sales throughout the day. The data values that should appear on the bottom of the graph are scrambled on the right side of the screen and you will need to drag and drop them into the correct place to continue onto the next day. If you need a detailed walkthrough on box and whisker graphs it is recommended visiting the how to play or the tutorial. That is about it on the instructions for BaW\u2019s Pharmacy! While in the game if more help is needed just visit the how to play, the trivia or the tutorial in game and these will explain again how to play BaW\u2019s Pharmacy successfully.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1931960/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1653616724","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1931960/page.bg.jpg?t=1653616724","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1931960/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1653616724","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1931960/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1653616724","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"BAW\u2019s Pharmacy is a mobile time management and strategy game.
