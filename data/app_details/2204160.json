Greenlander is fast-paced, challenging, and brutal. Cut enemies apart and split their skulls with your Axe, block their swords and arrows with your Shield, and blow them apart with your improvised matchlock cannon Jormungandr.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2><br>Greenlander's gameplay consists of curated combat encounters with multiple ways to complete them. You'll need to experiment with your pathing, enemy kill order, and special abilities to succeed. Over the course of your revenge-fueled journey you'll acquire new equipment and abilities as enemies become stronger and more numerous.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Setting</h2><br>Experience a gloomy, medieval Greenland, surrounded by crushing waves and perpetually soaked in torrential rain. The environments are hand-pixelated and rich with detail and texture.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2204160/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1668535440","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2204160/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1668535440","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2204160/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1668535440","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2204160/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1668535440","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Violence and gore.
