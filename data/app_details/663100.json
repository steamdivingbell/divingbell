Capital ships have maneuver thrusters that can push them along all axes; for fighters, it's easiest to just turn and use the main thrusters for all their maneuvers.

You turn with the mouse, left-click to fire guns, right-click to accelerate forward. By default, you roll using the scroll wheel. Reloading and target selection are keyboard keys by default, but you can bind them to other mouse buttons or anything you want. The game has full joystick and gamepad support and you can configure controls to whatever you feel works best.<br><br>In this game, you're a cadet trying to pass the Academy's flight trials and become a certified combat pilot. Each mission teaches and tests your ability in a certain kind of combat scenario. The bronze medal signifies basic ability and is not too hard to earn, as long as you can perform the required task. Silver and gold are progressively harder and require you to polish your tactics and precision.
