{"about_the_game":"Use boxes to make bridges across the water, and keep buttons held down that open gates that block your path. In certain stages, you will need to co-operate with a partner (that you can switch to freely) to get boxes out of tight spots, hold down a button, or give you the positioning you need to solve a puzzle. Conveyor belts provide additional challenge by restricting your movement, often acting as a one-way door.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1093120?t=1589994969","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1093120?t=1589994969","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1093120/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1589994969","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1093120/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1589994969","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Use boxes to make bridges across the water, and keep buttons held down that open gates that block your path.
