{"about_the_game":"The IAR-80 was a Romanian low-wing monoplane originally designed in the late 1930s by Industria Aeronautic\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103 (IAR, or Romanian Aeronautic Industry in English). First flown in 1939, the IAR-80 was comparable to other fighter aircraft designs of the late 1930s and would remain in service with the Royal Romanian Air Force throughout World War II until the end of the war in May 1945.<br><br>The armament of the IAR-80 initially consisted of Belgian-made Fabrique Nationale FN 7.92 mm light machine guns, which were a licensed version of the Browning M1919 machine gun. These machine guns would eventually be replaced by 13.2 mm FN heavy machine guns and German 20 mm MG FF/M and MG 151/20 cannons. In 1941, the IAR-80 was modified to become a dive bomber and thus became the IAR-81. This new model was fitted with a bomb cradle under the fuselage which would throw the bomb clear of the propeller when the bomb was released.<br><br>The first production IAR 80s were completed in January 1941, and they were in action against the Soviets from the first day of Operation Barbarossa on June 22,1941. IAR-80s and 81s both saw action during the Battle of Stalingrad and later took part in combat over the Kuban and the Crimea throughout 1943 and into 1944. Meanwhile, in August 1943 IAR-80s took part in the defense of the Romanian oil fields at Ploesti for the first time against US Army Air Force B-24 heavy bombers.<br><br>Further defensive missions would be flown over Romania through the summer of 1944 against American heavy bomber raids. After Romania switched sides in August 1944 and joined the Allies, IAR-80s and IAR-81s fought alongside the Soviets until the war ended in May 1945.<br><br>In addition to Quick Mission Builder, Advanced Quick Mission Generator and Multiplayer modes, you can fly it in Career mode during Battle of Stalingrad (Grp. 6 BoPi ARR and Grp. 8 V\u00e2n\u0103toare ARR) and Battle of Kuban (I.A.R. 80-A in Grp. 3 V\u00e2n\u0103toare ARR and I.A.R. 80-B in Grp. 4 V\u00e2n\u0103toare ARR).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">'Short' I.A.R. 80-A</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Default armament: six 7.92mm machine guns &quot;FN Browning 7.92 mod 1938&quot;, 2400 rounds, 1500 rounds per minute, wing-mounted<br></li><li>Length: 8.9 m<br></li><li>Wingspan: 10.5 m <br></li><li>Wing surface: 16.1 m\u00b2</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">'Long' I.A.R. 80-B</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Default armament: four 7.92mm machine guns &quot;FN Browning 7.92 mod 1938&quot;, 1600 rounds, 1500 rounds per minute, wing-mounted and two 13.2mm machine guns &quot;FN Browning 13.2&quot;, 350 rounds, 1080 rounds per minute, wing-mounted<br></li><li>Length: 8.97 m<br></li><li>Wingspan: 11.0 m <br></li><li>Wing surface: 16.5 m\u00b2</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Modifications</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>I.A.R. 80-B series 181-200: two 7.92mm MGs replaced by 13.2mm ones, new headrest, sturdier flaps (14.7 kg weight increase, 1 km/h speed loss).<br></li><li>I.A.R. 80-C series 251-290: four 7.92mm MGs and two 20mm MG FF/M guns, tail struts, new air filter, second oil radiator, sturdier fuselage and flaps (24 kg weight increase, 12 km/h speed loss).<br></li><li>I.A.R. 80-M: two 7.92mm MGs and two 20mm MG151/20 guns, tail struts, new air filter, second oil radiator, late type headrest, sturdier fuselage and flaps (62 kg weight increase, 9 km/h speed loss).<br></li><li>I.A.R. 81 series 151-175: centerline (249 kg SC 250) and underwing bombs (two 55 kg SC 50), tail struts, sturdier flaps (379 kg weight increase with racks, 32 km/h speed loss before drop, 14 km/h after drop).<br></li><li>I.A.R. 81-C series 301-450: two 7.92mm MGs and two 20mm MG151/20 guns, centerline (249 kg SC 250) and underwing bombs (two 55 kg SC 50), tail struts, sturdier flaps (427 kg weight increase with racks, 41 km/h speed loss before drop, 19 km/h after drop).</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Paint Schemes</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Alternative national markings (customizable tactical number).<br></li><li>1943 paint scheme (customizable tactical number).<br></li><li>1944 paint scheme (customizable tactical number).<br></li><li>Allied markings (customizable tactical number).<br></li><li><strong>&quot;Mouse Knight&quot;</strong>.
