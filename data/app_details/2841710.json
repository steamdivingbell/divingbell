{"about_the_game":"<strong>STORY:</strong><br>An atmospheric narrative driven survival horror game with metroidvania elements, set in the wake of a nuclear disaster, you hunt as you struggle to quench the ever growing appetite of your heart, in hopes of completing &quot;The Cleanse&quot;, after which you hope that father lets you go, riddled with guilt, you cant live with yourself, what youve done, what father has asked of you, you plead, desperately, to be set free, but he never answers.<br><br><strong>ENVIRONMENT</strong><br>A strange, cold forest, with trees extending far out of sight. A fog has settled on the area, with the occasional ray of light reminding you of what the world once was. The creatures, at least the ones who survived- sustained life altering mutations, they suffer, but the forests grasp only tightens.- fed by pain, the forest seems to have a life of its own, cannibalising the very creatures that inhabit. <br><br><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong><br>Armed with only a rusty shotgun and a geiger counter, you search for vermin to bring back to the heart in order to fuel it, as you desperately try to please father. You must manage your tiny 3 slot inventory to the best of your ability, and keep radiation flowing through your veins, that thing is never too far behind you. Scavenge, hunt and explore the pain ridden exclusion zone, as your body begins to change, you gain powers from your victims, but you are still left weak in comparison to the things that inhabit the forest.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2841710/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729862271","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2841710/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1729862271","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2841710/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729862271","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2841710/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729862271","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Dark storyline\r\nLittle to no blood, mature topics discussed eg. death, killing, loss, mentions of suicide.\r\n"},"detailed_description":"<strong>STORY:</strong><br>An atmospheric narrative driven survival horror game with metroidvania elements, set in the wake of a nuclear disaster, you hunt as you struggle to quench the ever growing appetite of your heart, in hopes of completing &quot;The Cleanse&quot;, after which you hope that father lets you go, riddled with guilt, you cant live with yourself, what youve done, what father has asked of you, you plead, desperately, to be set free, but he never answers.<br><br><strong>ENVIRONMENT</strong><br>A strange, cold forest, with trees extending far out of sight.
