The rock elements bring a raw intensity to the compositions, while the electronica elements add a futuristic and synthetic texture, creating a unique sonic landscape that mirrors the game's blend of fantasy and technology.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the standout features of the soundtrack is Zach's occasional use of vocals, delivered in a haunting, whispering style that lurks subtly in the background of select tracks. This unconventional approach adds an eerie and mysterious dimension to the music, enhancing the atmosphere of the game as players race against time through otherworldly environments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverall, the OST for &quot;Xeno Runners&quot; is a testament to Zach Fitzgerald's versatility as a composer, seamlessly blending genres to create a cohesive and electrifying musical experience that immerses players in the fast-paced and exhilarating world of the game.
