{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Your Mission:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As captain of the <i>Titan</i>, your goal is to navigate the depths of the ocean, investigate the remnants of the <i>Titanic</i>, uncover valuable artifacts, and survive the harrowing challenges of the deep sea. But danger is everywhere \u2014 from the crushing pressure of the ocean to the ferocious creatures that call the dark depths home.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Key Features:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>1. Deadly Depths: Pressure and Peril</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The deeper you dive, the more your vessel will be tested. The ocean's immense pressure can crush even the most well-built machines. As you venture into waters more than 4,000 meters deep, you\u2019ll need to monitor your submarine\u2019s structural integrity. Keep an eye on cracks and weak spots, and perform repairs on the fly. Upgrades are crucial \u2014 a more resilient submarine will increase your chances of survival, but be mindful: every repair costs resources. Can you balance the risks and rewards of diving into the abyss?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>2. Fierce Deep-Sea Predators</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The ocean is not a welcoming place. From the shadows, enormous and deadly creatures of the deep await. Watch your sonar carefully as massive sea monsters track your movements. When they strike, you\u2019ll need to use a combination of weapons, traps, and cunning tactics to defend your vessel. Use limited ammunition wisely and decide whether to fight or evade these relentless predators. Survival isn\u2019t just about exploration \u2014 it\u2019s about keeping your vessel and crew alive in hostile waters.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>3. Limited Resources, Strategic Decisions</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You\u2019re on a tight budget when it comes to resources. Oxygen, energy, and the overall health of your submarine are finite, and every trip into the depths will deplete your supplies. Strategic planning is key: each dive must be carefully calculated to maximize your gains while ensuring you have enough fuel and air to return safely to the surface. Choose your path wisely, and be ready to face the unknown at every turn.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>4. Explore the Titanic\u2019s Sunken Secrets</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The <i>Titanic</i> is not just a wreck \u2014 it\u2019s a graveyard of history, a treasure trove of secrets, and a place of eerie silence. Scour the wreckage for valuable artifacts, each one telling a story of the ship\u2019s tragic past. Pieces of jewelry, rare antiques, and priceless items lie buried beneath the sea, waiting to be uncovered. Every discovery could fund your next upgrade, or even open the door to new areas of the wreck that were once beyond reach.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>5. Thrilling Atmosphere</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Experience the breathtaking, yet terrifying beauty of the ocean\u2019s depths. In <i>Titan Quest</i>, the further you dive, the darker it gets. The pressure of the ocean surrounds you, the only sounds are the distant creaks of your submarine, and the crushing silence of the abyss. The vast, black ocean stretches endlessly, with only the faint glow of your sub\u2019s lights cutting through the void. The deeper you go, the more oppressive the atmosphere becomes, and the stakes rise with every passing moment.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>6. Endless Exploration, Infinite Danger</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each dive into the abyss is unique. Will you encounter a massive sea serpent lurking near the wreckage? Or perhaps an unknown force in the deep that defies explanation? The ocean is full of mysteries, and every expedition brings new challenges and rewards. As you venture deeper, the wreck of the <i>Titanic</i> slowly reveals its secrets \u2014 but will you survive long enough to uncover them all?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Will You Survive the Abyss?</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In <i>Titan Quest</i>, every decision counts. Will you push your submarine to its limits in search of treasure, or will you play it safe, preserving your resources for a future dive? The deep sea is unforgiving, and not everyone returns from its depths.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Embark on an unforgettable adventure where danger, mystery, and treasure await. Will you unlock the secrets of the Titanic and make it back to the surface? Or will the ocean claim your vessel as its own?</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Only the bravest explorers will conquer the abyss. The ocean waits \u2014 and it has no mercy.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3385130/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737480595","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3385130/page.bg.jpg?t=1737480595","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3385130/2041814fdaa59e65dcf757938ba167db15b7c507/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737480595","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3385130/2041814fdaa59e65dcf757938ba167db15b7c507/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737480595","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Your Mission:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As captain of the <i>Titan</i>, your goal is to navigate the depths of the ocean, investigate the remnants of the <i>Titanic</i>, uncover valuable artifacts, and survive the harrowing challenges of the deep sea.
