A massive, open-world full of wonder, dungeons, and cities awaits you!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1653830/extras/nimoyd_building2-small.gif?t=1719229845\" /><br><br><strong>Survive a Vast World</strong><br><br>Your only way to survive is to dig, craft, and fight through this strange world. Manage your energy supply as you explore forests, grass plains, deserts, dark caves and dungeons, and generated cities filled with enemies. Beware the night though, as the dark Spirits will haunt you.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1653830/extras/nimoyd_crafting-small.gif?t=1719229845\" /><br><br><strong>Scavenge, Craft, Farm, and Survive</strong><br><br>After crash landing with little to no help, the clock is ticking to find something to eat and to develop the equipment you need for exploration. Each biome offers useful resources for you to gather. Craft gear, lights, food, but also a bed, a table, buildings, vehicles, or even a mecha. Whatever you make will help you survive further away from your base. Who knows what else you can find deep below in the Underworld, and who knows what you could craft with it!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1653830/extras/nimoyd_hero_small.gif?t=1719229845\" /><br><br><strong>Become a Hero</strong><br><br>Customize your hero based on 16 hero types, ranging from humans to aliens, and magical creatures. Add unique character traits such as \u201cBrave\u201d or \u201cLazy\u201d to make them unique, and watch how other characters in the game react to you.

Choose recipes, and manage your defense against either other human factions, or new alien colonists, or against the Underlord who lives deep below in the Underworld. Use your home base to store resources, park vehicles, and replenish your supplies as you explore the vast world. Manage your defence against either the human factions, the new alien colonists, or against the nightly Spirits \u2013 or other players. Participate in wars between human factions or defend their factions against those strange alien colonists from space, or even play as an alien faction yourself.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1653830/extras/nimoyd_combat2-small.gif?t=1719229845\" /><br><br><strong>Play With Friends</strong><br><br>Invite your friends to your planet and go on an adventure underground or against the aliens. Or join one of the many public planets, to experience a more hilarious world filled with lots and lots of player factions and cities. But since Nimoyd is as a single player game at its core, take your time for that, and do it whenever you feel is right for you, and keep playing alone.

What about that infecting Fungus that destroys villages and even alien colonies with ease? Why keep the humans talking about an Underlord in the Underworld? And where are those nightly creatures, called Spirits, come from? And what about the aliens? Why on Earth do alien colonists dig so vigorously deeper underground every day?
