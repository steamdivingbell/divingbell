{"about_the_game":"This is not just a text quest, but a real journey into the depths of yourself, an atmospheric immersion in the night city, soaked with rain, melancholy and the mysterious whispering of destinies. You are not just a reader, but the creator of your own story, a composer whose decisions are the chords that form the unique melody of fate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nImagine: outside the window the rain is pouring continuously, as if the sky is crying in unison with your soul. The drops drum on the windows of your apartment, reflecting the neon lights of the sleepless metropolis. The room is filled with semi-darkness, broken only by the flickering screen of your laptop and the warm light of the floor lamp. You're sitting on the couch, wrapped in a blanket, but the cold of loneliness creeps through the fabric, making you shiver. An undrinkable cup of tea on the coffee table, an open book forgotten halfway through..... Everything around you reminds you that you are alone. Loneliness, like a faithful dog, curled up in a ball at your feet, looking for at least a drop of your warmth. And at this moment, to the accompaniment of the rain, in your soul is born a quiet but firm: &quot;Enough. It's time for a change.&quot;<br />\r\nWhat makes the game special:<br />\r\nNon-linear story: Your decisions are not just a choice between yes and no. Each step opens up new paths, forming a unique story maze from which you have to find your way out.<br />\r\nVariety of endings: There is no definite &quot;happy ending&quot; in the game. Here you yourself decide what will happen to your hero. Find true love, find a strong friendship, unleash your creativity or let loneliness consume you completely.<br />\r\nCinematic atmosphere: We have thought over every word, every description, so that you do not just read the text, but literally live in the world of the game. Vivid images, heartfelt dialogues, atmospheric soundtracks (optional) - all this creates the effect of complete immersion.<br />\r\nRomance and Intrigue: Meet the girl of your dreams on a dating site, uncover the mystery of your past or try to write a song that will touch the hearts of millions. In the game you are waiting for an exciting story, full of unexpected twists and turns and deep emotions.<br />\r\nGenre choice: You decide what color your story will take. Do you prefer a light romantic comedy? Or are you attracted to mystical thriller with elements of horror? There is room for all kinds of fantasies in the game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3102210/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1722507193","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3102210/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1722507193","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3102210/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1722507193","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3102210/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1722507193","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This is not just a text quest, but a real journey into the depths of yourself, an atmospheric immersion in the night city, soaked with rain, melancholy and the mysterious whispering of destinies.
