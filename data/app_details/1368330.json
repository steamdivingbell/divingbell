{"about_the_game":"The game is about Marco Polo\u2019s experience when visiting Hangzhou, China during the medieval period<br>Marco Polo's book is a travelogue about Asia, which records the situation of many countries in Central Asia, West Asia, Southeast Asia and other regions, and its focus is on the narrative about China. Marco Polo has stayed in China for the longest time. His footprints are all over the Northwest, North China, Southwest and East China. In &quot;Travel&quot;, he described the inexhaustible wealth of China, the huge commercial city, the good transportation facilities, and the gorgeous palace buildings with a lot of chapters and passionate language. The second volume of &quot;Travel&quot;, which focuses on China, consists of 82 chapters and is very important throughout the book. There are many pages in this volume about Kublai and Beijing.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368330/extras/444.png?t=1667372840\" /><br>At the beginning of the book, the people who were very surprised at the time were introduced: &quot;Emperors, kings, dukes, marquises, counts, knights and citizens, and all other people, no matter who they are, if you want to understand the differences between human races , To understand the differences between regions of the world, please read it or listen to someone reading this book!

He talked about the Great Khan Palace with gardens and man-made lakes, elephants loaded with silver harnesses and precious stones. He also talked about the various avenues above the surrounding ground and easy to drain; merchant ships flowed continuously every year on the Grand Canal; various ports berthed larger vessels than Europeans knew, and talked about the production of spices, silk, Some places of ginger, sugar, camphor, cotton, salt, saffron, sandalwood and porcelain. Marco also described all the fabled countries he visited and heard about when he escorted the Chinese princess to Persia-Singapore, Java, Sumatra, Ceylon, India, Socotra Island, Madagascar, Arabian Peninsula, San To Barr and Abyssinia.<br>Everything in the book seems bizarre and exaggerated.
