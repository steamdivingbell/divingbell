{"about_the_game":"Unravel the mystery of a missing cardinal by solving the riddle of a demonic power you did not expect to come upon. Face your inner demons and fight the power of evil while it seduces your soul. Play as the wittiest, pop-culture referencing priest in video game history and face an ultimate game over, if you make the angels cry you a river.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/747650/extras/comb_GIF.jpg?t=1662417359\" /><br><br>The Padre is a retro stylised 3D horror adventure game tapping deep into the roots of classic horror games. The dark and striking atmosphere is often cut by the wicked humour of the always witty Padre. You will need to use your brains to solve challenging puzzles, as well as your brawns to fend off monsters, all at the same time while you try to unravel the mysteries of the mansion, yourself and the eternal fight between good and evil. Be wary though, if you fail enough times it\u2019s a permanent GAME OVER for you!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Rest well","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/747650/23f03a8378fec0dd66b857737e49ce8a918be2f5.jpg"},{"name":"Bloodless Victory","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/747650/c47236cbfb0eda4fcc7fee3448207f2075720465.jpg"},{"name":"Spider Smasher","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/747650/47a65e7200e17d7e2cde5b567d7dee1864f07ff6.jpg"},{"name":"Ghost buster","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/747650/63c92d8cc564dd93474bdaeeea82174b32f0f009.jpg"},{"name":"Mirror master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/747650/223a8b472b601d64b47c5c1b00ddfda537cb9d00.jpg"},{"name":"Doubletap","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/747650/5c5710615ef00400b44fe78ef32eea0439ea920b.jpg"},{"name":"Redeemer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/747650/ae65b90d31941a7729f83bc8442d4f9ebfab3069.jpg"},{"name":"Sinner","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/747650/f59de7bff35319b02e875152a6e6bdc00a17d5cf.jpg"},{"name":"Clean carpet","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/747650/8c8e35c2cae7eeb60f8e79c7f3f6163c5e35e567.jpg"},{"name":"Master detective","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/747650/614565c34c71fe99443cf3c4fe315c2630a23b84.jpg"}],"total":28},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/747650/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1662417359","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/747650/page.bg.jpg?t=1662417359","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/747650/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1662417359","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/747650/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1662417359","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Check out the sequel!</h1><p></p><br><h1>More games from Feardemic</h1><p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Unravel the mystery of a missing cardinal by solving the riddle of a demonic power you did not expect to come upon.
