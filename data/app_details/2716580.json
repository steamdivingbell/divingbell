{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Star Trek Adventures: Eight Layers Deep</h2> A routine inspection of a Starfleet research project leads to ethical dilemmas for the ship's crew. In order to save lives, difficult decisions need to be made, and your crew may need to test the limits of the Prime Directive. Starfleet has given your crew instructions to resupply the <i>U.S.S. Colotario</i> and to prepare a progress report on the <i>Colotario's</i> ongoing research. The discovery of troubling anomalies leads to closer scrutiny of the research project and its scientists.  The situation is further complicated by first contact with a new species and their desperate plea for help. The crew must identify if (and how) they can help, and use their own scientific knowledge and, perhaps, the technology of the <i>U.S.S. Colotario's</i> research project to travel where no Starfleet officer has gone before!  Although this is a standalone adventure, a one-page mission brief provides inspiration for continuing the mission.  Adapted from this 20-page adventure for the <i>Star Trek Adventures</i> roleplaying game is written by Michael Dismuke, and is set in the <i>Enterprise</i> era with the player characters being the crew of a Starfleet vessel. This adventure also contains advice on adaptation for use in campaigns based in other <i>Star Trek</i> eras.<br><strong>Note: </strong> This adventure requires a <i>Star Trek Adventures</i> core rulebook to use.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2716580/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1702995778","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2716580/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1702995778","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2716580/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1702995778","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2716580/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1702995778","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Star Trek Adventures: Eight Layers Deep</h2> A routine inspection of a Starfleet research project leads to ethical dilemmas for the ship's crew.
