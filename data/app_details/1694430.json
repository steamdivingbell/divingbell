{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dynamic Dungeons Editor is an easy to use local tabletop tool that was developed for game masters who use a TV or projector to map different premade backgrounds, videos, and images. Animations and particle effects, tokens, and audio files can be used to immerse your players. It's a player, not a 3d map-building software. Both the demo and the full version contain only a few simple battle grids, so you will need the videos or static battle maps of Dynamic Dungeons or other creators. The complete dynamic dungeons map collection is not included. The software is in constant development, future updates will be free.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1694430/extras/ffw.gif?t=1732957087\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Import Dynamic Dungeons maps or your own images or video files into the storyline and make a playlist, cover and reveal areas with the fog of war tool, apply custom size hex or quad grid overlay. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1694430/extras/covergif1.gif?t=1732957087\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Playing on the TV screen is easier than you think.
