{"about_the_game":"The LW version uses a simpler but more performant render pipeline, which provides double the frame rate compared to HD, while maintaining similar graphics quality. However, it lacks a few advanced graphics features that HD has, such as volumetric fog, screen space shadows, global illumination, and a water system.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2819100/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1708047336","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2819100/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1708047336","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2819100/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1708047336","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2819100/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1708047336","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,3,4,5],"notes":"Although this program is not sex-focused, it does contain several procedural motions that are sex-related. Additionally, there are motion adjustment features that allow users to modify the playback to achieve certain poses and motions. Users can also load external objects and attach them to specific body parts of the model. However, these functionalities constitute only a small portion of the features provided.\r\n\r\nSince users are free to load any model and motion available on the Internet with this program, it might be potentially easy for them to find and use models and motions that depict nudity and explicit activities. It's important to note that the program itself does not provide or endorse such content; users are solely responsible for the materials they choose to use."},"detailed_description":"The LW version uses a simpler but more performant render pipeline, which provides double the frame rate compared to HD, while maintaining similar graphics quality.
