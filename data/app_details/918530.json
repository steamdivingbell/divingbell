{"about_the_game":"What is the Dark Room? The Dark Room is:<br><br>1. Sadism. With jokes.<br>2. An addictive throwback to 1980s text adventure games. <br>3. A one-of-a-kind retro-styled comedy puzzler that pits your pitiful brain against brutal deathtraps in the pursuit of freedom. <br>4. An adventure with a deep hidden story you can only unlock through skill, patience and exploration. <br>5. The kind of thing you can send to your friends just to make them very, very angry. <br>6. The exact opposite of an open-world game. <br>7. Like Fortnite, but only in the sense that it\u2019ll make you want to kill. <br><br>With over three-and-a-half hours of recorded content, plus profanity, comedy, body horror, puzzles and warped logic, this is the Dark Souls of text adventures, the BDSM of RPGs, it\u2019d be a walking simulator, but only if you were walking through a minefield.<br><br>Level One has 60 minutes of specially mo-capped dialogue and performance, while levels 2, 3 and Darkest give you even more, and will bring you the true story of Darren. Your money goes into making the game bigger, louder and more dangerous!<br><br>The Dark Room is the videogame adaptation of the interactive stage show of the same name from comedian John Robertson. So play this, then, when the show comes to your town, gather with the other survivors. Just remember - YA DIE! YA DIE! YA DIE!
