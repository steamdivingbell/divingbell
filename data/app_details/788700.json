Each day you construct your defenses, train troops, and prepare for attack.  When enemies come in the night, you defend with towers, troops, and heroes with powerful abilities!  Save as many towns as you can, while you travel through the Vale.  Choose wisely, because each town unlocks unique assets and a hero to aid in future battles.  Defeat is not the end in Valeguard.  Each play you can unlock more heroes and discover new strategies to achieve victory!<br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build in the day and defend at night</h2></strong><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/788700/extras/Battle.png?t=1667839988\" />The quiet hamlets of the Vale stand defenseless.  As the ValeGuard you act as mayor, merchant, and general for each village.  Balance your workforce to provide food, housing, troops, and fortifications.  When enemies threaten your villages, take on the role of commander with pause-able, real-time combat.<br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gather resources, craft weapons, and train troops</h2></strong><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/788700/extras/Town_1.png?t=1667839988\" />Juggling resources is key to success in ValeGuard.

Not all villages will survive the war and when a town is destroyed, these perks are lost with it.
