{"about_the_game":"<strong>Guide a group of adorable spuds through a series of challenging and varied levels in this cute adventure that can be played seated, standing or in full room VR. Each spud has a mind of their own, so it\u2019s up to you to manipulate the world around them as they wander, jump and stumble through it.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Save the Spuds</h2>The spuds are on the run - and they need your help! There\u2019s no questioning their adorable cuteness, but their intelligence is another matter, as they carelessly stumble to their demise unless you place the correct devices in their path.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Inspired By Classics</h2>Partially inspired by gaming classics such as Lemmings and Pipe Mania, the base premise of <strong>Kartoffl</strong> is simple: help the spuds get safely from point A to point B. The visual style is playful and full of character, while gameplay interactions are intuitive and snappy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Collect All the Stars</h2>If you want the true <strong>Kartoffl</strong> experience, you\u2019ll need to do more than getting the spuds from A to B.
