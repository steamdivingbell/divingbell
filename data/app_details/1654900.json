{"about_the_game":"Orakyubu is a game about 2D puzzles in 3D space.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo compete each puzzle, you will need to push boxes onto every target. However, there's a catch - each puzzle is contained on the faces of cubes. It is possible, and usually necessary, to move the pieces of each puzzle across the faces of their cube as well as onto other cubes to solve the puzzle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOrakyubu contains around 25 puzzles. Each one requires you to approach it in a unique way, so no two puzzles are the same.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1654900?t=1713712088","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1654900/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1713712088","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1654900/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1713712088","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1654900/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1713712088","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Orakyubu is a game about 2D puzzles in 3D space.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo compete each puzzle, you will need to push boxes onto every target.
