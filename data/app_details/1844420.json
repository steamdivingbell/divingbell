{"about_the_game":"Dino Safari first opened its doors in 1994 to capitalise on the mainstream obsession with all things prehistoric, and is proudly still going strong today. This beloved local location is one of the area\u2019s premier tourist attractions, transporting kids and adults alike into a bygone time around its proud central volcano. There are four main zones containing eight dinosaurs whose grounds need maintaining\u2026 if you\u2019re brave enough!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nT-Rex Paddock<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe notorious Tyrannosaurus Rex is the favourite dinosaur of many, and you can follow its footprints into the T-Rex Paddock. Carefully trim around these prints to keep them visible and pristine for Dino Safari\u2019s guests!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCretaceous Canyon<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Cretaceous Canyon is called home not only to more unique archaic creatures but also the park\u2019s Cretaceous Caf\u00e9, where all ages can enjoy a bite to eat. Unfortunately, some of the guests\u2019 manners could also be described as archaic \u2013 so you\u2019ll have to make sure to keep the area in tip-top shape with both cutting and litter contracts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHerbivore Valley<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHerds of gentle giants \u2018roam\u2019 through Herbivore Valley - and Dino Safari\u2019s guests often enjoy a shaded seat under a Brachiosaurus, or a picnic with a Parasaurolophus. Dino Safari\u2019s youngest patrons can also use Herbivore Valley\u2019s play area, so it\u2019s vital that this zone remains as clean and tidy as possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRaptor Enclosure<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollow the winding trail through thick bushes to the Raptor Enclosure; possibly the most dangerous of all Dino Safari zones. Make sure that even the most petrified of guests stop for a second to admire the pristine surroundings before continuing their escape from the resident Velociraptors.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1844420/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1646938113","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1844420/page.bg.jpg?t=1646938113","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1844420/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1646938113","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1844420/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1646938113","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Dino Safari first opened its doors in 1994 to capitalise on the mainstream obsession with all things prehistoric, and is proudly still going strong today.
