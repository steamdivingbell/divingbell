Or it will be, if you can survive. Streets of Fortuna is a free-roaming megasim sandbox RPG with emergent chaos rather than a linear story. Use your wits to live however you can. Someday perhaps you can challenge the Overlord that rules over Fortuna with an iron fist. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You arrive in Fortuna as a hungry, tired nobody, without even a single coin to your name... your first step is going to be finding a meal and shelter, here in the wealthiest city in the world, where the guards don't take kindly to theft or street-sleeping. Befriend a fence to sell your stolen goods or an art collector to improve your resale prices. Observe the behaviours of the wealthy (and their entourage) to pull off the perfect heist. Experiment with forms and materials to create food, gear, or valuable objects to trade, without rigid recipe systems.
