Are they friends or foes? And why does the white rabbit Usamura have a zipper on his back?<br>And who exactly is this enigmatic girl hiding Alice in the deepest part of the world? This is where you've probably realized that this game has multiple endings. There are numerous major choices to be made, a story that repeats itself, and the true goals of the characters to be revealed. An adventure the likes of which you've never experienced before is about to begin!<br><br><strong>\u25a0 Battle Action</strong><br>One of the core points of this game is its stylish, tag-team battle system!<br>Swing Usada\u2019s giant hammer to pulverize your enemies with powerful melee attacks, or use Kotora\u2019s submachine gun and bombs to take out enemies from a distance. Switch between the two to chain impressive combos! Chaining combos will increase their attack power, and make it easier to quickly defeat your many oncoming enemies.<br>Taking out enemies builds up your Chance Gauge, which can be used to perform supporting attacks and devastating ultimate attacks.

You can improve their weapons, which will then unlock unique skills. Or you can focus on their stats and movement, and even pick up skills to help them convince others to help them. If you find yourself stuck on a difficult boss, then try taking some time away from the main path to help our heroes grow stronger.<br>Scattered about here and there in the world are death matches (areas where you can't proceed without defeating all of the enemies there), and if you can finish them with a high-count combo, or without taking any damage, you can earn skill crystal fragments.<br><br>In addition, out in the world you can also find Heart Crystals, which increase your heroes' maximum health, in addition to other key items that they'll need on their adventure. Based on what you find, you might find that they're protected by powerful traps, just like the treasure you'd find deep inside of a cave.
