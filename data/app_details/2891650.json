{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">SOS: Forgotten Planet is an Educational Survival Horror with Roguelike elements where you learn Morse Code. You play as Clara Redmont, the grand-daughter of the man who ordered the complete an utter destruction of the planet Ouro. Looking for answers Clara goes to the planet and finds the world still very much alive. The labs of Ouro and the cause of their destruction are procedurally generated allowing for lots of replayability. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2891650/extras/GifLoopDoorOpenDither.gif?t=1733238152\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2891650/extras/LearnMorseCodeNoBG.PNG?t=1733238152\" />This game will teach you Morse Code in both inputting and listening. Use Morse Code to open doors and interact with the environment. Listen to and decode it to open chests to get the items needed to survive.
