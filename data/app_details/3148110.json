{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Greetings to all the players of my game!</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Game Development Journey </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The development of this game began as my graduation project in 2018, where I challenged myself to complete it within 10 days. Although it was a tough challenge, it allowed me to gain a lot of experience. Six years later, I spent another three days refining the story and decided to release it for free to everyone. To make it easier for players to download, I decided to put the game on Steam. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Game Introduction </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">1. Silent Mist is a third-person zombie game with a bit of storyline. Currently, there is only one map in the game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">2. The project took about ten days to complete and was purely made to bring some joy to everyone\u2014your enjoyment is all that matters.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">3. The objective of Chapter 1 is for players to eliminate as many zombies as possible and reach a safe location. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">4. In the initial version of the game, bullets are unlimited, allowing players to fully experience the thrill of shooting. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">5. The game is being released on Steam to make it easier for players to download and enjoy.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Story Inspiration and Background </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The storyline of  Silent Mist draws inspiration from classic titles like the Resident Evil and Silent Hill series. Although these masterpieces provided rich creative inspiration, I\u2019m fully aware of my technical and resource limitations, as this game was completed by me alone within 10 days. Therefore, I hope everyone can understand and enjoy its simple fun without setting high expectations. To ease the pressure on myself, I chose to release it for free. I welcome everyone to play and provide suggestions, and I will continue to update and improve the game based on your feedback.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Future Prospects </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the future, I sincerely hope to hear your opinions and make this game even better. I hope everyone will get involved in the improvement process by trying out the game. I will continue to update the game content completely for free, and I look forward to the support of all you godfathers of the game! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Development Costs </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Current development costs: Excluding time costs, the main expenses include Steam developer fees and game art assets, totaling 1162 RMB (712 RMB + 450 RMB = 180 Dollars). </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is a Beta version of the game, which is why there is a &quot;trial version&quot; watermark in the lower right corner of the game menu. However, this watermark does not affect the overall gameplay experience.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3148110/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730184053","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3148110/page.bg.jpg?t=1730184053","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3148110/edf47e1349ba2ced5a59248e46960317be686cd4/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730184053","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3148110/edf47e1349ba2ced5a59248e46960317be686cd4/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730184053","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Greetings to all the players of my game!</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Game Development Journey </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The development of this game began as my graduation project in 2018, where I challenged myself to complete it within 10 days.
