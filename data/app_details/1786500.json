{"about_the_game":"Claw Machine Pro (CMP) is the physics-based claw game you\u2019ve been waiting for! Spot the prizes you\u2019d like to grab in one of several different machines. Like physical claw machines, you control the claw to move it, drop it down, and - fingers crossed - it\u2019ll grab the prize. If it does, lucky you! Next just guide it back to the drop chute\u2014BE CAREFUL! If the prize isn\u2019t firmly in the claw\u2019s grasp, it might fall out before you get there\u2026<br><br>Choose from six machines in a variety of locations. Each one has a different theme and its own difficulty level: Chill, Challenge or Frustrate.  With three games each, featuring different challenges and prizes per machine, you get a total of 12 different claw game experiences!<br><br>All games feature multiple modes, including:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>One Strike - Are you really sure you\u2019ve got the claw lined up right? Make one mistake and your game is over.<br></li><li>Infinite - Are you looking for the freedom to try, try, try (and try, and try, and\u2026) again? In Infinite mode, play as long as you want. You\u2019ll get that bear eventually!<br></li><li>Limited Mistakes - It\u2019s countdown time. Your game starts with a limited number of permissible mistakes. Each mistake reduces that count by one until you run out and the game ends.<br></li><li>Limited Attempts - Countdown time continues. This time you begin with a limited number of attempts. Each drop of the claw deducts one from the count until you run out so make sure every drop counts!<br></li><li>Timer Mode - Capture as many prizes with the claw as you can before the timer runs out. Each successful attempt returns some time for you to continue.</li></ul><br>Please let us know what you think about Claw Machine Pro in the discussions, we'd love to include ideas from our players!","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1786500?t=1676162266","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1786500?t=1676162266","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1786500/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1676162266","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1786500/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1676162266","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2246200,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Claw Machine Pro (CMP) is the physics-based claw game you\u2019ve been waiting for!
