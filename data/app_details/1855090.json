{"about_the_game":"Human civilization has been attacked by aliens set on the elimination of all sentient life in the galaxy. During this war, you were able to merge with a previously unknown substance called \u201cALT\u201d. As a result, you can now control ALT in a way previously thought impossible.  Your control of ALT allows you to build impossibly large military units known as \u201cBehemoths\u201d, and more amazingly, control time &amp; space.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou are now in control of the last remnants of humanity on the run from these warmongering aliens. You are tasked with eliminating the aliens' presence on a network of planets. Your ultimate goal is to eliminate the aliens on their home world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGameplay: This Next Time features hex based real time strategy gameplay. You will experience gameplay across countless procedurally generated maps. You can build various types of production centers based on the terrain type to generate resources needed to support your military. Build military bases to generate infantry, tanks, exo-skeletons, and air units to attack your enemies. Defeat alien bases to create Behemoth production centers. These behemoths are monstrous hero units that are capable of incredible power and destruction. Defeat the aliens on each level to advance and use your ALT to power up your units with the upgrade mechanic between each world.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1855090/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1644354754","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1855090/page.bg.jpg?t=1644354754","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1855090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1644354754","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1855090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1644354754","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Human civilization has been attacked by aliens set on the elimination of all sentient life in the galaxy.
