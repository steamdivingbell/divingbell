While it has gotten a modest number of downloads on the platform, less than 1 percent of players have beaten the final boss. This led me to wonder how gamers on Steam would fare. Consequently, I decided to port Serious Scramblers to the PC while using this opportunity to touch up various graphical aspects of the game.
