These towering skyscrapers are only available once you've completed a Steel Yard, and they are much more expensive than your average building. That said, they more than make up for the initial investment by not only providing a passive income from retail sales, but also by boosting various aspects of your city.<br><br>You may choose from the following retail units in Constructor Plus:<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/898800/extras/TrailerHighrise_Eng.png?t=1575426423\" /><br><br>With this monstrous tower of trailers, you will be able to temporarily place all new Level 1 and Level 2 tenants into temporary housing whilst you construct more permanent residences! This means that your Headquarters no longer has a limit on the number of level 1 and level 2 tenants it may hold. In addition to this, the Council waives all taxation fees related to your people.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/898800/extras/GlassHouse_Eng.png?t=1575426423\" /><br><br>The geniuses inside this pristine building will secure you an annual lump sum payment of 2% of your total assets. Not only that, but your Headquarters will no longer have any limits to level 3 and level 4 tenants as they totter away the day.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/898800/extras/FederalHall_Eng.png?t=1575426423\" /><br><br>Access to better training and equipment means up to 25% more recruits graduating as Police Cadets. The Council, pleased with your lawful pursuits, will also pay $500 for each new Police Cadet produced.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/898800/extras/StateTower_Eng.png?t=1575426423\" /><br><br>The lab-rats in this structure will further boost the productivity of your town's hospitals ensuring that they work 25% faster thanks to medical breakthroughs and better equipment. They have also devised a cure against zombification, and as such your town will no longer be at risk of zombie outbreaks.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/898800/extras/Capitol_Eng.png?t=1575426423\" /><br><br>Increasing the influence of the Mob in town means your Gangsters will have better access to appropriate equipment. Each Gangster created whilst the Mob Commission is functional will begin their criminal careers equipped with a pistol instead of a knife. You will also be provided with one extra favour per Gangster you produce. Additionally, as a close associate of The Family, your credit line will be extended by up to $100,000.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/898800/extras/AnglerBuilding_Eng.png?t=1575426423\" /><br><br>With this structure your property lawyers will ensure that you get the jump on any prime real-estate that your opponent owns. You will no longer pay extra to build on estates owned by another team. In addition to this, you will be paid a bonus by the Council for each tenant happier than 60%.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/898800/extras/SpaceNeedle_Eng.png?t=1575426423\" /><br><br>This crazed bunch of scientists swear by their methods. By inviting them into town your tenants will breed 10% faster. As they are still testing their latest breakthroughs, you will receive $5,000 for every 10 child births as a small compensation for your tenant's time.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/898800/extras/CommsTower_Eng.png?t=1575426423\" /><br><br>When things get serious you need the professionals. This shady group will boost the output of all Casinos owned by you by up to 25%. They are also rather good at bending the rules and will divert up to 10% of your rival's Casino earnings to your own bank account.</p><br><h1>CASINOS</h1><p>In addition to our new retail units, you will have the chance to also set up swanky Casinos ranging from low-grade penny pinchers up to well-to-do money makers. You'll need to ensure that you place them strategically to procure the greatest number of clients, and you must do your best to protect them from your rivals to extract the most value out of them. Proper placement is essential as you can only build one of each Casino at any given moment. Fortunately, tenants love to get some much-needed rest and recuperation at the local Casino, and therefore any Casino built on the same estate as other tenants will increase their happiness. You might very well find that you need to knock down some of your older wooden shacks in order to keep your Casinos relatively central to your town, and thus a buzzing beacon of your society!<br><br>Casinos in Constructor Plus require constant visits from the locals to continue making money. You will therefore need to ensure that your town is well populated to take full advantage of these buildings. Of course, if your rival has a thriving metropolis you can also build the Casinos closer to their town to attract their tenants instead! Just be sure that you keep them well protected as this can be a very risky, but also highly rewarding development move.<br><br>Each tenant type has a limit they can possibly spend at any given moment. So lowly Greasers may only spend 40% of their meagre income but the Toffs can splash out up to 300% of their hard earned cash.<br><br>In Constructor Plus, we have three different grades of Casino represented by the following:<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/898800/extras/Poker_Casino_Eng.png?t=1575426423\" /><br><br>This low-grade Casino is the first of its kind to which you will gain access due to its simple requirements of a Brick Yard. The floor limit for this Casino is a meagre $1,000, so it is not going to be anything to write home about. That said, it can be useful to get your foot in the door for more expensive projects down the line. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/898800/extras/Crazy_Clown_Eng.png?t=1575426423\" /><br><br>This medium-grade Casino is the second one you will unlock, and it requires a Steel Yard. It represents the next step in your gambling career and has a much higher floor limit of $2,000 so will prove even more lucrative than the lowly Poker Casino. Keep it well guarded with Gangsters because it will be an even larger target for your rivals!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/898800/extras/Nero's_Palace_Eng.png?t=1575426423\" /><br><br>This high-grade Casino is the final rung in the gambling ladder you have thus far been cultivating. It has a hefty price tag and requires that you have upgraded your Steel Yard into a Steel Factory. It is the most lucrative of your Casinos, and as such has a floor limit of a staggering $4,000! We don't need to tell you twice to keep this beauty well-guarded... Or do we?!</p><br><h1>TAKE YOUR CAREER TO NEW HEIGHTS</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/898800/extras/pls_SpaceBanner.png?t=1575426423\" /><br><br>In Constructor Plus, we want you to take your property development careers to new heights, and we don't just mean towering Skyscrapers! We are proud to say that you may choose from three incredibly unique and beautifully rendered space-themed worlds. Take your career to the moon, explore the dusty dunes of Mars, or go where no man has gone before to the industrial outposts of Uranus.<br><br>To complement these new worlds, we have also added in an array of fully re-imagined space-themed buildings, as well as the beautifully crafted soundtrack of Mat Jarvis to take your interstellar career to the next level. That's right, only in Constructor Plus can you take your love for charging high rent, and blowing up your rival's investments, to the stars. <br><br>If you think you've got what it takes then join System 3 Space Tours for this delightfully humorous, and not-at-all serious, interplanetary adventure.</p><br><h1>NEW UNDESIRABLE - STEPTOE'S YARD</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/898800/extras/SteptoeYard_Eng.png?t=1575426423\" /><br><br>This rather unassuming junk yard plays host to mutant cockroaches with all the charm of the local Hippy Commune. Good thing they're on your side then, right?<br><br>Unique to Constructor Plus, Steptoe's Yard is a unique undesirable building because not only can you use it for nefarious deeds, it also serves as the drop-off point for any gadgets or resources foraged by its cockroaches. You can then pick up these gadgets with your characters (excluding Repairmen!) and drop them off elsewhere. For example, your cockroaches might acquire a lovely Computer that you can immediately send to a tenant's house to be installed. However, if instead the gadget acquired is an external decoration you will first need to send it to your Gadget Factory so that the boffins over there can set up the delivery route at your discretion. This mechanic extends to trading gadgets/resources between other team's dumps, and you can even steal from rival dumps with your own Workers!<br><br>It wouldn't be an undesirable without some use against your opponent, though, would it? Steptoe's Yard is a highly undesirable place to live near and it will inflict heavy stress penalties on all tenants that live on the same estate. This can be used to cause all kinds of problems for your opponent and will be sure to send their repair bill through the roof!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/898800/extras/SteptoeAnim_Eng.gif?t=1575426423\" /><br><br>In that same idea, you may also send the cockroaches on different kinds of context-sensitive missions (simply select a cockroach and send them to a rival's building). This involves such tasks as infesting empty buildings or causing additional cockroach damage to a building. <br><br>Unlike the other undesirables, the cockroach does not show up on the radar as a flashing blip and are not deterred by Policemen or Guard Dogs. They can also get around much faster, and they need to because they are god-awfully slow on their feet, by utilising tube sites. Keep them out of sight, though, because they are fragile and can be killed very easily if they are caught! <br><br>Fortunately, if you're defending against these critters you can either install a handy cockroach trap, the natural enemy of the unsuspecting cockroach, or pay close attention to where your rival might set up tube sites to take advantage of their natural ability. A couple of Workers, or a Gangster, will generally do the trick!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/898800/extras/pg_StoreBanner_sLogo.gif?t=1575426423\" /><br><br>Constructor Plus is the latest in the critically acclaimed series of Constructor games that have captivated gamers for over twenty years.
