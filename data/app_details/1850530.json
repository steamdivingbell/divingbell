Earth\u2019s fossil fuels had run out. Any remaining deposits were fought over fiercely by various big companies. In  the  end  there  were  no  winners  as  is  always  the  case  in  times  of  war.  The  earth,  or  what remained of it was now mostly a wasteland of shattered ideals and the stain of humanity upon it. So we took to the stars. From the Lunar and Mars colonization\u2019s we were able to slowly stretch our hand outwards to the great beyond. Like a plague some would say, to do unto other planets what we had done upon earth. As for the peace, it was a fragile thing. There was a peace treaty signed but the moment a moon or  asteroid was  found  with  a  potential  of resources  all  companies  risked  their  hand  on  taking their cut. Humanity having long accustomed to its corporate capitalistic ways of life, slaved away for the promise of a brighter future among the stars.<br>At the year 2109 something was found in the crust of a planet. An artifact of sorts of unknown origins. It\u2019s shape no bigger than that of a clenched fist. The company who discovered it quickly took to experimentation with it to uncover the secrets within.  And  something  was  found.  Within  the  artifact  it  seemed  to  contain  a  supply  of unlimited energy, just waiting to be tapped. The energy could solve the entire crisis at once. However it was decided to not be shared. The company continued its experimentation on in secret. Until one day a test was executed that had disastrous consequences. Nothing much is known how exactly it happened but only that it was on the planet designated PX-307 that after an unknown experiment took place a massive energy spike was read coming from the surface. The planet itself was consumed within an incredible mass of crystalline substance that swallowed everything and everyone whole. From orbital shots nothing seemed to remainof the facility where the supposed artifact was located, nor were any of the other colonies visible under the massive growth of pulsating orange crystals. The crystal substance itself however did not stop there, it was still growing. It moved in swirls of toxic webs into the galaxy wide. Any new planet it reached it would repeat its process of consuming its way across the surface. Other companies were able to investigate the crystalline substance themselves and quickly found that the crystals themselves also harnessed a large amount of energy within. If harvested it could potentially fuel starships and the human race for centuries...  This was the only spark that was needed to reignite the war. <br><br>At the year 2109 something was found in the crust of a planet. An artifact of sorts of unknown origins.

Backwater colonies were often left without protection. When the mold reached them, there wasn\u2019t much anyone could or would do. Some companies saw this even as an opportunity \u201cTo study the effects and understand the mold\u201d they said.  A  means  to  learn  to  control  it  and  spread  it  effectively.  Perhaps  even  to  infect  planets purposefully. Others don\u2019t see it that way and believe it unethical and against humanity. They want a more controlled environmentwhere the mold can be studied without the loss of life. It might take longer but at least we won\u2019t lose our humanity in the progress, they claim.  The war only escalates. We\u2019re all being conscripted into this war one way or another. A war where we might just end up destroying all what\u2019s left of humanity.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1850530/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736847182","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1850530/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1736847182","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1850530/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736847182","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1850530/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736847182","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"This game contains content not appropriate for all ages: Frequent Violence, General Mature Content"},"detailed_description":"<strong>Descend</strong> is a fast-paced VR shooter.
