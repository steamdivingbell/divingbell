{"about_the_game":"Defentron is a 3D &quot;Tower Defense&quot; straight out of the 80's with its retro look.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGet ready and battle for the ultimate upgrade. Defentron, the retro-futurist computer system is trying to safeguard itself from malicious viruses that seek to control its core.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nUse strategy to upgrade your lines of defense and become the most powerful security system ever known.   <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThink like an 80s software. You will face fast, hard, resilient enemies, capable of regenerating or splitting when destroyed, returning to the battlefield. Nobody will be safe until the last of the living enemies falls.   <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWill you be able to save Defentron from the enemy threat? It all depends on you.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"First Steps","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1475970/72eb32517cd3523a4927b9854269bf1463c072e7.jpg"},{"name":"Motherhood","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1475970/212166ec98a654f6147eca04b6f5b5aec6d6853b.jpg"},{"name":"Blue Pill","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1475970/22d32f1f840c302af0aa0f711b06810372285a68.jpg"},{"name":"Centralized","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1475970/b4f05e57537177ad8e28e276156c20fc6a7f7fe5.jpg"},{"name":"Dark Tides","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1475970/e8275df68cc1a3f2349fe30aba0b4c10f714b392.jpg"},{"name":"Perfect Beginnings","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1475970/6277225899a3aecbd6ca1e127a95132d4bbfe853.jpg"},{"name":"Pride of the Motherland","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1475970/ac062df1c6c464ee35af889789fbba3df0e5fdc2.jpg"},{"name":"Red Pill","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1475970/c29d9e5f5375de1a322e5da444847a882c79b559.jpg"},{"name":"Served","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1475970/aca4ee8c7feced3aba7c3d8710fb6ea4369f395e.jpg"},{"name":"Dark Conqueror","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1475970/f46ad9edcf029b27716ff7c63babf310e97a669f.jpg"}],"total":50},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1475970?t=1732184216","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1475970/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1732184216","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1475970/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732184216","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1475970/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732184216","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Defentron is a 3D &quot;Tower Defense&quot; straight out of the 80's with its retro look.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGet ready and battle for the ultimate upgrade.
