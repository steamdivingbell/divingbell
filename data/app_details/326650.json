{"about_the_game":"Candlewind is a small and peaceful town where everyone lives in harmony. At least, that's what it used to be. The forces of darkness have come to stay. Deep in the depths of the earth, a dark power is rearing its ugly head. The villagers are blissfully unaware \u2014 for the moment. You alone can prevent the destruction of Candlewind. Ride into battle with your warriors, explore dark dungeons, discover legendary treasures, and protect Candlewind from the danger it knows nothing of.<br><br>The Legend of Candlewind: Nights &amp; Candles returns to the traditions of old role-playing legends. Go up against the forces of evil in hand-drawn dungeons, step by step. Following in the footsteps of classic dungeon crawlers, players will take part in turn-based battles that will put their skills to the ultimate test. Only true role-playing gamers will have any chance of survival!<br><br><br><strong>Hand-drawn graphics</strong><br>Exactly like it used to be: Every single little detail in The Legend of Candlewind has been drawn by hand.

Under the town of Candlewind, an enormous cavern with ten different levels waits to be explored.
