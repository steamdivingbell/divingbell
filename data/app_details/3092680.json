He has recently divorced his wife and she has taken their young daughter and moved out of the house, since he can\u2019t take care of himself. His mental health is worsening since he became alone in the big mansion. To deal with his inner \u201cdemons\u201d, he tried to seek help in the mansion's library, where the previous owner left a large collection of occult and spiritual books. This put him on a path toward ritualistic sacrifices, contaminating and blurring his memories, and releasing various creatures into his home and mind.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3092680/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724880389","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3092680/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1724880389","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3092680/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724880389","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3092680/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724880389","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"The game contains blood on the walls, indicating some form of previous violence, along with bottles of alcohol in the mansion.
