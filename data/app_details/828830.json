{"about_the_game":"The 2S14 Zhalo-S is an experimental light, highly mobile, Soviet self-propelled gun from the 1980s. It is armed with an 85mm cannon on a BTR-70 wheeled chassis. Despite its unusually low caliber, the gun was very capable of defeating older vehicles, but it lacked the penetration of 125mm guns, a fact that ultimately doomed the project. The surviving prototype is currently located in the Kubinka Tank Museum.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Armored Warfare, it\u2019s one of the deadliest Tier 4 vehicles when driven by an experienced commander. Its gun has a rather low caliber for its Tier, but it more than makes up for it with its rate of fire and penetration power. The Zhalo-S can stay hidden for extended periods of time thanks to its excellent camouflage factor and, with a bit of luck, is capable of taking out entire squads of enemies on its own.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/828830/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1703144711","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/828830/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1703144711","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/828830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1703144711","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/828830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1703144711","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Turn Notifications","id":32}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The 2S14 Zhalo-S is an experimental light, highly mobile, Soviet self-propelled gun from the 1980s.
