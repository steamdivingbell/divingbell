{"about_the_game":"This hysterical, story-rich 3D adventure game is all about player choice and partying the way you want.  House Party's unique AI and scripting system allows the game to shape and mold its content around your choices.  You'll see something new or different each time you play.  To date, there are hundreds of different stories, side-quests, and narratives, and thousands of branching stories and dynamic elements.  Content is being added regularly, so it just keeps getting bigger and better!
