{"about_the_game":"<strong>TSW Compatible content released for a previous Train Sim World\u00ae - features may remain unchanged from the original release and may not make use of all newer core features.</strong><br><br>Passenger &amp; freight often combine on RhB rails into dual-purpose operations, and with Rivet Games\u2019 Arosa Aggregates pack, all-new Swiss stone-laden services will be yours to master. The Fac wagon and 2 new Ge 4/4 II liveries bring the Aggregate terminal on Arosalinie to life in Train Sim World\u00ae. <br><br>Nestled high in the Swiss peaks, the Arosa Line winds its way along mountain ridges and across towering valleys, while also squeezing through the streets of Chur. A vital passenger route, granted, but also among the mix is a series of rail-served industries, including an aggregate terminal sat just outside of Arosa station. <br><br>It\u2019s your job to carefully haul Fac wagons, attached to the rear of passenger trains, up the 1km in altitude from Chur to Arosa, shunt them into the terminal for unloading, before reattaching them for the nail-biting downhill run. You will also have the unique opportunity to mix freight with the existing SP-W timber wagon, operate a stand-in mail delivery service with the Gepackwagen, and rescue a stranded service in harsh conditions. <br><br>Powerful and capable, the Ge 4/4 II is well suited to the task, and it arrives in 2 new liveries: loco no. 629 celebrating the construction of the new Albula tunnel, and no. 622 commemorating the Rh\u00e4tische Bahn\u2019s Japanese partner, the Hakone Tozan Railway. <br><br>With Train Sim World\u00ae Free Roam, take the new RhB Ge 4/4 liveries and haul a selection of stock from the Arosalinie route, and the RhB Anniversary Collection. <br><br>Expand your metre-gauge collection with new stock, scenarios and services, and get back to work along the classic Arosalinie with Rivet Games\u2019 RhB Arosa Aggregates Pack! <br><br><strong>Please Note: For the full experience, we recommend you own Train Sim World\u00ae: Arosalinie: Chur - Arosa which is available as a separate purchase.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2> <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li>RhB Ge 4/4 II Electric Locomotive in 2 new liveries: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li>No. 622 Hakone Tozan Railway <br></li><li>No. 629 Neubau Albulatunnel </li></ul> </li><li>RhB Fac Aggregate Wagon <br></li><li>Highly detailed, feature-rich, driving cabs <br></li><li>True-to-life performance and handling <br></li><li>5 additional Scenarios and an additional Timetable for Arosalinie <br></li><li>Scenario features include picking up mailbags in the Gepackwagen and mailboxes across the route <br></li><li>Additional Journey Mode chapter for Arosalinie <br></li><li>Livery Designer and Scenario Planner compatible.
