{"about_the_game":"Raw Metal is a sci-fi stealth-action dungeon crawler with a focus on smooth, stylish gameplay.<br><br>You are a lone scavenger on the distant, barren exoplanet Charybdis. In search of gear and supplies, you infiltrate the depths of Katabase 6, a massive mining facility run by a corrupt megacorporation known as Orpheus Tech. Sneak through the mines undetected, cleverly utilizing various gadgets and equipment to your advantage, but beware; if you're caught, you'll need to rely on your combat skills for a fighting chance to escape.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">High-Stakes Stealth</h2><br>Use taser darts, noisemakers, improvised flashbangs, and more to slip past and isolate guards. The shadows are your domain; manipulate your environment and your enemies well enough and they'll never see you coming.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Breakneck Combat</h2><br>Combat in Raw Metal is fast and punishing. The guards stationed at Katabase 6 are stronger and more heavily armored than you, so fighting them head on will take skill cunning, and a great degree of risk. However, mastering combos and using your environment will allow you to come out on top, and yield far greater rewards. Depending on whether it is initiated through a clever ambush or a stealth slip-up, combat can range from a calculated risk to a desperate fight for survival.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Development and Planned Features</h2><br>Raw Metal is still early in development, and the Alpha Demo includes the following features:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Core stealth and combat gameplay<br></li><li>One test level along with a tutorial level<br></li><li>5 types of consumable gadgets</li></ul><br>The final release of the game is planned to include the following features:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>3 distinct regions with a few levels each<br></li><li>3 unique bosses (one at the end of each region)<br></li><li>Modifiable gear</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2283830/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1710353118","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2283830/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1710353118","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2283830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1710353118","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2283830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1710353118","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Raw Metal is a sci-fi stealth-action dungeon crawler with a focus on smooth, stylish gameplay.<br><br>You are a lone scavenger on the distant, barren exoplanet Charybdis.
