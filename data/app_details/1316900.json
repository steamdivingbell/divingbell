{"about_the_game":"Creep is a 2D platform game that takes place inside a struggled person's inner world represented as a worm world. You control the worm form of the same person as he shows why this world exists and how it's like to live there.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">I have no friends and life is full of obstacles</h2>Yes, it is hard to say the other worms in the world are friendly, and there are lots of other dangers you will encounter. There is no one else other than you to cope with all these. Your only weapon is your wit against this crooked world until you reach the point to hell with it. This won't just go forever like that. Your relationship with other worms will change as you progress.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">I once loved too</h2>Throughout the story, you will occasionally visit some memories or analogical mini levels with different gameplay than the main part of the game. These levels will unlock new abilities the worm can use. These abilities are not mere powers. They are part of the actual character progression itself and they will start to change the main gameplay and story.","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1316900/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1595358091","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1316900/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1595358091","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"This game includes gore intended for mature audience."},"detailed_description":"Creep is a 2D platform game that takes place inside a struggled person's inner world represented as a worm world.
