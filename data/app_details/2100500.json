{"about_the_game":"Let yourself be carried away by the incessant pursuit. Play the role of a boy - Simon and show the pool guards who is in charge! Feel the taste of commercial America of the 1960s, blending into a fairy-tale aquapark full of attractions. Demonstrate agility in competition with enemies by farting and polluting pool zones, destroying their filtering pumps. Only this will allow you to recover secret confectionery recipes that will be with you forever. Don't forget about your best friend Poopie, who is always ready to help you come out alive. Have fun!<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2100500/extras/grafikasteam605.png?t=1727204701\" />","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2100500?t=1727204701","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2100500?t=1727204701","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2100500/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727204701","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2100500/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727204701","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h1>Important Announcement: 'Swimming Poo' Demo Delayed \u2013 Production Continues</h1><p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We tried our best to deliver the Swimming Poo demo on time, but we've decided to adjust our production plans. Fortunately, only the schedule has been affected, and the project is still in production. We're striving to deliver the best entertainment game set in an aqua park ever made\u2014within our capabilities, of course, as this is our first game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We don't intend to create another piece of crap on Steam or deceive you with trailers that don't show gameplay. We care about quality and presenting something unique because we're gamers ourselves. So when we return, the first thing you'll see is a gameplay trailer, and we'll release a demo shortly after.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This will most likely happen in the second half of 2025. For now... the pool is closed.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Thank you for your support from every corner of the world!
