{"about_the_game":"Liquid Rhythm is a wildly innovative beat generator, sequencer, and software MIDI controller. It's powered by a rhythm synthesis engine that gives you instant access to quadrillions of rhythmic patterns that can be manipulated with a comprehensive suite of MIDI effects called Molecule Tools. Paint drum patterns using a palette of note clusters that provide new visualizations for MIDI data, make beats using multi-sample drum instruments or your own samples, and run it standalone or integrate into your workflow through VST/AU/RTAS/Max for Live.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><br><strong>Accent Modifiers</strong><br>Accent Modifiers target the velocity and groove of notes; basically the things that make music not sound like renegade robots hijacked your studio and started making music. You can think of Accent Modifiers as avenues to <u>humanize</u> your beats and free them from totalitarian robotic rule.<br><br><strong>BeatBuilder: BarForm List</strong><br>When you\u2019re creating a drum track, the Beat Builder is your best friend. By default, it\u2019s a really straightforward look at some commonly occurring patterns for whatever instrument you have selected. For example, if you\u2019re working on a snare instrument, the Beat Builder will instantly highlight snare-specific patterns you can insert into regions with one click.<br><br><strong>BeatBuilder: BeatForm Sequencer</strong><br>A regular sequencer loops one or two bars and you input notes one at a time. The BeatForm Sequencer takes that model to the next level:  Each space in the sequencer can hold one or more notes, up to six. You can think of the spaces in the BeatForm sequencer as placeholders for groups of notes. All it ever takes is one click in the BeatForm Sequencer to get a cluster of notes in any given space. <br> <br><strong>BeatSeeker</strong><br>The BeatWeaver Rhythm Synthesizer can be an intimidating mass of information to negotiate through. That\u2019s why the developers at WaveDNA built the BeatSeeker, an intelligent algorithm that highlights the most commonly occurring patterns for whatever instrument you\u2019re working on. Our team of astute scientists studied several hundred songs from a variety of genres to ensure its accuracy. <br><br><strong>In-Line Editing</strong><br>Liquid Rhythm\u2019s Pencil and Paint tools turn the Arranger into something it should always be\u2013 a Canvas.
