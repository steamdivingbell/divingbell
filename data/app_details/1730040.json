Virtual realities, having reached a high degree of complexity both technologically and socially, give rise to problems. The principle of the system is that the people enclosed in it see poorly how it works, so they need the help of an outsider. They need gamedec. Torkil receives orders from individuals, companies, and forces that camouflage their identities. Sooner or later, gamedec will have to deal with reality animators, not just virtual ones. In the meantime, he enjoys the company of friends, women, and his own dreams.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1730040?t=1664534981","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1730040/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1664534981","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1730040/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1664534981","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1730040/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1664534981","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Play as the main character known from the Gamedec saga by Marcin Sergiusz Przyby\u0142ek.
