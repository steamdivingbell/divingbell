Where the original did not mince its words &quot;Your daughter died of dysentery&quot;, this game did not get any less harsh. It feels like in a time when modern games are all about popping bubbles or crushing candy, this game can feel a little jarring, a little bit like a pinch in the face with reality, or at least one possible future reality.
