Take the call to arms as you will control and use the four most skilled fighters Rujino has to offer. Viktor is a human warrior who uses double weapons to deal massive blows to enemies and Trist is his better half a elven warrior who is willing to fight to restore peace to the land of the elven, Liss is a human mage she is a well versed mage who has studied her arts of magic all her life and is a master of the elements and then caine the priest who hails from a elven clan as well as Trist. Caine was voted to join the three others by the council of elders in Luonto who believe he is the best priest the elven have to offer. Fight through countless lands, terrains, and bosses to get to the demon castle where the beings of death are casting a shadow over all of Rujino and once you are done restoring light to Rujino you will be asked to aide the elven people who have lost their inner animal presence also known as Henki. Battle your way through Rujino and fight to restore the statue of the bear so the elven Henki of all elven may return.
