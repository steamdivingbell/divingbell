{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">7Years is a non-linear, open-world horror game, that offers both a single-player story and 4-player online co-op. After waking up in the middle of the night, you discover that you're wife is missing. Desperate to find her, you try to find help, only to quickly learn that the only person left in your entire mountainside neighborhood is you. No phone service and the main powerline to the neighborhood has been severed. You are alone, or so you think, until you find a modified HAM radio system that is transmitting a repeating message...with your name in it. The person on the other end may be your only hope to find your wife and survive the horrors surrounding you. Traverse open-world maps as you investigate for clues, solve puzzles, uncover mysteries and elude unique demonic enemies, each created to trigger a specific fear and complete their only mission...to find you.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3019060/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735850131","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3019060/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1735850131","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3019060/b805e35468716a26f1f2f32cbac38e641d4e8cfd/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735850131","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3019060/b805e35468716a26f1f2f32cbac38e641d4e8cfd/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735850131","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3284440,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">7Years is a non-linear, open-world horror game, that offers both a single-player story and 4-player online co-op.
