{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ghoul Island Act 3 Clean Up Crew</h2> The time has come to press their advantage and drive the foul cult of Ghatanothoa from idyllic Farzeen. In act 3, Clean-Up Crew, the adventurers do just that and in their investigations learn that their fight has just begun. Gaining entrance to the hastily constructed citadel proves to be a near insurmountable challenge, and the adventurers turn to the lava tubes riddling Farzeen for an answer. The subterranean path has its own host of challenges, but they fight through, learning more of the island's true history in the process. When faced with the power of Ghatanothoa they experience their first taste of bitter defeat at the hands of its mummifying gaze. Fortuitously, a previously unknown ally provides the opportunity to escape, and they are able to warn their allies that the battle is far from over.<br> <i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by:</i> <strong>George Botelho</strong> <br><strong>Requires:</strong> An active subscription or a one time purchase of a Fantasy Grounds Unity license and the included 5E Compatible ruleset. <br>Screenshots may differ from what you see in-game based on the extensions and ruleset you have loaded.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1865450/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1644386105","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1865450/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1644386105","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1865450/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1644386105","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1865450/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1644386105","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ghoul Island Act 3 Clean Up Crew</h2> The time has come to press their advantage and drive the foul cult of Ghatanothoa from idyllic Farzeen.
