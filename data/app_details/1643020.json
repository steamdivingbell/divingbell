{"about_the_game":"This DLC contains one Hunter and two Weapons:<br />\r\n- The Beast Hunter (Hunter)<br />\r\n- The Bark (Romero 77 Hatchet)<br />\r\n- The Bite (Crossbow)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor as long as he could remember, Theodore Tuck was plagued by the same nightmare. In marsh blanketed in fog, Tuck would find himself surrounded by sharp gnashing teeth, frothing with spittle and blood as they snarled and snapped, desperate to tear the flesh from his bones. Sometimes there would be hundreds; sometimes only one. And each morning he would awaken with a fresh new scar. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCertain that the dreams were an ill-omen and determined to face his fears and destroy them at the root, Tuck searched field, forest, and mountain the country over, finally coming face to face with those nightmarish creatures in Louisiana. He proved his mettle hunting the beasts of the Bayou and through his skill with animals, but when he set out to tame the hellhounds themselves, even most Hunters thought he\u2019d gone too far. His attempts earned him infamy \u2013 and many additional scars.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1643020?t=1728562412","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1643020/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1728562412","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1643020/85d2b1c84a72157712ac26fb7aa117ad4f6437a4/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728562412","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1643020/85d2b1c84a72157712ac26fb7aa117ad4f6437a4/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728562412","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"This DLC contains one Hunter and two Weapons:<br />\r\n- The Beast Hunter (Hunter)<br />\r\n- The Bark (Romero 77 Hatchet)<br />\r\n- The Bite (Crossbow)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor as long as he could remember, Theodore Tuck was plagued by the same nightmare.
