{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Polytropos: A Tactical Odyssey</strong> is a roguelite turn-based strategy RPG.

Your decisions will shape the encounters you face and the development of your hero. Your hero will acquire heroic epithets granting permanent unique effects and learn godly prophecies to turn fights in your favor.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Battles will be won and lost by the strategies you employ. Fight from a distance with a force of archers, or send flying units in to disrupt enemy formations. Hinder your enemies by casting powerful prophecies, or turn your hero into a one-person army and wreak havoc. After each crisis, new boons are earned, allowing you to continually adjust your approach to find success.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Choose Your Patron</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each Patron offers distinct prophecies, units, and epithets to your hero. Behold the pantheon:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Athena uses strong, defensive units. Her powers aid allied troops and enable clever strategies.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Zeus has fast, flying allies. His powers deal high damage to enemies, or increase the mobility of allies.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Archers and wild beasts compose Artemis' army. Her nature-oriented powers heal allies and hinder enemies.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Ares has powerful, offense-oriented forces. His powers promote reckless aggression and direct heroism.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Poseidon balances a mixture of mobile and hardy units. He uses large, sweeping prophecies to dominate conflicts.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Hades summons vast undead hordes. He can control death itself, and bring forth the riches of the Underworld.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Only 4 Patrons are available during each playthrough, so every odyssey offers new, powerful combinations for you to explore. In addition, all patrons have unique synergy effects - for example, having 3 or more Ares units grants\u00a0<strong>Indomitable</strong>, causing all your units to become stronger when attacked.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Choose Your Challenge</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Triumphant odysseys unlock new heroes and units to use on future playthroughs. Work your way up through 10 increasing difficulty levels to find your ideal challenge.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Polytropos: A Tactical Odyssey\u00a0</strong>was built from the ground up to facilitate easy customization. All units, prophecies, epithets and game parameters are defined in text files located in the game's install directory, allowing easy tweaks and modding. Buff your favorite unit, or add new ones for endless content!</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3227320/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732340656","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3227320/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1732340656","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3227320/4332f9cc661b8e72792a6827f2707105eba95fb4/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732340656","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3227320/4332f9cc661b8e72792a6827f2707105eba95fb4/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732340656","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Polytropos: A Tactical Odyssey</strong> is a roguelite turn-based strategy RPG.
