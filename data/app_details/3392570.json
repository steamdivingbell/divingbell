{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MORTAL QUEST</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Follow John, a mortal who has been transferred to an island infested by monsters and demons. You must guide him through dangerous challenges in order to prove himself worthy to fulfill an ancient prophecy. Meet uncomprehensible foes and even some unexpected allies on this unforgettable journey.\u00a0</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SURVIVAL</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The main theme of Mortal Quest is survival. There are dangerous monsters to face on the island, and if you die, you have to restart from where you last saved. There are many ways to fend off the monsters, including building a base, crafting new weapons, managing your health and hunger, and learning and adapting to each enemy's unique threats.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ADVENTURE</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Another big theme of Mortal Quest is adventure. The island is big and vast, but that isn't the only place to explore in this alternate realm. There is also a cave system, a still-running ancient civilization, a relic of an older time, and MUCH more! Each area has new resources, new foes, and even possibly new friends? It's up to you to explore and find out!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">COOL MECHANICS</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Mortal Quest has a bunch of mechanics that keep the game engaging and fun. There is a crafting system that unlocks new recipes the more you progress. This means that not everything is available to the player right off the bat, and they have to progress to unlock new tools and resources. There is also cooking, fishing, long-ranged weaponry, and more!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PLAY THE DEMO</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Don't buy a game you might not enjoy. Try the demo first! It's free and will give you an idea of what this game is and what it's all about. If you don't enjoy it, don't buy the full game.
