{"about_the_game":"Spaceship is a short technical demo showcasing high-end visual effects of the Unity game engine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou will play a 5-minute long first-person narrative sequence: While escaping an alien attack, your spaceship has warped into uncertain space and you need to find an escape route, before your pursuers catch up with you. Roaming into the spaceship, and Interacting with holographic terminals maps, you need to find a way to land into safe space... or is it already too late?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can run the demo using different graphics quality levels and test some graphics features of Unity High Definition Render Pipeline. Also, we provide a benchmark mode that runs a simulation of the demo and reports simple results.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you are interested on how the project was made, you can also download the full Unity project to learn, mod, reuse, or explore the content. It is available as open-source directly on GitHub.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1605230/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1635173599","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1605230/page.bg.jpg?t=1635173599","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1605230/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1635173599","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1605230/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1635173599","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Spaceship is a short technical demo showcasing high-end visual effects of the Unity game engine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou will play a 5-minute long first-person narrative sequence: While escaping an alien attack, your spaceship has warped into uncertain space and you need to find an escape route, before your pursuers catch up with you.
