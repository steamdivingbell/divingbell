{"about_the_game":"<strong>Everything</strong> is an interactive experience where every object in the Universe is a playable character - from animals to planets to galaxies and beyond. Travel between outer and inner space, and explore a vast, interconnected universe of things without enforced goals, scores, or tasks to complete. Everything is a procedural, AI-driven simulation of the systems of nature, seen from the points of view of everything in the Universe.\u00a0<br><br>Learn to transform yourself to create worlds within worlds within worlds, or let go any time to allow Everything to take over and produce a never ending documentary about the world you live in. Narrated by the inspiring philosophy of Alan Watts, and featuring a rich score from composer Ben Lukas Boysen, Everything will give you a new perspective on life.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Everything is Everything","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/582270/e540917affc412716c23151aba1aa7d9c5a82a88.jpg"},{"name":"Hello, I Exist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/582270/ad8b970ef8f5da2398aa8bfff98e1df504923280.jpg"},{"name":"The Space Between Things","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/582270/f2dbb1abe74fbe4a813a87c1db96b6fe4216c1ad.jpg"},{"name":"Ready to Think","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/582270/ed13f509e2b71eb2e002494c4dd83db50bc5e94d.jpg"},{"name":"The Swing Of Things","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/582270/53b70aad6a6c5e4bace435813b7efd5e4ece8eef.jpg"},{"name":"r-Strategist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/582270/958812fd696e4a2136ba495180c28dcfdece4cab.jpg"},{"name":"Thinker","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/582270/5d56579dceca5a6b06720af9b6db553a182bcde3.jpg"},{"name":"Thought Collector","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/582270/d79b7c45b8e92ad0d063a277763e3f429c97d2f2.jpg"},{"name":"Formless Form","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/582270/7adeba78e5559cf33837762144fed2d6441bd487.jpg"},{"name":"Symmetrizer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/582270/29459662b941cd887b50b4b149228876945ab9dd.jpg"}],"total":36},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/582270/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1674789705","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/582270/page.bg.jpg?t=1674789705","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/582270/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1674789705","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/582270/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1674789705","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>Everything</strong> is an interactive experience where every object in the Universe is a playable character - from animals to planets to galaxies and beyond.
