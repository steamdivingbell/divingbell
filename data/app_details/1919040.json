Your mission is to safeguard your forest settlement against the relentless onslaught of deranged creatures from Slavic mythology. Forge an indomitable army and construct fiery walls during the night to fend off the chilling spirit of winter. Take charge of your settlement, diligently recruiting fighters to bolster your forces before each nightfall. However, remain vigilant, for each new day presents fresh challenges and obstacles to overcome. Immerse yourself in the mesmerizing world that surrounds you, meticulously studying and exploring the lush forests as you embark on a quest for eternal spring.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1919040/extras/3.png?t=1731062316\" /><br>Once upon a time, a child with a remarkable difference was born. Their heart burned as intensely as a dragon's breath, and their kindness shone so brightly that even the gods took notice. However, this extraordinary power came at a cost. It drove a hunter to madness, inflicting eternal sorrow upon innocent people. In an attempt to restore balance, the water deity stripped the frost of all its powers. But in turn, the frost imprisoned the child's soul within a sacred totem, rendering them capable of defeating the vengeful merman with their army. In a cruel twist, the water deity brought forth the demise of Mokosh, the god of nature and life. Yet, these mighty powers of frost were taken away, and the child of fire became subject to punishment for any misdeed. Determined to reclaim their true self, the child of fire strives to restore their powers, day after day.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1919040/extras/2.png?t=1731062316\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Mythical Creatures: &quot;Winter&quot; immerses players in a world filled with enchanting mythical creatures from Slavic mythology.
