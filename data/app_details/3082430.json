{"about_the_game":"Tamzin Twins is an action-RPG adventure with countless enemies of all sorts, magic spells, sword agility combat, breathtaking locations, tons of loot and miniature baseplates for all characters.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Start Evil, Become Queens</h2>Enya and Kyra start their journey as evil servants of the dark lord Tyrek Tefari. He orders the twins to be executed because they are growing too powerful. The twins escape the assassination attempt and swear to kill Tyrek for betraying them. In the twins\u2019 attempt at revenge, Tyrek nearly kills them by stabbing them and throwing them off a cliff.<br><br>The twins wake up battered and bruised across the world without their magic. They vow to enact revenge on Tyrek Tefari, no matter what army stands in their way. Enya and Kyra will discover what it means to be leaders, what it means to do good for others and what morality means in this epic tale to be experienced. The twins will meet barons and kings of different leadership qualities and learn from them all to become queens themselves. Initially their goals are all about revenge and whatever it takes, but eventually they see the effect they have on the people they help.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unique Sword-Throwing Combat</h2>It\u2019s not every day you see a player juggle swords and throw them around. The player has 4 weapon slots where they can throw them and leave them on the ground. Magical weapons will have certain effects when they are stuck on the ground. Magically recall your weapons in an instant and damage your foes again on the way back.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3082430/extras/EnyaGif2_480.gif?t=1736809529\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3082430/extras/EnyaGif3_480.gif?t=1736809529\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unforgettable Characters</h2>From the terrible tyrant Tyrek Tefari to even humble shopkeepers, players are bound to find some characters they\u2019ll relate to and enjoy having conversations with. This game has a fully featured dialogue system that allows the other player to keep exploring while you enjoy talking with the locals.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Couch Co-op</h2>Play together on the same screen. Player two isn\u2019t just player one without any dialogue, player two is Kyra who has her own dreams, ambitions and opinions on things that differ from her twin sister\u2019s. Will they learn morality at the same speed? Of course not! Will they get along all the time? Nope! Will they actually talk to each other sometimes? Yep<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Breathtaking Locations</h2>Enya and Kyra\u2019s path to revenge is filled with misty cliffs, dangerous swamps, endless seas, haunted forests, relaxing shores, creepy dungeons and deadly volcanoes.
