Build tracks, traverse vast landscapes in various steam locomotives, transport goods to earn money, and customize and buy new locomotives and equipment as you grow to become a railroad tycoon. Play alone or with up to 15 friends in the online cooperative multiplayer mode on 4 different large maps including Lake Valley, Aurora Falls, Pine Valley and Mesa Plains. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1696810/extras/RRO_Visual3_BUILD.gif?t=1733753679\" /><strong>Tracks, trains &amp; more </strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Design your dream rail network from the ground up. Explore the world, scout the best route and lay down embankments, switches, turntables and more. Select and build tracks, bridges and other infrastructure buildings afterwards. Then cross the vast, open landscape in finely detailed locomotives and wagons. Interact with regulators, valves, brakes, couplers, and many more features in first-person view as you drive your vehicles. But you won't simply be driving around aimlessly! Your mission is to build up your company by transporting goods across the country, including timber, ore, coal, cattle, gold and other various freight items for a broad variety of industries. Earn money for every successful shipment and invest in new vehicles or upgrade and customize your existing locomotives. Plus: build stations, yards, and other infrastructure along your routes to service your trains with fuel, water, and sand. You can also build up a wide variety of iconic buildings and objects to create a beautiful surrounding for your railroad network.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1696810/extras/RRO_Visual4_DRIVE.gif?t=1733753679\" /><strong>Experience the Railroad Sandbox with up to 16 players </strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Enjoy a realistic railroad experience with the advanced Unreal Engine physics system for deep railroad simulation.
