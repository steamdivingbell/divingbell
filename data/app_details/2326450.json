{"about_the_game":"Ball Drop is a single-player puzzle platformer game. Made up of fast-pased action. The ball rolls down using gravity and you must use the mouse to move platforms to guide the ball to the goal line. Can you use the platforms and broken cogs to get the ball to it's destination? I certainly hope so! The objects in the game rotate following the mouse and you can use them to solve puzzles and navigate around hazzards. On the menu screen is the list of levels which are not level-locked, so players can navigate to whatever level they're interested in. The game is relatively short, 8 levels, taking about an hour to beat. The game is set with a minimalist gear and cog asthetic.  There are no items or levling-ups, just simple puzzle solving. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is a practice project for myself to learn Steam and game design. I hope you enjoy and would appreciate feedback.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2326450/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1680572915","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2326450/page.bg.jpg?t=1680572915","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2326450/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1680572915","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2326450/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1680572915","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Ball Drop is a single-player puzzle platformer game.
