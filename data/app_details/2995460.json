{"about_the_game":"You are a master runecrafter. You have been tasked with solving a series of puzzles using your runic knowledge to delve deeper and deeper into an ancient labyrinth, and discover what awaits you within. Each puzzle will require you to combine runes in more intricate and expansive ways as their complexity increases. Or you can choose to lose yourself within the labyrinth, playing through an endless sequence of puzzles with configurable difficulties.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery rune transforms streams of magic in unique ways: Changing the polarity of the magic flowing through your runic structure. Earth runes, air runes, fire, water, and more. Power flows from the heavens, and must always reach the void in the correct polarities. The aether and void runes show you the pattern, and it is up to you to draw the correct combination of runes to match it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStarting with a blank canvas of only the aether and void runes, watch their colors change and show you the pattern. Then drag out the runes you need to solve the pattern, and draw the lines to connect the runic pattern.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2995460?t=1718649899","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2995460?t=1718649899","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2995460/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718649899","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2995460/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718649899","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You are a master runecrafter.
