{"about_the_game":"<strong>SpellTome</strong> is a story driven 2D adventure platformer set in a fantasy world. You will explore a lakeside castle, navigate it's corridors and floors, dodge traps and fight magically animated weapons, armor, and more. The game follows our magic blinded protagonist on their path to steal, ehem, borrow the fabled SpellTome and uncover it's magic secrets.<br><br><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The Demo version of the game was done with Unity. Due to recent issues regarding the monetization and fees owed to Unity by indie developers we have decided to change the game engine to Godot. This change will revert most of our progress that we have done on the game so far, however we did not want to waste what we had.
