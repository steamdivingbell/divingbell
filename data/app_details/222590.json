{"about_the_game":"The hugely popular EMD F7 has hauled some of North America\u2019s most celebrated passenger trains, including Great Northern\u2019s Empire Builder, and is now available in this famous consist and livery for Train Simulator.<br><br>Built between February 1949 and December 1952 by General Motors\u2019 Electro-Motive Division and General Motors Diesel, the F7 started life as a freight-hauling unit but quickly moved on to haul passenger services for numerous North American railroads. The unit was the fourth in GM-EMD\u2019s line of successful F-unit locomotives and was the company\u2019s best-selling cab unit of all time \u2013 more than 2,300 cab-equipped A-units and just under 1,500 cabless B-units were built in total.<br><br>The EMD F7 replaced the EMD F3, although there were not many external differences between the two units \u2013 most changes were internal. Such was the popularity of the F7 that many remained in service for several decades as railroads found them economical to operate and maintain. However, they were not popular with yard crews as they were difficult to access and visibility was poor due to the high cab position and long nose.<br><br>With an operational speed of 80 km/h (50 mph) and a high tractive effort, the EMD F7 powered some of the most famous trains in North America, including Santa Fe\u2019s Super Chief and El Capitan, and Great Northern\u2019s Empire Builder, a famous passenger train route between Chicago and Seattle, Washington or Portland.<br><br>The Empire Builder first ran on 11 June 1929 and quickly became Great Northern\u2019s premier passenger service.

Latterly, the train carries in excess of half a million passengers annually, maintaining its status as the most popular long-distance train in Amtrak\u2019s national system.<br><br>The EMD F7 for Train Simulator is available in Great Northern \u2018Empire Builder\u2019 livery and includes the full coaching stock of the famous Empire Builder train, including sleeper cars, dome coach, sleeper observation car and mail baggage car. Features include cab lighting, Mars headlamp and passenger views from the different passenger cars.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the EMD F7 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam.
