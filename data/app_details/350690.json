{"about_the_game":"V16 engines are the largest capacity engine configuration available in Automation, with a capacity range of 1.1L - 21.7L. While it is not giving players any direct advantage, it offers a nuanced alternative to V12 engines for very-high-end cars.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBack before Steam Early Access was a thing, we did sell an early version of Automation via our own website. From 2012 to 2014, potential buyers had the choice between base version ($25), and a premium version ($35) of the game for players who wanted to support development a little extra. The latter promised the inclusion of exclusive V16 engines as soon as they are done. Now, after almost a year of V16 exclusivity for those early premium version buyers, we offer the upgrade to anyone who missed out back then and still wants to support us today.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/350690/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1531499238","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/350690/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1531499238","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/350690/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1531499238","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/350690/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1531499238","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"V16 engines are the largest capacity engine configuration available in Automation, with a capacity range of 1.1L - 21.7L.
