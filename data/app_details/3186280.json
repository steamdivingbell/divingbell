{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dukkido is a physics-based, Co-Op Action RTS where you directly control your Captain and a squad of minions. Collect resources, uncover artifacts, solve puzzles, and build your army while unraveling the secrets of the Relic Frontier. Play solo or with up to 5 players in chaotic Online Co-Op, and complete over 5 unique objectives in Dukkido's fully handcrafted mission-based adventure.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3186280/extras/Steamworks_Gifs_Tiny00000524.gif?t=1737579026\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Every mission features a familiar level, but with countless different layouts, puzzles, enemies, and secrets to uncover.
