{"about_the_game":"Infinite Incantation is a charming papercraft-style bullet heaven action roguelike that will test your spell-slinging skills as you tear through waves of enemies. To survive against the horde, you'll have the chance to roll the dice to procedurally mutate your spells into powerful evolutions, allowing you to take on even tougher challenges. Customize your character with RPG-like upgrades and stack your deck with the spells you'll randomly draw in runs. With fast-paced action, challenging bosses, and endless spell-crafting possibilities, Infinite Incantation is a must-play for fans of spell-casting, screen-filling, and goblin slaying action.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2286260/extras/Evolve_and_Mutate_Spells.png?t=1728558902\" /><br>Cast Shape Archetype + Element + Effect = <i>Infinite Incantations</i><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2286260/extras/Stryx_Action_Optimized.gif?t=1728558902\" /><br><br>Infinite Incantation uses a robust component spell system that can combine elements, casting styles, and special effects in a variety of different ways.
