{"about_the_game":"This game is a psychological horror in which the main character wakes up in an unfamiliar house and must pass all the levels by solving puzzles. Puzzles are miniature tests of finding objects and comparing facts to solve the main problem - opening the door leading to the next level, deeper into the ground and the depths of the character's consciousness. At the same time, the player will be frightened by frightening sounds and an oppressive atmosphere.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1726550/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1721228169","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1726550/page.bg.jpg?t=1721228169","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1726550/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1721228169","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1726550/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1721228169","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Interesting Facts</h1><p><strong>1.</strong> Our development team consists of a programmer, a game designer, a modeller and a composer, and the age of all team members together is <u>72 years </u>.<br><strong>2.</strong> Initially, this game was developed within the framework of <u>Ludum Dare 48</u>.<br>[[b]3.[/b] The name of the studio DEGRADE OTRYAD Studio comes from the <u> of the same name discord server CRYSTAL DIGITAL OTRYAD Server</u>.<br><strong>4.</strong> This is our first game that we <u> release on Steam</u>.</p><br><h1>Our Discord Server</h1><p>If you want to chat with the developers of the game or just have a good time, you can join our Discord Server: <i> </i></p><br><h1>For Media</h1><p>If you have a suggestion for our studio and you would like to contact us, then write to the email: <i>vadim@cr1stl.ru</i></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>This game is a psychological horror in which the main character wakes up in an unfamiliar house and must pass all the levels by solving puzzles.
