{"about_the_game":"Have you ever dreamt of commanding an 3000 ton vessel and navigate it in high seas? Then test and improve your skills with the fun but somewhat realistic version of our professional ship simulator. Use  your 4x2 kW main engines and the bow and aft side thrusters to take your anchor handling and tug supply vessel (AHTS) out to the oil rig and hold it steady for 10 seconds, so your crew can rail in the anchor. But beware of the UFO and its tractor beam. If there is a fire, put it out before.. Adjustable weather conditions and two water guns that help against attacking aliens (laser weapons are for the weak!) make it an exciting experience with realistic controls. But beware, Captain, AHTS vessels are expensive, so try not to collide and sink it. <br><strong>Controls:</strong> With the controllers  you set he main engines throttle and  turn the wheel to get to the oil rig. Give the aft and bow thrusters a push to turn the bow or aft of the ship in the respective direction for fine navigation. use the controller's side button to switch to water gun mode. It helps against fires and UFO's.. <br><strong>The goal:</strong> Steer the ship to the oil rig, avoid traffic, put out any fires using the water guns and  keep the ship within the marked area for 10 seconds.Good luck, Sailor.<br><strong>hotkeys:</strong> push numbers 1(calm)-5(heavy storm) to change the weather, 'S' to start from the menu and 'R to restart the simulation.<br><strong>WARNING: </strong>The AHTS Simulator is not for the faint and sea-sick.. In stormy weather conditions things may get uncomfortable...","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/670910/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1501226952","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/670910/page.bg.jpg?t=1501226952","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/670910/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1501226952","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/670910/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1501226952","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Have you ever dreamt of commanding an 3000 ton vessel and navigate it in high seas?
