Turkish expanding Sea Exploration Activities with Piri Reis and Sismik 1 ships\u00a0created a provoked tension between the two countries. Greek plans also to nationalize the consortium of companies that was drilling oil off Thasos island and a planned drilling activity 11 miles east of the island, was recognized as illegal and provocative by the Turkish Government. The crisis escalated quickly and military forces of both countries were set on the highest alert level while Political and Military leaders of both countries threatened to use armed force if obstructed by the other.\u00a0<br><br><br>The crisis was ended when international pressure was\u00a0increased (mainly from other NATO allied countries)\u00a0and Britain's\u00a0Lord Carrington, the Secretary General of NATO, urged Greece and Turkey to avoid the use of force and offered to act as a mediator.<br>\u00a0<br>Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayip Erdgogan recently unveiled his plans for a wider role of Turkey in the Region and the expansion of the country's sphere of influence even outside its physical borders.\u00a0<br>September 2, 2019 Turkish Prime Minister makes clear his intentions as he presents his Mavi Vatan (Blue Motherland) plan. Based on this claim, Turkey does not recognize officially\u00a0Exclusive Economic Zone rights to any Greek island close to Continental Turkey, thus claiming that half the Aegean Sea and very large areas even over Libya are part of its own Exclusive Economic Zone. The newly elected Greek government issues a protest.\u00a0<br><br>December 5, 2019: The Turkey-Libya EEZ\u00a0Agreement is announced and days after, Turkey submits it officially in the UN.<br>Greece reacts by declaring it as invalid.

In fact, key members of the Turkish Government make no secret that their aim is to blackmail EU for financial aid and destabilise the Greek Government. This escalates into a show of will as Greece declares its firm position not to allow any trespassers and mobilises Border Guards, Police, and Army while receiving token reinforcements from Poland, Austria and Italy. \u00a0<br><br><br>March 20, 2020: Greece has managed to protect what considers to be European borders by having successfully blocked any trespassing attempts that were supported by Turkish police.
