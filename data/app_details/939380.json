{"about_the_game":"Are you looking for a fun game that will make you crave more? Would you like a game filled with humor, fun and some frustration? Then you have come to the right place!<br>Fruit Punch is a fantastic game where you have a choice to play between different fun fruits! your mission is to get as high as possible in the game but beware! It is not going to be easy! <br>First of all, you will have to avoid the holes in the map that will make you fall to your death.  Second, the small space you have left is infected with insects that will spoil your fruit if you touch them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">You too, have an advantage.</h2>As you have a variety of fruits to choose between, they each have an ability to fight the hostile environment but what will you choose? Will you be attacking, defending or will you choose to directly ignore the problem by flying over it? Whatever you choose, the ability is limited! With 3 charges and a cooldown on your ability, you must be wary of when you use it. Nobody wants to be in need of it when not at their disposal.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Regret your choice of fruit?</h2>No problem, you will at times be given the opportunity to switch fruit in-game. Should you choose to switch to the other fruit that has spawned on map, you will NOT get the chance to switch back so choose wisely!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Checkpoints</h2>As you play the game, you have 3 lives. When you fall down a hole or get spoiled by an insect, you loose a life. When that happens, you will respawn at the most recent checkpoint that you have activated. How do you activate it? Simple. All checkpoint has a cost to activate, this cost is a number of your ability charges. For example one checkpoint can cost 2 charges but another can cost 3. When you spend charges on a checkpoint they will, of cause recharge with the given cooldown.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Out of lives, then what?</h2>You loose the game. When all life is lost you will have to start a new game and catch up to your highscore from the game before.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/939380/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1551378958","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/939380/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1551378958","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/939380/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1551378958","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/939380/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1551378958","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Are you looking for a fun game that will make you crave more?
