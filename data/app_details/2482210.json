You collect resources, build up your town and your army, research new technologies and protect it all from monsters that come from the sea and from cultists that try to destroy your town from within. You have various resources to manage - both classical ones like iron, wood, money and population and more unique ones like ammunition and madness. The latter one is a concept from lovecraftian horror worlds - the higher madness your population has the more powerful the cultists become, your people get crazy and kill each other more often, etc.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Come back stronger</strong></h2></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Eldritch Town is a roguelite game. Every run has multiple objectives you have to complete to win, but if you can't finish those quests and your city gets destroyed, you don't lose everything.
