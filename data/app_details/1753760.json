{"about_the_game":"Picture a mash-up of Super Meat Boy and Lunar Lander. Or N+ meets Asteroids. That\u2019s Impulse.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe premise is simple. You need to guide your craft to the exit point of each level, avoiding the various obstacles and bad guys.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLevels are short, sometimes brutal affairs. There are no life limits, retry as many times as you need. Restarting a level is instant. There\u2019s no waiting or loading \u2014 one moment you\u2019re dead, a click of the mouse later and you\u2019re ready to try again. You can even suicide so you don\u2019t have to wait for death when you know you\u2019ve fouled up.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour craft is at the whim of Newtonian physics. With only a simple thruster you need to battle the forces of gravity and atmospheric drag all while avoiding high-speed impact. The trouble is that all these variables are liable to change with each level. Gravity could be strong, or weak, or zero; it may pull in any direction. Drag might mirror the vacuum of space or the ocean depths. Your craft\u2019s thrusters might be strong or weak. You might have limited or limitless fuel. Your hull might laugh off high-speed impacts or it might shatter from the slightest bump.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith all these variables, levels take on very different feels. Some require careful thinking and gentle, deliberate action. Others are all about reflexes and reaction. Most are a mixture of both.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1753760/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1633084675","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1753760/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1633084675","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1753760/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1633084675","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1753760/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1633084675","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Picture a mash-up of Super Meat Boy and Lunar Lander.
