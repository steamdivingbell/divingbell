Defend my money, of course</strong>.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">            <strong>Weapons</strong> To have an army, you have to have weapons, and to have weapons, you have to have mines,so you have to invest in/buy all kinds of mines, all kinds of arsenals;</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2772160/extras/\u77ff\u573a\u53ca\u5175\u5de5\u5382\u5efa\u7b51.png?t=1737085366\" />        <strong>Conscription</strong>.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">            With weapons, you can conscript based on the number of inhabitants in the territory, and with a supply of soldiers and weapons, it's time to build an army!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2772160/extras/\u5f81\u51752.png?t=1737085366\" />                Infantry: basic soldiers, high evasion, better in the early stages;</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2772160/extras/\u6b65\u5175\u90e8\u961f.png?t=1737085366\" />                Scout: you can probe the distribution of soldiers and strength within the enemy's territory, laying the foundation for battle strategy;</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2772160/extras/\u4fa6\u67e5\u90e8\u961f.png?t=1737085366\" />                Artillerymen: pretty big attack power and attack range, but low life;</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2772160/extras/\u706b\u70ae\u90e8\u961f.png?t=1737085366\" />                Tank Troopers: very high life, but slow moving;</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2772160/extras/\u5766\u514b\u90e8\u961f.png?t=1737085366\" />                Air Defense: the nemesis of bombers;</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2772160/extras/\u9632\u7a7a\u90e8\u961f.png?t=1737085366\" />                Bomber Trooper: the only air unit that can't do anything except for air defenses that can hit him;</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2772160/extras/\u8f70\u70b8\u90e8\u961f.png?t=1737085366\" />                Airborne: go straight to your designated battlefield location (not attacked until you arrive) and then target kill operations;</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2772160/extras/\u7a7a\u964d\u90e8\u961f.png?t=1737085366\" />                Special Forces: specializes in fixed buildings and ignores bomber attacks, and more importantly, is the strongest defending unit, bar none;</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2772160/extras/\u7279\u6218\u90e8\u961f.png?t=1737085366\" />        <strong>Expanding the territory</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">            When you have an army, you have to conquer all directions;</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">            Depending on the type and strength of the army you have, go and conquer every enemy and make them part of the dustbin of history;</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2772160/extras/en6.gif?t=1737085366\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What are the strategies of the game</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">        <strong>Resource allocation and acquisition</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">            Each region has only one sub-category of resources within a larger category (e.g., the region contains only 1 of 6 minerals);</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">            So you want to build guns, is there a gun arsenal in your territory? Do you have the material [iron ore] to build guns? Do you have enough inhabitants? If not, it's a choice between conquering other regions to fulfill the conditions or going to the exchange and buying them with money;</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">        <strong>Acquisition of money</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">            We can get it by doing business, but what if we still don't have enough money? Open a bank? What about the lack of banking resources within my land.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">            Should I sell my household goods to gather money, or should I break down and expand and loot and gamble?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">        <strong>Distribution of Money</strong>.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">            Investing in mines, commerce, and arsenals requires money, upgrading these buildings also requires money, opening a bank requires money, engaging an intelligence agency requires money, conscription tends to make the inhabitants riot, pacifying the inhabitants also requires money, how to allocate money is also a challenge;</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">        <strong>Expansion options</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">            In the process of expanding our territory, we are faced with the choice of who to attack and how to attack.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">            Who we attack, whether to hit the strongest first (to prevent the other side from growing too fast and not being able to beat them in the later stages), or to pinch the soft ones first (to expand the territory and play steadily), this needs to be thought about;</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">            We can attack by force, we can also use other means, which means to maximize the benefits, this is a difficult problem;</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">        <strong>Strategies for combat</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">            What kind of soldiers we have, what kind of soldiers the other side has, what is the distribution of the other side's army, can I use the least amount of troops for the greatest victory, and eventually take out all the clans to win the game, this requires wisdom;</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">        <strong>Selection of World Events and Intelligence Events</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">            There will be a large number of events within the world and in the intelligence agencies, these events will be good and bad, some of them will be beneficial if done but will also have side effects, so when unexpected events happen, choices will become important.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img
