However, we also have a passion for privacy and data protection, and if you are reading this, then hopefully, you do too! <br>We put together this privacy policy to explain who we are, how we collect, share and use personal information about you, and how you can exercise your privacy rights. This privacy policy only applies to personal information that we collect when you play Weird West. <br>If you have any questions or concerns about our use of your personal information, then please contact us using the contact details provided at the bottom of this privacy policy.<br><br>Please note that data collection is only optional and opt-in based and can be turned off entirely before any data is collected the very first time the game is launched.<br><br><strong>Who is WolfEye?</strong><br>We are a game studio. You know that game Weird West? We made it (and we are very proud of it!). We are headquartered in Austin, Texas, but we have staff who work from various locations around the world. <br>For more information about us and what we do, please see the \"About\" section on our website here . <br><br><strong>What personal information do we collect and why?</strong><br><br><i>Information that we collect automatically</i><br>When you play Weird West we may collect certain information automatically during your play sessions. More specifically, the information we collect automatically may include information like your location, IP Address, key actions and choices you perform in the game. We use this information to analyse game performance and to understand how players interact with the game so that we can improve it. For example, by analysing this information we might see that most players struggle to get past a certain area of the game so we might then adjust the difficulty of the map or level to fix this \"bottleneck\". <br>Additionally, as Weird West may contain community events, when you first launch the game we may create a player ID associated with your copy of a game. These IDs help us identify player contributions to community events. For example, if we set a global community challenge for players to complete in-game events the player ID helps us make sure your contributions to the event are not counted more than once (otherwise that would be cheating!). <br>In some countries, including countries in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, this information may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws. <br>In general, we will use the personal information we collect from you only for the purposes described in this privacy policy. However, we may also use your personal information for other purposes that are not incompatible with the purposes we have disclosed to you (such as statistical purposes) if and where this is permitted by applicable data protection laws.<br><br><i>Who do we share your personal information with?</i><br>We may disclose your personal information to the following categories of recipients:<br>to our <strong>game publisher</strong> to discuss potential gameplay issues players are facing or overall behavioral trends based on how players play the game;<br>to our <strong>group companies and third party services providers</strong> who provide services to us (for example, our data warehouse partner provides the infrastructure to store the personal information described in this privacy policy so the personal information will be disclosed to them for it to be stored on their infrastructure); <br>to any <strong>competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party</strong> where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person;<br>to an <strong>actual or potential buyer</strong> (and its agents and advisers) in connection with any actual or proposed purchase, merger or acquisition of any part of our business (but we will we tell the buyer they should use your personal information only for the purposes disclosed in this privacy policy if this happens);<br>to any <strong>other person with your consent</strong> to the disclosure.<br><br><strong>Legal basis for processing personal information</strong><br>In some countries, such as the United Kingdom and countries in the European Economic Area, we need to have a legal basis for processing your personal information. <br>We will normally process personal information from you only where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms or where we have your consent to do so.  In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you, to perform a contract with you or to protect your vital interests or those of another person. <br>Where we process personal information in our legitimate interests our interests are to improve and optimise the game so that you have a better experience when you play it. If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).  <br><br><strong>How do we keep your personal information secure?</strong><br>We use appropriate and industry standard technical and organisational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.  <br><br><strong>International data transfers</strong><br>Whilst we are headquartered in Austin, Texas, we do have staff and third party suppliers who support our games located around the world. Therefore, your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country. <br><br><strong>Data retention</strong><br>We retain the personal information described in this privacy policy for up to 3 years. However, we may retain this personal information for longer where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, we will continue to retain your player ID whilst you continue to play our game so that we can keep running community events) or where required to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements.  <br>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. <br><br><strong>Your data protection rights</strong><br>If you are located in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom you have the following data protection rights:<br>If you wish to <strong>access, correct, update or request deletion</strong> of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the \u201cHow to contact us\u201d heading below.  <br>In addition, you can <strong>object to processing</strong> of your personal information, ask us to <strong>restrict processing</strong> of your personal information or <strong>request portability</strong> of your personal information (in certain circumstances). Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the \u201cHow to contact us\u201d heading below.<br>If we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can <strong>withdraw your consent</strong> at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.<br>You have the <strong>right to complain to a data protection authority</strong> about our processing of your personal information.  For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. Contact details for data protection authorities in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom are available here. <br>You may have similar or other data protection rights if you are located in a different country which also grants you certain rights in relation to your personal information. <br>We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.<br><br><strong>Updates to this privacy policy</strong><br>We may update this privacy policy from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business developments. When we update our privacy policy, we will take appropriate measures to inform you, consistent with the significance of the changes we make.  <br>You can see when this privacy policy was last updated by checking the \u201clast updated\u201d date displayed at the top of this privacy policy.  <br><br><strong>How to contact us</strong><br>If you have any questions or concerns about our use of your personal information, please contact us using the following details: <a href=\"mailto:contact@wolfeye-studios.com\">contact@wolfeye-studios.com</a>  <br>The data controller of your personal information is Wolf Eye Studios, Inc whose address is at 6700 W Courtyard Drive Austin TX 78730 USA.  <br><br>Copyright 2021 Wolfeye.
