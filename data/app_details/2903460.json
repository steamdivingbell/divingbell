You are not a hero or warrior, but an ordinary person and a trash. In this world full of zombies and chaos, you must survive through methods such as scavenging, building, interacting with NPCs, and fighting rebels. Around the dungeon, you will be living in a quarantine zone with other survivors, and you must pass strict observation tests in order to be allowed to enter a safe dungeon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to storing survival supplies and fighting bandits and rebels, you also need to deal with other NPCs, choose appropriate strategies, and unravel the plot and side lines. You are not only pursuing survival, but also seeking a glimmer of hope in this world full of danger and uncertainty, and doing your best to protect yourself and the people around you. As always, the game has multiple branches and endings, and every choice you make will determine your fate and that of others!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe survival wisdom of the garbage man and the homeless will become your most precious wealth. By flipping through garbage, opening treasure chests, catching mice, and other means, you will continuously explore this world and strive to find ways to survive.
