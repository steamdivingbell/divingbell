{"about_the_game":"<i>Please Note: The game is still being developed, and there may be some inconsistencies in the screenshots/videos due to them being from older builds.

In a last-ditch effort to learn the magic, our inept hero must travel <i>into</i> the magical scrolls and seek the knowledge in a... more hands-on fashion. You take control of Ian as he navigates the magical scrolls. Each spell is made up of a series of runes, and you must find them all before you can progress to the next spell. It's not just a matter of looking, however. Magic can be dangerous, and those dangers are manifest down here in the scrolls.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2326910/extras/features.png?t=1679509199\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 24 spells to find, each with a different maze to navigate and different puzzles to unravel<br></li><li> An original chiptune soundtrack<br></li><li> Collectables provide a little extra challenge for those who want it<br></li><li> Controller support<br></li><li> 2.5D art style; control 2D sprites in a 3D world<br></li><li> Steam achievements</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2326910/extras/gameplay.png?t=1679509199\" /><br><br>All game entities--including the player--are confined to a grid-based movement system, with wrinkles in the scroll parchment being impassible to all.
