{"about_the_game":"Bet Your Brain is a trivia game with the twist of gambling your earnings throughout the game. Players alternate between answering questions and participating in gambling minigames attempting to accumulate the most wealth before the end of the game. Compete against bots or your friends in an attempt to call yourself the King of both knowledge and luck.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Trivia Rounds</h2>During Trivia rounds, players attempt to guess the correct answer from 4 possible choices. At the start of a Trivia round, 3 categories will be shown scaling from a broad category to a very specific category with pauses between each displayed category. During these pauses, players will be able to bet points with different multipliers based on the current category. After the last category is displayed and all players have placed their bets, a question with four options will be shown to all players; players will have a set amount of time to answer the question by selecting one of the four options. After time is up or all players have answered, the correct answer will be displayed, points will be added to players who answered correctly based on their bets, and points will deducted from players who answered incorrectly based on their bets.<br><br>Trivia Round Example<br>The First Category is displayed (Entertainment). Player 1 decides to bet 500 points during this time, locking in a 3x multiplier if they answer the upcoming question correctly. The Second Category is then displayed (Movies) and Player 2 decides to bet 600 points during this time, locking in a 2x multiplier if they answer the upcoming question correctly. The Final Category is then displayed (American Psycho) and Player 3 decides to bet 800 points during this time with no multiplier locked in due to locking in during the final category. The question and options are then displayed with each player selecting a different option. The answer is revealed with only Player 2 selecting the correct answer. Player 2 is awarded 1200 points (600 point bet with a 2x multiplier), Player 3 is deducted 800 points, and Player 1 is deducted 500 points. The round is then complete.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gambling Rounds</h2>Gambling Rounds are luck-based minigames that allow players a chance to come back or increase their lead even more. Gambling rounds involve players being shown a minigame with starter information. Players then select options and an amount to bet before the minigame starts. After the minigame ends, players who chose the winning option are awarded the amount of points they bet and players who didn't choose the winning option are deducted the points they bet.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Painting Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2826250/3dc67710075d5a8236a97aea7189c0516370856b.jpg"},{"name":"Tabletop Game Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2826250/fc9fff6ea9b4d3c8e224deb4624f1ba58d9e77f2.jpg"},{"name":"Music Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2826250/36a4f8e326d61c013fef7f7343e38060558ee592.jpg"},{"name":"TV Show Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2826250/fa8ce20dbb5307136516befec219b68c96cb33d9.jpg"},{"name":"Architecture Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2826250/4b0dbef855444b2a6c600adb3ca7fc74cb68bdb9.jpg"},{"name":"Sculpture Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2826250/efc6b9ad10cf0bad66fbb5a2ac86df769ac9e708.jpg"},{"name":"Movie Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2826250/5dec309d86466a69490049ee488d65cf0a63483a.jpg"},{"name":"Video Game Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2826250/8cdd3337c2542106f1b33e2da009286e4cd607ae.jpg"},{"name":"Baseball Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2826250/dbe792447e5d4537a690a0dfef84a182df963236.jpg"},{"name":"Basketball Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2826250/4ca6c99eaf9b1a8c838f271cc3e4eabcfde390fa.jpg"}],"total":30},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2826250/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1713555095","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2826250/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1713555095","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2826250/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1713555095","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2826250/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1713555095","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Bet Your Brain is a trivia game with the twist of gambling your earnings throughout the game.
