{"about_the_game":"Prepare to master the power of the cursor in this skill-based puzzle. Move the tiles in the smoothest way possible to put the tiles in position. Improve your record time and analyze your solve in Classic Mode. Discover and practice the drills to become a master in Campaign mode.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Smooth Movement</h2><br>Move freely with the help of the cursor. With the cursor you control the \u201cremoved tile\u201d (which would be the 16th tile),  when you move the cursor above a tile, it will move to the free space. This unlocks new possibilities in speed and higher level thinking. No repeated clicking and no jankiness whatsoever.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3224250/extras/Movement_GIF.gif?t=1738224729\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Classic Mode</h2><br>In this mode, you play the classic 15-puzzle, putting each tile in position from 1 to 15. Solve puzzles endlessly in an appealing atmosphere. Play to optimize and reduce your record time or hide the UI and enjoy the view with no stress.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3224250/extras/Classic_Mode_GIF.gif?t=1738224729\" /><br><br>In Classic Mode, you can analyze your solve by pressing \u2018P\u2019 at any moment. This will bring you back to your furthest checkpoint, and you can find other alternatives to your solution. While in a checkpoint you have the time saved at the checkpoint and a \u201cmoves\u201d counter appears. You can move freely through the pre-established checkpoints and a custom you can set by clicking \u201cC\u201d at any moment (in play mode or checkpoint mode). It\u2019s important to mention that these solves cannot become records to avoid any kind of unfairness.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3224250/extras/Checkpoint_GIF.gif?t=1738224729\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Campaign Mode</h2><br>In Campaign mode, you take the journey to become a master. Complete the levels with increasing difficulty to get the recognition you deserve. To complete a level, you have to solve a specific amount of arrangements, with limited or unlimited moves or time. When you complete a set of levels, you complete a chapter and a new board. Learn fundamental concepts from the beginning, such as Single Tile Movement and the Solution Method, to complex concepts such as Insert Variations, Complex Movement, and the optimization of \u201cthe last 9\u201d.
