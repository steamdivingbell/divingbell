Criminal activity is often described as a threat to your city that you need to deal with as the lord. There are no overtly sexual events in the game, besides some sexual innuendo. There are no instances of profanity in the game, besides one instance where the swear word is censored both in the voice-over and in the written text. In this instance, it isn't even clear what the censored word is meant to be."},"detailed_description":"Who will you be?
