{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The E-flite Extra 330 SC 3D 1.3m offers nearly unlimited aerobatic and 3D performance potential \u2013 even beyond that of the full-scale design! It's a replica of the airplane that Jim Bourke flies in airshows and competitions around the world, including his unique and highly visible trim scheme. It's also an updated and upgraded version of the Extra 300 3D 1.3m that features a larger hatch and opening with plastic edges to eliminate paint chipping when more easily installing/removing 3S or 4S 2200mAh to 3200mAh batteries. The strengthened motor mount better secures the brushless outrunner motor that's equipped with a lightweight wooden propeller to deliver outstanding thrust and vertical performance, along with extremely crisp throttle response thanks to the upgraded 85-amp Spektrum Avian Smart Lite ESC. Its fully molded EPO airframe is composite reinforced for an outstanding blend of rigidity and durability while also being as lightweight as possible. And the wire landing gear has been replaced with much stronger aluminum gear to make it even more durable! Plus, fast and precise factory-installed digital, metal-geared servos with ball-link equipped linkages drive the oversized control surfaces to deliver incredible 3D and precision flight capabilities. So whether you fly it mild to hone your sport or precision aerobatic flying skills or fly it wild to learn or perform the most aggressive 3D maneuvers, the Extra 330 SC 3D 1.3m will offer unexpected levels of capability and performance you'll enjoy flight after flight.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This model is equipped with Horizon Hobby and Spektrum exclusive AS3X (Artificial Stabilization \u2013 3-aXis) and optional-use SAFE (Sensor Assisted Flight Envelope) Select technologies, and when SAFE Select is turned on using the mode switch (B on the Spektrum InterLink DX controller) it offers:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Pitch and Bank Angle Limits</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">These envelope limits keep the airplane from rolling or pitching upside down.\u00a0 They also prevent excessive climb or dive angles.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Automatic Self-Leveling</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The airplane instantly returns to and holds level flight when the sticks are released and in the center position.\u00a0 It\u2019s also helpful for keeping the wings level during takeoffs and landings.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759450/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734547674","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759450/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1734547674","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759450/d51a9688f0ccdd6b19cede6e52a6bd98b1d3a929/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734547674","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759450/d51a9688f0ccdd6b19cede6e52a6bd98b1d3a929/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734547674","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The E-flite Extra 330 SC 3D 1.3m offers nearly unlimited aerobatic and 3D performance potential \u2013 even beyond that of the full-scale design!
