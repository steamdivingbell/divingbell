{"about_the_game":"&quot; <br>  <br> <strong> </strong>  <h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Dungeon Crawl Classics #72: Beyond the Black Gate</h2>  <strong> A Level 5 Adventure for DCC RPG</strong> <br>  <br>  This printing features a dynamic new cover by Ken Kelly! <br>  Summoned by a coven of foul witches, the adventurers are bid through the Black Gate and across the multiverse, in pursuit of the crown of the fallen Horned King. There, in the icebound gloom of Thrice-Tenth Kingdom, they must pit their wits and brawn against his dread servants. His sullen citadel looms above the darksome woods and elfin ice caves, ruling over the mystic kingdom. Do you dare to ascend the throne of bones and declare yourself master of the Wild Hunt? Whatever your answer, the land beyond the Black Gate is sure to present a grim challenge for the even the hardiest of adventurers! <br> <strong> Crash of the Sky People:</strong> <br>  BONUS ADVENTURE! The infamous winged sky-pirates from the planet Tahlmohl have crashed! Their ship was blasted in two by a defending craft, and the &quot;bow&quot; half has fallen near the PCs. The pilots died, but not before activating a distress beacon that extends a green column of light into the sky. Some of the ship's robots and constructs survived the crash, and they wait to be rescued by those Tahlmohlians that will surely answer the beacon's call. In the meantime, who knows what alien riches sit in the wreckage, waiting to be plundered?
