It is the void. It surrounds you. It crushes you as though it were the deepest darkest ocean. You feel as though you are falling from a dream. A dream with no end in sight.<br><br>It is with my sincerest regret to inform you that you are dead. Murdered in fact. Your life was taken in this most unnatural way and so your soul will wander the void as nothing more than a lost and broken memory. Somewhere beyond this unfathomable expanse is the fractured soul of your beloved who has suffered equally so. Two parts of one soul set adrift in this impossible abyss and left to wait for the malevolent grip to loosen.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2717620/extras/DescImage_Anim_King.gif?t=1728663030\" /><br><br>When that time comes, your souls will not pass on, but instead fall from this place to somewhere in between. A world of the damned where those who stray are lost. Where dwell violent and wicked spirits that have long been abandoned and those who wish to see you join them.<br><br>Only by reuniting with your true love may your souls become whole and ascend from that purgatory. Do you hear it? It beckons. Damnation awaits you.

In this dark place between death and the afterlife you will explore broken and haunting locations and encounter the bloodless vestiges of those once living which dwell there. Just as our brave knight wonders in search for the missing half of his fractured soul, so do the grim inhabitants of this world bid with their fleeting mortal spirit. While some pass peacefully through this plane, there are those who linger, praying on the souls of others so as not to themselves fade into oblivion. Unarmed, our brave knight may only succeed by what strength he has to defend himself and through sheer force of will.<br><br>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2717620/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728663030","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2717620/page.bg.jpg?t=1728663030","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2717620/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728663030","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2717620/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728663030","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"Please be aware that this game contains macabre imagery such as bones, skulls, skeletons, and corpses and features cutscenes portraying murder and depictions of nudity."},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":2767580,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2717620/extras/DescImage_Anim_Messanger.gif?t=1728663030\" /><br><br>Do you feel that?
