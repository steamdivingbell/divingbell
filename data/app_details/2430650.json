The two ships that sank near Cape Verde did not go down by accident\u2014and the perpetrator must have been among the survivors who were rounded up for interrogation. Three walked the plank, found guilty of conspiracy, but it didn\u2019t stop another ship from sinking that same night.

With naught but his service rifle, revolver, and a penchant for gunpowder\u2019s destruction, he had decimated the fleet. Such a heinous crime demanded he be made an example of and humiliated, lest other would-be rebels take inspiration. On trial, the man proclaimed himself to be Francis Fawkes, heir to Guy Fawkes and dedicated to his ancestor\u2019s mission. <br><br>He was sentenced to burning at the stake. On November 5th, The Conspirator was paraded in the streets and burned atop a historic bonfire: bound, masked, and dressed as an effigy to be mocked by what remained of the Navy. The flames of consequence melted his skin and welded the mask to his visage. In total agony, childhood memories flooded his mind in a fever dream: a sickly father\u2019s pained groans, a vagrant mother\u2019s bitter tears, and a frail grandmother\u2019s lullaby\u2014wondering about life if history had been different. Spiteful, The Conspirator lived long enough for the fire to burn through his restraints. Survivors of his wrath say he descended with eerie, royal poise. Spectators fled and homes burned as The Conspirator searched for water. To this day, those streets remain rubble and ash. <br><br>Pleased with his work, and with intentions to someday finish the Gunpowder Plot\u2019s mission, The Conspirator fled. Hearing of good money and good use for his spite-fueled talents, he made his way to the bayou, continuing a lifelong crusade.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2430650/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1723708634","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2430650/page.bg.jpg?t=1723708634","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2430650/5ff4b798cf79ee5cd0711df87e9352ef50e88471/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1723708634","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2430650/5ff4b798cf79ee5cd0711df87e9352ef50e88471/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1723708634","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Remote Play on Tablet","id":42},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"This DLC contains one Hunter, two Weapons, and one Consumable:<br><br>- The Conspirator (Hunter)<br>- Crown Cinders (Martini-Henry)<br>- Royal Sabotage (Scottfield)<br>- Forefather's Fury (Vitality Shot)<br><br><br><strong><u>The Conspirator</u></strong><br><br>The flames of November 5th taught the self-proclaimed heir of the Gunpowder Plot not to speak out against unjust rule, but the fires of war taught him silence was untenable.
