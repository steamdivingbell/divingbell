{"about_the_game":"<i>Immortal Defense</i> has been widely praised for the game's storytelling and unique twist on the tower defense genre, many consider it a cult classic of the subgenre. Its story was written by novelist Jeanne Thornton, and its universe is based on the novel <i>Raberata</i> by Robert Bisno. This new Steam release features many improvements over the original release: Steam achievements which grant gameplay bonuses, leaderboards, improved graphics and performance, widescreen support, an improved level editor, and much more.<br><br><strong>WARNING: This game involves a lot of flashing lights and visual effects.
