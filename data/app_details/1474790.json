In Multiplayer Modes, this gives Players multiple ways of competing against or with each other as well as diverse forms of achievements and challenges, in Single Player modes this will either serve as creative challenges for the Story Dungeon or interesting obstacles or tasks for each consecutive round in other Single Player modes.<br><br><u>Weapons:</u><br>With 5 weapons to choose from there is never a dull moment in a round of Booom-Slang! Whether it's the Plasma Rifle for pinpoint accuracy and those deadly kill-shots, the Plasma Shotgun for those spots that just a little bit too crowded, the Plasma RPG when you like to 'live dangerously', the Plasma Sword to get up close and personal or the Plasma Grenade when you just feel like leaving someone a present ;)<br><br><u>Power-Ups:</u><br>Hunt Creeps for Points, Collect Treasure, Trade in Resources for Power-Ups, what could be more natural! Protect your vulnerable bag of skin from things like Lava Pits and Rabid Wolf Bites with the Plasma Shield. Burn your enemies (or yourself, lol) with a conjurable Pit of Fire! Hop over those pesky high arena walls and barriers with the Rocket Jump or bring down judgement with a FRICKEN LIGHTNING STRIKE!!! Yeah!!!<br><br><u>Abilities:</u><br>Where would one be without Abilities? Truly one of the Universe's most important questions. That's why we gave ya a Teleporter, cause gee golly whizz it sure is neat watching your character zipping and zooming across the screen, ain't it? Then of course, we just had to strap a ridiculous Super Vacuum to your suit so you can bring those juicy boxes a bit closer a bit quicker and yank away the loot right under your opponents' noses.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1474790/extras/OPBS_1V1.gif?t=1708305647\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><u>Premise:</u></strong></h2><br>In Booom-Slang! you take on the role of one many clones that is kept prisoner by a deranged mad man running a sadistic live death game.
