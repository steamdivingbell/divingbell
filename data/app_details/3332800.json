I am 27 years old, known as Mimen in the wuxia world. I am currently working to support myself while learning Unreal Engine to make games. My ultimate goal is to create a pixelated wuxia ARPG game by myself. However, due to my limited energy, sometimes I don't even want to write after work, so I only wrote a script of about 26800 words in just over six months. With this progress, I am afraid that my wuxia game may not be completed in 20 years. After thinking about it, I have to come up with this bottom line and make this small game first to prepare for full-time development of independent games in the future. Therefore, I need your help.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If I am fortunate enough to resign, I will complete the writing of the game script within 2 years, organize the character network, write biographies of important characters, etc., so that I can directly view them when I reach a corresponding level of favorability with specific characters in the game. At the same time, I will complete the English translation of the game script; After completing the script, I will design the art of characters, scenes, props, skills, special effects, UI, etc. based on the plot, and simultaneously arrange and produce the game music. The arrangement will use an older instrument, which may take 4 years to complete; The final stage will integrate the code written in the previous years to ensure stable operation of the game, while optimizing game performance. If everything goes smoothly, the game should be launched within another year; The final game will mainly feature a long storyline, character development, and boss strategy. These are all my plans for the wuxia game.
