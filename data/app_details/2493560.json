{"about_the_game":"<strong><u>Rated higher in steam than HellDivers 2!</u></strong><br><br><strong>Ethically free Idle game! (No Ads/Micro Transactions or options to buy anything)</strong><br><br>In the once-prosperous kingdom, a land shrouded in mystic enchantments and ancient prophecies, a dire threat looms. The malevolent Mordek, a dark sorcerer of unparalleled power, has unleashed his horde of abominations upon the land, plunging it into chaos and despair.<br><br>As the darkness encroaches, a glimmer of hope emerges from the towering spires of the royal castle. It is here, amidst the swirling mists of uncertainty, that brave adventurers gather, their hearts ablaze with the fire of determination. They stand ready to embark on a perilous quest that will lead them from the fortress's battlements deep into the heart of the enchanted forest, where Mordek's sinister lair lies hidden within the depths of a cavern veiled in shadows.<br><br>Yet, this is not merely a battle of steel and magic, but a test of courage and resilience. For in this mystical realm, the laws of nature bend to the will of those who dare to challenge fate. It is a realm where heroes craft their own destiny, forging mighty weapons and armor, and honing their skills to perfection through tireless dedication.<br><br>In the crucible of adventure, every action taken echoes through the fabric of reality, shaping the very course of destiny. Will you charge headlong into the fray, confronting the minions of darkness with unwavering resolve? Or will you harness the power of patience and strategy, allowing your strength to grow with each passing moment, until you stand as a beacon of hope amidst the encroaching shadows?<br><br>So gather your courage, brave adventurer, and let your legend be written in the annals of history. For the fate of the Kingdom hangs in the balance, and only by vanquishing Mordek and rebuilding the kingdom can true peace be restored to this mystical land.<br><br>Ascending is not merely a journey of progression; it is a leap into the unknown, where the very essence of existence bends to the will of the chosen few. Through the veils of time and space, adventurers ascend to new heights of power, gaining access to mystical multipliers that amplify their prowess in ways unfathomable to the uninitiated.<br><br>With each ascent, the boundaries of possibility are stretched ever further, as heroes harness the boundless energies of the cosmos to fuel their endeavors. Multipliers cascade like streams of stardust, imbuing every action with the potential for greatness, allowing resources to flow like rivers of liquid gold.<br><br>And in this mystical realm, where honor and valor reign supreme, there are no shortcuts to greatness. There are no hidden costs, no treacherous schemes, no super premium currencies to cloud the purity of the hero's journey. Only through courage, perseverance, and the indomitable spirit of adventure can heroes rise to claim their rightful place among the legends of the Kingdom.<br><br>Button Assest created  by: upklyak on Freepik<br>Music: - Pixabay -  subject to and licensed under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license (&quot;CC0 Content&quot;)","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Sword1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2493560/d17e90bca77a108ad6f6c5b77a65f2325c3e0bf6.jpg"},{"name":"Sword2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2493560/1276f8843765550a37fc1e501af3ade0046767f1.jpg"},{"name":"Sword3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2493560/a250422307581230244ff5038c83ee8348861920.jpg"},{"name":"Sword4","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2493560/e63fec0c51777e20fd1b48bb8ad1b0bd9281e70c.jpg"},{"name":"Sword5","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2493560/a97e9e05e22d05d65543392c682dad65f1a49fb3.jpg"},{"name":"Sword6","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2493560/12d336e2b2c4045816e2fdedaa0b2ee0c179731f.jpg"},{"name":"Sword7","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2493560/89d1caef0e71a4b2f872d2112f961b751fe864ba.jpg"},{"name":"Sword8","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2493560/e87b1e5a6839e037874743a9abc8a47ee778a5ca.jpg"},{"name":"Sword9","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2493560/ae624c5d65cee89e2b77b8b9ab0c0039c6dfc3a6.jpg"},{"name":"Sword10","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2493560/8e149df5b1a2ab0c9a93b92f922763ae37c270ba.jpg"}],"total":94},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2493560/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714822699","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2493560/page.bg.jpg?t=1714822699","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2493560/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714822699","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2493560/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714822699","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong><u>Rated higher in steam than HellDivers 2!</u></strong><br><br><strong>Ethically free Idle game!
