{"about_the_game":"You find yourself in a dark labyrinth dungeon, you need to find the key and defeat the boss to go to the next level or return to the tavern with the loot. The deeper you go down, the more dangerous the enemies become, but the reward is better. When you die, you lose everything and are revived in the nearest tavern penniless. You will have to find out what this place is and if it has a &quot;bottom&quot;. The most important thing to remember is that the most dangerous enemy in the dungeon is a &quot;human&quot;.<br />\r\nThe development of the game is divided into two stages Roguelike and Mmorpg.<br />\r\n1. Roguelike is based on procedurally generated mazes, I will be adding all the mechanics that I have planned, as well as maze modes. When all this is done and the balance including PVP between classes and builds is fine tuned, I will move on to the second part of the Mmorpg.<br />\r\n2. Mmorpg will be based on Roguelike, without progression transfer, in fact there will be 2 different games in one client. With open world, siege and node systems, city management.<br />\r\nFor the base of atmosphere and experience for players taken from various anime in the style of SAO &quot;sword art online&quot;<br />\r\nand other similar anime about dungeons and survival in them.

Where you find friends, enemies, love, join guilds, meet in real life.  You can go alone, or you can team up with a friend, but be careful, because a friend can shoot you in the back and take your drop. You can meet with another group in the depths of the labyrinth, and kill them, taking everything, but the value can be huge, you can negotiate with the strong and separate for a fee or together to defeat the boss, and then be what will be. The main thing in time to stop and after killing the boss to return to the tavern to exchange the drop for the necessary and become stronger. And here you are with your friends in full equipment ready to go further. Here at death you lose everything and maybe even your friends.
