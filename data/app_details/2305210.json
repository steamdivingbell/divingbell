{"about_the_game":"You are a robot sent to the planet of Xenion to set up a system to make it habitable for your creators. However, the makeup of its atmosphere leads to a challenging process along the way.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Build factories automated by drones</strong></h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2305210/extras/dronetest5.gif?t=1736882889\" /><br><br>Create systems to mine and process materials in automated pipelines. Configure drones to easily handle the logistics. Skyformer's automation is intended to be more approachable and casual than most automation games, with less calculations and planning involved. It's an automation game that you can play at the end of a tiring day.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Terraform and track the weather</strong></h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2305210/extras/map3.gif?t=1736882889\" /><br><br>The processed materials allow you to create and run a system that controls the climate, tracks the weather, and terraforms the planet. As you terraform, the planet becomes more capable of producing weather systems, some of which being quite destructive. This game has a dynamic weather system that interacts with the geography, producing microclimates in each region based on the current global climate.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Position and protect your factories, and make Xenion habitable!</strong></h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2305210/extras/anim23.gif?t=1736882889\" /><br><br>Changing the climate of the planet can allow access to previously inhospitable regions, but can also do the opposite. Observing the weather and how the geography locally influences it is important to surviving the terraforming process. A few different strategies can be employed towards surviving storms, such as building up automated drone defense systems, strategically positioning buildings, or simply maximizing the power of your tools and taking storms head-on. The energy produced by the storms can also be harnessed!<br><br>The goal of the game is to achieve a climate that maximizes biomass across each region, and stabilize the atmosphere to the point at which storms are no longer destructive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Development</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Aiming to release the game in early access in Fall 2025.
