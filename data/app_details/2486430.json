{"about_the_game":"Bilattice is a massive puzzle game featuring over 300 hand-crafted levels and tons of unique mechanics. The mechanics interact with each other in endlessly interesting ways to produce hours of mind-bending content. The sheer number of clever gimmicks offered by this game is hard not to appreciate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this game, you learn the rules as you go through thoughtful level design that is meant to walk you through a series of realizations. Every puzzle is purposeful. But for those who prefer a more overt helping hand, tutorials and accessibility options are offered.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game also goes totally off the rails for the optional, bonus content. Bilattice is a game that goes all in on any wild concept the developer could think up.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2486430/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1690070398","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2486430/page.bg.jpg?t=1690070398","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2486430/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1690070398","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2486430/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1690070398","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Bilattice is a massive puzzle game featuring over 300 hand-crafted levels and tons of unique mechanics.
