{"about_the_game":"Spider Bounce is a game built around a single, simple mechanic. You control a spider that moves left and right, and dashes downwards.  You navigate obstacles and collect a multitude of flies that move in waves underneath you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game can be played as a single-player experience or with up to 4-player couch co-op.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter each round of collecting flies, you have a chance to build your playstyle by choosing rewards that augment your spider and its abilities. Some will increase your health, others will allow you to pile up your points into huge combo streaks, and others to collect your opponents' flies as well as your own.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe flies will move in a variety of ways and in a range of formations. There are hazards in the game such as snakes which you will need to dodge in order to make it through the rounds. Through skill and cunning, you have a chance to outwit your opponents, either real or computer controlled, and be crowned the greatest spider of them all.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt's a fun and colorful game with light-hearted elements such as customizing the appearance of your spider with accessories. However, Spider Bounce also has a strong core theme of Nature and Mysticism which it stays true to throughout.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2549900/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737555420","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2549900/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1737555420","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2549900/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737555420","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2549900/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737555420","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Spider Bounce is a game built around a single, simple mechanic.
