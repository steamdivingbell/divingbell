{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Game</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">&quot;Coins, Crown &amp; Cabal&quot; is a medieval economic, political, and trade simulation where players take on the role of a trader to build a thriving trading empire. Players face tough societal and political decisions to gain wealth, influence, and power, while competing against others. Customize and design your own settlement to gain recognition from thousands of fellow players. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Views</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game offers three different views, each serving it's own purpose.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>3D Settlement View</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Manage your own settlement and interact with those of other players. Here, buildings can be constructed and expanded, settlement-related menus accessed, and tasks accepted.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>3D Overview Map</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Used for trading over shorter distances within a county. Trade routes can be planned, dangerous bandit camps discovered, and responses to events coordinated.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>2D World Map</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">On the large world map, you can discover hidden paths and plan distant trade routes. It also provides an overview of counties and guilds, as well as additional information such as the economic strength of players.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Trade with Resources &amp; Goods</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Players can trade goods with other players and NPCs to create a flourishing trading empire.

Additional equipment can be added to alter their characteristics and withstand the challenges coming their way.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Utilize Settlement Potential</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Settlers have individual traits and abilities initially unknown to players.

Choose the best terrain factors (meadows, forests, mountains, rivers, swamps) for transporting goods or generating new income through toll roads. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Goods Production</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Raw materials can be produced in production buildings and refined in processing facilities. Trade contracts must be made to obtain missing consumables, and transportation must be planned on land and by ships. Production buildings can be expanded and equipped with tools. Worker characteristics determine production speed and product quality.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Events &amp; Decisions</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Players are continually confronted with political and societal events, each decision bringing individual advantages and disadvantages - there is no shiny path.

These characters are controlled by the game and have individual political tendencies influencing the game (e.g., high tax burden). The players' goal is to gain esteem from the current nobility, which can be used to eliminate bandit camps threatening their convoys, for instance.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Intrigues</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The earl occasionally assigns players with intriguing tasks. To fulfill such a task, suitable settlers must be sent as agents to other players' settlements to carry out specific sabotage. Successful completion gains you high reputation and rich rewards, but failure may lead to the prison tower!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Offices &amp; Voting</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Players can occupy the positions of builder, lay judge, and councilor in the citizen council, as well as the positions of bailiff, judge, and magistrate in the city council, through elections won by players. Officeholders enjoy special features of their positions and can participate in special votes, such as holding a festival or imposing special taxes on certain goods.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Tasks &amp; Progress</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Completing tasks for the settlement, the earl, or even the king can yield special rewards and improve your reputation drastically. Additionally, there is an overarching progress system divided into chapters, unlocking new possibilities, such as &quot;Market rights&quot; for trading processed goods or automating repetitive tasks in the game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Expansion and Design of the Settlement</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The settlement is the players' true &quot;avatar.&quot; New buildings like taverns, town halls, residences, and forges, as well as various production buildings, can be constructed. Players can influence the composition and structure of individual buildings, choose building materials, and define architectural styles. Particularly representative &quot;skins&quot; can be earned or purchased. Players gain gameplay advantages by rating other players' settlements, contributing to a dedicated ranking. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Trade Guilds</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the later stages of the game, players can organize into large guilds to collectively tackle extensive tasks from the king. These represent significant logistical challenges that must be fulfilled quickly. As a reward, &quot;Crown Gulden&quot; are offered - a currency which can be exchanged for special items.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2749050/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727689550","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2749050/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1727689550","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2749050/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727689550","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2749050/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727689550","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Game</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">&quot;Coins, Crown &amp; Cabal&quot; is a medieval economic, political, and trade simulation where players take on the role of a trader to build a thriving trading empire.
