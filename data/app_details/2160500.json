{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Description</h2><br>Many Minigames is a collection of minigames inspired by Wario Ware. In each game you must quickly identify the controls and the goal in order to beat it before time runs out. Each game is relatively simple: bringing to mind old console games and Flash games. However, when played one after the other they become more than the sum of their parts and beating all minigames without losing a life is quite a challenge. As you improve you can climb the global leaderboard.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Modes</h2><br>Currently there are three modes: play, infinity challenge, and practice mode.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Play Mode</h2><br>This is the default experience and where new players should start. It's laid back and you get three lives.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Infinity Challenge</h2><br>This is the hardcore experience. You've got just one life to run up your score on the global leaderboard. Speed increases over time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Practice</h2><br>Choose a specific minigame to practice it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Community Feedback</h2><br>As I'm adding minigames and game modes I want the community's help to steer things in the right direction. What do you think about the game? Which minigames are too hard? Which are too easy? Which are the most fun? Which are the least fun? I would very much appreciate hearing your feedback. You can reach me via email or Twitter or just comment on this Steam page and I will read and respond promptly.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Talking about practice","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2160500/2f37c7132d66bd9ee380f619b5495fbe400fb79e.jpg"},{"name":"Every journey starts with a single step","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2160500/5dcd95649e97a2e6814161ee28f1cf2f32edf1c4.jpg"},{"name":"Speed demon 150","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2160500/d2fcbfdba7394eec0d76a8ca174e8c34e1405eb6.jpg"},{"name":"Speed demon 200","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2160500/01003a12ad22a4cac6147a59e246b427da87125f.jpg"},{"name":"No chill","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2160500/dea89c7825f7ea2f1f12160b926231d7721c4753.jpg"},{"name":"Sweet 5","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2160500/fae3c9d8af8ab8d3d742e819bcf7c00bfdcb4a71.jpg"},{"name":"Sweet 10","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2160500/fccf7c45f92409a2dc49dbeca2310e080b952db0.jpg"},{"name":"Sweet 15","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2160500/7fee7de1f3884c02164dacf6a8a6408b5f00ae0a.jpg"},{"name":"Sweet 20","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2160500/16be85bbe665e33c2a1824e7259d6e49e8dacde0.jpg"},{"name":"Flawless play","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2160500/4dc828baf203cf1887a8ff45d85340e042511c96.jpg"}],"total":11},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2160500/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1717854282","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2160500/page.bg.jpg?t=1717854282","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2160500/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1717854282","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2160500/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1717854282","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Description</h2><br>Many Minigames is a collection of minigames inspired by Wario Ware.
