{"about_the_game":"This game combines action, adventure, puzzle solving, fantasy horror, and adventure games. Although the time background is set around the 1960s, it is not completely consistent with that era. But rather machine equipment filled with fantasy ideas and various sci-fi elements. And in close coordination with games, most science fiction devices can be operated to solve puzzles. This game also includes horror and supernatural content. Players can help ghosts solve problems and bring them to rest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the plot deepens, the perfect combination of ghosts and sci-fi elements ultimately forms an evil conspiracy. Players can only unravel the truth of the entire conspiracy by solving all puzzles and helping most ghosts rest in peace.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a detective, the protagonist accidentally enters a mysterious industrial town, triggering a series of mysterious, terrifying, magical, and supernatural events. As the plot deepens, the protagonist gradually solves a series of puzzles but is surrounded by larger ones...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game has rich content, a strong sense of tension, difficult puzzles, and severe brain-burning. Suitable for players who enjoy tension and excitement, have a strong curiosity, a desire to explore games, and enjoy using their brains.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is a single-player game and is only suitable for single-player play.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDue to the large content but limited developer capabilities and economic limitations, this game can only be launched in segments, ultimately forming a complete puzzle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, thank you to the Steam Platform and all players. I hope everyone enjoys this game and provides various opinions and suggestions. Developers will try their best to meet the player's requirements and modify the game's shortcomings based on their abilities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is a horror game that includes violent content such as amputation. Contains sexy clothing but does not include sexual activity, drug use, alcohol abuse, or self-harm.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is a demo version, including about one hour of game time. Due to the abnormal difficulty of this game and the lack of storage function, the demo version of this game has reduced the difficulty and added some shortcuts to ensure that players can pass. Thank you for your support.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2654200/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1699112638","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2654200/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1699112638","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2654200/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1699112638","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2654200/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1699112638","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This game combines action, adventure, puzzle solving, fantasy horror, and adventure games.
