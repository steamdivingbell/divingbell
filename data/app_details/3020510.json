{"about_the_game":"Legend of Heroes: Three Kingdoms is a free sandbox RPG that plays as a military general of the Three Kingdoms. It focuses on gaining an immersive experience of playing a military general in the world of the Three Kingdoms.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Rich gameplay:</h2>There are three core battles in this game, namely legion battles, martial arts battles and verbal battles. Among them, legion warfare uses a real-time strategy system to achieve victory by annihilating enemy troops and occupying enemy buildings. Fighting and verbal battles adopt a turn-based card system. In order to improve the performance in the three types of battles, it is necessary to improve the three souls of each general, namely the military soul, the martial soul and the intellectual soul. Accumulating three soul points and learning to equip special souls and skills is the most direct way to prompt combat effectiveness.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multi-identity experience:</h2>When playing as the lord, you can control all the cities under your command and assign them to governors. Improve the economic balance of each city by executing internal policies. and spent the excess money on army formation and recruitment. Improve your own strength by developing science and technology or implementing specific strategies. When the army forms combat effectiveness, you can launch wars, capture enemy cities, and unify the world.<br><br>When playing the role of a general, you need to accumulate merit and speaking power as much as possible. When promoted to a fifth-rank official, he will be named a prefect and gain command of the city. When you accumulate enough merit to serve as a second-grade officer, you can become a legion commander and add more cities to your legion. You can also use your speaking power to exchange for the direct jurisdiction of more cities when talking to the lord, or to obtain more generals under the lord's army.<br><br>When playing the role of a military general in the field, you can build military residences in the city and form a private army. And sign mercenary contracts with the lords of other forces. When this force encounters a war, you can lead mercenaries to join the war and influence the general trend of the world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Various social networking:</h2>All generals in the game can be befriended. It is relatively easy to get to know generals with similar personalities, but it is more difficult to get along with those who are noble or have different personalities. There are many benefits to building a good relationship with military generals. In addition to directly obtaining immortal points, you can also ask them to give you special training to quickly increase certain characteristic values. Or you can invite him to go with you, do tasks together, or help you win some battles that are usually difficult to win. In addition, when the relationship reaches a certain level, you can become betrothed or married. Make her completely join your power group. <br><br>The number of social interactions with a general each quarter is generally limited by the other party's social interest in you. The higher the relationship level, the more social interest will be increased each quarter. Increasing social interest by giving gifts that the other party likes is a good way to quickly improve the relationship.<br>Various topics can be obtained in the game. When you share these topics with other generals, you can improve your mood, strengthen your relationship, and gain some six-dimensional experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Rich historical plot with multiple endings:</h2>You can experience the rich historical plot of the Three Kingdoms in the game. For example, you can play as Cao Cao to experience the first-person perspective of the Battle of Guandu and the Battle of Chibi, or you can play as some military generals who were defeated in history and change their fate against the odds in the historical plot.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Diverse commissioned tasks and plots:</h2>In each city, you can receive interesting task commissions. Helping the generals you want to make friends with to complete the commissioned tasks is a common way to make friends with the generals. And if you are confident in your martial arts or eloquence, you can participate in national martial arts conferences or tongue fighting conferences and become famous all over the world.<br><br>Supplement: Because we are a small team, there are still many areas in the game that need to be improved, but we still hope to do our best to make a sandbox game from the Three Kingdoms RPG perspective that belongs to the Chinese people.
