{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Revert, use the time-manipulation powers granted to you by the Animal Spirits to solve over 40 puzzles in this  puzzle-platformer. You start out with the ability to Save the state of the world, and Revert to go back to how it was. Solve puzzles with the world now reorganized! As you progress, unlock more time-manipulation powers to solve increasingly complex levels. Use your powers sparingly, and you\u2019ll please the Animal Spirits.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><u>HOW TO PLAY</u></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The core mechanic of Revert is saving and reverting to moments in time. Control a young wizard who gains time manipulation abilities. When she saves time, the positions and movements of world objects will be remembered. At any time, you can use her power to revert to that time. Everything in the world - except you - will be reverted to how it was at the last save. You can save multiple times before reverting. Whenever you revert, you go to the most recently saved version of time.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><u>ABOUT THE AUTHORS</u></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We are Radar and Frood, working together as Higher Up Games.

Use the Revert mechanic to solve over 40 puzzles. As the game progresses, you will learn several new abilities to make the puzzles more complex.
