{"about_the_game":"<strong> In the industrial era, the engineer  has a dream. The world of machines that uses the combined power of the magic and steam engines. Being a mechanical device designed by you, you venture out into a lucid dream that moves as your imagine.</strong><br><br>&quot;The engineer has to make his way out of his dreams and defeat the boss. As time passed, bizarre and powerful monsters will appear and cause pain to the engineer. Can the engineer escape his lucid dreams?&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">concept</h2>Lucid Steam is a game with a fairly complex system. Basically, it is a rogue-like game dealing with turn-based dungeon crawling, and you have to develop a path, design, and battle with items as well.

Tiles with monsters placed on them, tiles with loot chests, event tiles where you don't know what's going to happen, and so on.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Card</h2>   The route card is the card that makes the way.
