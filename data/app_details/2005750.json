{"about_the_game":"You have 60 seconds to explore a collapsing cave before time resets, and then you'll lose everything but your map and one item.

Hidden codes uncover unique gameplay challenges!<br><br></li><li><strong>Randomizer</strong> -- The customizable randomizer mode lets you play with the item layout entirely rearranged. The game's logic will ensure each game is possible to complete in respect to both item order and time. The logic can be set to normal, difficult, or off and you can even entirely turn the game's clock off as well.<br><br></li><li><strong>Sequence breaking</strong> -- Don't like playing in the dev-intended order? You can abuse the game's design to get items early, or not at all!
