{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2096480/extras/Combat.gif?t=1664686239\" /><br>Shattered Star is a small indie game made by 3 action game enthusiasts that tends to combine hack&amp;slash and roguelike gameplay together to let you have the most fun out of it. There is no storyline due to the limit of 3 part-time developers. Just drop, kill, and have fun. We provide 2 game modes including a pass-30-level mode and a survival mode. Hopefully this small game can put a smile on your face :)<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2096480/extras/Blessing.gif?t=1664686239\" /><br>We have a special machanic called blessing, which allows to put very powerful skill on any weapon with certain trigger condition. We want to promote player to have different play style for every run and it is almost impossible to end up with exact same build in 2nd time since all blessings are generated with random conditions. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2096480/extras/Bow.gif?t=1664686239\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2096480/extras/rangeWeapon.gif?t=1664686239\" /><br>We provide players great amount of weapon choices bows, various guns and all kinds of melee weapons.
