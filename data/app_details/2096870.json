{"about_the_game":"Home By The River is a unique builder game set in a dystopian not too distant future. You move to a polluted land by a river so that you may build your clean reactor secretly, and hide from the mighty Sigil Corporation. Construct your home &amp; lab, farm, harvest, cook, earn money, gain virtue, clean pollution, get your technology out to the world, and so transform your dystopian world forever by your efforts. Enlist Pioneers of various professions to help you in your cause! You can play single player or LAN co-op.<br><br>I think you can finish all of the main game objectives in about 4 hours play time and after that you can continue playing the game as a house building sandbox. I've purposefully made all systems in the game swift because I don't like tedious grinding (such as planting one by one, harvesting one by one, placing things one by one, or being limited in how much can be achieved in one day). If you have ideas on more things you'd like to see in the game then just write on the discussion board. I'm a guy not a corporation so do just write and treat me like a person. Making a fun and interesting experience is my full time job. I prioritise the lowest hanging fruit that makes the game more fun.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>CLEAN POLLUTION</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Cut down dead trees.<br></li><li>Remove trash.<br></li><li>Plant new trees.<br></li><li>Place solar panels.<br></li><li>Establish wind farms.<br></li><li>When you're filthy rich, build your clean reactor.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>CREATE YOUR HOME</strong></h2>Build your dream home, and feel free to share what you've made with the Discord community.
