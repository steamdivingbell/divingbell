{"about_the_game":"Regarding Unfear Day, it is an open world multiplayer survival game that combines sandbox and simulation elements, including base building, NPC recruitment, community building, and the fusion of zombie growth elements and major event elements.<br />\r\nRegarding the overall framework of the survival mode, it may not have particularly obvious innovative content and is still a relatively old-fashioned and conservative resource reuse mechanism. However, the difference is that we believe that the addition of big event elements and community elements can change this. For example, zombies will be reinforced in fixed/random cycles, with their ultimate goal of attacking players and their bases and communities. Community building elements that integrate various functional facilities can be used to defend against zombies or produce resources, while NPCs will have one or more professions to build specific community facilities. Of course, the addition of NPCs allows players to freely call on them to defend against zombies, and event elements will provide interesting extensions for NPCs and zombies, which also belong to a task system. Yes, NPCs can publish tasks and reward players with rewards to purchase or sell their private resources.<br />\r\n\ufeff<br />\r\nPlayers need to deal with many unexpected things, and it's not just zombies that can defeat us. From a macro perspective, we still added many hostile NPCs who, along with unfriendly players, pose the greatest threat besides zombies. Therefore, recruiting teammates and members is a very important thing, just to ensure that they will truly cooperate and win.<br />\r\n\ufeff<br />\r\nIn addition, we will patiently listen to the opinions and feedback of players, and at any time, we will adopt reasonable suggestions.<br />\r\n\ufeff<br />\r\nWe will continue to update it endlessly.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3097650/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1721360156","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3097650/page.bg.jpg?t=1721360156","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3097650/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1721360156","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3097650/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1721360156","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":51},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Some bleeding special effects, as well as corpses produced after zombie death"},"detailed_description":"Regarding Unfear Day, it is an open world multiplayer survival game that combines sandbox and simulation elements, including base building, NPC recruitment, community building, and the fusion of zombie growth elements and major event elements.<br />\r\nRegarding the overall framework of the survival mode, it may not have particularly obvious innovative content and is still a relatively old-fashioned and conservative resource reuse mechanism.
