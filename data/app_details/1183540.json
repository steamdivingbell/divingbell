Players who do not own the Skin Pack cannot edit vehicles that use these skins without purchasing the Skin Pack for themselves, but will still be able to drive vehicles with these skins equipped if spawned in by a player who owns the Skin Pack. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to making your builds pop, buying the Skin Pack also supports the continued development of Trailmakers and future games from Flashbulb Games.
