{"about_the_game":"<strong>COLOR</strong> is a unique puzzle game from Dual Studios which revolves around the manipulation of color through the additive color system. <br><br>In each level you must use and manipulate the colors at your disposal to match the color of the goal and therefore progress to the next stage.

This light can be interpreted as different colors depending on how long the waves are. There are three primary colors that come from this: <strong>Red</strong>, <strong>Green </strong>and <strong>Blue</strong>. These primary colors can then be added together to create secondary colors: <strong>Yellow</strong>, <strong>Cyan </strong>and <strong>Magenta</strong>. These six colors can then be mixed and separated to make each other, thus creating the complex puzzle mechanic that the game is built around.<br><br><br><strong>Trailer music by Jamie Molloy</strong>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/305030/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1544291495","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/305030/page.bg.jpg?t=1544291495","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/305030/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1544291495","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/305030/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1544291495","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>COLOR</strong> is a unique puzzle game from Dual Studios which revolves around the manipulation of color through the additive color system. <br><br>In each level you must use and manipulate the colors at your disposal to match the color of the goal and therefore progress to the next stage.
