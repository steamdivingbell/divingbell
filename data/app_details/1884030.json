{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2>The game's story begins when you awaken in the middle of a forest with a rifle in your hands. While attempting to escape, Zombies appear out of nowhere and try to\u00a0kill you. Even After Killing All Zombies, The Adventure Has Only Just Begun! After that, you'll find yourself in a house filled with traps to avoid and healing medicine kits to collect! After that, you'll return to the forest\u00a0in order to continue your journey and take back your freedom! Then there's a basement where there are zombies in every room, and you have to search for and collect keys to get out! Finally, you find yourself in a forest full of zombies who are much faster than you and against whom you have no defense! Nothing is as simple as it appears. To summarize, you will encounter numerous zombies, traps, extremely fast zombies, and even scare jumps, as well as some exploring experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Mode</h2>Beside The Story, There Is One Game Mode In The Game, Basically It's You And Zombies In A Small Rounded Place Where Zombies Respawn Every Second!
