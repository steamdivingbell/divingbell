{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Overview</h2><br>With Carl and Cari: Trubel in Tierstadt, we are trying to build a bridge. On the one hand, we want to provide children with information in a playful way, free from the pressure of tests and at their own pace. On the other hand, we want to record important information about the child's achievements and interests.<br>Our solution to this problem? The &quot;Profile&quot; system.<br>The child doesn't have to do anything but play the game and doesn't even know that anything is being learned. While jobs that the child has enjoyed are saved as a &quot;profile&quot; file on the PC at the end so that they can be sent to the parents/teachers. These &quot;profiles&quot; are summaries of all relevant information about each job, which the parents/teachers can then use for evaluation.<br>In the game itself, the player slips into the role of Carl or Cari and has to help Tierstadt prepare for a festival. You do this by helping the inhabitants of Tierstadt with their jobs. While helping them out, children learn about the various jobs in a playful way and then receive a letter of information for teachers or parents about all the jobs that the child found interesting. The aim of this is to counteract the lack of training and to educate children at an early age about possible future areas of interest.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3081940/extras/image_51.png?t=1723485280\" /><br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3081940/extras/Unbenanntes_Projekt__1__1.png?t=1723485280\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game mechanics</h2><br><strong>2,5D Level:</strong><br>We try to arouse children's interest in the game primarily through its visuals.

We always represent several jobs in one category with a job that is more tangible for the children. Example: Ornamental plant cultivation, landscape gardener, cemetery gardener, orchard gardener... are all represented by the &quot;gardener&quot; in our game. The mini-games are usually played in a first-person 2D view.<br><br><strong>Dialog:</strong><br>Dialogs are used to tell the story of the game. This is there to bind the player to something so that they try out even more jobs. Furthermore, dialogs are mainly used to explain game mechanics and to provide background knowledge about all the jobs. All dialogs are set to music to make it easier for children to read. There is also a picture and a name for each character.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3081940/extras/Frame_37.png?t=1723485280\" /><br><br><strong>Map with progress:</strong><br>The map features a hub where players can move between levels.

If you are playing Cari, the help button is represented by Carl and Vice Versa.<br><br><strong>Profile-Export-System:</strong><br>After each game, the child receives a &quot;profile&quot; for the respective job. These profiles can be called up from the map and are always a sheet on which everything you need to know about the respective training occupation is summarized. If the child now clicks on &quot;Download&quot;, the respective profile is then saved on the desktop. These profiles are specifically addressed to the tutors/parents, so the child is simply informed that they should please show these profiles to their teachers/parents. They can now initiate educational measures and, for example, encourage interest in the areas in which the child has attracted positive attention.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3081940/extras/Frame_38.png?t=1723485280\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3081940/extras/Unbenanntes_Projekt__1__1.png?t=1723485280\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Didactic framework</h2><br><strong>Who is the target group?</strong><br>The game is designed for kids aged 9 to 11.
