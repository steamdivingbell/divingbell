{"about_the_game":"Let's do it a third time! Gods, oh yes, yes! As you may have guessed, we are talking about the third coming of the legendary Lord of the Click series - now it is a trilogy.

Well, naturally!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLord of the Click III concludes the epic story of General Clicker as he battles all the monstrous enemies of our once-peaceful realm - defeat them all and live in peace again. The game has improved its own formula with several new features: an updated unit recruitment system, a thoughtful approach to leveling, and a visual update. So now you can admire the pastoral-cartoon landscapes, on which only orc blood is shed. We know you can't wait to get back to Lord of the Click with all these improvements!
