{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Plot and gameplay</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the beginning, there was darkness. Somewhere out there, beyond the event horizon. For a long time, darkness just was. The universe expanded, life came and went, until it evolved enough to learn how to travel between worlds. And then out of the darkness came the Rifts, a dimensional disease that incarnates in the form of formless creatures.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Various story campaigns are waiting for you, in which you will fight against the spawns of darkness, more than 10 missions for 10 hours of gameplay, traveling through the world of the future, which is literally consumed by Rifts. Collect improvements for your exoskeleton, trade trash and scrap metal for profit, visit abandoned and captured buildings for reinforcements.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Intertwining genres</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game combines the ideas of strategy and CCG (collectible card game), which gives a unique and interesting experience from its passing. You need to explore the world, strengthen yourself and fight back your opponents in card battles.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Adventure Mode</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Adventure mode you need to travel around the planets, collect items, pump skills, explore buildings and recruit creatures from different universes to fulfill the main task: destroying Rifts - entities that appear from spatial Rifts.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Battle Mode</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As soon as you encounter hostile creatures or an unknown character, you can start a fight and go into Battle mode. The battlefield in Battle mode is a table on which opponents take turns placing cards, attacking with them, and using unique abilities. There are three types of battle cards: creatures, actions, and events. Creature cards are your army, your helpers that you have found and taken with you on your journey. They have their own health, damage, and individual abilities. They cover you with their bodies, so the face cannot be attacked until all your companions have been killed.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">World destruction</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you progress through the scenarios, the world around you is destroyed and you experience the devastation of its effects. You need to be extremely careful to survive in the territories captured by the Rifts.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cooperative</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Team up with other players to play story campaigns together or engage in 1 vs 1 faction battles to determine the strongest soldier.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Visual design</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Enjoy the game's lush visuals that combine pixel-art and digital-art styles.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Immersion","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3212880/3514756093e80d0ad6e14df8f38f3286c7c799b2.jpg"},{"name":"Ready for Battle","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3212880/79166718f4d2943295ceed25504c42ee465f1c82.jpg"},{"name":"The First Pancake is Never a Flop","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3212880/79166718f4d2943295ceed25504c42ee465f1c82.jpg"},{"name":"The Power of Ignis Gladius","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3212880/79166718f4d2943295ceed25504c42ee465f1c82.jpg"},{"name":"The Greatness of Terrum","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3212880/79166718f4d2943295ceed25504c42ee465f1c82.jpg"},{"name":"The Wisdom of Verbum Portatores","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3212880/79166718f4d2943295ceed25504c42ee465f1c82.jpg"},{"name":"Save All Livings","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3212880/79166718f4d2943295ceed25504c42ee465f1c82.jpg"},{"name":"Took Out the Trash","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3212880/d1774f111adb3ae6572208c05132e84cd6ec9ac9.jpg"},{"name":"On the Brink of Death","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3212880/006620643b80bc63c77e9904fd41993abe5697aa.jpg"},{"name":"Replenishment of Supplies","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3212880/6693b0ce83cbb5a45fcace6bae60889bfadf948c.jpg"}],"total":15},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3212880/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1739361658","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3212880/page.bg.jpg?t=1739361658","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3212880/32d7f5b4db09c5a7a20e09aaf78c0212d4a05379/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739361658","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3212880/32d7f5b4db09c5a7a20e09aaf78c0212d4a05379/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739361658","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Plot and gameplay</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the beginning, there was darkness.
