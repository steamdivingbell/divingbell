Your primary task is to evade enemy collisions and incoming fire. Upon defeating enemies, they will drop crystals, which you can collect to gain experience points. When your experience bar is full, random module upgrade options will appear.

Within the game, you'll encounter two buildings, the 'Gold Factory' and the 'Crystal Factory.' The Gold Factory periodically provides players with gold coins, with production capacity increasing with each upgrade. Similarly, the Crystal Factory periodically supplies crystals, and its production capacity also increases with each upgrade. Each factory can be upgraded to a maximum level of 10.

Each time you level up, you will randomly receive a talent or unlock a new spaceship. The number of talents you can carry into battle is limited, so you'll need to choose them wisely based on your strategy.
