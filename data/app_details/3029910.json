{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2><br>Once upon a time, there was a planet called Meow Meow, where the inhabitants, the Meow Meows, loved to play a game called Monopoly. However, a witch named Lele always rolled a one on the dice, so she always lost. Anger, resentment, jealousy, and a powerful obsession caused the space to warp, and the demonic energy from another time and space also corrupted Lele and the other little animals. Lele also used her newly learned magic to create a chessboard world where it was easier to win when rolling a one. The other Meow Meows in the village were also sealed in the chessboard world by her, and the players will play various Meow Meows to compete with Lele, ultimately helping the Meow Meows to escape this absurd chessboard world...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Features</h2><br><strong>A Game of Luck and Strategy</strong><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3029910/extras/2.gif?t=1734589861\" /><br><br>\u25cfThe majority of the map's plots can be freely constructed, and stacking similar plots can upgrade the plot level.
