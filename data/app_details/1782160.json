In his spare time, he loves to attend meet and greet events, and bring his camera with him. That's how he met Yoan Fanise - DigixArt founder - during a game jam, and he began to closely follow the creation of Road 96 for nearly a year. \u201cMore than videogames, what I love is to follow the creative process of inspiring people. No matter the media,\u201d he explains. Adding: \u201cI feel incredibly lucky to have had the chance to follow Road 96's development process. There was so much creativity and talent taking part in the game.\u201d <br><br>Florian Gallant is currently trying to find out what his next project will be. Inspired by Brian de Palma and C\u00e9line Sciamma films, Danny Fonseca began his filmmaking career by creating short fiction and advertisement.
