{"about_the_game":"Welcome to the open world, mini-metroidvania of your dreams.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou wake in a circle of speaking stones, in a strange sunless land filled with ruins and monsters. You remember going to sleep, back in your world, on a hill near the cresting lights. Some called it a faerie hill, and warned of kidnapping and dancing and taken to the land of the good folk, the grey folk, the faeries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut there are no fair folk here, it is empty and lonely and littered with hollow bones. You have only one thought: to return back home. But how? How. The experience is beautiful and immersive. Expect to get lost, and love finding the interesting places you discover.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game contains:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Non-linear layout. Defeat any boss in any order you like. Find any item in any order you like. Solve puzzles using whatever tools you have on hand.<br />\r\n-No health bar. You fade away each time you get hit, until you completely disappear<br />\r\n-Only two items. One for each hand, each time you want a new one, you have to drop an old one. This leads to interesting strategy and puzzle solving<br />\r\n-You can pick up anything and use it as an item<br />\r\n-Speed run and game challenge tools. Press escape, turn on the speed run timer or the kill count timer. Try beating the game with 0 kills! It's hard, but not impossible. Or beat the game with only 5 kills. Or 100! <br />\r\n-Multiple different ways to solve each puzzle in the game. This allows players to find their own way.<br />\r\n-A full Day/Night cycle<br />\r\n-A weather cycle including fog, rain, overcast<br />\r\n-Fifty four unique maps, creating a unique, miniature world<br />\r\n-Four bosses. Three bosses hidden throughout the land and one final boss.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Light Bringer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1523640/8cbedf92608d9611f7dde3d5e0d44a930f2e1c45.jpg"},{"name":"Living Bow","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1523640/2e6214cfe81ef093daa77157649b79ab75348252.jpg"},{"name":"Ghost Shield","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1523640/183232ba8fa8cd9cc086d4ea6529f67b512402cf.jpg"},{"name":"Hollow Prince Sword","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1523640/acd2532591f04976dbf2a8ac70980d2c71704269.jpg"},{"name":"Crow Flight","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1523640/25a3117003158141af361e412713986020e2ae72.jpg"},{"name":"Storm Caller","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1523640/65049c175b907b8b9f5e0468628923b67e2d9f5d.jpg"},{"name":"Fog Walker","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1523640/15d500466417721798a7c4e35a6308f814204ccb.jpg"},{"name":"The Ivy Wand","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1523640/f2941f04252f8d01850462a979765f448931bb3a.jpg"},{"name":"Potion Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1523640/f7481787093f3923ddc81eb1b5d67449a4d7af17.jpg"},{"name":"Archery Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1523640/35f77ddb906297e362b6dbe6d099178dc7aad84a.jpg"}],"total":23},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1523640/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1653676303","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1523640/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1653676303","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1523640/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1653676303","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1523640/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1653676303","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Welcome to the open world, mini-metroidvania of your dreams.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou wake in a circle of speaking stones, in a strange sunless land filled with ruins and monsters.
