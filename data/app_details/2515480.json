{"about_the_game":"Frame of Mind is a brief and cozy narrative game that lets you discover a character trough thoughts and mementos they find while moving out of their parents home. It's an introspective game, meant to share some experiences a peer-group of neurodivergent queers, including the developer, had growing up.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile this game does its best to be accessible and kind, it also portrays burdens a normative society puts on kids, that are different growing up and you will encounter self-destructive thoughts. You probably should not play this if you are looking for escapism.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game can be harsh sometimes, but it is driven by empathy and the desire to share authentic insights.<br />\r\nWe do provide extensive content notes in the Game and in its Manual.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2515480/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736950455","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2515480/page.bg.jpg?t=1736950455","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2515480/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736950455","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2515480/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736950455","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Includes Source SDK","id":16}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Frame of Mind is a brief and cozy narrative game that lets you discover a character trough thoughts and mementos they find while moving out of their parents home.
