{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Starfinder RPG - Dawn of Flame AP 4: The Blind City</h2><br><strong>Trapped in the Dark</strong><br><br>When the heroes seek an expert to translate an ancient, eldritch tablet, a sinister cult strikes from out of the shadows, intent on destroying the relic and all who know of its existence.

There they will encounter ghastly creatures and uncover sophisticated technology that could advance sun-diving by light-years.
