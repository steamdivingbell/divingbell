{"about_the_game":"<i>There\u2019s an old story, so old it was old when the Arc was first built. The hero Theseus\u2019s decaying ship is replaced, piece by piece, until none of the original parts remain. Is it still the same ship?</i><br><br><i>GRAFT</i> splices together tense survival horror with a dark RPG experience in a thrilling new adventure from the developers of <i>BATTLETECH</i> and the <i>Shadowrun Trilogy</i>. Explore a dying world haunted by darkly fascinating characters and nightmarish monsters as you delve into the mysteries of the Arc. Tear pieces from your enemies to transform yourself into something new\u2014something capable of surviving the horrors that prowl around you. Every Graft brings with it some piece of its previous owner\u2019s identity, changing more than just your physical body. <br><br>You are the Ship of Theseus. Who, or what, will you be when you escape?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>POST-CYBERPUNK HORROR</strong></h2>The Arc is dying. You must escape.<br><br>Once, it hung in the sky like a jeweled moon\u2014a continent-sized station filled with biomechanically enhanced citizens, all working toward some greater purpose lost to time. Bodies were replaceable, resurrection assumed.<br><br>Now your city\u2014one of the last\u2014has fallen, swallowed by the encroaching darkness of the station's slow death. Beyond its walls you find yourself in the Arc's decaying superstructure, where both power and light are precious resources.<br><br>But the darkness isn't empty. It only feels that way at first.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>DELVE INTO A HAUNTING WORLD</strong></h2>The Arc is packed with powerful and unsettling wonders, if only you can live long enough to extract them. Master forgotten technologies and unearth secrets as you traverse yawning chasms, self replicating labyrinths, and techno-catacombs in search of a way out.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A DARK RPG EXPERIENCE</strong></h2>You are not the only survivor in the desolation. Form fragile alliances and build them into deeper relationships. Of course, anyone still living is likely both dangerous and treacherous, and that includes you. The choices you make will shape your journey and decide the fates of those you meet.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>TENSE SURVIVAL HORROR COMBAT</strong></h2>Ancient feral experiments, strange abominations, and ruthless agents of a mad AI stalk you. Use the tools in your growing arsenal as you fight through the horrors in a visceral new twist on classic survival horror combat. You will need to pick your battles and manage your resources carefully in order to escape the Arc alive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>TRANSFORM TO SURVIVE</strong></h2>Your changing body is your most powerful weapon. Augment it with Grafts and build out your abilities according to your own strategies. Each Graft you rip from a fallen foe or find hidden in the recesses of the Arc is one more deadly tool in your expanding arsenal.<br><br>But there\u2019s a catch, every Graft carries with it some small piece of its previous owner\u2026 and now they are a part of you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A METAMORPHOSIS OF SELF</strong></h2>With each Graft, strange cravings and half-glimpsed memories flood your system. Now you remember the hot breath of a lover you never touched. Now you find yourself suddenly obsessing over cruel and sadistic impulses.
