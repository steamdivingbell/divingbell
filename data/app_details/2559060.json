{"about_the_game":"If you can\u2019t travel to a total solar eclipse, bring the eclipse to you! Experience a complete total solar eclipse from start to finish. Feeling impatient? Speed up time or jump ahead. You can even pause time for extended totality! Want to stare at the sun without going blind? You can do that here. Just don\u2019t do that with the real sun!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can also view the eclipse through a pane of #14 welding glass or a pinhole projector.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeyond the eclipse itself, the environment is designed to be very relaxing. Watch the day pass from sunrise to sunset and overnight under a clear, cloudless sky. Listen to the wind dynamically blow through the trees on top of a low mountain. Breathe, relax, and enjoy your time here.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2559060/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1699111643","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2559060/page.bg.jpg?t=1699111643","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2559060/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1699111643","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2559060/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1699111643","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"If you can\u2019t travel to a total solar eclipse, bring the eclipse to you!
