{"about_the_game":"Click and drag to place asteroids, planets, and stars, then send them flying into the matching targets in a physics-based puzzle game where everything attracts everything. The levels start simple, but ramp up to include several moving parts and tricky solutions. You'll need to plan your placements carefully in order to win!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Featuring:</h2>100 hand-crafted levels to master!<br><br><br>An N-body gravity system where everything can move if something near it is heavy enough, or if something crashes into it. These puzzles are firmly grounded in real orbital mechanics!<br>(Aside from the targets. They don't move. Most of them don't, anyway.)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unique types of matter for unique puzzles:</h2>Antimatter: Crash a normal object into it to launch it away and shave off some mass. Or avoid doing that if you need to keep something onscreen.<br><br><br>Exotic matter: It has negative mass, which means it pushes things away instead of attracting them. It's still attracted to normal matter, though.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2674040/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1707592874","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2674040/page.bg.jpg?t=1707592874","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2674040/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1707592874","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2674040/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1707592874","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Click and drag to place asteroids, planets, and stars, then send them flying into the matching targets in a physics-based puzzle game where everything attracts everything.
