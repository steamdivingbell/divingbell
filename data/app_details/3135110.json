{"about_the_game":"You are who you are.  And you have stumbled upon a museum that you might have not intended to find.  But it called to you.  As you wandered the halls of an all-too-foreign place, you encountered a small structure upon a table.  Picking up the nearby headset and devices gave you control of a minibot.

After scanning everything I could (and taking photos of the larger art), I compiled and organized it all in chronological order as accurately as possible within categories of medium.

I originally organized it all into 45 categories, but in designing the actual museum, there are around 60 sections, some small and some vast.<br><br>For my first indie game, I wanted to make something that leaned towards my strengths and degrees, writing and art.  So this is a simple walking simulator museum game with a written story component.  I set up the written portion in an unobtrusive way of clicking on intractables to read, so you don\u2019t have to engage with the writing if you don\u2019t want to.  The only text you must see is for the titles.  Every piece of art and collection has a unique name.<br><br>I wanted to create a digital museum that showcased someone\u2019s lifetime development, artistically and psychologically, and I kept that promise by completing this.<br><br>Additionally, I\u2019m including the images I commissioned from artists around the world.  (I have the exclusive commercial-use rights to these pieces of art).  And I organized their work alongside the fast sketches I sent to the artists.  So you\u2019ll get to see my silly doodles and what professional artists were able to make out of them.  (I did send lengthy descriptions too, but that\u2019s all too long to include in this game.)<br><br>This section is for two categories:<br>1) The game features over 100 images of mythological creatures from cultures around the world.  (These are from a board game I created.)  (All the monsters will talk to you in that area.)<br><br>2) The game features the art for my book covers.  Starting from 2012, I wrote 38 novels in a decade.  Those are my treasures and I\u2019d like to share them with you.<br><br>(And just a note for those areas, be kind to the artists.  I worked meticulously with them until we landed on depictions that met my standards without impinging too much on their styles and capabilities.  You may have even worked with some of them yourselves.)<br><br>---<br><br><strong>The Art Excluded:</strong><br><br>I originally wanted to keep to the promise of showing everything.  Every piece of art.  And I technically am within reason.  But here\u2019s a small disclaimer.  This project includes every piece of art I ever created (that I could find), but excludes the following categories:<br>1) Portraits of real people\u2019s faces that aren\u2019t mine.<br>2) Nude sketches from college that are too revealing (I included those that don\u2019t reveal private areas and cropped certain other images that I thought still had value in that form).<br>3) Erotica.  There are no sexually explicit acts depicted in this museum.<br><br>(Otherwise, through this game, you will begin to know the horror of Everything.)<br><br>---<br><br><strong>Age Ratings:</strong><br><br>I filled out the age rating questionnaire as accurately as I could.  However, what I\u2019ve created might be somewhat unique because certain questions in the rating system were not designed with an art museum in mind.  Therefore, I\u2019m not an expert on how to gauge age ratings for an art-themed project that spans so many years, genres, mediums, and topics, so I\u2019d advise erring on the side of caution.<br><br>Keep in mind, even though a large portion of my game contains art from my childhood, this game does contain art that I made into adulthood.  The art doesn\u2019t contain any erotica, but there are other adult themes throughout the sections.  For example, there are body horror monster drawings, a few of which depict gore and violence, but those aspects are sparser throughout the total amount of images.  Even some of the art I made when I was twelve has gruesome imagery, blood, and violence, but in the form of childlike doodling.  <br><br>In the written portion of the game, there are no descriptions of sexual acts.  Most of the adult themes relate to conversations about traumas, mostly from the topics of bullying, family strife, rage, grief, and existential despair.  There is also ominous and crass humor here and there.  There is a sparse amount of coy flirtatious jokes between character echoes when they comment on the art.  <br><br>What I\u2019m trying to say is for any parents out there, if you\u2019re interested in playing the game with your kids present, vet the game first.  Certain images and dialogue might not be suitable for your individual standards.  <br><br>---<br><br><strong>The Absence of A.I.:</strong><br><br>This is another disclaimer that I\u2019ll put here even though I don\u2019t like that we\u2019re in an age where this now feels necessary.<br><br>This game does not include any A.I. generated or edited art and writing out of what I created.  That\u2019s not what this project is for.  It\u2019s only for content that I created or worked on in some capacity, without A.I. involvement, from age one until now.<br><br>I still possess the original pieces of art in case I ever needed to prove that for some reason.<br><br>(For the commercial-use art I bought, I doubt the artists I worked with used A.I. to edit images because I\u2019ve only worked with a select few \u2013 those I began working with years ago in late 2020.
