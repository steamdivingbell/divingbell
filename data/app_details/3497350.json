Gladiators engage in combat with weapons such as swords, maces, and axes, resulting in visual effects like exaggerated knockbacks, sparks, and minimal blood splatter.\r\n\r\nThe game is intended to be lighthearted and entertaining, with no graphic depictions of gore, dismemberment, or realistic injuries. The tone is more akin to a competitive, fun arena fight rather than a brutal or realistic simulation of violence.\r\n\r\nThere are no depictions of sexual acts, drug or alcohol use, or any themes involving self-harm, assault, or other sensitive topics in the game."},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Welcome to Gladiator Rumble!</strong><br>Where <i>your audience</i> transforms into fierce gladiators, ready to fight for glory in the ultimate Twitch-integrated battle simulator.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>\ud83d\udd39 What Is Gladiator Rumble?</strong><br>Gladiator Rumble is a unique game built for streamers and their communities.
