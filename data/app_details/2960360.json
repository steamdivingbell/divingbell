{"about_the_game":"Step into the shoes of a determined reporter who arrives at the notorious Hotel 77 in Arkham, Massachusetts, on the fateful night of Monday, July 7th, 1997. You're here to document the 120th anniversary celebration of the hotel, but what you encounter is far from festive.<br><br>As midnight strikes, you begin your recording, only to find the hotel eerily deserted. The once bustling corridors now stretch into an endless maze, trapping you in a sinister loop where time stands still. Each passageway seems familiar, yet subtly different, as you navigate the hotel\u2019s repeating corridors, fighting to maintain your sanity.<br><br>Amidst the disorienting labyrinth, you stumble upon a cryptic message left at the reception. This mysterious note hints at a way to break free from the hotel\u2019s eldritch grip:<br><br>&quot;There are eldritch anomalies in the hotel corridor. If you find an anomaly, turn back and advance in the opposite direction. If there are no anomalies, keep moving forward. The reception is devoid of anomalies. Every successful pass through the reception advances time by one hour. Reach the seventh hour to escape the loop!&quot;<br><br>Can you decipher the clues, overcome the anomalies, and survive the nightmarish reality of Hotel 77? Test your wits and bravery in this chilling horror experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Play Time</h2>15-60 minutes<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About Video Distribution</h2>\u30fbDistribution is available to both individuals and corporations without permission.<br>\u30fbMonetization is only possible when using the functions provided by the video distribution site.<br>\u30fbWe would appreciate it if you include the name of the game in the title of your video or live broadcast, or include a link to the Steam page in the summary section.<br><br>We will not be liable for any damages caused by the distribution of videos of this game.<br>The contents of these guidelines are subject to change without notice.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2960360/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736771605","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2960360/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1736771605","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2960360/82a8599b3aad3ca674e28454c325ae972e1a1c9c/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736771605","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2960360/82a8599b3aad3ca674e28454c325ae972e1a1c9c/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736771605","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Step into the shoes of a determined reporter who arrives at the notorious Hotel 77 in Arkham, Massachusetts, on the fateful night of Monday, July 7th, 1997.
