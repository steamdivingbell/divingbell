{"about_the_game":"In September 1995, National Rail awarded a contract to A Goninan &amp; Co for 80 locomotives, which later became 120. NR1\u2013NR60 were built at Broadmeadow, and NR61\u2013NR120 were constructed at Bassendean. The frames were built at Hexham and the bogies at Goninan's Lansdowne Engineering subsidiary in Taree.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first locomotive to be completed was NR61, which was trialled on 18 September 1996. The first Broadmeadow-built unit ran on 23 September 1996.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe early units were delivered without National Rail branding or logos, but later put into the full livery. Testing was carried out on the NSW Main Northern line between Werris Creek and Maitland, using ballast wagons and 442 class locomotives. Each locomotive was required to accumulate 10,000 kilometres of trouble-free running before being accepted. The final unit was delivered from Broadmeadow in February 1998.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPacific National announced in September 2022 that the company had committed more than $160M AUD towards the overhauling of the company's NR class units.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1996 NR3 was involved in a fatal rail accident and was later re-numbered NR121, NR121 re-entered service in 2000. <br />\r\nIn 2019 NR80 was involved in a fatal rail accident and was later re-numbered NR122, NR122 re-entered service in 2021.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPacific National run the Indian Pacific passenger train as apart of a contract with Great Southern Railways (Now Journey Beyond)<br />\r\nNR25, NR26, NR27, NR28 were the first 4 selected units, Then NR18 was introduced in a yellow Mark 2 livery.
