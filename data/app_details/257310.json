{"about_the_game":"<strong>THE FAMOUS BEATBUDDY SOUNDTRACK FINALLY ARRIVES ON STEAM!</strong><br><br>The official Beatbuddy soundtrack features exclusive songs by artists like Austin Wintory, Parov Stelar, Sabrepulse, Ari Pulkinen and more. The crazy mix of tunes goes all the way from electro swing to old school 80's rock music. For the first time you can enjoy the songs from Beatbuddy in the original mixes of the artists. The soundtrack is based on the awarded STEAM game Beatbuddy. Developed by German game studio THREAKS, Beatbuddy is the first game in which players can enjoy music as an interactive playable remix. Each contributor to this soundtrack has a dedicated world in the game, in which each instrument of their song is visualized by individual game mechanics. Beatbuddy was a very exciting project booth for the developers and musician who contributed 10 exclusive songs to this album.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/257310/extras//BB_sound.jpg?t=1449252855\" /><br><br><strong>SOUNDTRACK INCLUDES</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>13 awesome songs from the award winning STEAM game Beatbuddy: Tale of the Guardians</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>PDF Booklet with background infos about the songs</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Podcasts with Angry Birds composer Ari Pulkkinen, French Horn Rebellion, Peter Cruseder and more...</li></ul><br>Additional MAKING OF infos can be found here directly from Grammy Nominee Austin Wintory in the famous THREAKS NEWS SHOW: <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/257310/extras//AustinTest_steam.jpg?t=1449252855\" /><br><br><strong>TRACK LISTING</strong><br><br>1\tBeatbuddy Swing - Parov Stelar\t<br>2\tGive a Damn- A.G.
