He was a wicked and an angry old man who used to pick fights and argue with the neighbours over little things. Nobody in that neighbourhood liked him because of his rude behavior.

One day, he jumped off the third floor of the building and died in the process. <br><br>Since he used to live alone in the house and had no legal heirs of the property, it was left vacant for years after his death.

The story was broadcasted in one of the news channels which picked the interest of many paranormal enthusiasts. <br><br>One of them was curious to find out if the property was really haunted and decided to visit the property during the night of the new moon. <br><br>You play as a paranormal enthusiast.
