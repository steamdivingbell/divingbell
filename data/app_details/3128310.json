{"about_the_game":"Modern Fear is a short first-person horror game. The main gameplay mechanic is exploration and some interactions with game objects, either to move through the levels or to understand the hidden plot of the game. The story of the game is not told explicitly; it is conveyed through symbolism in the environment, and it is up to the player to discover the meanings through the objects in the surroundings and the events in the different levels of the game. The player moves through the levels using an elevator mechanic. There are a total of 10 levels, which are very short and similar to each other, but with changes that immerse the player in the atmosphere of horror and the meanings of the game's plot. The player does not take damage, and there are no confrontations with enemies. The game is linear and essentially a walking simulator with some interactions with objects in the environment.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3128310/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1723446667","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3128310/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1723446667","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3128310/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1723446667","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3128310/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1723446667","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Modern Fear is a short first-person horror game.
