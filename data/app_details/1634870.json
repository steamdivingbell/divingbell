Fire, water, smoke and light beams are just a selection of the wonderful brushes you\u2019ll find. A large selection of environments will find you floating in space, creating costumes, or enjoying a snowy walk.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnything is possible in Open Brush. Transport yourself across the cosmos, or jump through the frames of famous portraits and see what lies beyond. The choice is yours.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOpen Brush is the community powered evolution of Tilt Brush from Google, originally developed by Skillman &amp; Hackett.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1634870/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735044808","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1634870/page.bg.jpg?t=1735044808","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1634870/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735044808","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1634870/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735044808","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Supported","id":53},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Open Brush allows you to paint in 3D space with XR.
