Use a radar to locate your escape route, but beware - it may reveal your presence to the relentless monster. Your flashlight can shroud you in darkness, rendering you invisible but blind. Use weapons to defend yourself, but be wary, not all your adversaries can die. However, make no mistake, you're most powerful weapons are your cunning and courage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor Desktop Players:<br />\r\nTake control of a fearsome monster with one goal: hunt down the VR player. Use your cunning and knowledge of the maze to track their every move. Time your attacks carefully to catch them off guard. You're most powerful weapon is fear, a panicked enemy makes sloppy, and sometimes fatal mistakes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEndless Thrills:<br />\r\nBetween randomly generated mazes and plans for additional levels and features in the future, Nightmare Labyrinth promises a constantly evolving, heart-pounding experience for both VR and desktop players.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDeveloper's note:<br />\r\nI'm a one man dev, so any and all feedback is greatly appreciated!
