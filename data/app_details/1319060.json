{"about_the_game":"Why I made this game:<br />\r\nI made this game for the players to enjoy some old school arcade shooter. Have friends to play with you and enjoy yourself.. no battle pass or anything crazy.. just enjoy yourselves and have fun!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat this game expresses:<br />\r\nI want Deadly Maze to help build friendships and make new ones with Co-op. Take your friends and put them in a 1v1 situation. Have a grudge with someone take them to in there and see how many times you can beat them. All in all... I hope everyone enjoys my game!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nContent:<br />\r\nWe got all kinds of modes: 1v1, 1v3, 2v2, cooperative and last team standing. For those who just want to play and have nobody to play with there is a singleplayer mode so you can train and learn the maps if you need to. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverview of the game:<br />\r\nIts a really simple arcade shooter. When I say simple.. I really mean simple... I wanted to focus on the gameplay over graphics. I am still new with this engine so I had to go back to old school gameplay so there is very little animation. I just want players to have fun playing this game and to meet new people.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1319060/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1618070553","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1319060/page.bg.jpg?t=1618070553","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1319060/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1618070553","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1319060/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1618070553","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Why I made this game:<br />\r\nI made this game for the players to enjoy some old school arcade shooter.
