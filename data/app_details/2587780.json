{"about_the_game":"Alien Wars tells the story of how you travel to a different world, where you need to gather your companions to survive and explore the mysteries of this world.<br />\r\ncard<br />\r\nCards are divided into hero cards and regular cards. At the beginning of each game, you can choose the hero card, which represents the character you play in this game, and each hero has different protagonist skills. The protagonist card can enhance attributes such as HP, hand count, and attack frequency. <br />\r\nRegular cards are the hands that you can use in each game, divided into character cards and strategy cards. Character cards represent the companions you gather, with attack and defense values, unique skills, and rarity levels of gray, green, blue, purple, and orange. Unlocked character cards can be upgraded to enhance attack and defense as well as skills. Strategy cards are various types of strategies that can be used in each game, such as obtaining hands, reducing enemy hands, dealing damage, and so on. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nbattle <br />\r\nAt the beginning of each game, hands are obtained based on the number of hands, and at each subsequent stage, hands are obtained based on the number of touches. The hand may be a character card or a strategy card. When all unlocked character cards are drawn, random sword and shield character cards will be drawn later, but with lower strength than the unlocked character cards. <br />\r\nBoth the enemy and us take turns in their actions, going through the stages of judgment, hand drawing, playing, and discard. Use character cards to inflict damage on the opponent, use strategy cards to consume the opponent's strength, and reduce the opponent's HP to 0 to win. <br />\r\nCharacter cards have attributes such as stone, scissors, paper, and regular. Stones, scissors, and paper are mutually reinforcing and restraining, and are neither restrained nor restrained by any attributes. In character card battles, not only should offensive and defensive values be considered, but also attribute restraint and character skill effects. <br />\r\nAfter winning, players will receive corresponding coins based on their performance in this game, which can be used to purchase more rewards. <br />\r\nAfter experiencing a certain number of levels, the protagonist successfully survives and unlocks the next hero cards. <br />\r\nAt the beginning, they often die, but after continuous battles to earn points, they unlock more companions, strengthen cards and skills, and ultimately achieve victory. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nevent <br />\r\nThe game time is divided into day and night. There are no combat events during the day, and you can choose to strengthen yourself, strengthen companions, increase character favorability, restore, shop and other events. Night is always a battle event, and each event has its own rewards, especially for obtaining skills and skill upgrades, which are only available at night. At night, there are elite levels where the number of enemies doubles, but the rewards also double. <br />\r\nGenerally, there is 5 opportunities to take action during the day, but randomly increasing the recovery power of actions can provide more opportunities for action during the day and gain stronger strength. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nskill <br />\r\nThere are about 100 skills in total, and the protagonist can obtain an unlimited number of skills, with dozens of skills available at the same time. Each skill can be upgraded to gain stronger abilities. Players can build different skill builds in each round to gain different experiences. Character cards also have a skill that can be upgraded.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2587780/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734999701","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2587780/page.bg.jpg?t=1734999701","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2587780/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734999701","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2587780/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734999701","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3222690,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Alien Wars tells the story of how you travel to a different world, where you need to gather your companions to survive and explore the mysteries of this world.<br />\r\ncard<br />\r\nCards are divided into hero cards and regular cards.
