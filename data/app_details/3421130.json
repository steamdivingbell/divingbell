{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Those Who Crawl VR is a standalone VR port of Those Who Crawl. Enter a tense horror experience where you crawl and climb through cave tunnels. Use the VR controllers to navigate the tunnels as they begin to tighten. Soon, you will find you are not alone.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The walls are closing in.</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you progress, the stone walls become flesh and bone. The water in flooded tunnels is now blood red. This would be a horrible place to die. Now in the darkness, you hear something moving ... something with many legs.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Cut the flesh.</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Utilize sharpened bone knives to cut away at the sinue and flesh that blocks your path. Stab them into the walls to make improvised handholds. Be careful, however, as the fragile bone will break after several uses, leaving you without a lifeline.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Things are moving in the dark.</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Creatures lurk deep within the tunnels. They are bigger than you and faster. You can't fight back. Your best bet is to run - or rather desperately crawl. You could try using your knives, but would that even work against these monsters?</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3421130/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737445298","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3421130/page.bg.jpg?t=1737445298","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3421130/b91220c797e82822d0dec162775480b94a2bd0c0/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737445298","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3421130/b91220c797e82822d0dec162775480b94a2bd0c0/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737445298","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Gore and Scary situations"},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Those Who Crawl VR is a standalone VR port of Those Who Crawl.
