There are no people in sight, yet an unsettling feeling of someone\u2014or something\u2014lurking in the shadows never leaves you. Your objective is simple yet daunting: escape the metro. However, every time you step through the exit, you find yourself back at the beginning, caught in a mysterious and never-ending loop.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3265490/extras/img-2.png?t=1730190764\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you explore the dim, unsettling tunnels, anomalies begin to reveal themselves\u2014subtle at first, like objects slightly out of place, but quickly escalating into something more sinister. These anomalies twist your perception of reality, constantly blurring the lines between the mundane and the horrifying. Even though the environment appears lifeless, it reacts to your actions, and each new loop reveals fresh, bizarre distortions of the familiar station.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3265490/extras/img-3.png?t=1730190764\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The further you progress, the more the anomalies intensify, and soon you're faced not only with unsettling dissonances but also terrifying beings that emerge from the shadows.
