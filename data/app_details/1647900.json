{"about_the_game":"Now, it\u2019s time to show the infected your new gear! Chain at least three hits with the new one-handed axe\u2014<strong>RGB AXE-Pad</strong>\u2014to apply shock damage! Or, if you\u2019d rather use something heavier, smash them with the Next-Gen Maul hammer. Use a charged attack to let its power flow through the circuit and shock your enemies. But sometimes it\u2019s better not to come too close, and for that, you\u2019ve got the <strong>LED Meta Bow</strong>. It glows, it shoots, and, most importantly, it keeps you away from the bloodthirsty monsters! But let\u2019s not forget about the pinnacle of your crafting skills! Some extra lights here and there, just a little bit of polishing, and your buggy has turned into this cool <strong>4wheelz ride</strong>!
