{"about_the_game":"Get Those Bugs is a wave based tower defense with roguelite elements where you command a small party of magic soldiers to defeat hordes of attacking bugs. Upgrade and play cards on your units to strategically react to an ever evolving threat. Unlock additional power through meta progression to enable stronger builds to take on more difficult challenges.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Artefacts</h2>Send your units into battle across a variety of maps each with their own artefacts to defend. These mysterious artefacts may exhibit properties or abilities that change up the strategy needed to clear the stage.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2379300/extras/artefacts_example.png?t=1719849586\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Bugs</h2>These angry little guys absolutely despise the artefacts and will stop at nothing to take them down. Each different bug exhibits properties that require tactics and planning ahead to work around and their rapid evolution makes them even more dangerous. With hundreds of bugs descending on the artefacts at a time,  your party of four has a lot to deal with. Get those bugs!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2379300/extras/bugs_example.png?t=1719849586\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unit Customization</h2>Your soldiers are at the heart of your strategy and are exceptionally versatile.
