{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition Chicago By Night</h2><strong> Mature Content Warning:</strong> contains graphic and written content of a mature nature, including violence, sexual themes, and strong language. Reader discretion is advised.    Accept no substitutes: Chicago is the city of vampires.    Claim a haven on the Gold Coast.    Carve a place of this bustling metropolis for yourself.   Subjugate a handful of the living on Michigan Avenue. Take a few deep drinks from some of the intoxicating vessels we have around here. \u00a0   Discover the nightlife. Come visit the Succubus Club, the Blue Velvet, or Red No\u00ba 5, if they\u2019ll let you in. The guest list is pretty damn exclusive.   Introduce yourself to the Ventrue Prince. Get to know his vision. Buy into it. Serve it. Stay on his good side and your immortality is going to be just fine.    Just ignore the purges of Anarchs, Thin-Bloods, and fledglings when it grows inconvenient, yeah? Stay invested in the Camarilla and it\u2019ll stay invested in you. Remember who\u2019s got your back and who can take that backing away in the blink of an undead eye.\u00a0    Don\u2019t go digging into business that doesn\u2019t concern you.\u00a0   Don\u2019t go wandering into territory you don\u2019t know, because someone will claim your skull as a trophy.  Don\u2019t screw with another Kindred\u2019s kine, or you\u2019ll find your own murdered and dropped in a dumpster, and that\u2019ll just be the start of your problems.  Chicago can be everything for a vampire like you.  You just have to accept Chicago into your heart.  Become a part of the city.
