{"about_the_game":"The Yamanote Line runs in a circle around the center of Tokyo for 34.5 km, taking 59 minutes, and is one of the major lines in the Tokyo metropolitan area, connecting huge terminal stations with world-class passengers. It runs parallel to the Keihin Tohoku Line between Shinagawa and Tabata stations, and the Saikyo Line and Shonan Shinjuku Line between Ikebukuro and Osaki stations. Since most of the line runs parallel to other lines, many different types of rolling stock can be seen. The Yamanote Line has few level crossings, with only one crossing, the &quot;Daini-Nakazato Level Crossing&quot; between Tabata and Komagome Stations, the only crossing on the Yamanote Line. The line is also characterized by its high frequency of service, with trains running every 3 to 4 minutes during the morning rush hour on weekdays, and every 5 minutes during the daytime on weekdays.
