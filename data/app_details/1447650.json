As an extremely accomplished and well-respected billionaire that made their fortune in the logistics and technology sectors, you\u2019re well aware of the potential benefits that a permanent presence in space can provide. After meeting with many world leaders for several months and pitching your ambitious ideas, government officials from the United States of America (USA), the Russian Federation, the European Union (EU), and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) all want to partner up with you in order to setup a government-industry venture in order to establish a group of orbital outposts in Earth and Lunar orbits.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1447650/extras/Region_Selection.png?t=1729453448\" /><br><br>Unfortunately, these four superpowers are not interested in working together! Will you partner with the US and receive a commercial goods transactions bonus and an extra influx of initial funds? Or maybe go with the European Union and receive a permanent bonus on propulsion and research points generation? The Russian Federation prepares their astronauts for maintenance duties a lot better than the rest of the regions, maybe that\u2019s the best option?

A typical month as a Director of this government-industry venture will find you ordering modules, arranging resupply spacecraft, training astronauts, acquiring technologies from a vast tech tree, and manufacturing commercial goods that can later be sold in a dynamic market, where prices fluctuate in real-time.<br><br>Once you\u2019ve established a solid presence in LEO, expand your footprint by opening further outposts in Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), High Earth Orbit (HEO) and the Moon.

The \u2018Free Builder\u2019 mode gives you a blank canvas with an extensive palette of modules that you can assemble as you see fit, whereas the Campaign/Sandbox modes provides the following options:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Choose between four unique regions to establish your company. Each one of them provides different bonuses and perks.<br></li><li>Setup your LEO station by choosing from three different Core Modules.<br></li><li>Purchase modules across a wide range of categories (electricity, cooling, structural, research, manufacturing, etc) and install them.<br></li><li>Manage the members of your astronaut corps, whose individual morale ratings are affected by the assignments they get and other external events.<br></li><li>Discover and unlock technologies from a complex tech tree which comprises over 60 technologies.<br></li><li>Order space station modules from different types of contractors featuring unique strong points.<br></li><li>Request and prepare resupply missions in order to bring consumables, raw materials and astronauts to the station.<br></li><li>Experience random events that affect different aspects of your company.<br></li><li>Play a minigame when launching resupply spacecraft.<br></li><li>Assign astronauts to maintenance duties in order to keep the station fully functional. Sometimes modules will break, though! So make sure you have enough crew members available to jump in for unexpected repairs.<br></li><li>Setup complex production lines in order to produce commercial goods, which can be sold back on Earth in a constantly evolving market.</li></ul><br>If you\u2019re new to the game, we recommend starting with the \u2018Campaign\u2019 mode, which provides a series of objectives that will progressively introduce you to the game\u2019s systems. Once you feel more comfortable, you can transition to the \u2018Sandbox\u2019 mode, which gives you a lot more flexibility.<br><br>The game also provides modding support, and we have made available a series of mods that illustrate how to either replace existing or add new astronauts, space station modules and resupply spacecraft. You\u2019ll definitely want to check our mods out if you\u2019d like to have access to realistic versions of Skylab, the Apollo CSM, and the Space Shuttle.<br><br>In addition to this, there\u2019s also a series of mechanics that have already been implemented, but that won\u2019t be available in the upcoming update. These are:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The ability to provide commercial services and lease your modules to private companies in order to bring much needed funds.<br></li><li>The option to develop Industrial R&amp;D technologies, which can be leased or sold to private entities.<br></li><li>The choice to expand into higher orbits such as Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) and High Earth Orbit (HEO). You will also be able to establish an orbital outpost in Lunar orbit!<br></li><li>The capacity to build and manage Earth facilities, which provide extra bonuses and the possibility of running Continuous Improvement Programs (CIPs).</li></ul><br>Planned features for the campaign mode include:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>An optional mini-game where you will manually pilot resupply spacecraft and guide them to the target docking port.<br></li><li>Deeper interactions with your astronauts.<br></li><li>Even More random events and emergent situations.</li></ul><br>Lastly, we\u2019re designing a massive list of Steam Achievements and coming up with loads of ideas for Steam Trading Cards!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1447650/extras/Release_Date.png?t=1729453448\" /><br><br>There\u2019s no planned final release date for Space Station Designer yet.
