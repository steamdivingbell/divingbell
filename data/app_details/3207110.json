Will they help her accomplish it no questions asked? Will they get into a whirlpool they can\u2019t get back from? Will she succeed in everything?! I need to know!  In my opinion, is quite refreshing to have these types of stories in the visual novel sphere catching more eyes as of late.  As you might have guessed, I\u2019ve already gone and backed the Kickstarter.
