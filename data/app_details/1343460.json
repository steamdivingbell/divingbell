Use stealth and assassinate or sneak past enemies to avoid risky encounters altogether.<br></li><li>Resource Management - Most of your combat and survival capabilities are dictated by what resources you find.

Make choices when being presented with new random traits to gain power and build interesting combinations. Modify your inventory with acquired accessories to further customize your character.<br></li><li>Permanent Death - If your character dies, they die for good. Choose a new, random adventurer and embark on a new adventure. Even if you don't manage to go far, your actions will have consequences that carry over to subsequent playthroughs.
