{"about_the_game":"Chaos Pattern is an online multiplayer cooperative action/strategy hybrid game where each player assumes the role of a Guardian who is schooled in the rescue, training, and care of a wide variety of companions that they affectionately call Monsters. Together the Guardian and their Monster work to free their world of a mysterious menace secretly tracking most aspects of their lives.<br><br>Chaos Pattern is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and is a blend of detailed 3D pixel art and modern rendering techniques, along with lots of things to blow up with dynamic destruction.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FEEL THE CHAOS</h2><br>The core of the game is fast-paced action as you control your Guardian, traversing the levels with your Monster and facing off against the Synthel.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2466640/extras/CP_500_Feel_The_Chaos.gif?t=1703126088\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CREATE A PATTERN</h2><br>You can also quickly lay down commands for your Monster to unleash their most potent abilities onto the battlefield.

Hovering over discovered enemies can give you more information about them, including their field of view, how they\u2019re powered, and any movement plans they\u2019ve made so far. Use this information to help craft your plans. For example, knocking out a power source may disable an enemy, but it can also render doors or respawn locations inoperable.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2466640/extras/CP_500_Discover_The_Battlefield.gif?t=1703126088\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES</h2><br>Sometimes even the most carefully laid plans can go awry when the action starts flowing!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2466640/extras/CP_500_LearnFromYourMistakes.gif?t=1703126088\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ADJUST YOUR PLANS</h2><br>Fortunately the Guardians have the ability to quickly replace their plans with a simple click on a location to move to, attack, or interact with.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2466640/extras/CP_500_AdjustInTheMoment.gif?t=1703126088\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BETTER WITH FRIENDS</h2><br>As with many of our favorite games, they\u2019re always more fun with friends!

On the rare occasion when a world discovers they are being manipulated, the planet is slated for a \u201cReset\u201d, the total wiping of the existing life-forms so the Synthel can start over.
