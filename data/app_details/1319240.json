{"about_the_game":"Your infiltration team has been tasked with completing a series of missions to stop an army of lunar-bots from crashing our moon into the Earth! The field operative will wield the VR headset, sneaking through each lunar-outpost avoiding the mechanical guards. In this, they will be assisted by their team of hackers, who will guide the field operative and <strong>use their smartphones</strong> to help clear obstacles and disrupt the enemy. So gather a group of friends, strap on your VR headset and commence &quot;Operation Armstrong&quot;!<br><br>This VR-Stealth-Party game features the following:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A series of hand crafted interactable VR environments<br></li><li>Phone browser connectivity for cross platform local co-op with no player limit<br></li><li>Dynamic, drop-in/drop-out co-op gameplay<br></li><li>Level scoreboards and completion awards<br></li><li>A level editor and online level sharing platform (Coming soon!)</li></ul><br>We made the game with the intention of providing a fun way for those spectating a VR user to join in on the action instead of just waiting for their turn.
