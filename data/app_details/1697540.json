The intentions of a number of countries could not overcome excessive emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere on a planetary scale. The increase in the Earth's population led to an increase in its needs. The amount of emissions from factories, cars, landfills and local wars increased.<br><br>Global warming has reached its peak and has led to food shortages due to abnormal heat. Water and food were burned out by the heated atmosphere, later it became possible to grow something only in underground plantations. Therefore, people began to fight for a place under the sun. Local conflicts grew into global ones.<br><br>The population of the Earth began to decrease rapidly, so various countries built &quot;Super fortresses&quot; - gigantic structures that penetrated deep into the earth. And in order to control the region, automatic turrets were placed that could autonomously carry out shifts even without people.<br><br>In the end, the last global conflict with the use of nuclear weapons began, which led to the nuclear winter. This caused the planetary temperature to drop. And following the temperature, the population of humans as a species also decreased. Almost 85% of the potential was lost. All those who did not have shelters died immediately or after some time.<br><br>Despite the fact that almost all remnants of humanity were exterminated, the war continued.

Huge regions of the planet were mined, polluted and filled with a large number of defense complexes.<br><br>But after tens of years, it is time to come to the surface and build a new life.
