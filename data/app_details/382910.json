{"about_the_game":"WOOD ELVES race comes with its own unique AI and players (Passers, Wardancers, catchers, linemen and the Treeman) but also their own star players: Dolfar Longstride and Jordell Freshbreeze!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nElves are amazingly agile and almost as fast as Skaven. Avoiding other's tackles is a pure formality for them. Especially for the Wardancers whose ability to go through opposing defenses is nearly outmatched. Elves are excellent passers and catchers. Their game could become a true nightmare for other teams not as agile and fast as they are.<br />\r\nThe Treeman is probably the strongest player in the whole of Blood Bowl. He's gifted with an extraordinary natural strength against which very few players can compete. However, the Treeman is extremely slow and has a bad tendency of taking root in the middle of the field. If that happens, he won't be able to move...at all.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/382910/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1640279797","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/382910/page.bg.jpg?t=1640279797","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/382910/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1640279797","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/382910/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1640279797","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"WOOD ELVES race comes with its own unique AI and players (Passers, Wardancers, catchers, linemen and the Treeman) but also their own star players: Dolfar Longstride and Jordell Freshbreeze!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nElves are amazingly agile and almost as fast as Skaven.
