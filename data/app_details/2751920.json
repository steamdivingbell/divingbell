{"about_the_game":"In the near future, a mysterious and advanced district, codenamed &quot;Genesis,&quot; becomes the epicenter of a covert genetic experiment gone awry. Players take on the role of Levi, a skilled special operations soldier, assigned to uncover the truth behind the chaos that has engulfed Genesis. The H.O.P.E. (Hostile Opposition Prevention and Elimination) team, tasked with maintaining order and ensuring the success of the experiment, has gone dark, and Levi is sent in to investigate the growing threat. As Levi navigates the desolate streets of Genesis, he discovers a city in the grip of an insidious mutation. The once-thriving metropolis now teems with grotesque creatures, mutated by an unknown <br />\r\nforce that has corrupted the very genetic fabric of the district. Levi's mission is to piece together the events leading to this catastrophe, unveil the truth behind the redacted genome experiments, and neutralize the mutated threats that now roam freely. Redacted Genome combines intense third-person or first-person action with an immersive narrative, challenging players to adapt their strategies as they face ever-evolving mutations. Levi, equipped with advanced military gear and cutting-edge weaponry, must use his combat prowess and intelligence to survive encounters with the mutated horrors and uncover the secrets hidden within the city. Throughout the game, Levi will encounter remnants of the H.O.P.E. team, discovering audio logs and scattered documents that gradually reveal the scope of the genetic experiment. As the story unfolds, Levi must make critical decisions that impact the fate of Genesis and the people involved in the ill-fated project. Redacted Genome's atmospheric and haunting soundtrack sets the tone for the unraveling mystery, creating a sense of tension and urgency. The game's visuals showcase the contrast between the once gleaming utopia of Genesis and the nightmarish reality that has taken its place.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2751920/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1706041102","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2751920/page.bg.jpg?t=1706041102","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2751920/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1706041102","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2751920/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1706041102","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"This game contains depictions of suicide, gore, and various other elements visualized in a warzone."},"detailed_description":"In the near future, a mysterious and advanced district, codenamed &quot;Genesis,&quot; becomes the epicenter of a covert genetic experiment gone awry.
