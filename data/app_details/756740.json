{"about_the_game":"Man of Honor is a mafia themed top down shooter / character study where you control Emilio Gallo, an ex-mafioso, as he fights to get revenge on his former friends in the waning  rust belt city of Ferrousburgh. Gallo's pride is his life-force, so keep him strong by stylishly killing gangsters and drinking beer. The better you play, the stronger you become, as raising your score multiplier increases the size and power of your bullets and the strength of your fists. Increase your score to unlock different suits that feed your narcissism and change the way you play. Experience your fifteen minutes of fame and read the fantastical headlines that Gallo sees only in his mind. The whole city\u2019s watching you, so keep it classy.<br><br>Features:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>You\u2019re only as strong as you feel.
