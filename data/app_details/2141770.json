{"about_the_game":"URBO offers you the opportunity to build towns on countless floating islands. Become a visionary architect and watch small houses grow into bigger ones, then bigger ones into even more, slowly filling the untouched soil of your town. When you run out of space on one island, a new one will appear, followed by another, and so on until you complete the level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">IMMERSION AWAITS</h2><br>Dive into the inimitable ambience of URBO, where landscapes delight the eye and puzzles evoke memories of mathematically precise riddles from ancient legends. You shall create cities that can only be seen in dreams. Dreams to be remembered and to which you'd wish to return. URBO is a unique mixture of visual minimalism, relaxing music, smooth animations, meditative game tempo, and puzzles that impress with their elegant solutions.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2141770/extras/r11.gif?t=1715622580\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">VARIETY AWAITS</h2><br>URBO invites you to visit myriad worlds and secret places.

The peaceful quarters of a small fishing village nestled on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. Or fantastical islands with mythical artifacts in the middle of the vast ocean. URBO is where dreams of distant places come true. You shall see many worlds, existing ones, lost ones, and these that are yet to be found.

Under the disguise of simplicity lie challenges that require concentration. The challenges that generously reward an attentive player. URBO is designed so that its nature is clear at first glance.
