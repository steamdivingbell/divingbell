{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Conjunctivitalizer takes a mallet and smashes all expectations of what traditional 2D shooters should be like. Take the role of the Conjunctivitalizer (&quot;Liza&quot; for short) and set out to remind humanity of the true meaning of creativity.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In addition to a standard and wide shot, the player is equipped with a sword, but this sword isn't used to defeat enemies melee style. Instead, it has different effects on enemy bullets depending on their color. Blue bullets can be reflected back for added damage, yellow bullets can be absorbed into your conjunctivitality meter, and red bullets - run like hell.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In a bizarre twist, there are no weapon or powerup items. Your weapon will increase in power at certain score milestones, and enemies will only leave behind point items if you kill them with reflected bullets or the conjunctivitality beam (which can be used once your meter is full). This allows players to choose their own play style; you can play it safe and just shoot everything down, or you can master the sword and go for the high score while powering up your weapon as quickly as possible.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Not only does Conjunctivitalizer offer a completely fresh method of gameplay and scoring, but it's also filled with bizarre and zany enemies. Fruit bowl spaceships, dango mochi birds, flying cacti and gazelles riding tractors are just a fraction of the characters you'll encounter. Still not enough? Conjunctivitalizer features an OST by game music legend Yamanaka Toshiya, whose previous works include Star Cruiser, Bakuretsu Muteki Bangaioh, and Sin &amp; Punishment.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With multiple difficulty levels and endings, secret characters, and near infinite scoring strategies, this is a shooter that finally breaks the bullet hell mold and truly attempts something new.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3343600/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731628801","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3343600/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1731628801","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3343600/f8d6cf382af8de936ff4644478f2cfe6a1457d99/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731628801","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3343600/f8d6cf382af8de936ff4644478f2cfe6a1457d99/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731628801","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Conjunctivitalizer takes a mallet and smashes all expectations of what traditional 2D shooters should be like.
