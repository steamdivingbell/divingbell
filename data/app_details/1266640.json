Play the Axis forces to conquer the most valuable prize of all: the Suez Canal. Or command the 8th Army soldiers, the famous Desert Rats, to repel the invaders. <br><br><strong>Afrika Korps</strong> contains many scenarios, covering different periods of the war in the North African desert in Libya and Egypt, from 1940 to late 1942.  Small scenarios cover the famous battles of the Crusader or BattleAxe operations, or the fight for El Alamein campaign. Medium size campaigns deal with the 1940 Italian \u2018Operazione E\u2019, the failed invasion of Egypt and the O\u2019Connor counter-offensive. Or a second one with a campaign start in the Spring 1941 when the Afrika Korps first arrives, while the third covers the war from 1942 onwards.
