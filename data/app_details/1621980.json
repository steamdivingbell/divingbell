real-time single-player strategy about <strong>genes and animal species.</strong> Animals are behaving the way they would in nature, but you can indirectly control them and mutate them to achieve various goals.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Highlights</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Evolve: update genes to change behavior of your species<br></li><li> Eat: animals need to eat food to survive, define what food they can eat<br></li><li> Reproduce: increase your population, improve fertility, prolong your life, hide better from predators, too high population leads to diseases<br></li><li> Expand: expand your territories, migrate to new territories to increase your population further<br></li><li> Fight: fight species that stands in your way<br></li><li> Play for more than 40 species and mutate them or define your own species<br></li><li> Play on 3 different biomes with more than 80 different genes<br></li><li> Play 12 maps in 3 different modes - standard, custom, creative</li></ul><h2

disease, or die by old age.<br></li><li> You are evaluating your surroundings and the ecosystem to determine your next steps.<br></li><li> Species react indirectly to your commands if certain
