{"about_the_game":"Spurdo :D features multiple, unique micro-stories that all revolve around a singular story line.

In essence, each of the worlds you visit, acts as it's own separate game, yet tied to the overarching story.  Most of your time spent in these memories specifically revolve around your last moments in those worlds, leading up to your inevitable death in them.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/955200/extras/Gif_3_Spurdo.gif?t=1710545793\" /><br><br>Spurdo :D features a variety of freedoms to the player, such as:<br><br>-Quick save states, allowing the player to save at nearly any point, and load up at that point.<br>-Freedom to decide the fate of the other characters in the worlds by letting them live or not.<br>-Explore the world, or rush to the end.
