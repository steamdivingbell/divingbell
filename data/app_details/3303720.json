This convergence gave rise to diverse archetypes that quickly adapted to &quot;life&quot; on the <strong>Motherboard</strong>: mysterious <strong>SANDBAGS</strong>, <strong>ARMORER</strong> guardians, enigmatic <strong>MAGICIAN</strong> scholars, tribal <strong>RANGER</strong> adventurers, majestic <strong>DRAGONS</strong>, carefree <strong>UNDEAD</strong>, and many more.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The lore of Dataclysm is explored through individual cards, each ready to tell its own story through the descriptions that players can read in-game via the almanac.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Gameplay Overview</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Dataclysm, players will take on the role of skilled commanders tasked with leading their troops into battle to defeat enemy armies and ultimately the leader commanding those forces.
