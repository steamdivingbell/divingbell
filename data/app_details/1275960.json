I hope that although it's somatosensory game, I still hope to ensure that it has content at least first. After all, the operation of sense of body game is not as convenient and arbitrary as clicking on the screen with the mouse, so the creation space is not so free. At present, the way of browsing the plot dialogue is only to use the virtual button, which takes a lot of time.Therefore, we should first explore the agile and flexible space interaction mode, and then gradually fill in the richness of the game.<br>- In addition to browsing the plot, the virtual button set in the game also provides a specific page scanning display return button, which is not only designed to facilitate the return and re selection of interactive items, but also because the current stage of somatosensory recognition inevitably has misjudgment. In the game, there is a mechanism to intelligently adjust the position of interactive scenes according to the height, weight and position of the experiencer, such as If the interaction of scene position is uncomfortable due to the misjudgment of the standing position of the person, it also prevents the automatic click due to the misjudgment of the position of the hand, the return button is displayed by scanning the page to confirm that the player has the intention to return subjectively.<br>- To sum up, I am also actively reforming the internal implementation mode as much as possible, but that's a &quot;ten-year strategy&quot; that can't be achieved overnight, so it's inevitable that there are accidents that need to be manually corrected and avoided by players.
