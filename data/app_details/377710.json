{"about_the_game":"Matsushima Michiru is a loved, respected, nationally-famous idol, worthy of singing on the same stage as the legendary Kazami Kazuki... in her own dreams, at least. In reality, she's a complete nobody, only able to perform in a dingy basement bar on the weekends for crowds numbering in the single digits.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne night, while sulking about the real world's inability to live up to her fantasies, Michiru sees a shining star falling from the sky. She tries to use it to wish for the fame and admiration she's always dreamed of, but what crashes down on her is not the glamorous life of a Top Idol, but rather a black cat from the World of Magic, Nyanmel. Nyanmel's request: &quot;Become a Magical Girl, and save the world!&quot; But can Michiru really handle that kind of responsibility?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis visual novel, a spinoff of the popular &quot;Fruit of Grisaia&quot; series, follows Michiru's adventures in an anime-like format of 13 episodes. It is split into two Parts: Part 1 contains the first 7 episodes.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/377710/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737084341","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/377710/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1737084341","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/377710/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737084341","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/377710/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737084341","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Matsushima Michiru is a loved, respected, nationally-famous idol, worthy of singing on the same stage as the legendary Kazami Kazuki... in her own dreams, at least.
