The game was supported for many years with 6 full brand new sets of cards being released over time. However, the developers Lightmare Studios were a very small, young studio. There were a lot of industry-standard practices that the team just didn\u2019t know about. Zero comments were left on the code, little to no documentation on coding standards was made, and each and every card was hard coded with its effects, creating massive amounts of redundancy, and what experts would refer to as \u201cspaghetti code\u201d. This led to increasingly severe technical difficulties, and the team was tunnel visioned on chasing features and new set releases, exacerbating problems.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With no way to fix the problem, we signed our game over to our Publisher to let them handle it, however, the problems were much too severe to be fixed even by them, and even small bug fixes became monumental tasks. It wasn\u2019t long before the game was left as it was, with the servers being hosted, but no significant support. And in 2019, Lightmare took back the servers to prevent them from being shut down. Despite the game significantly draining resources, it was kept online for a further year as a service to the few players who remained, before we finally had to put the servers on ice.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Shortly after, we finally broke the news that we were working on Infinity Wars Classic - a technical remaster built from the ground up using the Infinity Card Engine (born through Infinity Heroes\u2019 early development) to be a much more technically functional version of the game our fans had enjoyed playing for years. In October 2020, we released our Pre-alpha version 0.01 of IWC, which featured only 49 cards. As of September 2022, we\u2019re now in public free access, but still in active development towards a fully remastered product, and currently has all Infinity Wars 1 cards (not including 3rd party ones) and the first 60 from the upcoming Intrigue set, due for release on the 10th of September 2022. It features a brand new deckbuilder, and in the backend a module-based card creation system, allowing for far more frequent content. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We want to do right by our oldest players, so one of the biggest things I want to highlight is that players from Infinity Wars 1\u2019s time can import their IW1 collections into IWC. That means your old collections you spent time and money on are going to be yours eventually. This is currently available in game, and you can make the request from the profile page. Using the same email as your Infinity Wars 1 account will minimise wait time on porting your collection over.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/257730/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727034163","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/257730/page.bg.jpg?t=1727034163","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/257730/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727034163","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/257730/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727034163","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/257730/extras/IWC_Cardspread_-_600_Steam.gif?t=1727034163\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Infinity Wars is a unique trading card game</strong> that blends rich lore and artwork with innovative gameplay mechanics that are both simple to learn and hard to master.
