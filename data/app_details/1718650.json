{"about_the_game":"This is a detective story in VR, a documentary investigation, brought to you by Rossiya Segodnya. Your goal is to find and collect evidence to prove that the key Nazi criminals and the leaders of the Third Reich are guilty. Today, less than 50% of young people are familiar with the<br />\r\n historic Nuremberg trial, its process and results (according to a survey conducted by the \u201cNuremberg: Casus Pacis\u201d project). The charges and verdicts brought forward by the Nuremberg tribunal, its fairness or even necessity are often questioned. This happens<br />\r\n out of ignorance or under pressure from those who benefit from distorting the historical facts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour virtual journey begins in the Spandau Prison dining area recreated from one of the legendary post-war photos. Here, you are met by serenely dining Nuremberg defendants \u2013 G\u00f6ring, D\u00f6nitz, Rosenberg, von Ribbentrop and von Schirach. By touching each of them, you can  travel back to<br />\r\n these Nazi criminals\u2019 past. Your task is to find evidence of their terrible crimes against humanity in \u2013 seemingly \u2013 an ordinary and peaceful environment. As you gather more pieces of evidence, you put together a convincing dossier, akin to those ones that<br />\r\n the 1946 Nuremberg verdict was based on. Thus you will restore the historical truth.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Ghosts of the past","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1718650/10059f8a7f7f976310376447cab4db05d5e5d8dd.jpg"},{"name":"Flame of Nazism","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1718650/e2101dc70d8dbfb3eaecb51c3396a38c01b01c65.jpg"},{"name":"Interim head","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1718650/050341b49a877c56ea8aba72405b26d5fd078ede.jpg"},{"name":"Departure","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1718650/3021ceb7b3b34225f398e8818824f568e2d665e9.jpg"},{"name":"Death march","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1718650/5b95ad048d8751a534e3c8a5ad7a1edf55e3bea1.jpg"},{"name":"Lord of the Flies","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1718650/52553817be66a6e6bc9505559f4ef19ee05e76fc.jpg"},{"name":"Hunger breaks stone walls","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1718650/63c167f096d2989a0ea7656e387a2de823487c26.jpg"},{"name":"Thank you for smoking!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1718650/a21ad7ef9d29ba316fa742895787fcc781b11d1a.jpg"},{"name":"First clues","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1718650/0c715b63a3d7beb0fef8c86d7a08e85a8041e8dd.jpg"},{"name":"Now you know enough","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1718650/afa5aa04495030a8102f2a8846321a6a1887edc1.jpg"}],"total":13},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1718650/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1644495118","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1718650/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1644495118","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1718650/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1644495118","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1718650/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1644495118","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This is a detective story in VR, a documentary investigation, brought to you by Rossiya Segodnya.
