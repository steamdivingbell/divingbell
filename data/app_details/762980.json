Every weapon is also entirely physics-driven, from the recoil and rate of fire, to the projectile types. Weapons also have many different combinations, such as clips, barrel attachments, silencers, and more!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/762980/extras/Hazardous_Environments_2018.png?t=1737323783\" /><br>The hazardous environments featured in Chaotic Void are what make each round so intense!
