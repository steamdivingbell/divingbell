{"about_the_game":"Earthworm Jim, spineless superhero, wriggles back into action as the Groovy Guardian of Goodness in an incredible journey of cheese-curdling proportions. Left unconscious by a massive cow-induced blow to the head and clad in his indestructible, high-tech super suit, Earthworm Jim continues the battle for truth, justice and well aerated soil. He sure is going to need your help to guide him through his 3D fun-house of a brain. <br>\t\t\t\t\tBut beware, the is an evil lurking, a presence in his mind, a dark unseen force at work - Jim's brain is a dangerous place! <br>\t\t\t\t\tIn the game you can enter Jim's psyche where he comes face to face with his own fears, happiness, memories and fantasies. Each environment has games-within-games, ludicrously large levels where you go wild pig-sliding, grandma wrangling and much more. You will face the weird enemies like Psycrow or the Disco Zombies.
