Having worked on many of the core features of the Formula 1 franchise from 2010 to 2015 (2011 to 2015 releases) he decided that he wanted to make a game that harked back to the old school dungeon crawlers of the 1980's and 90's. Jason began working on Dead of Day in his spare time and with a small amount of match funding from Creative England, he was able to enlist the help of a team of talented artists from Indonesia.... and so Dead of Day was born. It's been a long road and a long process, but finally we are ready to get Dead of Day into Early Access. Not only will this allow us to start getting feedback from users but also provide as the ultimate method of encouragement to finally commit to getting the game released. Time working on AAA games and living life has meant he has procrastinated long enough, now its time to finally get the game made!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/543480/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1707651651","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/543480/page.bg.jpg?t=1707651651","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/543480/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1707651651","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/543480/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1707651651","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Game features the \"Living Dead\" Zombies and has depictions of blood, mutilated body parts.
