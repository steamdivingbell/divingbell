In it I've put the best meditation techniques I've been taught and some discovered on my own. It's like a gym with various machines, but for your mind. Just like a gym I've designed it to be as pleasant and as efficient as possible.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">It's just a part of the answer</h2>It's not a miracle cure or &quot;a fast way to reach Nirvana in just 10 minutes&quot;. It's there to help you but it won't do your work for you. It will however make the practice of meditation easier and more pleasant!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TO BE HUMAN IS TO SUFFER.</h2>Suffering comes in many forms but <strong><u>mental suffering</u></strong> is the most widespread. Depression, Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Worry, Grief, a huge amount of mental illnesses (OCD, ADHD, Bipolar Disorder, Psychoses, etc).<br><br>Meditation and other mindfulness techniques can and will reduce the amount of mental suffering. These techniques, once learned, will stay with you forever. They will help you enjoy a more <u><strong>peaceful and happier life.</strong></u><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gamitate is designed to help you in 2 ways:</h2><br>1) Teach you as many techniques as possible in an easy and FUN way. <br>2) Provide you with a pleasant environment to practice various meditation and mindfulness techniques.\u00a0<br><br>The techniques taught in this game come from a variety of sources: personal experiences, books, articles, etc. Some of them will work better for you than others. We\u2019re all cut from a different cloth so it\u2019s perfectly normal.\u00a0<br><br>You don\u2019t need to \u201cmaster\u201d each and every meditation technique. Just go through them all and stick with the ones that work best in your specific case.\u00a0<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Note:</h2><br>Meditation doesn\u2019t replace medication and therapy.\u00a0<br>If you suffer from a mental illness visit a mental health specialist, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist. <strong>Don\u2019t stop taking your prescribed medication</strong> unless your doctor tells you to.\u00a0<br><br>It may be tempting to try to \u201ccure yourself\u201d through meditation but it\u2019s always a bad idea, especially if you suffer from a serious mental disorder.\u00a0<br><br>Please be aware that there are a handful of articles and studies\u00a0which say that for a small number of people meditation may be harmful. If you experience negative side effects from meditation please STOP immediately.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1370970/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1680253198","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1370970/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1680253198","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1370970/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1680253198","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1370970/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1680253198","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":1637620,"description":"Gamitate Full Trial"}],"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1370970/extras/buddha1.png?t=1680253198\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Easily improve your mental well being</h2>Enjoy the benefits of healthy meditation practices in this unique game!
