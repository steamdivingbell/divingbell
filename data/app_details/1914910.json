You have a regenerating paint tank that you can use to paint the road and launch yourself forward! Keep your future laps in mind as you strategize where you want to spend your boost paint. Do you put it in the middle road on the racing line for maximum speed, or do you put it off to the side where other racers are less likely to paint over it with their colors? The paint adds a level of strategy to an already chaotic game.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1914910/extras/Button_NaturallyMultiplayer.jpg?t=1720807572\" /><br>Enjoy a fun and smooth gameplay experience in local split/screen, online with friends, with strangers, or all three at once!
