{"about_the_game":"Get Stuffed! is a chaotic, top-down \u201ccapture-the-flag\u201d-esque party game for 2-4 players. Each player takes on the role of a sentient stuffed animal, who must try to wake their young owner after they become trapped in dream limbo!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo wake them up, you\u2019ll need to grab the alarm clock from the centre of the dreamspace and bring it back to them. But first, you\u2019ll need to construct the dream itself. Create a path to the alarm clock by placing tiles onto the grid, and then avoid the obstacles and ghosts along the way. Be careful though! Rooms only last for so long, and if any toy places a tile of the same shape over an existing room, it will cause the room to collapse, even if you\u2019re still inside!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlongside the alarm clock, there are rooms containing power-ups, such as a boost in speed, a protective shield, or even the ability to swap with someone else in the dream. Once you have the alarm clock, you\u2019ll need to defend it until your friend wakes up. Keep other toys away by hurling buttons at them. Hold to charge up and do more damage!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRemember: Only one child can escape the nightmare, so if another toy gets the alarm clock, be sure to use your tiles to create nightmarish ghosts nearby for them to have to deal with!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This game ONLY supports ONLINE multiplayer -- NOT local.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFEATURES<br />\r\n\u2022\tChaotic, Fast-Paced Competitive Gameplay<br />\r\n\u2022\t4 Playable Characters<br />\r\n\u2022\tOver 75 Available Tiles<br />\r\n\u2022\tA Variety of Unique Power-Ups<br />\r\n\u2022\tBrowsable, Easy to Use Lobby System<br />\r\n\u2022\tUpbeat, Energetic Soundtrack","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1704070/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1663352174","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1704070/page.bg.jpg?t=1663352174","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1704070/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1663352174","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1704070/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1663352174","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Get Stuffed! is a chaotic, top-down \u201ccapture-the-flag\u201d-esque party game for 2-4 players.
