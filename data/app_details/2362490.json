Merciless aggression is the key; with defeating enemies being the only way to restore precious health, or, in Mokou's case, pain tolerance. Inspired by a deep love for both the Touhou Project and games like Hollow Knight and DOOM, Fujiwara Phoenix is a relentless, fast-paced platformer that pushes the boundaries of the metroidvania genre.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2362490/extras/combat.gif?t=1710286543\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay Mechanics</h2><br>A metroidvania platformer, Fujiwara Phoenix has a strong focus on combat and exploration. Make your way through different screens in each stage, fighting a variety of enemies and collecting various pickups like coins and ability-modifying equipment items. While there is a healthy amount of backtracking and secret stuff to find, Fujiwara Phoenix places a strong focus on combat with our DOOM and ULTRAKILL inspired health/mana system. <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2362490/extras/orbshot.gif?t=1710286543\" /><br>Rather than mana, spend your own hit points to cast spells and recover them in the only way Mokou knows how, burning her enemies to a crisp. Mokou is totally invincible, but that doesn't mean she can't feel pain. She uses this to her advantage with reckless fire magic that she can heal any burns from, but beware her limited pain tolerance. Once it runs out, she will pass out from exhaustion and you'll be sent back to a checkpoint. <br><br>We couldn't call ourselves a Touhou fan game without a healthy dose of bullet hell, and you'll get to experience weaving through waves of bullets in a whole new light with a platformer moveset.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2362490/extras/keinecombo.gif?t=1710286543\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2>Fujiwara no Mokou wakes up one day to discover she has lost all of her magical power. While attempting to recover it, she is contacted by a mysterious figure who gives her a lead on how she might finally kill her archrival, Kaguya Houraisan, once and for all, ending their thousand-year feud and breaking the tedious cycle they've become trapped in. Fired up with a renewed sense of purpose and aided by her disapproving best friend, Keine, Mokou sets out to recover her magic and obtain the power she needs to confront Kaguya for the final time. Her only lead? Seek the Gap Youkai in the Netherworld...<br><br>But is this what she really wants? And can she trust the word of this mysterious figure?
