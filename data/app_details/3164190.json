Kyoukai is designed to be printed as a traditional TCG, has no mana resource, and and no AI of any kind.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3164190/extras/Banner1.png?t=1738680602\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You are an Entrant in a fighting tournament, run by the mysterious Carnation Society. Called through the Gate into a mysterious new world, you build a deck of 40 Cards (or Gates), and up to 15 Spirits, and battle other Entrants in various online lobbies! You can also learn more about the lore and world of Kyoukai through single player visual novels.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3164190/extras/Banner4.png?t=1738680602\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Unique diagonal Gates are played on a diamond 5x5 grid, and familiar mechanics lie at the heart of fast-paced TCG card battles. Each turn, each of your Units has a standard action - they can first move, then either Attack or use their Skill. You can also build your field presence by Opening Gates from your hand - but you can only Open them next to your Ready Gates already on the field. Use your on-field Units, and Normal and Fast Gates from your hand, to approach your opponent's Entrant and deal 20 damage to them!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3164190/extras/Banner3.png?t=1738680602\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Choose from 5 Entrants, each with their own unique card pool and deck types!
