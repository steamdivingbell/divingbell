{"about_the_game":"You find yourself alone on a remote research outpost in the Polaris system. Something has gone terribly wrong. Much of the base is lacking power and your co-workers are mysteriously missing. Your resources are dwindling, so you'll need to secure more food, water, and power, but this involves venturing away from the security of your home base. There are deadly threats lurking in this outpost and it will take all of your cunning to keep from becoming another victim. Equipped with various items to track, deter, and trick your adversaries, there is a chance you can outwit your opponents. However, you'll need to keep a close eye on your stats, as it's all too easy to get dehydrated or lose your sanity to the extreme stress of these circumstances.<br><br>You will need to explore deep into hostile territory to find a way to escape this outpost. A distress signal may take too long, so maybe you can get the escape shuttle up and running instead. Or maybe there is a way to actually defeat your adversaries. One thing is for certain, this won't be easy. They are becoming more intelligent by the minute, and adapting to resist your weapons. You'll need to find more powerful equipment and build up your base if you expect to stand a chance. Secured areas provide safety and other benefits, but unexplored areas contain additional threats such as oxygen leaks and radiation poisoning. Can you survive Polaris Outpost?<br><br>Polaris Outpost is a survival game with intelligent adversaries in a hostile sci-fi environment. It involves both planning ahead and thinking on your feet in order to survive. The gameplay is often tense and frightening as you try to out maneuver and outsmart your deadly opponents in a variety of atmospheric environments. However, your base can provide a reprieve from the action and it's resources can give you the upper hand in the battle to survive. The game becomes progressively more open-ended after introducing some core mechanics, giving you a chance to make your own decisions.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2209080/extras/Vertical_No_text.png?t=1732084798\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2209080/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732084798","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2209080/page.bg.jpg?t=1732084798","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2209080/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732084798","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2209080/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732084798","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2213970,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"You find yourself alone on a remote research outpost in the Polaris system.
