{"about_the_game":"Block Tower: Prologue is only part of the gameplay that awaits you in the full game.

This aspect becomes even more valuable in Block Tower: you can build towers on high ground, leave free blocks for resource extraction or later strong towers. In addition, all towers have an experience bar, the earlier you build it, the stronger it will be in the late game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CHOOSE UPGRADES</h2>The order in which upgrades are chosen in each game is very important. You can choose resource-based upgrades, magic tower upgrades, or upgrades for strong early defense, which will allow you to safely move into the late game. Combined with randomly generated blocks, this gives infinite replay value.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">RESOURCE MINING</h2>Think over your economic strategy. Early construction of economic buildings is risky, but gives a big boost in the late game. The random location of resources in each game sets new strategic questions that you will have to answer each time.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2427280/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1687430256","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2427280/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1687430256","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2427280/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1687430256","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2427280/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1687430256","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Full Game</h1><p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Block Tower: Prologue is only part of the gameplay that awaits you in the full game.
