{"about_the_game":"Elyrion is Polytopia\u2019s second Special Tribe! Emerging from isolation in a mystical forest, the Elyrion will stop at nothing to uncover the magical secrets of the Square. The Elryion are known for surrounding themselves in the magic of the forests, using their powers to lure woodland denizens to their Sanctuaries for profit, bargain with awesome dragons, and enchant animals into soldiers to help them fight.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnlike the other tribes, the Elyrion have a unique style of gameplay. First, the Elyrion get markers in the Fog of War showing where ruins are, meaning they don\u2019t need to scout as much for them. Also, the Elyrion consider nature divine, and their worship of nature prevents them from deforestation for a quick profit or hunting animals for food. Instead, the Elyrion can build Sanctuaries, which will provide resources based on the amount of adjacent animals. The Elyrion are also unable to harvest whales for resources, and instead will use their magic to transform them into the fearsome Navalon, which can obliterate a navy single handedly! In addition to whales, the Elyrion can enchant animals in their territory into Polytaurs, which can be used to supplement an army or work as part of an early game rush. Lastly, the Elyrion don\u2019t get Giants, but get flying Dragons, instead, which must grow up from an egg before they can be used.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nElyrion Features:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Live in harmony with nature through the magic of the Elyrion!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Pinpoint ancient Ruins through the Fog of War!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Build magical Sanctuaries to attract both animals and a profit!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Enchant animals into fearsome Polytaurs!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Train whales into mighty ship-eating Navalons!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Gain an inability to chop forests!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Hire awesome dragons to burn your foes to a crisp!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you like tribes that are against the grain from what you\u2019re used to, or you simply want to fly on the back of a majestic Fire Dragon, then the Elyrion are the tribe for you!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/982201/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724051071","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/982201/page.bg.jpg?t=1724051071","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/982201/5f9a066270d1caa203ba484988975f6607922071/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724051071","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/982201/5f9a066270d1caa203ba484988975f6607922071/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724051071","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Elyrion is Polytopia\u2019s second Special Tribe!
