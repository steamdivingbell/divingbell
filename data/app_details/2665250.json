{"about_the_game":"Are you tired of big city life? Escape to an American ranch. In this ranch life simulator, you'll have to find your way in a rural, sometimes harsh reality.  <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2665250/extras/Header1.png?t=1738073661\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">From field to plate </h2><br>You can eat fast food as you did before or start growing healthy vegetables from which you prepare a meal, bake freshly caught fish, and drink fresh milk. You will have many recipes at your disposal with different levels of complexity. You will be able to prepare meals in the kitchen or with the use of a barbecue or campfire. <br><br>Plant your favorite vegetables in the garden beds or the greenhouse. Create your garden compositions of flowers, vegetables, and fruits. Grow, water, and harvest. Pick apples in the orchard and plant your favorite flowers along the path. Cut the grass or assist yourself with living grass cutters - cows, sheep, goats. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2665250/extras/Header2.png?t=1738073661\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Renovation, furnishing, workshop </h2><br>The ranch you bought will need a lot of repairs. Patch the holes in the roof, fill the gaps in the walls, and paint the walls the color of your choice. When you can afford it - replace the furniture and arrange your space, buy decorations for the fireplace and even potted flowers.  <br><br>With the money you earn, develop your workshop. Buy more tools and equipment. Build more and more complex structures from boards you cut yourself. What will you start with? With a bookcase, a fence by the pasture, or maybe a birdhouse?  <br><br>Restore a forgotten car and use it to go to town. Replace the paint, repair the engine, replace the tires, and feel the satisfaction of the final result. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2665250/extras/Header3.png?t=1738073661\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Recreation </h2><br>Ride a quad bike on the surrounding forest trails, walk through the woods picking mushrooms, or take photos of the animals you encounter. Travel through your sprawling ranch on horseback. Go to the shooting range, go fishing, have a bonfire or barbecue in the surrounding arbor.   <br><br>Eat healthy, get enough sleep, don't get overtired, and enjoy plenty of activities! Learn to play the harmonica, break your records, and overcome new challenges.  <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2665250/extras/Header4.png?t=1738073661\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Animal breeding </h2><br>Raise and sell animals: cows, chickens, goats, sheep. Feed the animals with fodder or herd them to pasture, take care of access to water. Milk cows, shear sheep fleece, collect eggs, breed and sell. Take care of their mental state and put your heart into raising them. Stroking is welcome.  <br><br>If you decide to buy a dog, you will not regret it. Take care of your pet and let it help you with work by herding animals to pasture.
