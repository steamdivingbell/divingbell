{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u25ef 1. Simplify internal affairs</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the game, you don't need to manually develop commercial agriculture and recruit soldiers and treat injuries like other Three Kingdoms strategy games. You only need to set a governor, who will develop various values \u200b\u200bof the city according to his own attributes. Increasing the number of civil officials can also improve the governor's development efficiency. The generals automatically restore 30% of their lives each round and automatically recruit soldiers from the population. When the population is 0, the troops cannot be replenished.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u25ef 2. Personality of famous generals</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each general has 3 personalities, which affect the behavior of the generals during the game. For example, the development efficiency of the governor with a dedicated personality is increased by 50%; the success rate of the generals with a good debate personality when persuading the enemy to surrender is increased by 50%; the cunning generals have 100% escape when arrested; the generals with unruly personalities have a 50% chance of being uncontrolled during battle, etc.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u25ef 3. Equipment &amp; artifacts</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There are currently 15 types of military equipment and 6 artifacts in the game. Equipment can be purchased in the city. Matching equipment can greatly improve the combat attributes of the generals such as output, defense and range. Artifacts are randomly scattered around at the beginning of the game and need to be obtained by performing patrol missions. Artifacts have special functions, such as possessing the &quot;Imperial Seal&quot; can make you an emperor, possessing the &quot;Diluma&quot; can perform the magic skill &quot;Leap&quot;, etc. More equipment and artifacts will be added in the future.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u25ef 4. Battle terrain</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The battle scene consists of terrains such as grasslands, woods, rivers, and city walls. In the woods, you will receive additional fire damage, on the mountains, you can increase your range, and moving in the desert requires more action. Each terrain has a different effect on marching and fighting. If you can use the characteristics of the terrain to fight, you can turn the tide of the battle.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u25ef 5. Battle strategy</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Strategy is an ability that a general can use during the battle, and it requires the general's intelligence. For example, a general with an intelligence higher than 55 can perform containment to prevent the enemy general from moving. Using &quot;Wind Call&quot; can make the enemy general our general. Using &quot;Wind Call&quot; can increase the attack range of all our shooters, etc.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u25ef 6. Editing the script</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game has a built-in script editor. Through the editor, you can modify the characters, cities, terrain, etc. in the official script. You can also create a brand new script of your own. The script supports exporting to the local computer, so even if it is a stand-alone game, you can export the script to share with your friends.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The first time you enter the game, click the Start Game button to quickly enter the novice tutorial. The operation of the editor is relatively simple, so there is no tutorial. Just watch the video above. If you have any questions about the game mechanism, it is recommended to check the built-in help manual of the game first. If you have any comments or suggestions, you can leave a message in the community forum or send an email to my mailbox.
