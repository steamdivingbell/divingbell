Friendly characters will give you advice and clues, as well as helping you with food, weapons and supplies, sometimes for a price. The enemies will include hostile tribesmen, slave traders and the Egyptian soldiers. Angering some friendly characters may turn them into enemies as well. In the beginning of the game enemies will outclass you and kill you easily, so you have to arm yourself with decent equipment before taking on seasoned fighters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are 16 types of animals, and while the herbivores like zebra and giraffe will run from you, there are meat eaters like lions, hyenas, crocodiles and leopards that would like to eat you.

Killing innocent people or losing a family member will lower your happiness, and if you become seriously unhappy you may just commit suicide. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game does feature combat and exploration, but the primary aim of the game is to be a primitive detective and to rescue your daughter.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1213660/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1583924464","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1213660/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1583924464","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1213660/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1583924464","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1213660/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1583924464","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"The game contains combat and the ability to hunt and kill animals.
