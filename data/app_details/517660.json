{"about_the_game":"Drop Out 0 is an online first person shooter with a twist: there are no hitpoints! Beat your opponents by knocking them out of the map.<br><br><strong><u>Gameplay</u></strong><br><br>Drop Out is played in matches of up to 8 players, the goal is to get as many points as possible in a team, or alone, within the time limit. You gain 2 points for every enemy player you knock out of the map and you lose 1 point every time you are knocked out of the park. Every suicide will result in a withdrawal of 2 points to your own score, you clumsy oaf! The game offers a variety of weapons that allow for different strategies and playstyles; whether you want to rocketjump, snipe or fistfight there will be something for you!<br><br><strong><u>Mechanics</u></strong><br><br><br><br>The game is built for multiplayer, you can play online, cross-platform easily and quickly. There is also an offline mode where you can practice against bots. LAN mode is clunkily available for windows, but can be improved and expanded if there is demand for it.<br><br>Playing online will grant you XP which you can spend to get new weapons, perks and skills. To keep the game balanced, you can unlock anything at any time. The price per unlock ramps up, making sure you can get a full set very quickly but getting every set will take some time.<br><br>The percentage at the bottom of your screen is your susceptibility. This number increases as you take damage, the higher your susceptibility the more knockback you will experience when taking hits.<br><br><strong><u>Features</u></strong><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/517660/extras/DO0Arsenal.png?t=1666994365\" /><br><br>At the time of writing there are 5 maps, 13 weapons, 8 perks, 2 character models and 2 skins for each.
