{"about_the_game":"The climate crisis is hitting humanity with increasing force - but now you're hitting back. Dodge, fight, and level up, and live to see another day. Utilize the full arsenal humanity has at its disposal to show the endless swarm of natural hazards who's boss - and dominate the leaderboard.<br><br>Climate Survivors is an action-heavy arena survival game. Until the timer hits the year 2100, hordes of monsters - symbolizing climate hazards like droughts and floods - spawn and try to attack you. The higher the carbon counter and resulting global heating grow, the more vicious the monsters and their attacks will become. You defend yourself by dodging and automatically firing back at them - first with a simple starting weapon, but you can upgrade your arsenal with every level-up.<br><br>Even more, through your choices, you can affect carbon levels and dynamically change the challenge of the game and the future of the world. Discover all the options we have at our disposal to tackle the climate crisis. From low-carbon energy to sustainable food and even whale poop.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Developed with science</h2><br>Climate Survivors builds on real research and communicates it in an accessible way. The development is supported by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis and the CHOICE research project. This daily, scientific work on these topics is also why we call it climate crisis instead of climate change and global heating instead of global warming.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3010970/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727690446","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3010970/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1727690446","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3010970/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727690446","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3010970/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727690446","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":3081190,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"The climate crisis is hitting humanity with increasing force - but now you're hitting back.
