{"about_the_game":"Destroy all the cubes! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nUse the laser to launch your cubes and match your colors by 3 or more. If you put a cube without color assembly by 3 minimum, the progress bar increases. When this one reaches at the end, a new layer of cube falls, the traditional plate advances, and the plate turning is reduced. To pass to the next level all the colored cubes must be destroyed while remaining within the limits of the game boards.<br />\r\nTo make your task easier, you have 4 types of bonus and it depends on your ability to use these bonuses or not, that you will earn stars at each end of level.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe challenge is to get 3 stars per level.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4 different types of bonuses:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Heart : Resets the progress bar to zero to give you a second wind.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Cannon : gives the possibility of shooting to destroy cubes for a few seconds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Bomb : Destroy the cubes where you sent it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Magic ball : instantly deletes a color of your choice.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3 game modes:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Classic : here no time limit and a limited number of moves represented by the progress bar!
