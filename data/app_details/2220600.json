Fight bosses, get new weapons, power up, and find new things in the land of Craftia.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fight Legendary Bosses on a massive Campaign</h2>Fights tons of foes from week to strong. Weird and unnatural to worthy and god-like. Rule the arena and change the tide of the fight against the Galactic Federation. The more bosses you defeat the weaker the control the GF has over that sector.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Battle Strategy</h2>Prepare for planning and fighting against the enemy. Come to the war room and with your team of other Craftians or maybe your Solo, be the general in the war room and battlefield.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Weapon System</h2>Prepare to go deep in the details of the weapon. Come to Sigurd, brother and Lexus, and have him do the work, for a price of course. Or go do it yourself, just everything is harder but more worth it. Find legendary items hidden in deep forts or kill bosses for something special.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get Creative</h2>There is a reason we are called Craftians. The Craftian people are good builders. Use your skill to build defense and special items to kill your foes easier.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Join Our Discord</h2>Join for updates and more cool stuff! |<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Devolper Note</h2>This game is made by Team Craftia, a 3 man team.
