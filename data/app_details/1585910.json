{"about_the_game":"<strong> In Roll, you have 2500 rolls to collect as many points as possible. Roll your dice to gain points, spend your points to upgrade your dice, and repeat. Borrowing gameplay elements from strategy, clicker, and roguelike deckbuilder genres, Roll creates a perfect balance of relaxation with critical thinking.</strong><br> <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1585910/extras/descriptionStressed.png?t=1734803845\" /><br><br>   Roll is designed first and foremost as a relaxing and meditative experience.

Each run will present you with new and interesting decisions creating a huge depth of strategy and keeping the game feeling always fresh.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Note From the Developer:</h2>If you\u2019re thinking about buying Roll please keep in mind that while I am super passionate about this game, I am a solo developer. This is not a triple A experience with 4k graphics. Instead, I offer a small, satisfying experience inspired by roguelike mechanics. Get it for less than Mcdonald's.<br><br><br>Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have feedback, questions, or problems with the game.
