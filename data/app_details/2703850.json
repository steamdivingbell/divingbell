{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Ever felt like the world was missing that one Parkour game? That game that scratches that <strong>Parkour/Freerunning</strong> itch that other games just don't? <strong>Rooftops &amp; Alleys</strong> aka TheParkourGame is aiming to deliver! Rooftops &amp; Alleys is a brand new game being developed by a single person in Unreal Engine 5. <strong>RNA</strong> has been in development for around 12-13 months and is ongoing. This project aims to create a fun single-player experience with multiple maps to free roam and challenge yourself in. This game will be its own unique take on the Parkour and freerunning gaming genre and will feature its own control scheme and tricking system (<strong>Controllers will offer the best experience, keyboard &amp; mouse is also supported</strong>). Currently, the game is being developed primarily for PC, with the intent of releasing on consoles upon official release later on. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2703850/extras/description-image-01.jpg?t=1739153590\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Core Game Features:</strong></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> </h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Parkour &amp;\u00a0Freerunning</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Intuitive Controls</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Tricking &amp; Scoring System</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Singleplayer &amp; Multiplayer</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Free Roam </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Time Trials </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Trick Challenges\u00a0(Currently being reworked - back soon)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Session Marker &amp; Pin Dropper System (Pigeon) </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Multiple Maps </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Character Customization</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Third and First-Person Camera </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Ragdoll/Bail Button </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Slowmotion Button </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dynamic Weather </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Original in-game Music</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Multiplayer Features:</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2703850/extras/description-image-03.jpg?t=1739153590\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Play with Friends (Invitational or Session Browser)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">TAG Game Mode (Up to 4 Players)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Capture The Flag Game Mode (Up to 4 Players)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Freeplay Game Mode (Up to 4 Players)  </p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2703850/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1739153590","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2703850/page.bg.jpg?t=1739153590","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2703850/e851ac1b78f0569b1e12adfb7e6484b31a0ec2c4/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739153590","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2703850/e851ac1b78f0569b1e12adfb7e6484b31a0ec2c4/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739153590","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Ever felt like the world was missing that one Parkour game?
