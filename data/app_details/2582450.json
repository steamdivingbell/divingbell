{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We say a lot of things about time. That you can't outrun it, that it heals all wounds... You know, flowery shit like that. Truth is a bit less interesting, though. You see, time doesn't care; not about you, or anyone, or anything. It has one job, and that is to march ever on. So, what do you think happens when we try to control it? To force it to stop, speed up, or turn right around? Does it get mad? Does it laugh in our faces? Or does it march ever on, utterly uncaring for all the best-laid plans that are crushed under chitin and scale.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We were once a proud people- too proud, as is often easily identified after the fact. We looked upon our works. We felt mighty. And now we despair.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the Sands of Time, we are smothered. And in it's Rivers, we drown.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">'Sassin is a story on recovering from failure. It will be told by you, your friends, and your foes as you embark on single and multiplayer missions which, with every major update, will directly influence the future of this world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Will you support the Lighthouse Keeper, whose ambition drives him to learn from an apocalyptic mistake and get it right this time so that many can be saved?\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Or will you support the Harbor Master, whose regret drives him to stop the second attempt and instead rebuild so that more won't be lost?\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As a wraith, stuck outside of time and consequence by the seaglass shard in your chest, you are an invaluable asset in this war at the end of the world. Every mission you choose to undertake will tip the scales of this conflict in a way that will be cemented as history at the point of every major update. Be it a simple singleplayer scouting mission, a competitive race for resources, or a large-scale PVP battle to take or defend a fortress, your actions will determine the outcome of the story. For even if you cannot die, you fight for those who can, and for those who already have.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2582450/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730653773","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2582450/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1730653773","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2582450/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730653773","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2582450/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730653773","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2585950,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We say a lot of things about time.
