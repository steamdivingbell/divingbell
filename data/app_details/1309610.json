We will evaluate user feedback and continue to build the AI and analytics for new and exciting single-player content. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">E-sports &amp; Season Finals</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Line War was created with e-sports in mind from day one. We know from experience that matches can be very interesting to watch from an observer's perspective. The average duration of a match is approximately 35 min. A global leaderboard based on quarterly seasons is already up-n-running. We want each season to end with live-streamed finals, proposedly in a round-of-32/double-elimination format. We are hooking up with commentators and collaborators.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Planned Features</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game has yet to see its fullest potential! Many more features have been planned all along and most of them can be found in the original Game Design Document. Take a look at this:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>ADVANCED WORLD ECONOMICS</strong> - A slightly more complex, 4X-like world economy with dynamic trade routes, growing cities, and new resources. Less emphasis on pre-defined locations.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>ORBITAL WARFARE</strong> - Rocket gets accompanied by Satellites, Suncatchers, and Orbital Killers, produced at the familiar Launchpad.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>WORLD IMPROVEMENTS</strong> - Seamless west/east cylindrical worlds, voting, favorites, metadata, visual hints.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>VICTORY CONDITIONS</strong> - Based on 80% territory ownership. Players get notified when any player is close to a territorial victory.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>CAPTURE BUILDINGS</strong> - Possibility to capture an enemy building, not just destroy it.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>INFRASTRUCTURE</strong> - Build Roads, Bridges, Fortifications, Coastal Turrets, or dig Canals.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>IMPROVED AI</strong> - Smarter unit micro-decisions, flowfield pathfinding, keeping optimal distance for ranged fighters, etc.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>OBSERVER APPLICATION</strong> - Watch a live match with support for switching perspectives and more.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>ESPIONAGE</strong> - Train Spies and assign them to sabotage-, intelligence- or counter-espionage missions.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>OPERATIONS</strong> - Use the F5 through F8 keys to record an Operation (which is basically just a grouping of commands).</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>NEXT GEN COMMAND SYSTEM</strong> - We have plenty of ideas on how to make the command system more expressive, efficient, and lean. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>SHALLOW WATERS</strong> - Not traversable by the Cruiser and Aircraft Carrier. Degraded stealth for Submarines.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Future of Line War</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Studio Centurion is committed to the development of this game for years to come!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Our final goal is to have an all-inclusive AA- or AAA product with single-player campaigns. At this stage, LW will already be an established player in the e-sports segment.</p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Inspired by classic RTS titles like Command &amp; Conquer with a nod to famed board game Axis &amp; Allies, Line War combines elements of 4X, wargame, and real-time tactics genres into a unique strategic experience for veterans and newcomers. <br><br>Line War\u2019s versatile control system allows players to quickly and intuitively issue commands by drawing lines across the battlefield to move units, form defensive lines, engage enemies and conquer territories.
