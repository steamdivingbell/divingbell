{"about_the_game":"After a string of missing person reports at an old abandoned park on the uninhabited Maple Island, a journalist decides to venture out to uncover the source of these disappearances. Immediately, something seems off. Unfamiliar noises echo through the forests, and you feel like something is watching you. Retrieving the wooden idols found within the park seems to stir the evil, and might be the key to uncovering this island's mystery. <br><br>Using nothing but a map of the park, a compass, and your trusty camera, you must uncover the truth behind these reports before someone, or some<i>thing</i> stops you. <br><br>This game utilizes cutting-edge technology to deliver stunning visuals, a minimal UI to maximize immersion, and many more effects to build a realistic, horrifying world for its players. Many Eyed is a single-player psychological horror game, centered around exploring the map and avoiding any terrifying enemies that may be encountered. Search every location to find wooden idols, in the hopes that you can unravel the island's mystery and escape with not only your camera footage, but also your life.<br><br>NOTE: This game utilizes cutting-edge technology from Unreal Engine as well as very high-quality graphical assets to achieve a life-like look and feel.
