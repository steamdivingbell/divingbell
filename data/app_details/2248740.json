{"about_the_game":"Libraries have always been home to hundreds of stories that can take you on a grand adventure, and Spectre's Library is no exception. From an evil clone to a homeless man with a guitar, there's a story for everyone!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCome explore the library and seek out the secrets that lie within! There are:<br />\r\n-Puzzles<br />\r\n-Insane NPC's<br />\r\n-A big library<br />\r\n-A rich and interesting story (Not just the ones in the library)<br />\r\n-An interesting main character<br />\r\n-And more!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, after a lot of struggles and thought, I have decided to cancel the game. There are several reasons for this, but the main reason I'm doing this is I've lost inspiration to work on it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI really wish that I could finish this game, but I just have no ambition to anymore. I'll probably reuse the ideas I had for it elsewhere, but they won't be connected to this game at all.<br />\r\nI'm so sorry for anyone that happened to be interested in seeing the full game. We tried our best, but we just didn't win this one, and the best thing to do would be to put it out of its and everyone else's misery. Like I said, we might come back to it, but with everything going on chances are slim.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you want to know more, please see the community post down below.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2248740/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724774156","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2248740/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1724774156","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2248740/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724774156","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2248740/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724774156","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Libraries have always been home to hundreds of stories that can take you on a grand adventure, and Spectre's Library is no exception.
