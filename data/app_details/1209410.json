Discover lost islands and treasures, fight rival pirates and menacing monsters all in your bid to become king of the sea.</strong><br><br><br><strong>MAIN FEATURES</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Shape your own adventure</strong>: Dive into a magnificent, nautical world. Complete quests to shape your journey and meet unique characters along the way. But be warned, the world around you will react and change depending on the actions you take. Naval routes will change and with each conquered settlement the difficulty adapts to make for a more challenging adventure. <br></li><li><strong>Weather the storms</strong>: Changes in the weather can knock you off your sea legs. From thick fog to dangerous storms, sail at your own risk and watch out for the direction of the wind. You could be blown right into an enemy\u2019s path if you don\u2019t strategize well enough. <br></li><li><strong>Customize your ship</strong>: Choose from five different types of highly customisable ships: The Sloop, Brig, Flute, Frigate and Galleon.

Line your pockets with gold and spend on improvements to your ship and on brand new skills. <br></li><li><strong>Prepare for battle</strong>: You\u2019re not alone out on the open ocean. Throughout your adventure you\u2019ll face off in naval battles with monsters and rival pirates. Keep your wits about you and use strategy to win. Battle mechanics aren\u2019t limited to blasting cannons, on your adventure you\u2019ll acquire up to 20 different combat skills from flamethrowers to voodoo rituals. Each battle you win will raise the bounty on your head and you\u2019ll be challenged by even more fearsome foes. <br></li><li><strong>Explore the nautical world </strong>: There is so much to explore in the epic world of King of Seas. Discover secret maps hidden in the depths and excavate precious treasures. Go fishing and uncover as many as 30 varieties of fish living below the ocean surface.
