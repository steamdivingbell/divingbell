{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>never Fight Alone!</strong></h2><br>Playing with friends is always more fun. That's why in 'The Great War 3032', everything revolves around teams. Join forces to compete against another team. The team with the most kills wins.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>not Enough Players?</strong></h2><br>Are you only two, three, or four players? No problem! With the co-op mode, you can play together against the computer. And if you want to play alone, that's possible too and it's just as much fun.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>multiplayer</strong></h2><br>In multiplayer, you have access to two weapons: a machine gun and a grenade launcher. In deathmatch, you'll be competing with your team against another. It's particularly important to keep an eye on your ammo, as the enemy will show no mercy once you run out. If ammo is running low, you should quickly grab some new ammo from one of your team's ammo crates. And while you're at it, you can also heal yourself from a first aid kit.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>co-op</strong></h2><br>In co-op mode, everything is set up exactly like in multiplayer. The only difference is that here, you compete with your team against an AI. As the team leader, you can choose the difficulty level and set the maximum number of opponents. When everyone is ready, the battle can begin. Good luck!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>the Future</strong></h2><br>We will continually develop 'The Great War 3032', adding new weapons, maps, and game modes, among other things. Additionally, the AI will continue to learn and make your life more difficult. But first and foremost, we want to hear from you, as your ideas and wishes are the most important to us! If you have something you'd like to contribute, please feel free to let our support team know. Who knows, maybe your idea will be implemented.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Winner","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2378640/248d8e0a01764e72fe056dac2bc0df5cc8568b3d.jpg"},{"name":"Killer 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2378640/bbd6667abf433e5784e4a057789956a8b06e5c0a.jpg"},{"name":"Winner 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2378640/248d8e0a01764e72fe056dac2bc0df5cc8568b3d.jpg"},{"name":"Winner 3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2378640/7de07a7ab4ff4f6532cde621982ba7c2420c4d64.jpg"},{"name":"Pro Winner","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2378640/23c0d6d24523c2ed54a66466cf584097045bfff3.jpg"},{"name":"Killer ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2378640/bbd6667abf433e5784e4a057789956a8b06e5c0a.jpg"},{"name":"Killer 3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2378640/980392a00acce67f4d1e5c29a38c39f0c6c1b2a2.jpg"},{"name":"Killer 4","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2378640/cf9b0bdb27684e68a6647c15855e62ccb4e6eedc.jpg"},{"name":"Dead","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2378640/50c8d7731a40b4f8f64da278080fe6873841c24d.jpg"},{"name":"Dead 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2378640/50c8d7731a40b4f8f64da278080fe6873841c24d.jpg"}],"total":16},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2378640/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1708370546","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2378640/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1708370546","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2378640/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1708370546","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2378640/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1708370546","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Killing opponents and general violence without depicting blood or mutilation."},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>never Fight Alone!</strong></h2><br>Playing with friends is always more fun.
