Set in a mythical Aztec era, the game tells the story of a once-peaceful land now plagued by a strange, dark energy emerging from an ancient temple. Axel and Bowie are the only ones immune to this darkness, and together they embark on an adventure to restore peace and balance to their homeland.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game unfolds across six unique worlds, each with five levels offering varied challenges, from vertical-scrolling platform levels to intense boss battles and shoot 'em up levels. Each world is meticulously designed in pixel art style, with a color palette inspired by the classic <i>Rainbow Islands</i>, giving the game a nostalgic and charming feel.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As players progress through the game, they must face enemies controlled by the dark entity, including manipulated Aztec warriors and animals. Axel, with his ability to freeze enemies, facilitates access to new areas by using frozen enemies as platforms, while Bowie, in his shoot 'em up levels, eliminates them with his divine bow.
