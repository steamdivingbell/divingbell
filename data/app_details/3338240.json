These metaphors may involve classic religious stories. I only hope to enrich the cultural connotations and story depths of the game through these elements. However, players are also requested to understand and approach the religious content therein with an open and rational attitude during the gaming experience to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings and conflicts.\r\n\r\n\u3010Violent and Gory Scenes\u3011\r\nThere are certain violent and gory scenes in the game, such as the special effects of character injuries and deaths during battles, and the designs of some monsters or scenes will present pictures of blood splashing. These scenes are intended to enhance the combat atmosphere and the sense of tension in the game, but they may cause a certain impact on players with weaker psychological endurance. It is recommended that such players make a cautious choice when experiencing the game or play the game under the accompaniment of parents or guardians.\r\n\r\n\u3010Psychological and Emotional Hints\u3011\r\nThe plot and character settings of the game involve some rather heavy and complex psychological and emotional themes, such as domestic violence, childhood trauma, and the struggle of human nature. These contents may trigger players' thinking about similar problems in real life, but they may also bring psychological burdens to some players. We hope that players can pay attention to their own emotional changes during the game process. If they feel uncomfortable, they can pause the game timely to adjust their mental state."},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About &quot;DAUGHTER OF PAIN&quot;</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">&quot;DAUGHTER OF PAIN&quot; is a top-down action game with Roguelike elements independently developed by &quot;Yu Bu Yun Tian&quot;.
