{"about_the_game":"You awake on the outskirts of a small town with no recollection of who you are or how you got there. After wandering for a while, you encounter a house in the woods. Is there someone there who can help? You soon realize that there is something terribly wrong with this town.  Do you have what it takes to overcome your fears and escape from Pleasant Falls?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExplore a landscape engulfed by fog and rooms filled with darkness in this VR psychological thriller. One will have to rely on med kits to replenish health, a flashlight to shine the way, and keys to unlock doors. Even though there is a HUD, to promote an immersive experience, it will not be visible unless a button is held down. Patience is required in order to figure out how to progress through parts of the game. This is not a sitting game. Thumbsticks will be used to move around and explore. The game is designed to start off slow and then build suspense. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbout me: I am an indie game developer and this is my first game. I hope you get scared and enjoy my game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2979510/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730086449","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2979510/page.bg.jpg?t=1730086449","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2979510/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730086449","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2979510/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730086449","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"This game contains scenes of explicit violence and gore and some nudity.
