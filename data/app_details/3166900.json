{"about_the_game":"Match-3 meets Tower Defense! Your matches become towers. Defend each real castle in Scotland! Learn about real Scottish castles/stories/legends while playing. The game takes place on full map of Scotland made of 5 million tiles, where each tile is 19.5 square meters of the real world.<br><br><strong>From the creator of Tower Swap. This game isn't released yet, so here's some reviews of Tower Swap:</strong><br><br>&quot;It's a perfect blend between the match-3, merge, and tower defense genre, so if you like any of those genres and you want to venture forth with a twist this is a perfect game with a great gameplay loop and great mechanics. It's super addicting... I enjoyed my time with Tower Swap so much that I lost track of time and got a super long gameplay recording.&quot; - MintCity Review<br><br>&quot;This is a hidden gem and belongs in the best-of list of indie match 3 mobile games alongside Triple Town, 10000000, and Puzzle Craft.&quot; - Loren Hernandez<br><br>&quot;Never have I ever played a game for such a long time continuously as this game. It's so simple and sooo good. 10/10 would recommend everyone ever. My grandma would love this game and my grandchildren would someday still love this game. ok I'm done. But seriously, play it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;One of the most well-designed games I've ever played! Game is easy for beginners to play but it takes quite a bit of skill to attain higher levels, as success requires using both match-3 and tower defense strategies.&quot;<br><br><strong>100s of castles are planned with real folklore from each:</strong><br><br>Did you know that there was a castle ruled by a Viking princess, and it was on an island, and she put up a chain reaching to the mainland to stop ships?<br><br>Did you know that there was a castle that was said to have been built by a wizard using an army of goblins?<br><br>Did you know that there's a fairy flag that still exists today in Dunvegan castle, and it is said that it can only be used 3 times, and it has already been used twice in medieval times to summon fairies to their defense?<br><br>All of these and hundreds more are planned to be added to the game.<br><br><strong>About Pricing</strong><br><br>Note that the game is priced low because it contains IAPs. If you don't want to pay you can play for free on the web but with banner ads, coming soon. You are essentially paying to remove the banner ads, and to be able to load up the game without internet, and to make sure your progress doesn't get cleared from your browser's storage. The Steam version doesn't have any banner ads. There will also be mobile versions with the same structure.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3166900/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734382891","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3166900/page.bg.jpg?t=1734382891","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3166900/f7e68da62b7f03516ab9529f43cac7623a90ae54/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734382891","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3166900/f7e68da62b7f03516ab9529f43cac7623a90ae54/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734382891","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Match-3 meets Tower Defense!
