{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Imaginary Chaos Fight</i> is a 2D PvP fighting game where each character has unique abilities and mechanics that add a new layer of strategy to each match. Each of the six fighters presents distinct advantages and disadvantages: while some have powerful but slow attacks, others rely on speed and agile moves to dodge and counterattack. The abilities of each character are carefully designed to either complement or counter each other in combat, offering a dynamic experience full of strategic possibilities.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Additionally, the game features unique and interactive maps, such as Jungle and Vulcan, which add exclusive mechanics to the battlefield. In the Jungle map, players are immersed in a dense forest with strategically positioned teleportation portals, allowing for quick movement between distant points on the map and surprising opponents. In the Vulcan map, players face a terrain filled with active geysers that provide powerful boosts for those who know how to use them strategically. These geysers allow players to quickly reach elevated areas, escape attacks, or surprise opponents with unexpected moves.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Imaginary Chaos Fight</i> combines these character and environment mechanics to create an intense and unpredictable combat experience, where character choice and map adaptation are crucial to achieving victory.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3341620/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734611511","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3341620/page.bg.jpg?t=1734611511","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3341620/633fdcf68bf472f98f374f704a81d8e5a19c3471/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734611511","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3341620/633fdcf68bf472f98f374f704a81d8e5a19c3471/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734611511","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Imaginary Chaos Fight</i> is a 2D PvP fighting game where each character has unique abilities and mechanics that add a new layer of strategy to each match.
