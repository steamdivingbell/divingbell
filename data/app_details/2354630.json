TRUST NO ONE!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Craft or find your kit</h2>In your hideout, you have access to a plethora of tools and crafting recipes that will greatly help you in the field. With our changing environment and multiple environmental hazards, you'll need to gear up to prepare for all hazards that you may find, infected and player alike!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Living your life</h2>As you can expect to encounter harsh environments, difficult situations and even life threatening events. Luckily you will have your bunker to fall back to! If you're ever in a pinch, you'll be able to craft life saving items using the worlds various materials. But remember, you won't be able to craft everything! If the situation ever gets too serious, you can always retreat back to your bunker!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Time to get back to the bunker!</h2>After getting back to the bunker, you will notice there's things to clean up! Not only can you tidy around the hideout, you can also craft items from parts you've found. As you will notice a large cave-in within your bunker, you can fix it up!

Combat training in this difficult environment is definitely a must! You'll have to learn to be efficient with your resource gather as well! Being able to carry more important items means faster development of other skills! Like crafting, engineering, or even the medical sciences! Maybe you can even discover the secrets of the crashed train!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Finding things in parts?!</h2>Living in this environment is tough enough.. A lot of the buildings are hollow now. They've been looted and left with little to nothing. Though, one persons trash is another ones treasure! Using blueprints and finding the parts to items and equipment will be one of the main ways of acquiring high end loot! If you can't find it, you'll most likely be able to make it yourself!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Where's all the food</h2>Having no one working on the farms or in the grocery stores, the wide-spread panic didn't help anything either.. People were storming the markets and farms, hoping to get as much as they can. In their panic, fights occurred. You'll have to start thinking of ways to sustain yourself.  Maybe you can plant something in the bunker? Or even have a personal farm somewhere close by!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Weird traders walking around</h2>There have been glimpses of backpackers who wander the world, but very few people know of their true intentions. Some radio stations pick up conversations or chatter of sightings, almost turning them into cryptids! They're always handy to look out for, and can trade items to you that you will likely need in your journeys! As long as you're willing to pay their price that is. Few have spoken to them face to face, usually leaving items in cashes hidden in the world will be the most you ever interact with them.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2354630/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1690751741","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2354630/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1690751741","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2354630/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1690751741","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2354630/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1690751741","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Includes Source SDK","id":16}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">This is where your story begins!</h2><br>Stories erupted so quickly.
