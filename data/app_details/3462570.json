{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Welcome to <strong>Tombs of Myra</strong> \u2013 my latest game about a cursed kingdom where you must delve into ancient dungeons to free the souls of warriors trapped in blue crystals.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What is it about?</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Tombs of Myra is <strong>a turn-based puzzle dungeon game</strong>. This means players and monsters take turns making moves. Your goal in each of the <strong>120 levels</strong> is simple: collect all the blue crystals. Doing so unlocks the staircase to the next floor, bringing you closer to completing the dungeon.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game starts off easy, but as you progress, the dungeons become increasingly treacherous, filled with more monsters and traps. Luckily, you\u2019ll discover helpful items like <strong>swords, shovels, bombs</strong>, and <strong>shields</strong> to aid you on your quest. These tools will let you fend off enemies, break obstacles, and protect yourself.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Every monster in the game has deterministic behavior. That means their movements follow clear, predictable patterns. A big part of the gameplay is <strong>figuring out these patterns</strong>. While they might seem simple, mastering them can be tricky and rewarding.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Wasps...</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Take, for example, your first encounter with the wasp. The wasp always tries to move one tile closer to you vertically\u2014either up or down. If you\u2019re above the wasp, it will move up. If you\u2019re below it, it will move down. Obstacles like walls don\u2019t stop it from attempting this. However, if the wasp can\u2019t move vertically\u2014because it\u2019s blocked or already aligned with you\u2014it will move one tile horizontally toward you instead.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This makes wasps both predictable and dangerous. If you\u2019re not careful, you might corner yourself, leaving no room to escape. But if you plan ahead, you can turn the tables\u2014trapping the wasp in a corner or widening the gap between you and your foe, giving you space to gather crystals and safely reach the exit.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">...and other threats</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Later levels introduce other threats, like carnivorous plants. These stationary hazards are deadly if stepped on, but they can also work to your advantage. For example, an enemy trying to reach you might stumble into a plant and meet its end. This highlights a key principle of Tombs of Myra: enemies are simple-minded. They follow their patterns without considering the consequences.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you progress, you\u2019ll encounter a greater variety of enemies, including those with more complex behaviors. To survive, you\u2019ll need to think strategically and make clever use of the special items you find along the way.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unlimited Undo</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Of course, experimenting with strategies is part of the fun. That\u2019s why Tombs of Myra gives you unlimited undo. If you make a mistake or end up in a hopeless situation, you can rewind time and try a different approach. And if a particular level proves too tough, you can skip it and come back to it later.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Do you have what it takes?</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">So, the big question is: Can you conquer all 120 levels and free the Kingdom of Myra? And more importantly, what will the journey do to you? The legends warn that even the purest souls risk getting lost in the Tombs of Myra.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3462570/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737494788","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3462570/page.bg.jpg?t=1737494788","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3462570/97e422a8c6f7f9b91497d4646e068e953648ccb1/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737494788","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3462570/97e422a8c6f7f9b91497d4646e068e953648ccb1/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737494788","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Welcome to <strong>Tombs of Myra</strong> \u2013 my latest game about a cursed kingdom where you must delve into ancient dungeons to free the souls of warriors trapped in blue crystals.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What is it about?</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Tombs of Myra is <strong>a turn-based puzzle dungeon game</strong>.
