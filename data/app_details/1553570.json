{"about_the_game":"A 3D version of the classic game Mine Sweeper.<br />\r\nA huge cube of spheres appears in the sky, and some of them contains mine. Discover them!<br />\r\nJust like the traditional minesweeper game, you can mark the sphere by right-click it or discover it with your left mouse bottom.<br />\r\nWhen discovering a mine, the game will end. Otherwise, it will disappear if there's no mine around it, or show a number represents how many mines are around.<br />\r\nYour target is to uncover all the sphere that doesn't contain a mine, while keep those with mines covered. Once you found a sphere contains a mine, mark it. After marking enough mines around a discovered number, you can safely uncover other spheres around. But if there's any flag that marked wrongly, mine will be waiting!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe control is really simple:<br />\r\n+ WASD for basic movement<br />\r\n+ C to move lower<br />\r\n+ Space to move upper<br />\r\nApproach a sphere, and you will notice it highlighted. Then:<br />\r\n+ Left mouse bottom to discover it<br />\r\n+ Right mouse bottom to mark it as mine<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can use the key Q to quit current game or quit the whole game easily. Esc do the same.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nComparing with the traditional 2D Mine Sweeper game, the Mine Sweeper 3D definitely push the toughness to a new level. An experienced player can mark all the mines in a 10-mine game under 5 secs when playing the 2D version, but it's really hard to complete an 8-mine game in 5 mins playing the 3D version.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you really think you're an expert, the expert mode is here for you! Try it and move with caution.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Mine Sweeper 3D game is made with Unreal Engine4, which provides epic graphics and full screen experience. You are playing the minesweeper game in a mountain area, with a house and a camp besides. Feel free to travel around, and back to game at whenever you want! You can also take a walk after winning a game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHave Fun!","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1553570?t=1709368074","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1553570?t=1709368074","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1553570/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1709368074","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1553570/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1709368074","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A 3D version of the classic game Mine Sweeper.<br />\r\nA huge cube of spheres appears in the sky, and some of them contains mine.
