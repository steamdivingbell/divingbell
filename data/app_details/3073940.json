{"about_the_game":"God Save Birmingham is a zombie apocalypse survival game set in 14th century Birmingham, England. The Early Access version will focus on a sandbox mode utilizing a small portion of the town. The full town will be available at official release, with a campaign mode coming later to complete the experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE END HAS COME</h2>A strange plague sweeps the countryside, transforming men into monsters, and cities into slaughterhouses. You are one of the last survivors of Birmingham, alone against the shambling corpses of your former friends and neighbors, with only your wits to protect you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">NOURISH THY BODY</h2>Even after the end of the world, life goes on. Forage for supplies, craft tools and weapons, then set out on the hunt for food, water, and shelter. The clock is always ticking, and the horde is always near.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MASTER MEDIEVAL PHYSICS</h2>Wriggle your way out of harrowing situations with physics-based mechanics that reward quick wits and skill. Stack furniture to barricade doors, leap low fences to trip your clumsy foes, and sever limbs to reduce the undead to angry, wriggling torsos. Just be careful not to stumble over a bucket while fleeing for your life.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TAKE A BITE OUT OF HISTORY</h2>Explore a carefully reconstructed 14th century Birmingham, in all its bucolic, bubonic glory. Stop by the Markets or the Burgage Plots to forage for resources. Raid boarded-up smithies for tools, grab a drink at the nearest tavern, and explore historic architecture at the Church of St. Martin in the Bull Ring.<br><br>The Early Access version of the game will contain about one-quarter of the entire town, with the rest coming between now and full release.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3073940/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737507694","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3073940/page.bg.jpg?t=1737507694","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3073940/02acba02e43ac85f8fa2d5804a420369290da3b5/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737507694","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3073940/02acba02e43ac85f8fa2d5804a420369290da3b5/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737507694","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"God Save Birmingham is a medieval zombie survival and contains violence, blood, gore, and nudity."},"detailed_description":"God Save Birmingham is a zombie apocalypse survival game set in 14th century Birmingham, England.
