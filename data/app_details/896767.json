{"about_the_game":"At the end of the 1970s, Electro-Motive sought a successor to its landmark SD40-2 locomotive and for its 645-series power plant. That effort would spawn Electro-Motive\u2019s \u201c60-series\u201d diesel locomotives and EMD\u2019s evolutionary 710-series engine.

Deliveries of regular production versions of the SD50 began in the spring of 1981, and from 1981 through 1985 421 standard SD50s would be constructed using EMD\u2019s traditional \u201cSpartan\u201d cab design. To improve the appeal of the SD50 during its production run, EMD had, in late 1984, boosted the horsepower rating of the model from 3,500 to 3,600 horsepower and had introduced improved alternators and traction motors. As such, the SD50 matched, with a 16-cylinder power plant, the potency once reserved for EMD\u2019s 645-series 20-cylinder SD45.<br><br>Over its production life, the SD50 garnered 12 original buyers.
