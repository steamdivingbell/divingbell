{"about_the_game":"So the town has been taken over by robots, the government evacuated the population before dropping a nuclear bomb to wipe out the robots. Great plan but those robots survived so they are nuking the town again. Unfortunately, you've never left town in your life, so instead of being evacuated, you decided to lock yourself away in the town's old nuclear bunker. One massive one-man party later and you wake up to find you have gone through supplies quicker than intended, now you must brave a town full of killer robots and a deadly hangover. Should have maybe given the drinking a miss because this is a bad day for a hangover.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- A survival game where being intoxicated matters more than food or water<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Gather tins to ensure you can outlast the incoming nuclear strike <br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Procedurally Generated world<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- 3 types of enemies, 2 bosses, robot bugs and 1 talking chicken<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- 1 overworld with 3 additional levels to explore","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442880/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1687273232","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442880/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1687273232","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442880/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1687273232","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442880/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1687273232","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Contains alcohol and drug abuse  "},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"So the town has been taken over by robots, the government evacuated the population before dropping a nuclear bomb to wipe out the robots.
