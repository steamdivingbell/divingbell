{"about_the_game":"You are the Champion of Syr - an ancient champion awoken in times of great danger.

Do you have what it takes to fight back the night?<br><br><strong>MONSTERS LURK IN THE DARK</strong><br>Fight a variety of creatures infesting the kingdom - each with their own unique methods of attack, and ties to the darkness. Can you drive these beasts back to the realm they call home?<br><br><strong>YOU MUST RESTORE THE LIGHT</strong><br> Rid an area of the infesting darkness by lighting and protecting beacons - be wary, however, as once a beacon strarts to light it will draw in those who would see it snuffed out. <br><br><strong>ENHANCE YOUR POWER</strong><br>Use your experience to power up certain aspects of your power - either through devotion to the God of Fire, Syr - or by imbuing yourself with the powers of the beasts you slay. Will you embrace the darkness?<br><br><strong>EXPLORE THE KINGDOM</strong><br>Navigate levels through a charming overworld system - travelling between levels, finding new friends, allies - and foes - along the way.<br><br><strong>DISCOVER THE TRUTH</strong><br>Not all is as it seems with this invasion - can you discover what the church is hiding? Are these creatures of the night exactly as they appear, or are they something more?","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"And I Would Walk 500 Miles","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2826890/d4f75502afce40d7c30eeee78d933ed53e94b24b.jpg"},{"name":"And I Would Walk 500 More","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2826890/0d1e40d2bd5cabf9332abfda6a33be7ff4df4f93.jpg"},{"name":"Long Live The King","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2826890/71640cdc4b9e95b934869e347990e0541842f7ac.jpg"},{"name":"May His Reign Be Short","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2826890/24e3d819af8e35bb14ce9b36e4c4c044f237643c.jpg"},{"name":"Bat Out Of Hell","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2826890/d949738a4efc2cb6b7165315a9bf03ebf5a4c640.jpg"},{"name":"When The Morning Comes","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2826890/8f10a6e797e6a8b916adcd6b504ed216fb90669d.jpg"},{"name":"Slow And Steady","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2826890/a16af37b20a0047a64df6169585a5aaf2fccee86.jpg"},{"name":"Fast And Unsteady","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2826890/2b5f6f380fec47e2c09115e8e18092ecfb9b05b4.jpg"},{"name":"Father of Light","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2826890/9b27203475dd2e11f94b63ba28caf96cf420ca6f.jpg"},{"name":"Mother of Night","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2826890/5468ac60fc332a2ec93331ebedb9cf46fd3dbd22.jpg"}],"total":25},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2826890/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731918152","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2826890/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1731918152","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2826890/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731918152","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2826890/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731918152","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":2942040,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"You are the Champion of Syr - an ancient champion awoken in times of great danger.
