The game is set in an alternate world where units and armies dating back from the 1960-1980 are enriched with high-tech current technologies and knowledge.<br><br>Inspired by childhood games that defined the RTS genre, Rush &amp; Command is here to combine that real nostalgic tactical RTS feeling with unique and innovative mechanics and ways to conquer your enemies on the battlefield. Whether this will be your first RTS game or you have been a RTS veteran since Utopia, you can plan out every move to outsmart real life or AI opponents, or make it your goal to obliterate every last player using your super weapons.
