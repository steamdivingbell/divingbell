{"about_the_game":"&quot;Ikonei Island: an Earthlock Adventure&quot; invites you to embark on a heartwarming multiplayer co-op journey suitable for all ages. Dive into gardening, form delightful bonds with fantastical creatures, undertake daring infiltrations of pirate camps, and much more. The captivating soundtrack, crafted by the composer Theo Nogueira, ventures into a sonic realm that spans from the orchestral odyssey of &quot;From Shore to Cliff,&quot; recorded with the renowned Kringkastingsorkesteret KORK (Norwegian Radio Orchestra), to the spirited flamenco-inspired tune \u201cDon\u2019t Cross the Longhorn\u201d, and even a playful and jazzy, almost comical composition for \u201cThere Goes the Axepecker\u201d. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe album also counts with the collaboration with the songwriter and artist Patty Gurdy, who wrote and performed \u201cPiratehog Chant\u201d, a bold and fun song that will make you want to dance to its beat. This musical diversity breathes life into the Island, offering a fresh and unique experience. While the original soundtrack predominantly operates procedurally and systemically, this album assembles those smaller pieces into cohesive tracks that will immerse you and transport you into the Ikonei\u2019s Heartland.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2677860?t=1711447867","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2677860?t=1711447867","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2677860/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1711447867","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2677860/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1711447867","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;Ikonei Island: an Earthlock Adventure&quot; invites you to embark on a heartwarming multiplayer co-op journey suitable for all ages.
