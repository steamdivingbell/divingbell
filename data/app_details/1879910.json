{"about_the_game":"Two Russian students Ivan and Alexander were expelled from the institute, but the knowledge remained with them. One day, while drinking beer, they come up with a brilliant idea - to create a superman who will not need food, and will work 24 hours a day. For the experiment, they recruited &quot;volunteers&quot; from the street, who already had nothing to lose. Everything went as planned, until the students themselves began to mutate. They began to think badly, and as a result they turned into zombies themselves... The task is to go through the entire maze, destroy two bosses (students), find the keys to the secret doors and get to the exit in one piece.<br />\r\n3D third-person shooter in which you have to go through a large secret laboratory destroying enemies. You can simply move around the game world and shoot the weapons that are given in the game. In the game there is a replenishment of lost health with food and ammunition that can be found in the corners of the secret base. The enemies have intelligence and it is not so easy to hit and kill them the first time, you will have to aim at the head, but they will dodge your shots, and when they get close to them, they will move on to hand-to-hand combat. The entire base consists of several large levels in which it is recommended to check every corner for useful resources for the player. The laboratory itself is built in the form of a corridor maze.
