{"about_the_game":"Alien bugs are launching an assault on Earth, which is rather unfortunate, and the only thing standing in their way is your strategic cunning. It's time to dust off our snazzy array of scientist-approved towers, and put them to use defending against endless waves of uninvited insects that are clearly intent on destroying our energy cores! Throw in a few nifty abilities from the Laboratory, some upgrades here and there, and our survival is almost guaranteed, probably.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>BUILD A MAZE OF TOWERS</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3133270/extras/TD_steam_gif_build.gif?t=1736969850\" /><br>Mount a defence by building hundreds of towers, choosing from the wide selection available. The placement of the towers can affect the path your enemies are likely to take across the map, so you'll need to put your strategy pants on for best results.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>DEFEND AGAINST PESKY BUGS</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3133270/extras/TD_steam_gif_bugs.gif?t=1736969850\" /><br>This game contains a lot of bugs, and not only the type that the developer created with their incompetence.

Each map can take anywhere from 20 minutes, to multiple hours to play, depending on your talent for survival.
