{"about_the_game":"Relive history! This is the only game out there with an unlimited number of missions you can play \u2014 there are thousands of them, many created by committed players! Play or create your own missions in World War 2 and all the way through the Cold War. Learn to master the skill of the commander and conquer every enemy!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWargame &amp; Turn-based Simulation<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom the Battle of Stalingrad to the Normandy landings, it\u2019s got the vast majority of WW2 covered. Play as Germany, the Soviet Union, Republic of China, United States, Great Britain, or any of the 100+ countries with additional customization possible. Attack enemy strongholds and defend your cities with 20+ land, naval, and air units. Even the same unit has special functionalities differing by country!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCampaigns &amp; Conquests<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are currently about 30 or so missions and conquest maps. The missions can be played through the story line, and the conquests (you get to choose your country) feature 1939-1950 Europe and 1937-1950 Asia. All the campaign maps can be downloaded and modified at your own will, as seen in the following section...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSandbox &amp; Custom Maps<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike I said, you can create your own maps; you can even upload them for the world to see! The map editor is readily available for use inside the base game. Every aspect of a mission is customizable: a country\u2019s alliance, resources, cities, airports, troops, veterency, troop attack distance, winning conditions, and even which troops have generals can be customized.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSimulated Politics<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom custom events to war declarations, this recent addition allows dynamic games of multiple alliances and betrayals; custom events can also be made to reflect historical events with different types of consequences (changes to resources, alliances, unit experience). Aid can also be given to allies like Lend Lease in the real WW2.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHistorical Generals<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHundreds of generals \u2014 with more coming by each update \u2014 from various countries around the world. Generals are not tied to specific units; they can be sacked from a unit on the spot and be replaced at any time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMobile Crossplay<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYes, this is also a mobile game. But it's a lot nicer to edit maps on the PC client, and there are no advertisements or micro-transactions here \u2014 you will be given $5 worth of coins upfront. You can also crossplay with mobile users in the multiplayer system and paste your user progress from your mobile apps.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbout Me<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI\u2019m an indie student developer, so this app is very flexible in terms of update content.
