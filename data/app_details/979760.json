{"about_the_game":"HEY, BEFORE YOU PLAY: This game sucks, plain and simple, alright? It's straight up horrendous, abominable even. Play at your own peril.<br />\r\nA big reason for that is that it's been created using this ancient game engine called 3D Rad, which has a ton of limitations and quirks. Of course someone who knows what he's doing could make a decent game out of it, but this was one of the first games i've ever made and i had zero skills and self awareness.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you really have to play a game of mine, pick something more recent, such as 30 Days to be the Best or Mariuccha, Alchemy Queen. They also suck but they don't crash if you press Escape.<br />\r\nLinks:<br />\r\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1908490/30_Days_to_be_the_Best__Ultimate_Edition/<br />\r\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1542010/Mariuccha_Alchemy_Queen/<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnyway, the original description of the game:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe time has finally come!
