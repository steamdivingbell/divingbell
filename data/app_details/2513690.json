{"about_the_game":"With Grapplania being inspired by 2D retro platformers in the style of classic Castlevania games from the NES/SNES days, the soundtrack recreates this unique musical style in a modern context. <br><br>This soundtrack emphasizes elements such as syncopated melody &amp; rhythms, relatively simplistic harmonic accompaniment in minor keys, and an emphasis on dominant chord progressions with descending motifs found in songs such as \u201cBloody Tears\u201d. Other aspects of this soundtrack deviate from Castlevania\u2019s style of songwriting in order to add original elements, such as the use of of electronic synths paired with real life instruments including piano, mallets and drum kits over the use of Chiptune music that\u2019s more commonly associated with retro inspired indie games.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Unique Music Tracks For Every Level<br></li><li>Castlevania Inspired Score.<br></li><li>Customizable Music &amp; SFX Sliders.</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2513690/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1689988391","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2513690/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1689988391","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2513690/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1689988391","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2513690/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1689988391","categories":[{"description":"Additional High-Quality Audio","id":50}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"With Grapplania being inspired by 2D retro platformers in the style of classic Castlevania games from the NES/SNES days, the soundtrack recreates this unique musical style in a modern context. <br><br>This soundtrack emphasizes elements such as syncopated melody &amp; rhythms, relatively simplistic harmonic accompaniment in minor keys, and an emphasis on dominant chord progressions with descending motifs found in songs such as \u201cBloody Tears\u201d.
