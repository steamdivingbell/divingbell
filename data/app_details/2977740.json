{"about_the_game":"9 new in-game music tracks to enhance Flatspace. Like any in-game music for Flatspace, these will trigger at random when you enter a new sector. Three music packs were designed for the Flatspace and Flatspace II games, and this pack is the original Music Pack 2 for the first Flatspace game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe music of the Flatspace IIk packs overlaps the former packs to a great extent; but not exclusively. Each pack had new and unique tracks, or alternative edits. When Flatspace IIk was released on Steam, the three Flatspace IIk Music Packs were revised, but the packs for the first game were forgotten. Now they are back for you to enjoy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack includes a full description of the music as a pdf booklet. Here is an outline of the music included:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBlue Nebula<br />\r\nCreated in 2012, Blue Nebula is a short music sting that sets something of an epic scene. This is a new remaster of this track.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHeart Of Greece<br />\r\nUnique to this pack, the music was inspired by the zither-like instrument, and the title by its relationship to the Zorba the Greek theme.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLost Dimension<br />\r\nThis was composed for Stuart Ashen as the theme to an ambitious and amazing idea for a television programme; an animated DVD review show set in an alien dimension. The show didn\u2019t make it to air, but the music remains.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRace The Sky<br />\r\nA supremely happy track which is also included in the Flatspace IIk Music Pack 3. It was inspired by console racing games.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Race<br />\r\nA fast and happy electronic tune, inspired by both console game music and J.S. Bach! The Race includes a fugue of two saw waves which intertwine and battle for dominance, albeit over a short period.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Space Whale<br />\r\nA track on an epic scale that began as an exercise in interleaved melodies. This pack is the only place this track has been released.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTiny Moon<br />\r\nA simple piece of music which was also present in the Flatspace IIk Music Pack. Flatspace 1 players can now enjoy it too, here remastered from the 24-bit source.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2977740/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737553936","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2977740/page.bg.jpg?t=1737553936","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2977740/f99e6a657f9c699515d5160bb661055550b9a5c9/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737553936","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2977740/f99e6a657f9c699515d5160bb661055550b9a5c9/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737553936","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"9 new in-game music tracks to enhance Flatspace.
