{"about_the_game":"Tanks in Labyrinth is a fun multiplayer game where you control a tank. You need to destroy the rest of the players and stay alive yourself. You can play alone or invite up to 3 friends. And the first-person mode will be a pleasant surprise for you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game has interesting bonuses that can help you win, or they can, if used poorly, hinder you. For example, the &quot;Wall&quot; bonus, which sets up a wall in front of you, if used correctly, will destroy the enemy with his own bullets, which will fly off from your wall into him.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso, you will really like the unusual music from Jason Shaw, which will make the game more exciting.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1440360/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1704818910","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1440360/page.bg.jpg?t=1704818910","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1440360/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1704818910","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1440360/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1704818910","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Tanks in Labyrinth is a fun multiplayer game where you control a tank.
