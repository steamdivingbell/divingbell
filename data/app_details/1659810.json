The system is designed so each time we release a new promo, it will drop at the lowest price you can set on steam (in USD), and we will also increase the price of another previously released promo by 1-3 steam price categories.","achievements":{"total":0},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1659810/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1667032119","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1659810/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1667032119","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1659810/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1667032119","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1659810/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1667032119","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,3,5,4],"notes":"Figurine Scene Simulator is meant to be a complete game which can be enjoyed without the use of NSFW type content.
