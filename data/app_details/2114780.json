{"about_the_game":"&quot;In Poison Promise, you and your Fellowship must travel across Rohan and seek the answers you need to stop the machinations of Angon and eventually confront the Orc Chieftain himself. The campaign has your party periodically looping back to the Entwash Inn, where different encounters and events will take place depending on what adventures you\u2019ve had up to that point. Gathering enough information to uncover the conspiracy is crucial to your success, but if you take too long, your opportunity to save the kingdom could slip from your grasp. With different endings and multiple story paths depending on your choices, successes, and failures, every playthrough of Poison Promise will feel unique, and you\u2019ll find yourself returning to Rohan again and again.&quot;","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2114780/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1667941397","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2114780/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1667941397","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2114780/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1667941397","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2114780/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1667941397","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;In Poison Promise, you and your Fellowship must travel across Rohan and seek the answers you need to stop the machinations of Angon and eventually confront the Orc Chieftain himself.
