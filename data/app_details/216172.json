{"about_the_game":"It doesn't matter if you are new player or an AirMech veteran, this pack is a great value. To start off, we make sure all the basic AirMech classes are unlocked for you. Not a big deal for a longtime player, but very handy for anyone new who wants to try them all. You'll also get new classes as they are added--forever. Next, a bundle of Kudos for any gameplay units you're missing, then a heap of Diamonds for any extras or cosmetics you have had your eye on. Instantly awards Silver VIP for a lifetime of benefits! Starter Pack Contents:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> All AirMech Classes unlocked (current and future)<br></li><li> 7,500 Diamonds <br></li><li> 25,000 Kudos<br></li><li> 20 Days Kudos Boost <br></li><li> 20 Days XP Boost <br></li><li> Lifetime Silver VIP status </li></ul><br>But you're a new player and all that might not mean much to you, so let's break it down:<br><br><strong>Silver VIP</strong> - Possibly the most valuable thing in the game, and it comes for &quot;free&quot; with any purchase. Similar to Team Fortress 2, once you have spent something ingame, this effectively makes your account &quot;premium&quot; and unlocks a whole bunch of benefits. You get unlimited Solo game rewards, you get to claim those Locked Diamonds, you get better drops, and more! <br><br><strong>Diamonds</strong> - This is our in-game premium currency which can be used to purchase cosmetic and convenience items or boosts. New players should consider saving their Diamonds until they know what they really want to spend them on. <br><br><strong>20 Days Kudos and XP Boosts</strong> - The Kudos and XP Boosts are shamelessly lifted from what Dota 2 is doing because we thought it's such a great idea. They are time based, so they kick in win or lose, and while you get 50%, every other player gets a 10% Boost. Yes, even the enemy players, and yes, it stacks. VIP Bonuses stack on top of the Boost Cubes too! <br><br>If you are still on the fence about anything, come ask us questions in the Steam forums, either the devs or other players will give you the straight info you are looking for. As a small developer, we are super appreciative of anyone who decides to put money into our game, and know that we will work hard for a long time to continue to grow AirMech Strike into something amazing.
