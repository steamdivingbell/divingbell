{"about_the_game":"Take control of a small team of contractors, hired by mysterious suits for impossible jobs against powerful corporations. Your contractors each have custom cybernetics that allow them to use a host of abilities, represented by cards. These cards are used in turn-based combat for actions such as movement, attacking, defending, and special abilities. Along with combat, you'll also encounter events, character upgrades, and black market shops as you explore each corporation.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">It's Called Power, Not Mana</h2>Playing cards costs power, and the bad news is each round your team's power is reset to zero. The good news is that each card not only has a cost, but a gain as well, which can be converted into power when discarded. Do you keep each team member balanced and focus your power on the character with the best draws each round? Or do you turn one of your characters into a recycler to fuel their killing machine companion?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unique Character Classes</h2>Each player character is represented by a different class, and each class has their own unique cards to build a deck from. One may rely on shields to reduce incoming damage, while another may instead disappear, forcing enemies to attack another target.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Character Defining Upgrades</h2>Along with adding new cards to character decks, characters can also be modified through cybernetic upgrades that you occasionally come across. Unlike abilities, these upgrades are always active and can greatly change how a character plays. Discover synergies between upgrades to become even stronger!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Random-ish Levels</h2>Hand-made environments and encounters are pieced together through procedural generation to build each unique level. Changing layouts, hazards, and events keep each run fresh, while enemy encounters and combat maps are designed for fun and challenge.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1074740/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1711457620","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1074740/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1711457620","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1074740/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1711457620","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1074740/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1711457620","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Take control of a small team of contractors, hired by mysterious suits for impossible jobs against powerful corporations.
