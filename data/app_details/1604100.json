{"about_the_game":"It's 2038, and a late maniacal inventor has left behind a legacy of madness - coordinates to an island full of wealthy robots, a gun that asks questions, and a widow that's hired you to answer them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs Izzy Buspec, the newest recruit to Randco, take charge of their patented revolver as you explore the densely packed biomes of Corvynnia, bringing down hordes of docile robots in a money-making adventure. Every time you fire, you'll have to answer one of over 4,000 trivia questions with answers based on numbers, percentages, geography, dates, and more - the further you are from the actual answer, the more of its own ammunition the revolver will discharge. If you run out, it's back to Randco HQ to reload!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRevolver and Co features 165 story levels across 11 unique worlds and 20 question themes which will test you on a wide range of subjects, tied together with humorous debriefings between Izzy and her maniacal boss before the start of each mission.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOr if you're looking for more of a challenge, have a go at one of the Endless challenges, which pits you against a barrage of questions until you finally succumb to an empty revolver chamber. You can even unlock more Endless challenges by completing the story levels, including a gruelling hour-long session where the only thing you have to lose is time.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1604100/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1656678550","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1604100/page.bg.jpg?t=1656678550","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1604100/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1656678550","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1604100/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1656678550","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"It's 2038, and a late maniacal inventor has left behind a legacy of madness - coordinates to an island full of wealthy robots, a gun that asks questions, and a widow that's hired you to answer them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs Izzy Buspec, the newest recruit to Randco, take charge of their patented revolver as you explore the densely packed biomes of Corvynnia, bringing down hordes of docile robots in a money-making adventure.
