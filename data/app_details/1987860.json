{"about_the_game":"Choose your ship and command it against an army pitted against you in this co-op wave-based arcade-style bullet hell space shooter. Fight for as long as you can with powerups acquired through the catalog, and blast through everything in your path.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Progress The Waves</h2>Defeat waves of enemies that will grow in both numbers and strength as you advance through the armada. While playing, you might encounter a wave with some special rules. Make it far enough, and you'll find yourself at a boss wave. Make it even farther, and you'll find yourself fighting enemies with altered attacks and behaviors than what they had previously.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Acquire Powerups</h2>While plowing through enemies, each one will have a chance to drop a powerup, a powerful item with extensive abilities that you can use. Fire a laser at enemies in your path, clear foes with a barrage of bees, or make your bullets hurt a little more with your favorite can of chunky soup. Some will grant temporary effects, some will fire projectiles, and some will grant permanent buffs for you or your allies. You can hold 2 at a time, so mix and match to what fits your playstyle.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Powerup Catalog</h2>The catalog has information on every powerup you have, with specific stats and descriptions so that you know in a moment's notice what each and every powerup does in your situation. While you only start with a few powerups available, you can purchase them from the powerup catalog and have them available for your future rounds. By completing waves, you earn arena tickets, which are spent on powerups to expand your arsenal. The better you play, the more you earn.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Customize Your Runs</h2>The powerup catalog has the ability to enable or disable certain powerups, so you can customize your runs as much as you'd like. Want to run only your favorites? Go for it. Want to see how far you can get with a select few? Completely fine. Want to run the original five? The cops won't stop you. Feel free to use any modifiers as well, to give some extra spice or challenge to your runs. Play how you want, and don't be afraid to try something new.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1987860?t=1689913633","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1987860/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1689913633","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1987860/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1689913633","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1987860/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1689913633","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Choose your ship and command it against an army pitted against you in this co-op wave-based arcade-style bullet hell space shooter.
