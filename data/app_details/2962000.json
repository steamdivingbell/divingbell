{"about_the_game":"The End of You is a short, emotional narrative game about love lost, the ghosts of the past, and the ungraceful clambering, oftentimes painful crawl towards closure. Interact with domestic objects, seek out  memories, and embrace feelings that cut as sharp as a knife.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Sometimes, you have to say goodbye a thousand times over.</strong></h2><br>It feels like the apartment is alive with the remnants of her in every corner. The mug she left behind rattles. Her toothbrush buzzes. The battered cassette whirs. You can\u2019t remember what was even on the tape. \u201cOur song\u201d is written on it. Should the tape be yours or hers? How do you decide? You hesitate over whether the tape should be tossed in her box, simply labeled Emily.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>When you close your eyes, you dream of her.</strong></h2><br>When the lights are off, you see her. Not her exactly, but the past version of her. Is that even accurate? Perhaps it\u2019s simply a version of her you\u2019ve created in your head. You see her everywhere - the kitchen, the bedroom, and the balcony. Who knew such a tiny apartment could contain so many ghosts of her. You decide what you say to her. You rehearse these conversations even though you know the ending.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Are you afraid to find closure?</strong></h2><br>As Walter, you will reluctantly pack away all the objects from a past relationship. Heartbreak exists in every crevice and in the seemingly most ordinary items. Can all the ghosts and the heavy weight of the past fit in a cardboard box? It seems impossible, and yet, you will try anyway. Wrestle with Walter\u2019s mental health, listen to the whispers of old memories, and find some closure.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Yes","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2962000/32b5c2794dc19e5afeadcecbbca402f49b467ecd.jpg"},{"name":"No","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2962000/76b1cbd912555e94be12dfe290afec06083d1cb4.jpg"},{"name":"Solstice","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2962000/bf729deed1610af619563b37ba3fb5ac1edb1883.jpg"},{"name":"See me through","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2962000/be86b61d87765f57a40393b46110d94bf79f67f7.jpg"},{"name":"Shhhh...","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2962000/405e9ee08999d05fefea89d857e880c269097b90.jpg"},{"name":"Nice try","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2962000/7614f7c85ab32f60e222a91280269d6ffd9566f3.jpg"},{"name":"Well read","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2962000/3920c0a0cacddac5c2b4210177ead6b825b7942f.jpg"},{"name":"Paranoid","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2962000/cff3b01ab1fc44f2f4ebd06afbfc29730b5de0c9.jpg"},{"name":"Bath time","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2962000/a63bfc3d65241cd48affadb043b7fe5b37be20f4.jpg"},{"name":"Moreschi fan","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2962000/8d57f8f90b88cd7f466d90325105ff24b4912b79.jpg"}],"total":12},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2962000?t=1737995038","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2962000/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1737995038","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2962000/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737995038","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2962000/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737995038","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"Some nudity,  no explicit sexual scenes.\r\nConversations revolving around child birth and infertility.\r\nEndometriosis theme and graphic descriptions of surgical procedures.\r\nAdult conversations about sex."},"detailed_description":"The End of You is a short, emotional narrative game about love lost, the ghosts of the past, and the ungraceful clambering, oftentimes painful crawl towards closure.
