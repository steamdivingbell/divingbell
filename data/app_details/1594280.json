Humans have begun to colonize the Moon, Mars, and the asteroid belt with their Avatars. Space has proven to be too dangerous long term for our fragile bodies. Space has also proven to be too valuable not to colonize. Three companies have pioneered the technology that allows for avatars to be remotely controlled by Humans on Earth. These avatars are designed to bring a profit to their respective corporations NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES, and the corporations see to it that they are well supplied to do that. Strike out and claim your stake on this new alien planet. Can you survive it?  Alone? With friends?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1594280/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1698778238","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1594280/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1698778238","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1594280/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1698778238","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1594280/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1698778238","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"New America is a FPS game - still under development and being rapidly iterated during Friday night multiplayer playtests.
