{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Repeat After Death is an action arcade game where your actions become your own enemy. Make your way through the various dungeons and kill the monster with your attacks. Repeat this over and over again until you clear the dungeon. Simple enough, right? But beware, as your actions from every character before will haunt you and be repeated back in your next. Dodge your way through the many ghosts of your own movement to kill the monster and get out of this looping purgatory.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Deck of Personalities</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Choose at least 3 of your favorite characters each run to cycle between to clear the dungeon with. The Deck of Personalities will shuffle them up and give one to you at random for every iteration. Will you combine the speed of the rogue, the imaginative power of the wizard, and the entertaining mind of the jester in one team?

Who are you? How did you end up in this place? Talk to the different characters around the dungeon to figure out why you were brought here and how to escape this never-ending cycle.
