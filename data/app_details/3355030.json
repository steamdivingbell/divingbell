{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Main functions and features</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">LuminaryPrimer is a tool software focused on providing reference of light and shadow relationship. It aims to simplify the creation process of light and shadow effects, so that users can achieve the desired light and shadow effects through presets and simple parameter adjustment without deep professional skills. Compared with Digital Content Creation (DCC) software, LuminaryPrimer focuses more on the simulation and adjustment of light and shadow relationships, reducing the skill requirements of users.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In LuminaryPrimer, users can quickly access a variety of preset light and shadow effects, which are simulated based on lighting principles in the real world. At the same time, the software provides an intuitive interface and easy to understand parameter options, so that users can easily fine-tune the light and shadow effects. Both beginners and experienced users can quickly get started and realize their own ideas with LuminaryPrimer.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">For the crowd</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">1.

Visually adjust the position of camera and light source:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The user is allowed to adjust the height, pitch Angle, surround Angle and far and near distance of the camera and light source through the slider, in order to observe and illuminate the 3D model from different angles and distances.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">2. Multiple objects:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Users are allowed to add multiple objects to the scene, one object is displayed by default, and up to three objects can be displayed. This helps users with layout and composition when creating complex scenes.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">3. 6 preset shapes:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Six common 3D shapes (sphere, cube, cone, cylinder, bottle, statue) are provided from which the user can select and add to the scene.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">4. 6 preset materials:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Six common materials (default, metal, vegetable, fabric, leather, oak) are provided that the user can apply to objects in the scene to change their appearance and texture.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">5. Light source Settings:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">It allows users to set the illumination intensity and illumination color in order to provide the appropriate lighting effect for the scene.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">6. Color picker:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Allows the user to extract colors from the viewport. Up to five colors can be extracted.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">7. 7 lighting presets:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Seven common lighting presets (along light, butterfly light, Rembrandt light, side light, side backlight, backlight, top light) are provided, and users can choose the appropriate lighting effect according to their needs. The best results are obtained when object 1 is shaped as a statue.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">8.
