{"about_the_game":"Picture the Electro-Motive \u201cE-unit.\u201d For an entire generation it was THE motive power for America\u2019s passenger trains \u2013 and now the elegant E-unit waiting for you in Train Simulator in the form of the EMD E8 in two classic Amtrak liveries!<br><br>When Amtrak was formed as the United States\u2019 intercity passenger carrier in 1971, the company was faced with patching together a fleet of second-hand locomotives. Amtrak first turned to Electro-Motive\u2019s E8 and its younger sister, the E9. Amtrak would operate nearly 200 E-units and the stylish EMD diesels became the workhorses of the early Amtrak era.<br><br>The E8 was produced by EMD from 1949 to 1954, and nearly 500 were built. The E8 derived 2,250-horsepower from a pair of EMD 567-series V-12 power plants, rode on an A1A-A1A wheel arrangement, and could be geared to operate at up to 117 miles per hour. During Amtrak service, the E8s operated throughout the country, handling both long-distance trains as well as short-haul services. Amtrak operated its last E-units into the early 1980s.<br><br>The Train Simulator Amtrak E8 is provided in cab and booster configurations and is available in Amtrak\u2019s original red-nosed \u201cPhase I\u201d livery and stylish striped \u201cPhase II\u201d scheme. Single- and dual-headlight versions of the E8 are provided as are \u201cas built\u201d and rebuilt variations.<br><br>And there\u2019s even more! Accompanying the E8 is Amtrak passenger equipment ideal to re-create U. S. passenger trains of the 1970s and early 1980s. Included with the E8 are an Amtrak baggage car, 48-seat coach, dome-coach, 10-6 sleeper, and diner in Amtrak\u2019s Phase I passenger car livery. The Amtrak E8 DLC features career scenarios on the Miami - West Palm Beach Route Add-On (route available separately) and even includes Train Simulator\u2019s popular Seaboard Coast Line General Electric U36B and freight equipment to provide era-authentic freight traffic. <br><br>Amtrak\u2019s legendary Electro-Motive E8 is ready to highball in Train Simulator service!    <br><br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The Days of Old: Part 1<br></li><li>The Days of Old: Part 2<br></li><li>Meteor Shower</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on the Steam Workshop online and in-game.
