Now they must hunt down and eliminate each member of the cult, in the hopes of stopping an evil plan that will result in the awakening of a legendary dragon, and the subsequent end of the world.</i><br><br>Cult of the Dragon takes place in a fantasy world that is currently experiencing peace. But the imprisonment of the player character is just the beginning of a change, as evil begins to creep from the shadows of the realm, and into the light. The player has the choice of 10 different characters from 10 different classes. The classes are <strong>Hero</strong>, <strong>Warrior</strong>, <strong>Mage</strong>, <strong>Priest</strong>, <strong>Paladin</strong>, <strong>Thief</strong>, <strong>Archer</strong>, <strong>Warlock</strong>, <strong>Monk</strong>, and <strong>Samurai</strong>. Each class has it's own unique set of weapons, along with special skills and magical spells. This means each class will play different, and each time playing is a new experience. You can play as a <strong>Witch </strong>or <strong>Wizard</strong>. Or you can play as a <strong>Samurai</strong>. The choice is yours.<br><br>The player will quickly uncover a conspiracy that is seeping into the once peaceful quiet life in the world. A mysterious cult is not only ruining the lives of the innocent townsfolk, but also gaining control of the local government. The cult itself has strange dark rituals, and a fascination with a long dead dragon. It's up to the player to put an end to this cult, before it's too late.<br><br>While the game has colorful and light visuals, the subject matter is dark. There is a deadly mystery at play, and cult members who participate in macabre activities. With many towns, cities, and villages, there are many NPCs to encounter. There are countless shops, stalls, and businesses to explore. Bakeries sell fresh bread. Cafes offer a break from the dramatic story and epic battles. There are also underground dungeons to explore, and castles to roam. The tutorial even features a large jail on an island that you will need to escape from.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3053200/extras/kickstarter-bar-5.png?t=1725882715\" /><br><br>Cult of the Dragon still encompasses the goal from my other games. Complete freedom. You can definitely look at the game as a medieval/fantasy life simulator.

The game is nonlinear, but guided by quests that will lead you in different directions.<br><br>Aside from defeating the cult, you'll also be able to take on quests to help the townsfolk, work jobs, and overall get immersed in the world.
