You find an Easter Egg in a quest. Then you hide somewhere in space. Every day it isn\u2019t found by another player, you get a daily reward that increases. When they find it, they get an instant reward! Then the egg comes back to you. Enjoy. Go find some place obscure in the game, space is big.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">-Space Dungeons: Competitive zones with different rules, find em, dominate em, and can you find the clues around space to find the one which will be dropping special event rewards?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">-Resource Trading / Crafting but also factory building Your economy and drones can build stuff up, but make sure no pirate, NPC or player tries to sabotage your supply chain.

When they log on for the next few hours or days, their character can play only in jail, and visitors come see him and such. Enjoy roleplaying being a prison inmate, or just use a different crew member on your account. Developing many crew members is a thing for when you fly capital ships.  This gives no one a reason to bully a low level player, and reason to not just leave your mining fleets unguarded with fighters.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">-Grand Space Opera-4x emperors around you trying to conquer the galaxy They ain\u2019t even players at first, just NPCs waging war.

Live game masters in about 6-12 months after the content updates roll through. We bias people with Founder's RP tokens some and good manner role players who stay in character(we have chat logs and even game logs). This promotes good role play even when not live GMing. Who doesn't want to bring their friends to a movie and surprise em with their own character in it? So stay in character for a better game! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">-Punky-Pulpy action, Levels, stats, skills, talents, items, fleet amassing, and great apocalyptic space plots, trippy Lewis Carrol level Mad Hatter humor along the way. It\u2019s really weird to see how this synergizes from a game design standpoint. Players naturally want to level up and power up\u2026 That\u2019s the twink min maxer in all of us. So when humor, plots, intrigue, or NPCs getting your blood boiling to action vs them happens, you get stoked, rewarded, happy and tossed off your axis. Then when resolved, you look back and get serious about powering up. The core of a RPG gamer is always powering up, it is something we can\u2019t get rid of, but the core of a game designer is to get you out of a spreadsheet mindset temporarily\u2026 And then you appreciate both more. So tacky humor, along serious pulp action and serious leveling up game mechanics\u2026 It is like a symphony of fun.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">-Skills</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">-16 Magic realms</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">-Modularia to modulate socketed items</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">REHASH OF WHAT WAS SAID ABOVE:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The MMO will contain &quot;Space dungeons&quot; which are special zones that all players compete </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">for a big reward.

Another might be science based.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Another might be team vs team.  Another might be chess team (aka you kill the king) you</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">win.  Another might be who kills a boss fastest.  Long story short, once a day, these</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">places will drop really good loot predictably either on a timer, or via clue sheet.  Then</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">most players will know where to be.  And the same guy won't win every 'Space Dungeon'</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">because the rules are dif for each.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There will be resource trading, aka, buy aluminum or other metals one place and sell</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">another.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There will be a PVP bounty system.

AKA Live Game Masters will observe the game, and </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">allow players to permanently change the history on their server.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Then later, the ability to touch down on ground, and your player get out FPS style will come.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">I have other plans, but this will be a very fun game to come along for the dev ride. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Enjoy updates and get yourself strong now, so when later the Space Opera comes out,</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">you can be one of the big dawg influencers of the universe.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Thank you for your interest!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Love is the way!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Big AAA corps don't need your money... Indies like me do, we make better video games when we can afford food, gasoline, and water for showers.  AAA just end up shutting down competition, internet search and see it's true.  AAA want to see you recycled culture, but indies make new culture.  So with your limited resources, vote for better games, by voting indie... If you like our art forms we're presenting.  In my lifetime, I made less than one cent per hour making games, due to contractual violations and the difficulty of making games... Yes, I've made less than one cent an hour... I make video games you WANT to play, the ways of the world's finances are inconsequential to true soul video gamers who make video games because we believe in the spirit of video games.  I could make these video games better and awesomer if you helped support me...But I've made video games for over 40 years making less than 1 cent an hour on my games, and I'll keep making video games the rest of my life even if no one helps.  I love and appreciate my fans and the small bit of support given... So it'd be awesome if people really got behind Starfighter General, there's galaxies that haven't even been made yet to explore.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">,James W.

Indies like me do, we make better video games when we can afford food, gasoline, and water for showers.  AAA just end up shutting down competition, internet search and see it's true.  AAA want to see you recycled culture, but indies make new culture.  So with your limited resources, vote for better games, by voting indie... If you like our art forms we're presenting.  In my lifetime, I made less than one cent per hour making games, due to contractual violations and the difficulty of making games... Yes, I've made less than one cent an hour... I make video games you WANT to play, the ways of the world's finances are inconsequential to true soul video gamers who make video games because we believe in the spirit of video games.  I could make these video games better and awesomer if you helped support me...But I've made video games for over 40 years making less than 1 cent an hour on my games, and I'll keep making video games the rest of my life even if no one helps.  I love and appreciate my fans and the small bit of support given... So it'd be awesome if people really got behind Starfighter General, there's galaxies that haven't even been made yet to explore.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">,James W.
