Here, there are not only martial skills, but also spiritual energy and technologies that led to the invention of spells and firearms. You will play as Ma Chao, master of a variety of attacks and tools, and break enemy defenses with the help of friends to exact revenge on Cao Cao for slaughtering your family.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2276420/extras/\u89d2\u8272\u9009\u62e9.gif?t=1733444295\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2276420/extras/SOD-\u6807\u9898-Multiple-Weapons-_-Synergies.png?t=1733444295\" /><br>EXP will be gained from kills for you to level up, unlocking new weapons.

It was the last boss battle, and the rhythm game played to The Final Song by Eir Aoi scarred me permanently and I remembered it to this day. So it began my journey to make a good yet depressing game like Yoko Taro did. Based on this idea, I took elements of Vampire Survivors and Taiko no Tatsujin and added some roguelike and auto battler features to complete this game. As a small segment of the Songs series, the story is relatively independent of the other games, so don't worry if you haven't played the other works in the series. If you are interested in the story, you will need to use different characters to clear the required difficulty levels and stages to unlock each character's story chapters and get a glimpse into the whole story. Hope you all have fun playing!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Invincible Start","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2276420/0640536d96161f4ceda367753e1ff3fdb3665417.jpg"},{"name":"Dawn Breaks","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2276420/43ffc94017e0db9a0efd1e37a99ff15f7066c96f.jpg"},{"name":"Hardened by Battle","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2276420/27b885fb77f4b01f4c910fd1f913bf62152d003b.jpg"},{"name":"Dark Falls","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2276420/93182f5f808960fe1dc2fcf7ed06b8b3a9774cc0.jpg"},{"name":"Living Hell","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2276420/8c32a101967f0e74fb97e26d5c115cf339a732bf.jpg"},{"name":"Back to Normal live","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2276420/500cf2cb866c251055a90d235c440dbf4466ec0b.jpg"},{"name":"Death with No Return","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2276420/2ea37959f02899928f2c9f8aef35da4dd6700c64.jpg"},{"name":"Song of Death","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2276420/a5bd584ef452c4b3f571d874a4cfc40d6c80146e.jpg"},{"name":"Fair Trade","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2276420/e48ba3c78256bf4c03808059dbe4c4ee310caa4f.jpg"},{"name":"Will of Fire","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2276420/0a69e3c3bea15a42454dbdf0f77f03506a101d91.jpg"}],"total":20},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2276420/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733444295","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2276420/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1733444295","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2276420/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733444295","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2276420/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733444295","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2276420/extras/SOD-\u4eba\u7269\u5c55\u793a+\u5c0f\u4eba-EN.png?t=1733444295\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2276420/extras/SOD-\u6807\u9898-Roguelike-Rhythm-Action.png?t=1733444295\" /><br>This is a roguelike rhythm action game that requires you to block and counter (accurate block) enemy attacks at the right moment.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2276420/extras/\u6218\u6597\u7d20\u6750.gif?t=1733444295\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2276420/extras/SOD-\u6807\u9898-Avenge-_-Thirst-for-Blood.png?t=1733444295\" /><br>This is a fictional world based on characters from the Three Kingdoms.
