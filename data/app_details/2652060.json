A collective of scientists from all fields, from the social sciences to the hard sciences, came together to devise a holistic, universal solution to all human problems.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Many solar cycles have passed, and humanity and society have now been transformed for the better. At the center of this transformation is Cybermask, an enigmatic yet benevolent sage who shared the knowledge that powered human society through a revolutionary network known as the OverNet. This heralded the birth of the Wisdom Age for humanity.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Unlike its predecessor, the internet, the OverNet is the physical manifestation of the digital realm, allowing seamless transportation of not only data but also physical matter. This advancement is possible due to Quantum Bits, or Q-Bits, a new compound particle harnessed by Cybermask that stores and transmits energy, matter, and information in a single unit.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Multi-Interface Neural Devices, better known as MINDs, were introduced to enable humans to manipulate Q-Bits over the OverNet, making life convenient, productive, and peaceful. This innovation allowed people to control tools, vehicles, and devices directly through their MINDs, creating endless beneficial applications.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Cybermask\u2019s source of knowledge is a mysterious artifact called the Hypercube, offered to anyone capable of climbing the Libra Tower and meeting him at the top. To ascend the Tower, challengers must face off in Anima Duels piloting OverKnights. These powerful robots, made entirely of Q-Bits, are shaped by their pilot\u2019s determination, will, and ingenuity, responding to Command Cards to unlock their full potential.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">OverKnight pilots from all walks of life gather at the entrance of the Libra Tower, each with different aspirations and motivations to obtain the Hypercube and fulfill their deepest desires.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">What will you achieve using the knowledge of the Hypercube?</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2652060/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731097516","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2652060/page.bg.jpg?t=1731097516","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2652060/d79f398d6e987715bab399b91a5f12d046d3a0ed/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731097516","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2652060/d79f398d6e987715bab399b91a5f12d046d3a0ed/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731097516","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>JOIN OUR DISCORD</h1><p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2652060/extras/discord.jpg?t=1731097516\" /></p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2652060/extras/cover1.jpg?t=1731097516\" /><strong>Customize Everything</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Take full control of your OverKnight\u2019s potential.
