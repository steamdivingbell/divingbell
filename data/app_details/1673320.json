{"about_the_game":"Survivor is an intense wave-based first-person shooter (FPS) survival game that throws you into a post-apocalyptic arena overrun by the undead. You are tasked with fighting hordes of zombies to stay alive, whether as a single player or as part of a multiplayer co-op team with your friends.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game gets increasingly difficult to play as the zombies grow in number, speed, and strength. You'll have to develop a strategy and constantly be on the move to avoid getting overwhelmed. Fortunately, you'll have brief free moments between rounds to restock on ammo and catch your breath.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExperience a realistic shooting simulation with features such as weapon physics, recoil, projectile spread, damage falloff, aiming down sights, and a wide range of gun customization and accessories.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are no victory conditions in Survivor, just a relentless and violent combat for survival against an endless horde of flesh-eating monsters. How long can you last before you succumb to the zombie apocalypse?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1673320/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1701307212","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1673320/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1701307212","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1673320/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1701307212","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1673320/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1701307212","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Survivor is an intense wave-based first-person shooter (FPS) survival game that throws you into a post-apocalyptic arena overrun by the undead.
