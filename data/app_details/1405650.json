{"about_the_game":"Our first <strong>Nemesis DLC</strong> highlights the <strong>Battle of Sandomierz Bridgehead</strong> and transports us to August 13th, 1944, to the battlegrounds of Poland. This battle took place south of Warsaw while the more important clash of Praga/Radzymin (featured in our Death on the Vistula expansion) at the gates of the Polish capital was dying down. Further south, the Red Army had managed to cross the Vistula and establish a bridgehead on its western banks near the town of Sandomierz, which the Germans were desperate to destroy at all costs.<br><br>What makes this particular battle interesting is that it was the first clash on the Eastern Front between the two super-heavy tanks of World War II: <strong>IS-2 vs. K\u00f6nigstiger</strong>! A duel that was won that day with flying colors by the Red Army.<br><br>This DLC will feature two divisions which clashed that day for control of the bridgehead. On the German side, the <strong>16. Panzer</strong>, on the Allies side the capable <strong>97th Guards Rifle Division</strong>.<br><br><strong>16. Panzerdivision</strong> was a spent shell without Panthers and only limited infantry, anti-tank, and AA forces compared to a \u201cregular\u201d armored division. Yet, for that counter-offensive the 16. Panzer was supported by not one but two Tiger battalions, one of them freshly reequipped with brand-new <strong>K\u00f6nigstiger (H)</strong>. Hoping to take the Soviets by surprise, the Germans attacked after only a brief preliminary artillery bombardment. As such, the division won\u2019t have any off-map artillery, but a good number of Nebelwerfer units instead. Like over Warsaw, the Luftwaffe made a special effort to provide air support, allowing the 16. Panzer to field numerous fighter and fighter-bomber units.<br><br><strong>97th Guards Rifle Division</strong> was to receive the full brunt of the German counter-offensive, yet held its ground superbly. And for a good reason. Thanks to very active <strong>Razveddozor</strong> (scout) combat patrols, the Soviets had received an early warning about the timing and direction of the impending attack, and of the presence of German big cats on the prowl. As such, the 97th Guards was heavily reinforced with anti-tank guns, close to a brigade worth of T-34/76s and T-34/85s, and even the mighty IS-2 tank. Due to the constraints of the newly established bridgehead, with its limitation on the movement of troops and vehicles across the few makeshift bridges across the Vistula, heavy artillery had to be left on the eastern shores. Air cover was also minimal, with the VVS (Red Air Force) operating almost at maximum range.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MAIN FEATURES</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Add two brand new divisions to play either in skirmish or multiplayer: German <strong>16.
