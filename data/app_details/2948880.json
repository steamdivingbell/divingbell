{"about_the_game":"The once peaceful nation of Escalia is oppressed by two tyrannical leaders who rule with fear and terror. As a last-ditch effort, the local rebels hired you, a legendary strategist and tactician, to help them free themselves. Assemble a team of mercenaries and free the country sector by sector, town by town in turn-based, tactical battles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">With Freedom for Freedom</h2><br>Complete your objective however you want, the entire country is open to you as soon as you land. Take it step by step or march on the capital right away. Build alliances and support among the locals or ignore everyone's plea for assistance and stay laser-focused on your task. Recruit an army or take one on all by yourself. No one tells you how to do your job. The choice is yours.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Colorful Characters</h2><br>Assemble a team from a selection of highly trained mercenaries, each with different skills and specializations. And opinions. Lots of them. Some get along, others just hate each other. Choose wisely if you want morale to stay high and everyone at their peak performance.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Strategy &amp; Tactics</h2><br>No war is won on the battlefield alone. If you want to prevail, it is not enough to win a fight, you need to keep the big picture in mind. Plan ahead, fortify liberated towns, train locals to become an efficient militia, cut off enemy supply lines, secure income streams to fund your operation and hire more fighters. There's always something to do on the way to victory.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2948880/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732992339","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2948880/page.bg.jpg?t=1732992339","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2948880/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732992339","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2948880/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732992339","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Violence\r\nProfanity\r\nDark Humor\r\nTraumatic Experiences"},"demos":[{"appid":3255880,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"The once peaceful nation of Escalia is oppressed by two tyrannical leaders who rule with fear and terror.
