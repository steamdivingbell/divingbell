{"about_the_game":"Dig a Little Deeper is a base management and construction game, where you must make your small colony of lost travelers prosper. The outside is an inhospitable wasteland, if you hope to survive you will have to take refuge underground, and find what you need there. Dig, explore, farm and research, and maybe you can make this planet your new home.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2654740/extras/1eng.png?t=1728894998\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2654740/extras/dig.gif?t=1728894998\" /><br>Make sure your colony has what it takes to make your colonists happy... or at least survive day to day.
