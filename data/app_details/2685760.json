He did enjoy a safe ejection from his &quot;Borrowed Spaceship&quot;. Upon landing, he can not help but notice the planet strongly resembles Earth. On this planet, he must engage with the very worst sort of villains. His skills will be tested with all kinds of unfriendly fire types such as Ranged fire, Melee, and magic-throwing attacks.
