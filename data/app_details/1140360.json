Texture Generation of desired size from sample input image with the feature of texture completion. <br>2. Texture re-scaling to high resolution. <br>3. Texture Maps Generation : Normal, Displacement, Ambient Occlusion, Specular.<br>4. Texture Visualizer in 3D Environment with direct feedback to changes made in the software. <br>5. A free Library of several essential textures of over 1600 files to jump start your 3D/2D game Development.<br>6. Seamless Tiled Texture Generation (recent update).<br>7. Image to Image color transfer without relying on external photo-editing tools. Useful for  changing color of textures as per its environmental lighting/season.<br>8. Node based PBR Texture Authoring.
