{"about_the_game":"This is a jumping and leisurely game on a ball platform. You can race against time in this game or play it leisurely. It depends on how you want to play it. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMode Introduction<br />\r\n  Plot: The plot mode mainly tells the story of &quot;EightBalls&quot; being captured by a mysterious person named &quot;The Brid&quot; in a laboratory, where they conduct experiments and pass levels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n  Jump: This mode requires players to control the &quot;EightBalls&quot; with directional keys to jump from one model to another, known as platform jumping, to pass levels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n  Beat The Ball: This mode requires players to use the paddle to control the &quot;EightBalls&quot; by sliding the mouse, and use one paddle after another to relay to the finish line. But the places that this mode can capture are quite different from that mode.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n  Loop Space: This mode is an infinite loop gameplay where you try to find an exit within the loop. The probability of finding an exit is very low, and it is generally easy to find, but the probability of refreshing is very low. The gameplay mainly involves passing levels and walking forward, then finding an exit to exit. The exit is usually a door located in the middle of the current space, left or right, and will not appear at the endpoint. The door that appears at the endpoint is usually the one that enters the next space. There are four types of challenges to overcome, Jump\u3001Transmit Door\u3001Key Door\u3001Find Different\u3002<br />\r\nIntroduction to Loop Space Mode<br />\r\n<br />\r\n  Jump: The platform jump in this mode is different from the regular jump in this game. The platform jump in this mode is achieved through first person jumping. In this mode, we jump to the finish line through the platform and then proceed to the next level.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n  Transmit Door: This mode uses Transmit Doors for transmission. Some Transmit Doors can be transmitted to the front, some Transmit Doors can be transmitted to the back, and some Transmit Doors can be transmitted in place. You can discover which Transmit Door can be transmitted to the front and which one to the back through multiple selections. Then each area has a number display that shows how many areas you have been transported to, until you reach the exit to the next level.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n  Key Door: The gameplay of this mode is to find the key in an area. The definition of the key in this mode is not a regular key, but a key that looks very similar to &quot;EightBalls&quot;. After you find the key, go to the door at the finish line to open it and pass through to the next level.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n  Find Different: The gameplay of this mode depends on your understanding of the game, identifying what exists and what does not exist. What exists is right, and what does not exist is wrong. As long as there is one mistake in a level, it is wrong. At the finish line, there are two doors. If you choose the right one, it's' Yes', and if you choose the wrong one, it's' No '.<br />\r\nThere are more modes waiting for you to play.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2573910/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1723125618","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2573910/page.bg.jpg?t=1723125618","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2573910/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1723125618","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2573910/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1723125618","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This is a jumping and leisurely game on a ball platform.
