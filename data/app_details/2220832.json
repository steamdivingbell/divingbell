{"about_the_game":"The C-47 Skytrain, which was a militarized version of the highly successful DC-3 civilian transport and airliner, was the workhorse cargo carrier of the USAAF during WWII. It also served with the U.S. Navy as the R4D-5 and with British forces where it was known as the Dakota. The C-47 was reliable, versatile and rugged. It could drop supplies to beleaguered ground forces, drop paratroopers during an invasion, tow gliders behind enemy lines and deliver desperately needed supplies to forward airfields all over the world.<br><br>The C-47 saw action in every WWII theater including both the Western and Eastern Fronts. The version specially designed to carry paratroopers was known as the C-53 Skytrooper, but were produced in much smaller numbers and generally also identified as a C-47 upon first glance. The C-47B had turbo-superchargers added so they could fly over the Himalaya Mountains or the \u2018Hump\u2019 as it was known into China from India to re-supply Allied troops there.<br><br>Over 5,300 C-47A models were built during the war. The C-47 was affectionally called the \u2018Gooney Bird\u2019 by soldiers, sailors and airmen of the Allies. The RAF received over 2,000 aircraft as part of the Lend-Lease program and were used wherever British troops saw action.<br><br>So successful was the basic design that there was a Soviet license-built version called the Lisunov Li-2 which served not only as a transport, but also a bomber in emergency situations. There was even a Japanese built version called the L2D codenamed \u2018Tabby\u2019 by the Allies.<br><br>In addition to Quick Mission Builder and Multiplayer modes, you can fly it Pilot's Career mode if you have Normandy and/or Bodenplatte modules: you'll get paradrop, transport and glider towing missions during major airborne operations - Overlord, Market Garden and Varcity.<br><br><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Aircraft 3D model developed by Ugra Media studio.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2220832/extras/Ugra600.png?t=1734534526\" /></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2220832/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734534526","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2220832/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1734534526","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2220832/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734534526","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2220832/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734534526","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The C-47 Skytrain, which was a militarized version of the highly successful DC-3 civilian transport and airliner, was the workhorse cargo carrier of the USAAF during WWII.
