{"about_the_game":"You are the Dragon Commander. Your mission it is to reunite a broken empire and become the new emperor.  Success depends entirely on your ability to efficiently rule your empire, build invincible armies and lead them to victory. Your secret weapons: your tactical insights, your leadership skills and your ability to turn yourself into a dragon. <br>Dragon Commander is not just any strategy game - it seamlessly blends real-time strategy gameplay with turn-based campaigning, role-playing an ascending emperor and controlling a formidable dragon.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Real time strategy: Command your sea, land and air forces in real-time. Combined operations and knowing where and when to hit are crucial elements of any victory. <br></li><li>Dragon Combat: During real time strategy mode, you can turn into a dragon to support your troops in combat and obliterate the enemy using your formidable dragon powers.<br></li><li>Turn based campaign: Direct your conquest on the turn-based world map; plan several moves ahead, build formidable armies and invest in the right technology or magic upgrades.<br></li><li>Rule your empire: You are the emperor and you make the decisions! But beware, political balance is easily upset. Each game is different and you'll find that a Dragon Commander needs to make really tough decisions. Feel the effects of your decisions on the battlefield as the war progresses.<br></li><li>Single-player, multiplayer and co-op modes: Play the single player story-driven campaign or test your mettle against other Dragon Knights, online or local via LAN. Start your own multiplayer campaign with or against a friend. Or duke it out on a skirmish map.</li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Enophile","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/243950/b569e039130f483fccf49ac4753eac44df2551e8.jpg"},{"name":"Henry II","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/243950/ee5b046a7d08c78c2e0c1e8ebba686f282ab4799.jpg"},{"name":"Unanimous","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/243950/4bf0976dc7bc143025de2708bbe338e3163c9dc9.jpg"},{"name":"Summary Justice","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/243950/d38052cc89b987337361e53264916dcb27f1504d.jpg"},{"name":"Nosferatu","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/243950/1608401489a089cad6dc0cb2da293946855837e5.jpg"},{"name":"Indecent Proposal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/243950/e6b8bc940b922636e7d78f7d9b21f44801f72263.jpg"},{"name":"Daddy Issues","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/243950/849332f576750296235325b82a3b5e4350aa885a.jpg"},{"name":"Hippocrat","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/243950/c3a2fd11c08ab106e62e7b22b88170fd03b0cb8f.jpg"},{"name":"Cat And Dog","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/243950/f1034e59ffa9ea865b88e626cf3d97370c7aef5a.jpg"},{"name":"Gambling Man","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/243950/7d6fe47df23e9f86f83977a857c7f5305fc1f5ac.jpg"}],"total":100},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/243950/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1568735710","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/243950/page.bg.jpg?t=1568735710","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/243950/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1568735710","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/243950/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1568735710","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You are the Dragon Commander.
