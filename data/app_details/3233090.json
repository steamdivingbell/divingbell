{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Who Killed BB Wolf?</h2> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">  A Level 1-2 Murder Mystery - Dungeon Crawl by Bardic Mischief </h2>   For the Shadowdark RPG ruleset. <br> <br>  In the quaint Village of Hamelin, Sheriff Billy G. Gruff and Deputy Aurora Briar-Rose are facing unprecedented challenges. This peaceful and picturesque community is not accustomed to criminal activity, yet recent months have seen a spike in thefts, vandalism, and other mischiefs. The crime wave has reached a level that has even disturbed the usually merry King Cole, putting additional pressure on the local constabulary to swiftly resolve the situation. <br> <br> <br>  Sheriff Gruff has sent out postings to neighboring villages, inviting applicants to serve as temporary constables. This move aims to bolster the ranks of the village constabulary and bring an end to the crime wave as efficiently as possible. <br> <br> <br>  Will the adventurers answer the call and track down the killer of BB Wolf?\u00a0 <br> <br> <br>  Hamelin indeed carries an air of enchantment, woven into the very fabric of its history and the lives of its colorful residents. Known to many for its legendary problem with rodents--a tale that has traveled far beyond its borders--the village holds a certain mystique that captivates visitors and storytellers alike.  The charm of Hamelin is further enriched by its notable inhabitants. Figures such as Mr. Hump T. Dumpty Esq., a character of unique disposition and legal acumen, and Matilda Goose, whose storytelling prowess keeps the lore of the land alive and contributes to the village's fabled reputation. Additionally, the celebrated Cinderella, once a humble resident before winning the Royal Lottery, adds a touch of real-life fairy tale to the village's legacy. <br> <br> <br>  16 Beautiful Maps - Dozens of fun fairy tale-based NPCs - 36 NPC/Monster Tokens - 13 New Monsters - A mix of murder mystery and dungeon crawl. <br> <br> <br>  All written work is by the adventure creator and is a live creation with many humorous fairy tale references.\u00a0\u00a0 <br> <br> <br>  Images created using Midjourney Ai. <br>   <br>  Maps created using Dungeondraft. <br>   <br>  Map Assets by Forgotten Adventures <br> <br>   Adventure Written and adapted to Fantasy Grounds by David Cole  In Collaboration with Drew &quot;Jinjeet&quot; Phillbrick, Taketoshi Kiyota, PE., Alan &quot;Vonwilli&quot; Williams, Brenay Torres <br>  <br> &quot;","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3233090?t=1728398202","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3233090?t=1728398202","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3233090/6d15b69615e3e9dfe68a78ce4b1ac80bdaa550d2/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728398202","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3233090/6d15b69615e3e9dfe68a78ce4b1ac80bdaa550d2/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728398202","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Who Killed BB Wolf?</h2> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">  A Level 1-2 Murder Mystery - Dungeon Crawl by Bardic Mischief </h2>   For the Shadowdark RPG ruleset. <br> <br>  In the quaint Village of Hamelin, Sheriff Billy G.
