{"about_the_game":"The world is riddled with monsters. The people need a hero and you need to serve them ale. You are a tavern barkeep and heroes are thirsty. Collect special ingredients to make ale for them, give them unique weapons from the blacksmith, organize the heroes into parties, and send them on quests. If they survive you might gain a little reputation and the ability to attract more patrons. Returning patrons will have become stronger and can be sent on more difficult quests.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2685520/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1699644592","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2685520/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1699644592","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2685520/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1699644592","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2685520/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1699644592","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Use of Alcohol and mentions of Fantasy Killing and Death"},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"The world is riddled with monsters.
