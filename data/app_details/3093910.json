She confronts a Necromancer named Erasmus, who seeks to capture dark elves to exploit their superior physiques for creating formidable undead warriors. As you rescue these elves and bring them back to your village, you will gain access to new gear and skills, culminating in an epic final dungeon.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3093910/extras/mq_air_dash_to_slash.gif?t=1739702814\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3093910/extras/MQ_Game_Header.png?t=1739702814\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">MegaQuest is a unique blend of various gaming elements, combining the rendering and movement styles reminiscent of titles like <i>Metroid Dread</i> and <i>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</i>, infused with roguelite mechanics akin to <i>Dead Cells</i>. The gameplay pays tribute to classic Castlevania-inspired games, such as <i>Bloodstained</i>, all set within a richly crafted fantasy realm inhabited by dark elves.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3093910/extras/mq_bone_thrower_2.gif?t=1739702814\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The primary focus is on gameplay rather than artistic presentation. We prioritize responsive controls over perfect animation, emphasizing the importance of fluid movement. Players will experience traditional mechanics like evades, slides, dashes, and double jumps, while also harnessing the power of shadow magic to perform shadow steps, teleportation, and gating. This combination of mana and stamina-based movements introduces exciting new skills for players to master as they traverse the dark elf world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Exploration is a key aspect of the game, with a magic-based travel system allowing players to gate between cities and bind points, as well as teleport short distances using portals that function like a breadcrumb trail. The world is designed to encourage thorough exploration, rewarding players who seek out hidden treasures and secrets. Combat mechanics draw inspiration from classic RPGs, featuring damage types, armor, and resistances, while incorporating roguelite elements that add unpredictability to gameplay. Players will find a robust ability-based combat system, allowing for extensive customization of their loadouts to suit their playstyle.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We also intend to eliminate elements that players find frustrating, such as tedious corpse runs and unnecessary death penalties. Our focus is on enhancing the enjoyable aspects of the game. This title is designed for those who are already enthusiastic supporters of the genre.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3093910/extras/mq_ornate_spacer.png?t=1739702814\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3093910/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1739702814","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3093910/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1739702814","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3093910/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739702814","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3093910/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739702814","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3093910/extras/mq_story_header.png?t=1739702814\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In this narrative, you will take on the role of Vivian, a hunter dedicated to safeguarding her noble dark elf heritage.
