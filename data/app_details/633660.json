{"about_the_game":"<strong>Onimod Land</strong> is real-time strategy game. The premise of the game centers around a conflict between inhabiting aboriginals and settlers from space as they both try to colonize a planet. The number of units is almost limitless, which makes for gi-normously impressive battles with lot of tanks, helicopters, catapults, etc. Each race has a unique set of skills (technologies or magic spells) with more than 30 upgrades. The AI of the units allows them to help each other during a battle, repair broken buildings, etc. Game networking supports up to 8 players. The game mechanics allow players to declare (or break) political alliances. There are 5 campaigns and 30 maps in the game.

Beating this game with it's brutal efficiency and crafty knack for making shrewd decisions is quite a challenge.
