Don't like a card or no longer need it? Place it in the Randomiser to change it to something more useful (hopefully). And many more ways to get cards with card effects that you want, and remove those that you don't.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Survive and thrive: strategically build your cards and deck to leverage powerful interactions while gaining favour to make allies and progress.
