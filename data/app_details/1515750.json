{"about_the_game":"You dreamed all your life about joining the ranks of Star Squadron, the famed interstellar supergroup of heroic, larger-than-life figures. Danger, intrigue and cosmic adventure await you- but first you'll need to pass your basic piloting exam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUntil they can trust you with their multi-trillion credit spacecraft, you'll need to prove yourself in this T71 Kestral, a rather care-worn training craft whose only weapon shoots ping pong balls. Yes, it's a tad under-powered but the T71 more than makes up for this with rustic charm. You'll love it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter the &quot;incident&quot; during an earlier attempt, Squadron officials have set up a series of driving test courses in a seemingly harmless derelict space freighter. What could go wrong? Naturally, it would be decidedly non-ideal for you to run into hostile life forms. We ran a scan and are 90% sure-ish that you won't see any. If you do, maybe you can find a way to dispatch them passively. You'll figure it out- or maybe you won't. How exciting!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nZip around through fifteen exciting levels over 5 separate environoments in your quest for the Star Squadron Pilot's License.<br />\r\nFind the hidden tokens in each stage to open up later courses. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne request: please do try not to die. It results in a lot of cumbersome admin and could result in damage to the T71. Also, your demise would go down on your permanent record, so yeah, try to avoid dying.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"I Feel MT Inside","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1515750/419d2dd12e0a04ee87eea4bbb33d62d5f65b6329.jpg"},{"name":"Running on MT, Running Blind","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1515750/8b8cfd213508a853fa5b3dfcec6156e0e6712187.jpg"},{"name":"You Showed Those MT Things Who Is the Boss of Them","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1515750/d85d1c03c7a80621c6a8e0edd399db1bd91dc803.jpg"},{"name":"That License, Tho","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1515750/3388cf5fd3e1ad04a86051e89d16bf2419bdad03.jpg"}],"total":4},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1515750/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1614976512","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1515750/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1614976512","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1515750/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1614976512","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1515750/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1614976512","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You dreamed all your life about joining the ranks of Star Squadron, the famed interstellar supergroup of heroic, larger-than-life figures.
