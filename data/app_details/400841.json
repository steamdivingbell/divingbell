NOT THE HEROES. Just the skins for those heroes. Watch the video and look at the screenshots. They're horror-tastic. <br><br><strong>Q: What happens if I don't own any of those heroes already? </strong><br>A: The skin for the heroes will wait in your account in-game. When each hero is on free rotation or you choose to buy them, it will become available immediately. The skins are yours and you own them, no matter what.  <br><br><strong>Q: What happens if I bought one of these skins from the game store already? </strong><br>A: You buy this pack and get the six. If you've bought one already, that's AWESOME but alas it won't be replaced for anything else. <br><br><strong>Q: I skipped straight to this question, what have I missed?</strong><br>A: TL;DR - Get the pack already and save on the price of these skins. <br><br><strong>Q: Anything else?</strong> <br>A: Negative.
