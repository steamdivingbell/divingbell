{"about_the_game":"The music in Unfair Rampage: Knightfall is a long single track of 13 minutes and 51 seconds composed by Imphenzia. It is heavily inspired by chip music and retro games with a modern set of sounds and a fast pace to keep up with the rapid gameplay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe intensity increases over time and recognizable sections help players determine their level of progression. In the game, the music starts over each time you start so the soundtrack was released for players who want to enjoy the entire piece of the music without sound effects. Thank you for buying the soundtrack and for supporting the development of this and future games by Imphenzia!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3200390/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727888913","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3200390/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1727888913","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3200390/724fd53dc19e5b1f16c4c2a91a4a222a1eb7593c/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727888913","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3200390/724fd53dc19e5b1f16c4c2a91a4a222a1eb7593c/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727888913","categories":[{"description":"Additional High-Quality Audio","id":50}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The music in Unfair Rampage: Knightfall is a long single track of 13 minutes and 51 seconds composed by Imphenzia.
