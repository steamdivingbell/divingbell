The first Japanese kunoichi in 16th-c. Europe in an extraordinary tale of revenge from beyond the grave. Swing a katana, move like a ninja, seduce like a geisha, and unleash vampiric powers. Learn from your mistakes.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Set in the late 1500s during Japan\u2019s Sengoku period, BANSHEE follows a female shinobi-samurai (kunoichi) on a covert mission. She arrives in Europe with the first Japanese Embassy. Betrayed and gruesomely killed, she rises as a powerful demon akin to European banshees, vampyrs or strigas.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2989840/extras/11.gif?t=1727369649\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">She tries to restore the karmic order by taking revenge on her murderers - but this isn\u2019t enough. As a demoness she realizes she needs to help free other restless spirits. There is no escape for her from the foreign world - not even in death. It always ends with her immortal soul returning to her mortal body. Will you find a way to change her destiny?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2989840/extras/3.gif?t=1727369649\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As the player, you will devour or banish restless souls to grow in strength, uncover secrets, and navigate the shadows.
