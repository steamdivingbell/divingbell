{"about_the_game":"<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Purchase of this base game includes the first chapter. Further chapters are DLCs.<br><br>Following a mysterious message from an old friend, you drive to an abandoned estate shrouded in mystery and decay. The air is thick with the scent of damp wood and overgrown vegetation as you approach the looming structure. Before you even reach the entrance, a figure emerges from the shadows, and everything goes black.<br><br>You awaken in a dimly lit, decrepit room inside the estate, your head throbbing and your senses disoriented. The walls are covered in peeling wallpaper, and the faint sound of whispers seems to echo through the corridors. Disoriented and alone, you realize that your only goal is to escape this nightmarish place as quickly as possible.<br><br>As you navigate the eerie surroundings, you uncover dark secrets hidden within the estate. Cryptic notes, disturbing artifacts, and fragmented memories hint at a sinister history connected to your friend's message. The shadows seem to move on their own, and you can't shake the feeling that you're being watched.
