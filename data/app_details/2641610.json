Originally a 3 month game jam, Golems and Gnomes continued on as a study to learn all aspects of game development, including launching it to market.  Play missions in the Farm, Gnome Village, and Golem Town~ throwing rocks at gnomes and golems and other enemies till all the targets are defeated, unlocking new missions. Collect keys and money which can be used with NPCs to unlock new item drops and open treasures.
