Do you prefer a fish with bright stripes or something more subtle like soft scales? The choice is yours!</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Dynamic Life Cycle:</strong> Watch as your fish grow, breed, and pass on their traits to the next generation. Each fish is a small work of art that evolves before your eyes.

Each fish has a value that varies based on its growth stage and the stars it earns.

The more stars a fish has, the more valuable it is, and you can breed it to pass down even more value to its offspring!</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Buying New Fish:</strong> Use the money you earn from selling your fish to acquire new ones or improve your aquarium. The combination of rare, well-designed fish with many generations behind them can bring great profits.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Star System:</strong> When a fish reaches adulthood, it receives between 1 to 5 stars, depending on its price and special traits. A 5-star fish is a true gem in the aquarium, and its sale can generate significant revenue to reinvest in new creations.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Strategic Reinvestment:</strong> Sell and breed your higher-star fish to generate income and use those resources to buy unique fish or expand your personalized fish collection. This cycle allows you to continually improve your aquarium and reach greater achievements.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>What Makes It Special?</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is not just a game; it\u2019s a unique creative relaxation experience in the form of desktop pets.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Whether you\u2019re looking for a game to unwind with while you work or want to test your skills as a creator and seller of rare fish, this digital aquarium will keep you hooked!</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3315190/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733144538","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3315190/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1733144538","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3315190/d2bffa9d4c0f69ad7a06319c4a2fb8e646c7cc1a/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733144538","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3315190/d2bffa9d4c0f69ad7a06319c4a2fb8e646c7cc1a/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733144538","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Welcome to Acuaria!</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Imagine turning your desktop into a vibrant and relaxing pond where you can design and care for your own fish while working or performing other tasks on your PC.
