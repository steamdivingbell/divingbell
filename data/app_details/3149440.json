{"about_the_game":"The zombies have arrived!<br><br>Grab your friends and escape Auda City, which has come under attack from the living dead. Use your superior skills in various weapons to beat back the repeated assaults of the non-stop threat of zombies to escape alive, and hopefully together. Featuring over 20 different weapons, dozens of characters to choose from, and a map big enough to get lost in, you will use the tools at your disposal to survive the night and escape to freedom. Play alone, or with friends, and shoot as many zombies as you want. There is no peaceful route, you must deliver the zombies back to where they came from in order to survive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Game Modes </h2>If you like playing alone, you can rampage through the city without consideration to others. Pick your loadout, and relish in the carnage.<br><br>If you like playing with friends, you and your buddies can scrounge together an unstoppable array of firepower to lay waste to the unwanted visitors of your city.<br><br>Feeling too easy? Bump up the difficulty to increase the carnage and mayhem. Only you can decide how many bodies to stack on this night.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Highlights </h2>From pistols to miniguns, hand grenades to dedicated air support, you will find what you like and set the bar for carnage.<br>An original sound track by Catastrophe Games' own DJ<br>Optimization to ensure the game can run on a potato<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Developer's Note to the community </h2>I am forever indebted to the Steam community and the people who make this dream a reality. Whether you buy the game or not, we at Catastrophe Games look forward to bringing you new content and fun games, and we hope that Audacity sets a good bar for what we plan to deliver moving forward.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3149440/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1723573087","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3149440/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1723573087","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3149440/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1723573087","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3149440/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1723573087","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"The zombies have arrived!<br><br>Grab your friends and escape Auda City, which has come under attack from the living dead.
