While on your mission you find yourself discovering ancient ruins, new creatures, and ancient powers.

In a future where most of humanity has left Earth for the stars, a research crew was orbiting the blue planet when a meteor storm took them by surprise. After splash landing on Earth, you are deployed in a submersible to recover the crew with the help of your off-planet mate, Miller. During the recovery mission, you encounter ancient text and creatures that seem to be protecting something. But what?
