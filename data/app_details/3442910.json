Its skyline is more impressive than that of other large cities; its metropolis was spread over such vast plains that the buildings could be seen for miles. It was a city full of steam powered cars, fog, and stubborn steampunks. Its people are such a vivid mixture of races, languages, and colors that they seemed to shine in the lights of the city.

An essential part of this plan was they supplied basic foodstuffs to the people. The steambots kept a close eye on these people. Some did not have the strength to fight against them, but they still had courage. The factory was not interested in the issue of the safety of the streets, which are the living space of the public.
