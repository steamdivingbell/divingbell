{"about_the_game":"Dehoarder 2 is a Life Simulator where you take control of the life of Harry the Hilldale Hoarder. You must help Harry to get his life in order before the building inspector fines him into oblivion and forecloses on the family home. But change comes hard for Harry, and at first he will only be willing to part with the simplest of things and do a minimum of work.<br><br>As he gains confidence and willpower from cleaning up his life, he will be able to dispose of progressively more significant items. In addition to parting with more of his hoard, Harry's increased willpower will allow him to gradually face other challenges in life, like making healthy meals, establishing a career in order to secure a steady income, and confronting a boorish and bullying neighbor.<br><br>Harry doesn't have to do it all alone, though. His best friend Joe is concerned about Harry's well-being, and is willing to lend help if Harry is willing to accept that help.<br><br>With a steady income, healthier body, and cleaner home, Harry will be able to begin the long-overdue task of remodeling and redecorating the house, though the struggle against Harry's hoarding impulses continues.<br><br>&quot;Dehoarder 2&quot; expands on the concept of the first Dehoarder game with a full 2-bedroom house set on a beautiful suburban lane, and a story about a personal quest for healing, growth, and self-realization. In addition to having to sort through all of the junk he has hoarded, Harry must also face and overcome an onslaught of problems both self-inflicted and externally imposed.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\ud83c\udfadDripping With Parody, Sarcasm, and Humor\ud83c\udfad</h2>Through the casual intermixing of existing Smiling Cat game worlds, a new world called &quot;Parallodia&quot; was accidentally created during the development of Dehoarder 2. The whole world seems to exist as a parody to our world. There are some anachronistic tendencies, and it appears to be our world as seen through the fun house mirror, you know, the mirror that makes us look silly and ridiculous. Jokes hide everywhere, even in the names of simple things.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\ud83c\udfe1Full House and Yard to Dehoard\ud83c\udfe1</h2>A two bedroom, one bath single family home set on a lot spanning over half an acre provides the perfect setting for your dehoarding adventures.
