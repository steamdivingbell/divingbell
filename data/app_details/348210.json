Every couple of levels, the tower will increase in level and the overall strength of foes it throws at you.<br />\r\n\u00b7         New Dynamic Crafting!

Once you leave the tower, you\u2019ll have to start back at the bottom of the floor; so do not leave if your adventurers have life left in them! <br />\r\n\u00b7         Time stops completely while in the tower! Your adventurers will not age! Time will not pass! Miraj won't even be able to invade your towns! Not even Doctors have any power here!<br />\r\n\u00b7         No Endurance Costs!
