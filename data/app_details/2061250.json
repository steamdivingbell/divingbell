Be it normal interactions with family or friends or some of the wackier story elements further in, there is enough to keep any player satisfied. If you\u2019re looking to escape on a whimsical trip, Shin-chan: Me and the Professor on Summer Vacation -The Endless Seven-Day Journey- is a fantastic choice.\u201d<br>9/10 \u2013 But Why Tho?<br><br>\u201cApart from mashing together two classic Japanese IPs, Shin chan: The Endless Seven-Day Journey mashes together some quite contradictory concepts and comes up with something special. You have the directionless, simple adventures of a child\u2019s curiosity on a rural holiday, but they\u2019re interrupted quite suddenly by a tightly directed (and completely absurd) plot. Wacky sitcom energy quickly becomes the drive and purpose in a game that could have been merely a wholesome meander-em-up. So there is the soothing magic of endless days running round fields and just seeing what catches the imagination, but also a heavy steer to play a story from end to end, packaging the never-ending summer into a punchy and dynamic 15-20 hours. Knowing now what Kureshin and Bokunatsu are, if you think you like the idea of mixing the two, this game is very easy to recommend.\u201d<br>8/10 \u2013 Nintendo Life<br><br>\u201cFans of Shin-chan, Bokunatsu, Attack of the Friday Monsters, or those who just enjoy a bit of slow-life low-pressure adventure will likely appreciate Shin chan: Me and the Professor on Summer Vacation. It could be a little fuller, and I don\u2019t know how to feel about how it wraps up its story, but it\u2019s unique, silly, and nostalgic in all the right ways.\u201d<br>8/10 \u2013
