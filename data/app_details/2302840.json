However, it is locked in a deadly struggle with Venice, for resources and power, centered around the richest of its provinces, crete. You are an impoverished patrician from Venice, exiled in Istanbul. The accidental discovery of a mysterious compass sets you on a course for vengeance against the Ottoman commander responsible for the death of your family and your disgrace.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Vendetta Across Worlds</h2><br>The Compass is your only chance at finding justice. By day, explore the meticulously recreated Istanbul at its richest and most beautiful, running into characters ripped straight from the pages of history. Meet Ahmed Dede, astronomer, poet, and historian, who played an unlikely role in your hero's past, and a vital ally of Sultan Mehmed IV, whose rule saw the Empire reach its greatest territorial extent.<br><br>By night, descend into Fitrat, the realm of dreams where everything is possible. Draw and redraw the course of your destiny, peer into the lives of others, from petty merchants to mighty kings. But beware, the compass can only take you so far. Beyond that, you'll need strength of arms, wits, and a keen eye for secrets.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Overcome, Grow, Conquer</h2><br>Every time you descend into Fitrat, you have the opportunity to grow stronger and push closer to the truth. Fight enemies trying to keep you from changing fate, using a light RPG system featuring skills, weapons, and armor to build your disgraced patrician the way you like.<br><br>But this realm is more than just violence: You'll need to explore in depth, tackle challenging puzzles and show off your agility in platforming sections, if you want to learn the complete truth. The Compass will be your irreplaceable aid.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Blend of Reality and Fantasy</h2><br>Compass of Destiny was created using meticulous research, to give you an authentic glimpse into the Ottoman Empire at its peak, challenged for supremacy by the Serene Republic of Venice. The brutal Cretan War defined the balance of power in the Mediterraneans for centuries to come, making it the perfect moment in history to combine with exploring fantasy concepts and the personal struggles of people caught in the middle of a titanic struggle between superpowers.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Let the Game Begin","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2302840/7b593c3a35b93c9b22059a0d7d1d203e6ad55e91.jpg"},{"name":"Venice Prince","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2302840/db6526a2a8ceac1d603928a77485b47a9eb83986.jpg"},{"name":"Chapter 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2302840/f2be4dd59883940cef936f83058e89072874cc7d.jpg"},{"name":"Chapter 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2302840/4fc336720ef9773c937ac38a60b4794975401092.jpg"},{"name":"Chapter 3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2302840/8b7de7310604ba03ffb6744a608535bc23193d0f.jpg"},{"name":"Chapter 4","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2302840/eac0d12eaa6767505454ab978d3eba750d084d60.jpg"},{"name":"Chapter 5","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2302840/c97518c0b89a375b09da2cda292cf54317a7a379.jpg"},{"name":"Chapter 6","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2302840/2961312ec8d36812833b80a58596409a7cd534c8.jpg"},{"name":"Chapter 7","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2302840/2b0cd4f871fb841ea6a226795fbc819851f8904b.jpg"},{"name":"Chapter 8","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2302840/6abfea3da98c2972d86cf463db11ae4c2f12eb7c.jpg"}],"total":21},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2302840/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737221979","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2302840/page.bg.jpg?t=1737221979","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2302840/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737221979","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2302840/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737221979","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"\"This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages: Frequent Violence, Blood, Strong Language.\""},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h1>Add to W\u0131shl\u0131st Our New Game</h1><p></p><br><h1>Try Our Game</h1><p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2302840/extras/ABOUT_THE_GAME_EN.png?t=1737221979\" /><br><br>It is the 17th century and the Ottoman Empire is at the height of its power, forming a transcontinental realm stretching across Europe, Asia, and Africa.
