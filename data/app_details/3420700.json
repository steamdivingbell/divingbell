{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The near future. Life on Earth has become impossible. Your ship is one of several orbiting the Sun and represents humanity's last hope for survival. Your mission is to equip your ship for a journey to one of the neighboring stars, where humanity can attempt to restart its civilization.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ship Construction</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">While orbiting the Sun, your crew will have the opportunity to construct new modules for your ship. This is a challenging task and may take considerable time. With some luck, your crew will craft one new module for every existing pair. Occasionally, they might even produce an extra module.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In addition to constructing new modules, your crew will convert existing ones to meet your needs. However, keep in mind that human resources in space are limited, and your crew can only work on one type of module conversion at a time.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Defense</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Traveling along the Sun's orbit comes with its own set of dangers, such as bursts of solar radiation or clouds of micrometeoroids that could damage your ship. Be cautious when selecting your orbit around the Sun and make sure to construct the necessary defensive modules \u2013 the kinetic shield and the magnetic field generator.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The kinetic shield will protect your Supplies and living modules, while the magnetic field generator safeguards your solar panels, fuel tanks, and interstellar engines from solar radiation. Keep this in mind as you prepare for the challenges ahead.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Final Leap into the Unknown</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Once you\u2019ve gathered at least one of each module, you\u2019re ready to make the jump. The distance you can travel and the success of your journey depend on the number of engines you've constructed, the amount of fuel you\u2019ve gathered, and how much energy you\u2019re generating.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Prepare for the ultimate leap into the unknown. As a pioneer of a distant star system, your mission will be to establish a settlement, using the materials and human resources you've assembled around the Sun.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The stars are waiting, Captain!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your journey is a one-way path, but it is humanity's only hope.
