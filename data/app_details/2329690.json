{"about_the_game":"KOOK is nostalgia the way we remember it.  The graphics are chunky and low poly but have modern rendering technology like realtime lighting and self-shadowing textures for extra immersion, all done per-texel so it keeps that retro vibe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou play as a madman, or kook, and when the ancient ones returned and claimed the sanity of those around you, you had nothing to lose.  Insane cultists and Lovecraftian horrors lurk around every corner and must be eliminated.  Shoot everything that moves!  Maybe shoot some things that aren't moving, too, and if they start moving, shoot them again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome weapons also feature movement mechanics beyond things like the classic rocket jump.  For example, the Time Vampire can be used to fire wooden spikes into the wall that can be used for makeshift stairs or platforms, and the flamethrower alternate fire acts like a jet thrust to launch objects, enemies, or yourself backward.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2329690/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738041709","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2329690/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1738041709","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2329690/0263eeebe2177a017ae789bfd9bb3950def510cb/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738041709","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2329690/0263eeebe2177a017ae789bfd9bb3950def510cb/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738041709","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"KOOK is nostalgia the way we remember it.
