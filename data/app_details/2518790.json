{"about_the_game":"Hieronymus is a surreal journey into the works of visionary painter Hieronymus Bosch. At the precipice of a new era of knowledge and civilization, players accompany the 19 year old Helena van Aken on her struggle to find her place in the world while unraveling her family's entanglement with otherworldly powers. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHieronymus is a historical fantasy adventure game with combat elements. In first-person perspective, players explore atmospheric environments, encounter grotesque creatures, and experience a challenging story about the complex reality of psychological disorders against the backdrop of the closing Middle Ages\u2019 trials and tribulations. Over the course of the game, players meet an ensemble of historical figures that had a hand in shaping the conflicts of the early 16th century in Germany. Chief amongst them is the duplicit trickster and famous magician Georg Faustus, who shares with them some of his knowledge of alchemy and the mystical arts. With the help of this unreliable mentor, players navigate hellish (and sometimes heavenly) landscapes born of fever dreams right out of the minds of Dutch Artist Hieronymus Bosch and his contemporaries. Traversing these outlandish environments in search for the truth about Helena's missing father and his association with sinister forces, they will encounter terrifying and oddly fascinating creatures. In order to fend them off, outwit them, or even befriend them, players progressively gain control over an increasing assortment of medieval alchemy, tools, and weapons. A core mechanic is the use of an historically believable arquebus - a precursor gun that can only fire once after a meticulous process of preparation - enforcing the idea that violence comes with a cost and should only ever be the player's last resort in solving conflict.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2518790/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1691493950","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2518790/page.bg.jpg?t=1691493950","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2518790/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1691493950","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2518790/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1691493950","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Belastende Themen\r\nFantasy-Gewalt\r\n"},"detailed_description":"Hieronymus is a surreal journey into the works of visionary painter Hieronymus Bosch.
