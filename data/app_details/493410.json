{"about_the_game":"<strong>Origins</strong><br><br>Phinnegan's Factory is set in an original universe, The Sky-High City of Steampuff \u2013 first created by Steelehouse. We are a small studio of artists, animators and gamers working in Tulsa, OK and we've been making content for other folks for the last 17 years. For a very long time, we'd wanted to make an animated series \u2013 in 2012, we did. We created the Sky-High City of Steampuff and in doing so, created a lot of artwork and lore. When we decided to make our first game, we knew our universe and its unique aesthetic would be a fantastic VR experience \u2013 so Phinnegan's Factory was born.<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><br>\u2022 BEAUTIFULLY CRAFTED - You'll experience an immersive world that is wholly unique, both in tone and style. Every detail has been painted and placed for you to explore.\u2028<br><br>\u2022 FRANTICALLY FUN GAMEPLAY - This isn't a game you can win by standing or sitting still. You'll need to duck, dodge, shimmy and leap out of danger.\u2028<br><br>\u2022 BREATH-TAKING LOCALES - Fight back the devious mechanical hordes in the sweltering Furnace Room, the moonlit Trainyard, and in the cavernous belfry of the Clocktower! \u2028<br><br>\u2022 DUAL DISASSEMBLY - Experience twice the fabulous firepower with a Farraday Model 53 in each hand! Focus your fire or split your salvo while you expertly pace the perimeter \u2026 otherwise you are just doubling the danger of being a bad shot. \u2028<br><br>\u2022 COVER SYSTEM - As decorated Rear Admiral Alexi Asminov famously said, \u201cThe best defense is a good sturdy something to hide behind.\u201d Well now YOU can experience that maxim first hand with your very own \u201csomething&quot; to cower behind. Trigger the hiding hole with a single shot. Enjoy your cowardice while it lasts.\u2028<br><br>\u2022 LOCAL LEADERBOARDS - Everything is more fun with friends, especially winning.\u2028<br><br>\u2022 IMAGINATIVE ENEMIES - You will face waves of mechanized monstrosities. Every robot is unique in design and function \u2013 each enemy has its own attacks and weaknesses.\u2028<br><br>\u2022 POWER-UPS - Ever wished for a little more oomph? Perhaps you\u2019ve lamented the loss of health! The new power-up system gives you the flexibility and longevity necessary to face the factory and live longer \u2026 perhaps.\u2028","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/493410/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1504046242","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/493410/page.bg.jpg?t=1504046242","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/493410/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1504046242","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/493410/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1504046242","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Origins</strong><br><br>Phinnegan's Factory is set in an original universe, The Sky-High City of Steampuff \u2013 first created by Steelehouse.
