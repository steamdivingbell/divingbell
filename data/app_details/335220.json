It\u2019s more of a slow burn than other match-3 games, requiring cold, calculated actions on behalf of the player. That threw me off at first, but \u2013 flawed though it is \u2013 I found myself having a lot of fun with it.\u201d<br>Gamezebo<br><br>\u201cThere seems to be a movement in the indie scene towards these very peaceful, gentle, Zen-like puzzle games. It\u2019s like developers are deconstructing what a game is, reinventing what has traditionally been a very challenge-driven, competitive, high-pressure medium.
