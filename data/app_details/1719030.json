{"about_the_game":"<strong>Terraform Inc</strong> is a well-known hyperspace terraforming guild with branches in every galaxy. It purchases, modifies, and sells planets across known space - no questions asked. As a fresh employee, you are opening a new branch in a recently opened region of hyperspace. You will be building a network of geomantic rails to connect the guild resources to your customers' desires. Making deliveries will earn new capabilities in the form of spending capital to buy new components. As you learn, you will create intricate networks, tweak each placement to improve reliability, and aim for even greater heights - or just build whatever giant process tickles your fancy.<br><br>In exploring the abstract dreamlike-world of hyperspace, you will make new acquaintances among your customers and learn their preferences. Making deliveries will earn the favor of those you serve. With time and effort, you can become a preferred supplier.
