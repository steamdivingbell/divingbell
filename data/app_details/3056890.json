{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A deckbuilder with 4x gameplay</h2><br>Combing elements of both genres, explore and expand across a fantasy world made of cards to find artefacts, unique buildings and new allies. Add buildings to your deck, then play them to expand your empire, adding farms, cities, libraries, temples, ports... Once buildings are played, attach cards to them to gain additional benefits. Workers in cities gain gold, idols in temples draw cards, witches (and possibly their black cats) gain command points... Choose the right attachment for your particular synergies.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3056890/extras/store_terrain.png?t=1720578729\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Three factions</h2><br>Play as one of three factions. The Lands of the King is a balanced faction which synergises well with large empires or high draw. Babylon is a building focused faction which attaches workers to buildings to customise their effects. The Unfaithful are a faction which revolves around gaining short term advantages at the cost of adding harmful sin cards to their decks which must then be removed later.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3056890/extras/store_threeFactions.png?t=1720578729\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Balance your deck, balance your economy</h2><br>Adding military cards lets you expand and defend your empire, capturing powerful unique buildings and protecting against orcish raiders, but will be useless against political foes or building up your gold supply. Adding cards to buy more cards may be expensive in the short term, but pay off greatly if you can craft the perfect deck. Meanwhile buffs and utility cards can sometimes help your economy along far more than just another trader might.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">5 Victory Types, 10 Difficulty Levels</h2><br>Win in a variety of ways, by gaining gold, invading your neighbours or befriending them. Each faction has 5 victory cards, including faction-specific unique victories. Unlock difficulty levels to add new obstacles to overcome, to make the game fresh and challenging with each replay. With over 200 cards, you'll have to adapt each time to the synergies your card draws, buildings discovered and artefacts allow.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Worker","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3056890/5b77feb2c96965e69bd2079ab2b766c824f47218.jpg"},{"name":"Royal: Conqueror","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3056890/18326cb5606fa469eb9ecaf5a127822066c53c1b.jpg"},{"name":"Royal: Diplomat","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3056890/f7ecf8607cddcb33118c4be4ac7b4f7b76a90e68.jpg"},{"name":"Royal: Emperor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3056890/73c8aa7844458bcaa0f4b0584f24a153b92ee508.jpg"},{"name":"Royal: Midas","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3056890/014d13fe6563d80db65d748cdd74d3dc7b952a05.jpg"},{"name":"Royal: World","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3056890/90cbfe15a422343302a17eb9b06335fea74d273b.jpg"},{"name":"Babylon: Warlord","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3056890/6d49366cfdb9ed589b89e1ee4d6d7dabee32590f.jpg"},{"name":"Babylon: Emissary","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3056890/1581a69657e1f004de194b7cf9ce886899f17461.jpg"},{"name":"Babylon: Law","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3056890/99739de9e7f8bf653abed0f1f55f9b0455a69ab6.jpg"},{"name":"Babylon: Monument","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3056890/65cc78e40bca0dc1f349c09ef9b348d01f201592.jpg"}],"total":25},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3056890/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1720578729","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3056890/page.bg.jpg?t=1720578729","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3056890/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1720578729","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3056890/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1720578729","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A deckbuilder with 4x gameplay</h2><br>Combing elements of both genres, explore and expand across a fantasy world made of cards to find artefacts, unique buildings and new allies.
