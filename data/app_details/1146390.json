{"about_the_game":"Confused and puzzled, you wake up and hear nothing but the quiet wind. You scan the environment around you, only to come to the realization that you're stuck on a floating island. But it's not void of anything, there's a bunch of seemingly random objects and items that are on there with you. Find ways to proceed to the other islands using the items you have and by solving unique puzzles. Along the way, meet other survivors whose fate and actions differ depending on the decisions you make throughout the journey.
