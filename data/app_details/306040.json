{"about_the_game":"Use gravity, tension, and wind currents to get your hot air balloon to its destination, dropping off cargo on your way, in this ultra-challenging game.  You'll have to use your skill, wit, and reflexes, to complete all of The Howler's dozens of levels.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll art used in the Howler was meticulously created by classically-trained experienced painters.  The majority of the art was created is by Rene Petruliene: all the graphic design was drawn by hand, on paper, the old fashioned way. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Howler was inspired by Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. The game's locations and architecture actually exist in Vilnius today. Come to Vilnius to see them in real life!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/306040/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1553036489","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/306040/page.bg.jpg?t=1553036489","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/306040/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1553036489","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/306040/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1553036489","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Use gravity, tension, and wind currents to get your hot air balloon to its destination, dropping off cargo on your way, in this ultra-challenging game.
