{"about_the_game":"Welcome to Zanfium Tower, a unique single and multiplayer casual gaming experience.  The core free play game centers around Zanfium Tower, a collection of mini-locations found within the large metro tower.  Your home in the Tower includes a sweet kitchen and lounge for entertaining and you can go to a rotating set of locations found in the tower including the game room, theater, co-op office space and more*.  At each location, you can interact with props such as food, drinks, etc and you can engage the multimedia system which allows you to jump into the rest of the Zanfium Tower experience including immersive settings and game modes, mini-games and multimedia entertainment.  <br><br>(*If you own the Zanfium Tower Premium Content DLC, you get access to all locations at all times and access to exclusive areas such as your condo's bedrooms. - If you have a friend who owns the Premium Content DLC, you can visit these locations by being invited by them to a multiplayer session)<br><br>In addition to the core casual (desktop) VR experience, Zanfium Tower brings together a massively sprawling set of content bringing together Ambient Channel episodes to provide immersive locations, My Neighborhood Arcade for mini-games and immersive game modes which can be played in Ambient Channel episodes and a huge collection of characters from Figurine Scene Simulator which can be customized in thousands of ways.  Building on Ambient Channel's Scene Designer for customizing settings and Figurine Scene Simulator for near infinite character customization, Zanfium Tower adds a game builder that allows you to design courses and arenas for MNA games in AC episodes using FSS characters.  For instance, you can create an RC Targets drone course in the Winter Mountains or setup a battle royale to play World War P (paintball) at an army outpost using your custom FSS characters.  <br><br><strong>Characters</strong><br>Zanfium Tower comes with a large set of Toony characters you can select from. If you own our other game, Figurine Scene Simulator, you can also play any of your characters by exporting and importing from FSS, or use the light character editor directly in Zanfium Tower.  <br><br><strong>Locations</strong><br>Zanfium Tower includes a series of locations, including the always available skyrise Terrace and one or more scenes that rotate from the Zanifum Tower collection.  (The whole collection and bonus locations are unlocked with the purchase of the Deluxe DLC.)  <br><br>In addition to the Zanfium Tower locations, you can also install any of the free episodes provided from Ambient Channels. There's an emphasis on the Zanfium locations, such as the Art Gallery, Residential area, etc, and there are also other Ambient Channel episodes available for free play including fantasy, dystopian and other genres.  If you own any of the individual paid promo episodes, you can also install and play them at any time.<br><br><strong>Media</strong><br>Zanfium Tower includes Infinity Jukebox and Ambiance Machine. See a TV or Theater screen somewhere?  Click on it to access in-world multimedia including music and ambient videos/pictures, internet radio, alarms and event timers, and ambient screen savers.  Zanfium Tower also includes custom libraries so you can add your local and network content. If you have hosted content, such as urls to mp4 videos, mp3 music or live streams, you can add them to the library and share them through simul-play to enjoy your content with other players. (Online content, such as videos, can only be shared with other players that have sharing enabled with you specifically.)<br><br><strong>Mini-games</strong><br>Zanfium Tower includes My Neighborhood Arcade.  A rotating set of free to play arcade style games - if you've collected any arcade units or own collector pass DLC, you can also play those games at any time in Zanfium Tower.  <br><br>Zanfium Tower also converts the sandbox modes of Ambient Channels and Figurine Scene Simulator into career paths by requiring spending tickets in order to unlock figurine variants, access new prop groups, etc.  (Don't worry, it's easy and fun to earn tickets by playing their related mini-games or other My Neighborhood Arcade games which give out tickets for free by playing.)<br><br><strong>Immersive gaming</strong><br>Zanfium Tower includes immersive gaming opportunities by combining Ambient Channel episodes for settings, Figurine Scene Simulator for characters and My Neighborhood Arcade for game modes.  <br><br>Download community built courses and arenas and with the Zanfium Tower Creators Unlock DLC, you'll be able to build and share your own rich games and series which can be shared through the workshop.  (The Zanfium Tower Creators Unlock allows you to design courses and arenas in existing scenes with existing characters. If you want to edit scenes and characters, you'll need Ambient Channels and Figurine Scene Simulator Editor DLCs.)","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1599850/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1686816764","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1599850/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1686816764","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1599850/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1686816764","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1599850/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1686816764","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,3,5,4],"notes":"There is a small amount of nudity and NSFW content in the base game. \r\n\r\nAdditional DLC, namely the Character Creator DLC adds a significant amount of additional nudity (at varying levels of realism) and NSFW content with the ability to turn clothes layers on and off.
