You have multiple weapon options and a demonic arm that shoots fire balls. Levels are generated caverns in which you destroy dirt blocks to choose your path through the level. They have goals / achievements for replayability, similar to Yoshi's Island. For example finding 3 hidden gems. The controls give you twin stick shooter level of freedom with 360 dagree aiming. One of the coolest features is the death mechanic. Death is how you get access to the skill tree upgrades. This makes it less frustrating to die and gives you a fun reason to try again. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Story</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Desperate to save himself and his dying son, the king dispatches his holy army to collect goblin blood and mine for precious mana crystals that keep them alive. Felix, a goblin, makes a desperate pact with the demon Blood Root. Offering his body as a sacrifice, Felix gains immense power and the gift of reincarnation. His one hope lies in using this new strength to protect his remaining loved ones from the cruel fate that befell his brother at the hands of the king and his knights.
