{"about_the_game":"Midnight Run is a casual RPG game where you play as Matt, a regular guy who was just picked to perform a late-night food run of good eats for his friends. There's only one problem. Matt doesn't have much cash, and items he has to get isn't cheap. Not to mention, he doesn't have a car so walking through the city at night is his only choice.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2627710/extras/shadyman.png?t=1736369130\" /><br><br>Navigate through the city while finding ways to either earn more cash or get free food. Keep in mind, the city is a strange place at night, so Matt has to be on his guard as he works on completing his food run. Trying to avoid oncoming traffic? No problem. Did you find yourself feeding hungry ghost? Yeah, that's about right. A Giant sewer roaches staring at you as if you're its finest meal of the night? Sure, why not!
