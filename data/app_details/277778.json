{"about_the_game":"The classic Class 105 diesel multiple unit comes to Train Simulator, perfect for the stunning Weardale &amp; Teesdale Network route.<br><br>Built by Cravens of Sheffield between 1956 and 1959, the Class 105 operated throughout the UK on branch lines and rural services in East Anglia, North West and North East England, and also parts of southern Scotland. The Class 105 could also found on suburban routes out of London King\u2019s Cross before electrification.<br><br>Once the stable of North East railways, operating alongside their superior cousins, the Class 101, most of the units that operated in that area were based at the DMU Maintenance Depot at Bank Top, Darlington. However, some units were based at Heaton Depot, Newcastle and operated local services to Sunderland, Hartlepool and Durham.<br><br>Some Cravens Class 105s were designated as Class 106s, due to them being fitted with different engines; however they were all later re-classified to Class 105. They were also based on the BR Mk1 coach body, underframe and bogies, Cravens having built a number of these coaches for British Rail previously.<br><br>Nineteen of the Class ran as three car units, but all of the centre cars had been withdrawn and re-used in Class 101 trains by 1970. None of the units were selected for refurbishment as they were candidates for early withdrawal, however they operated in passenger service until 1988 in their BR Corporate Blue livery.<br><br>The Class has also fared badly in preservation, with only three vehicles preserved today; a number of cars were also purchased and sectioned for use as store rooms on North Sea gas platforms, although it is not known whether any of these sections survived.<br><br>The Class 105 for Train Simulator is available in British Railways Green livery and features a working gear lever, wipers, engine start/stop, AWS, headlamps and tail markers, and changeable numberboards.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the BR Class 105 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for the Weardale &amp; Teesdale Network route (available separately and required to play these scenarios).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Scenarios</h2><br>Three scenarios for the Weardale &amp; Teesdale Network route:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tBarnard Castle to Crook<br></li><li>\tDarlington to Barnard Castle<br></li><li>\tDarlington to Stanhope</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
