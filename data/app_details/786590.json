{"about_the_game":"Karloman and His Iced Muffins is a slow-paced, gridbased puzzle game with a winter theme. Karloman lost all his iced muffins, and you have to help him get them back!<br />\r\nThe main objective in each level is to collect all iced muffins and get out. On your way you will find enemies, traps, blocks and bridges. Most enemies are easily evaded but you can also toast them with your (limited amount of) stars. Most levels have a central (light) puzzle. Be aware that to get a perfect score for each level you have to get through it without killing any living beings! The game can be played in full-screen or in windowed mode, and auto-saves after each level.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/786590?t=1546258829","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/786590?t=1546258829","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/786590/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1546258829","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/786590/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1546258829","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Karloman and His Iced Muffins is a slow-paced, gridbased puzzle game with a winter theme.
