Some big things that I think that are hard to accomplish here were, that the world feels real and inviting and the game feels fun to play. Nothing is too serious  where it feels hardcore but there are spots where it gets intense and you take the game seriously, like jumping off the bouncing bubbles in the waterfall.\u201d<br>Marillmau5<br><br>\u201cThis is brilliant.  Someone else said this, but it bears repeating: the world made me feel like a kid again. It was strange, surreal, yet had it's own sense of internal logic. And like any good title, I couldn't put it down.  I thought it would be a short demo and when I got to the overworld my jaw dropped.
