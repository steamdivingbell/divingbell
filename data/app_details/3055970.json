{"about_the_game":"You are a young woman passionate about the paranormal, in search of the truth behind inexplicable phenomena. On one of your trips, you discover an ancient abandoned village, dominated by a majestic castle whose history has been shrouded in mystery and silence. The villagers warn you: no one knows what happened within those walls, but one night, everything mysteriously fell into oblivion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIgnoring the warnings, you persuade a local to take you to the castle under the cover of night, ensuring your incursion remains secret.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArmed only with your hands and a torch, you will enter a vast, dark forest, traverse the corridors of an abandoned villa, and explore the dungeons where the most atrocious acts in history were committed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFace a variety of puzzles, from the simplest to the most complex, that will test your wit and determination.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrepare for chilling encounters with paranormal beings and monsters lurking around every corner, waiting for someone with enough courage to cross into their domains.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach step will take you deeper into the darkness. Advance through dark and eerie labyrinths.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour journey will not be easy. Paranormal horrors and monstrous creatures will always be lurking, ready to capture you. And remember, you will never truly be alone; something or someone will always be following your steps, watching your every move.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3055970/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1722536916","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3055970/page.bg.jpg?t=1722536916","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3055970/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1722536916","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3055970/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1722536916","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"This game contains explicit depictions of violence and torture reflecting the brutalities of the medieval era.
