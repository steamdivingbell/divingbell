{"about_the_game":"The wonders of space defy description \u2013 so see it for yourself! Explore the universe like never before in the fully immersive WebbVR experience. The James Webb Space Telescope and its infrared-light perception of the cosmos are simulated using NASA data, along with bonus information and interactive learning experiences.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can visit the James Webb Space Telescope at its orbit point beyond the Moon, 1 million miles from Earth, set against an accurate backdrop of the Solar System. Fly up-close to Webb\u2019s beautiful golden mirrors, and look out from its perspective on the universe. You can also compare Webb with the Hubble and WFIRST space telescopes. Info hubs within the VR environment provide more information about each mission.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurther out, explore your own cosmic neighborhood\u2014the Solar System\u2014in gorgeous detail.<br />\r\nFly through Saturn\u2019s rings or join Jupiter\u2019s moons in orbit around the gas giant. You may also leave the Solar System behind and visit the stunning Orion Nebula, where a swirling disk of gas and dust is beginning to form planets, or fly through the star fields of a simulated galaxy.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you\u2019re more the hands-on type, try building your own planet or even a whole solar system. Send stars into a black hole and see what happens. See how changing the mass of a star alters the course of its lifecycle. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe awe-inspiring WebbVR environment puts users in the midst of science concepts, presenting realistic, data-based collision physics, Newtonian gravity, gas viscosity, and the electromagnetic spectrum in a new, accessible way. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWebbVR is developed in partnership with Northrop Grumman.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/891960?t=1664990020","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/891960/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1664990020","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/891960/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1664990020","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/891960/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1664990020","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Captions available","id":13}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The wonders of space defy description \u2013 so see it for yourself!
