{"about_the_game":"Return to Toronto's sullen streets \u2014 now raked by northern winter winds \u2014 in this free expansion campaign for HEXCRAFT: Harlequin Fair. New puzzles and mysteries lurk in the shadows: now monsters and horrors roam free. Even more challenging and dynamic than the Harlequin Fair base game, the Harbour Dawn campaign serves as a New Game Plus mode for experienced users. Non-player characters now act with a totally free hand, squabbling over crucial items and developing social relations while you strive to discover the secrets of this ever-more-starcast, ever-more-sunlit, ever-more-digital city. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nNew terrors are rising now, up from the lake, striving to bring us the dreams that we make: come back to your guns and your magical tricks, and fight 'til the storm takes us all.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1960290/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1650906303","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1960290/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1650906303","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1960290/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1650906303","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1960290/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1650906303","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"Non-sexual nudity and drug use."},"detailed_description":"Return to Toronto's sullen streets \u2014 now raked by northern winter winds \u2014 in this free expansion campaign for HEXCRAFT: Harlequin Fair.
