Many objects are found to exist, in various configurations of blocking and allowing, danger and safety. Redbeard finds himself treading near to Gulliver's amorality, in encounters with creatures reduced to mere stepping stones for self-advancement. While imposing mostly physical constraints, these puzzles also occupy Redbeard's mind as he confronts Dasein, and ultimately, himself.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Personal note from the developer</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">I'm a solo indie game dev, and this is my first outing. For years, my hobbies have included programming, art, 3d modeling, music composition, and of course playing and thinking about games.
