{"about_the_game":"A blue jellyfish embarks on an epic journey to pick up his kid from kindergarten to come home for dinner. The journey, however, proves to be full of surprises and unexpected obstacles. The bus to the city breaks down in the middle of the &quot;desert&quot; (we are still under water mind you) and only you can figure out the way to make it operational again... just to discover that you don't have the money for the subway ticket... Maybe working part time in a restaurant will help? Maybe, but this is just the beginning. What other adventures await you in this underwater world of fun riddles and abstract humor? Nobody really knows... well, maybe except the Old Ones...<br><br>Meduziak is a laid back point-and-click adventure game inspired by the classics of the genre, especially the Gobliiins series. The game is mainly focused on solving puzzles to overcome the obstacles and weird problems of this deep sea realm. The game features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>&quot;no dead ends&quot; puzzle design:</strong> if you break an egg that you need, there will be a way to get another egg,<br></li><li><strong>unusual inventory system:</strong> Meduziak puts on himself all the items he collects,<br></li><li><strong>hand drawn animation:</strong> a major part of animations is made the classical way, with each frame being drawn individually,<br></li><li><strong>original music and sound:</strong> all of the sound samples are \u201cmouth made\u201d, we do not use any objects to record them,<br></li><li><strong>fun minigames:</strong> sometimes necessary for game progression, sometimes not at all,<br></li><li><strong>no language:</strong> since the creatures of the sea do not speak any human language, all of the dialogue is symbolic,<br></li><li><strong>friendly and cheerful atmosphere:</strong> kids like it very much, although, they will probably need help with the puzzles \u2013 we recommend playing the game together. </li></ul><br>If you would like to immerse yourself in this epic journey, feel free to download the <strong>free demo of the game (about 60 min of gameplay)</strong>.<br><br>If you like the game and would like to help us in the development process, you can buy <strong>the early access version of Meduziak</strong>.
