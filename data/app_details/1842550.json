{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Rumours, Notes and Books Collection (Pathfinder 2E)</h2> This is a collection of four different modules that add rumours, notes and books to your Pathfinder 2nd Edition game. Each of the four modules is detailed more thoroughly below.<br> <strong>100 Dungeon Myths, Legends and Rumours</strong> <br> Characters may often explore dungeons, but they may also need a reason to head to them in the first place. Such a reason can come from asking around and discovering myths and legends about the dungeon in question. This supplement has 100 different rumours that characters could discover about a dungeon. They can be rumours of lost adventurers and treasures, deadly monsters and dungeon peculiarities. Whether or not any specific rumour is true is up to the GameMaster. The provided rumours can be used as lures, background flavour or as potential adventure hooks.Here are some sample results:The dungeon was once above ground, a vast stone castle of illogical construction. Over the years, the castle sank gradually into the ground, becoming the present-day dungeon. Sages say that the castle didn't sank because the ground gave way beneath it, but because of the sheer evil of its inhabitants. Over the years, the evil actions carried out in the castle soaked into the stone, weighing it down just as a soul would be weighed down. The earth could no longer support such a concentration of evil and gave way beneath it.The entire dungeon was built with a single purpose in mind, to guard a powerful artefact that is hidden deep within. The artefact is too powerful to be used, and doing so would create great devastation. It has therefore been hidden away from any hands that might be foolish enough to use it, with chambers, guards, traps and tricks emplaced to prevent anyone from finding the artefact again. It's rumoured that the last time the artefact was used, an entire realm sunk below the waters.The Fellowship of the Nine Flails went deep into the dungeon but only one of the party returned, weeks later, badly injured and completely, incurably mad. The, presumably sole survivor, died shortly after returning to the surface, despite the aid he was given. During that time, he was constantly babbling about things coming out of the walls and attacking his party.The great dragon Felurivaax terrorised the lands for years before he retreated underground with his treasure. His hoard is vast, fruit of the scouring of dozens of cities. Felurivaax has not been seen since he went underground and many think he is now dead, his treasure unguarded. Others say that the dragon sleeps, dreaming, on his hoard, and if any treasure seekers disturb his rest, he will awaken to plague the surface world once more.The legendary paladin Sir Arabal Demonsbane descended into the dungeon to seek out a mighty demon that lurked within. Sir Arabal was never seen again, but neither was the demon. It is believed that both slew the other. Sir Arabal had his famed sword with him, the Demonsbane after which he was called, and that never surfaced again either. The sword probably still lies deep below ground, waiting for a new wielder to carry it into battle against demons.<br> <strong>100 Irrelevant Notes and Letters to Bamboozle Players</strong> <br> Players will often come across various notes and letters that are important and useful to whatever quest they are pursuing. However, if only important notes are detailed, it becomes pretty clear which ones are relevant.Here, then, are 100 different notes, letters, demands, lists, reports, threats, evidence of conspiracies or the ravings of madmen that all look like they might be important, but have no actual meaning - unless, of course, the GameMaster decides otherwise. These can be used to answer the question, &quot;What do we find?&quot; with some misleading answers. Alternatively, they could be used as a source of adventure hooks or ideas.There are two tables. The main one is the list of actual notes and there is a supplementary one that gives 12 different conditions for the notes to be found in (a thirteenth is naturally neither damaged nor unusual).Most of the notes are suitable for any setting, including modern and futuristic. Some may need tweaking to remove references to magic or supernatural creatures. Names and places can be added or changed to be more relevant to a setting or adventure.Here are some sample results:Progress requires sacrifice. Sacrifice is all. Either willing or unwilling, sacrifices must be made.Ratface, spy on me again and when I get my hands on you, your eyes won't be the only orbs that I'll remove from your pustulent body. Get my drift?Reach inside and feel for the hidden catch on the right. The top will then open. Reach inside the top, but only by an inch, and feel for the knothole. Depress that before proceeding, unless you want to lose a hand. Once done, reach down until you find the item and then withdraw it.Rotate the wheel counter clockwise for half a turn. Press it in two inches, then pull it out three. Rotate it clockwise for three quarters of a turn. It will then open.Sharra, I know that you love the look and smell of fresh flowers, but can you please not bring them in? I have no objection to colourful or fragrant items, but please, not ones that I am allergic to! I haven't been able to stop sneezing all day and my eyes are constantly watering. It makes it impossible for me to get any work done. Deran.<br> <strong>100 Less Than Useful Books to Find on a Fantasy Bookshelf</strong> <br> This is a supplement intended to flesh out the bookshelves of a fantasy setting. Players will come across books in different places - libraries, wizard's lairs, in the possession of sages - and some of them may be useful and valuable. But what about the others?This is a list of 100 different, not exactly useful, low worth books that can be used to answer players' questions about what books they find. Each has the title, author and an overview of the, generally useless, contents, together with their weight and low value in GP. Both fiction and non-fiction books are listed.Here are some sample results:Lost Lands of the Desert by Cuthbert Diggerly (Non-fiction, a not entirely accurate investigation into legends about civilisations now buried beneath the sands)Modern Magic by Thalmus the Wise (Non-fiction, a theoretical book on how spell casting has evolved over the years into its modern style, largely incomprehensible to most)Necromancy: The Misunderstood Art by Raknard Drakfor (Non-fiction, an essay on the good uses of necromancy and how its practice can be beneficial)Official Charter of the Guild of Wainwrights by Guildmaster Thorp (Non-fiction, full of legalese on topics such as how apprentices are trained, the different levels of membership and how to become a master)One Last Gasp by Letise Trill (Fiction, a murder mystery about an undead assassin)<br> <strong>100 Rumours to Hear in a Town or Village</strong> <br> Players will often ask around in towns and villages trying to find out useful information. This lists 100 different rumours for them to hear.The rumours are aimed at a fantasy setting and are most suited to towns and villages rather than cities, as the last tends to focus more on urban events, but some can still be used in such a setting.The rumours may or may not be true, at the GM's decision. They can simply be used as background flavour to make a setting seem more alive, to hide important information amongst the dross or perhaps as adventure hooks themselves, if they are fleshed out.Here are some sample results:There's been a spate of thefts in town recently. Some blame that dodgy looking group who passed through a few days ago. Personally, I think one of those thieves' guilds has decided to set up shop here.There's one odd oak in the nearby woods. Something just doesn't look right about it but you can't tell what. Standing under its shadow makes a shiver run down your spine though.The village well? Yes, it looks a bit strange, all polished brass and moving parts, but the water is always fresh. No-one seems to know who created it though. Dwarves, I reckon. Or perhaps gnomes, they're fond of odd mechanical things.The serving wenches at the tavern are open to a bit of afterhours serving, if you have the coin. If you know what I mean.Tonas claims he saw a group of orcs in the woods to the east. I hope they aren't planning a raid.<br> <i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by:</i> <strong>Adrian Kennelly</strong>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1842550/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1641305301","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1842550/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1641305301","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1842550/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1641305301","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1842550/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1641305301","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Rumours, Notes and Books Collection (Pathfinder 2E)</h2> This is a collection of four different modules that add rumours, notes and books to your Pathfinder 2nd Edition game.
