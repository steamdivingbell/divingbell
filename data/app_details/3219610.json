Tetrominos, which are geometric shapes made of four tiles, drop one-by-one from the top of the board. Each of these tiles acts like a Minesweeper square, with hidden mines you\u2019ll have to locate. Completely fill a row and correctly flag or reveal each tile to clear it! Let the tower reach the top or click on a mine, and that's game over.<br><br>What looks like an impossible challenge is actually a surprisingly intuitive mash-up like nothing you've ever played before! Well... maybe a <i>little bit</i> like something you've played before.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Evolving Minesweeper</h2>Solve a dynamic Minesweeper puzzle that grows and changes as you play! The fun never ends as you build your own Minesweeper board with strategically placed tetrominos. With quick thinking and careful planning, you can build the board so that you\u2019ll never be forced into a random guess again!
