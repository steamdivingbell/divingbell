He invaded the frozen northlands with a mighty army to seek out the turtles but was defeated at the battle of Amnolamire and retreated back to the dwarven underground city of Glimmerpass.

The sirens made a pact with the warlord to take his army and help them defeat the invading dwarf King Godrin at the battle of Amnolamire. In return they promised to fulfill all his desires and he became the legendary bandit king Paolos in the eastern territories. The old legends describe the sirens as daughters of Sora that has been corrupted by the Abyss. Born out of chaos magic.
