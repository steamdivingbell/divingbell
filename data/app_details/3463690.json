{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Cast into the depths of the Cleft by the mysterious Lady, your party awakens in a realm where hope comes to die. Sojourn Saga is a retro-inspired, turn-based roguelike JRPG where you'll lead a band of fallen heroes through an ever-shifting prison-realm. Build your team from fellow captives, bond with evolving Foomy companions, and master the art of survival as you search for a way to break the Lady's curse and escape this treacherous domain.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Deep Equipment Systems &amp; Powerful Ornaments</strong> In the Cleft, ancient artifacts of power await discovery. Wield weapons and armor infused with unique abilities, combining their effects to create devastating combat synergies. Claim rare ornaments from fallen warriors and fearsome bosses - mystical relics that dramatically alter combat mechanics. From the enigmatic Capacitor to the reality-bending Ouroboros Ring, these powerful artifacts could hold the key to your escape.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>A Vast Party Roster &amp; Evolving Foomys</strong> Unite with other imprisoned heroes, each bringing their own talents and tragic tales to your cause. Form bonds with mysterious Foomy creatures whose forms evolve to match your combat style, providing crucial support in the darkest corners of your exile. Choose wisely which ornaments to entrust to each ally, as their powers could mean the difference between survival and joining the Cleft's countless lost souls.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Strategic Turn-Based Combat</strong> Every battle is a deadly dance in the Cleft. Chain weapon abilities, exploit elemental weaknesses, and deploy tactical buffs and debuffs to overcome the Lady's twisted guardians. Your survival depends on masterful management of gear skills, ornament effects, and dwindling resources. Every 25 floors presents a choice between three fearsome wardens, each protecting powerful ornaments that could change your fate.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Step-by-Step Movement</strong> The Cleft's denizens move in concert with your every step, turning exploration into a calculated game of position and timing. Study enemy patterns, manipulate their movements, and seize tactical advantages in intense encounters where a single misstep could spell doom.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Ever-Changing Prison &amp; Endless Discovery</strong> Delve deeper into the Cleft's procedurally generated floors that shift with each descent, featuring new layouts, surprises, and a diverse bestiary of corrupted beings. Uncover secret chambers housing precious ornaments, challenge mighty wardens for their prized relics, and discover countless ways to combine gear abilities with ornament effects.
