Enter the town of Spatterville where you'll build your own spray-painting business. Meet the locals while you restore, repair, mask and spray paint everything from a kitchen and local landmarks to a giant robot. Buy new tools and equipment, unlock Free Spray mode and transform the town.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1811340/extras/SPS_Banner2_en.png?t=1732217611\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1811340/extras/SPS_Prep.gif?t=1732217611\" /><br>You've got to earn your stripes before becoming the town's top spray painter. No worries, though! There's plenty to keep you busy! Mask surfaces to protect them from overspray, remove and repair objects, and fill damaged areas to create the perfect canvas.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1811340/extras/SPS_Banner1_en.png?t=1732217611\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1811340/extras/SPS_Spray.gif?t=1732217611\" /><br>Grab your spray tools and watch worn-out objects spring back to life with fresh, snazzy colors! Feel the thrill of transformation, groove to the soothing rhythm of spraying, and enjoy the sheer joy of rejuvenating each item. It's all about making things look brand new and having a blast while doing it!

Keep an eye on your consumables like paint, masking paper, and tape, because nobody likes a half-finished job. Upgrade to cooler spray tools with more paint capacity, greater coverage, and bigger batteries. Need a boost? Choose from a variety of step ladders and scaffolding to reach those pesky high spots. Managing your supplies and equipment adds just the right amount of strategy, keeping things fun and light-hearted without getting too complicated.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1811340/extras/SPS_Banner4_en.png?t=1732217611\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1811340/extras/SPS_Free_Spray.gif?t=1732217611\" /><br>After completing jobs for customers, dive into Free Spray mode!
