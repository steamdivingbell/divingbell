{"about_the_game":"SCP: Hours to Go is a small survival horror escape room game based on the SCP Foundation Wiki. A catastrophic event shuts down the facility, leaving you alone in the security room with roaming hostile anomalous entities called SCPs. You can solve escape room puzzles and contain the loose SCPs to escape, or survive for as long as possible for a high score.<br><br>Puzzles in the small walkable area give a way to escape the facility. Doing this and containing the loose SCPs wins the game. Separate from winning, the game keeps a score from both time alive and encounters with SCPs. A score and high score are given at death or escape.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SCPs you'll find:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>SCP-049 - Plague Doctor</strong> : A slow-moving aggressive entity that can kill you on touch. Disorient it with lavender gas, accessible with the camera system.<br></li><li><strong>SCP-280 - Eyes in the Dark</strong> : An aggressive entity that appears during random blackouts.
