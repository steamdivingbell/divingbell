{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3245350/extras/AdventureTime-Logo.jpg?t=1731786765\" /></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Welcome to Adventure Time, a jacked-up Rogue-like game where you explore levels of a dark and twisting dungeon.\u00a0 \u00a0You will fight the ever more terrifying monsters of the deep, and you will ultimately face the Great Wyrm Red Dragon, Blazefang Cinderwing.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">To face these challenges, you are seeking ever-more powerful loot: Armor, weapons, jewelry and spell books.\u00a0 \u00a0You will find higher and higher quality gems, which can, via sockets, be used to augment the power of everything you wear.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you explore, you will find puzzle pieces.\u00a0 if you collect all the pieces for a particular puzzle, they will magically interlock and once activated, will open a portal to a boss fight!\u00a0 Also sometimes you will find minimalist looking dungeon levels that end in a boss fight too.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When you need a respite from battle, you can teleport to town, where there are a variety of NPCs to help you, from selling and buying gear, resting, healing, hiring mercenaries to aid you your battle.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you collect experience and level up, not only will you get more health and mana, but you will gain a combat bonus, get points you can spend on increasing your stats, and even get multiple attacks per turn.\u00a0 \u00a0The game is a balance between survivability (health), which constitution will help with, combat (strength and dexterity), and spell casting (mana), which intelligence helps with.\u00a0 You might want to spend some points on luck, as this causes improved drops from chests and monsters; wisdom, which helps with some saving throws, and charisma, which increases the number of mercenaries you can hire.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game is turn based, with a mixture of text and lots of high-quality images.\u00a0 It's pretty look at, yet still maintains the feel of a dungeon crawler like Rogue or Nethack.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There are two modes of play: Regular (dying has a penalty but death is not permanent) and Hardcore (you die, you are done!).\u00a0 Regular is a good way to come up to speed on the game without the fear of losing your progress, and Hardcore is the way to go if you want the more realistic Rogue-Like experience.\u00a0\u00a0 Regular has a range of difficulties, from Easy to Impossible.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong><i>A note about all the numbers used in the game</i></strong>: a lot of players are used to integer values, so by default everything is shown in rounded up integers (e.g. Health of 9.7 appears as 10; Damage of 3.2 appears as 4).\u00a0 But the game operates in fractional values, to sometimes you will see what appears to be strange results, like a monster with 10 health that doesn\u2019t die when the game shows you have done 10 damage. This\u00a0 would be because internally the monster may have had 9.8 health and the damage was 9.3 health, leaving the monster with 0.5 health \u2013 which would show as 1 health!\u00a0 If you don\u2019t mind seeing fractional numbers, you can go into the menu under File-&gt;Settings, and select \u201cShow decimals\u201d</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Getting Started</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3245350/extras/1-CreateNewGame.png?t=1731786765\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When you first launch the game, you will be presented with a screen that lets you choose your player's race, class &amp; name, and spend points on your player's stats (see the \u201cStats\u201d section below for detailed explanation on what the various stats are useful for).\u00a0 You can choose the game difficulty, plus select if the game is hardcore or not (in hardcore mode, if you die, the game ends).\u00a0\u00a0 You can also input a game seed, which is great if you want to repeat the same dungeon from scratch. (To locate the game seed later, look in the About dialog under the Help menu.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Once you have made your various choices, you will start in town with some basic armor, a sword, a couple of spells, a little gold and a few healing potions and keys.\u00a0 \u00a0In town you will see different non-player characters (NPCs) you can interact with to buy and sell items and take a variety of other actions described in the NPC section later below.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Once you are ready, you can teleport to the dungeon (\u2018t\u2019) and then the fun begins!\u00a0 Some basic keyboard commands you will want to know (or buttons using the mouse if you prefer):</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u2018w\u2019,\u2019s\u2019,\u2019a\u2019,d\u2019 [WSAD] (or 'n','s','w','e' [NSEW], you can change this in settings) will navigate the dungeon going north, south, west, east.\u00a0 On each level, you will find a room with a set of stairs down to the next level. &quot;&gt;&quot; will descend the stairs, and &quot; so keep an eye on your health, and keep a well-stocked supply of healing potions that you can buy from any Priest.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> \u2018M\u2019 will drink a mana potion.\u00a0 You can buy them from any Wizard.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">'E' will let you manage your equipment (armor, weapons, jewelry), switching it out for better loot as you go, and adding/removing gems from your gear</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">'t' will teleport you to town, where you can sell any loot you don\u2019t need to an NPC, along with spend your gold on a variety of loot and help</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> '?' will show help for all commands</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">For a full list of commands, see the &quot;Commands&quot; section below.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Keys are an essential resource in the game, as they open chests (most are locked) and unlock doors to certain boss fights.\u00a0\u00a0 Keys are fragile and break easily, but as you increase your Dexterity and Luck, you will find yourself able to up the odds that a key won\u2019t break.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you descend into the dungeon, you will find more and more powerful loot, but the difficulty of the monsters you encounter goes up.\u00a0 There are over 650 kinds of monsters in the dungeons, with a wide range of abilities so read the &quot;Monster Info&quot; section carefully each time you encounter a new monster.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your score is a combination of factors, including negative factors like how many times you died, how many trips to town you have taken. Positive factors include experience you have gained, monsters you have killed, how many spells you cast, and the value of all your gold and treasure.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Main Screen Areas</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3245350/extras/GameLayout.jpg?t=1731786765\" />The screen is divided into in six major areas:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Main Output Area: everything that happens in the game is displayed here</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Map of Current Level: a basic graphic map that shows everything explored on the current area</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Current Monster To Attack: shows all the information about the currently selected monster for attacking.\u00a0 If there is more than one monster in the room, you can use the dropdown to the left under \u201cSelect a monster to attack\u201d to pick the monster you want to be the default\u00a0 you are attacking.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Player Info: all the info about your character, along with 3 bars that show current health, current mana, and progress towards the next level.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Spell Shortcuts:\u00a0 these are \u201cquick cast\u201d buttons (with corresponding function keys) that will cast a learned spell at a specified power level.\u00a0 See the spells section for more details</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Commands: everything you can do in the game has a button you can click.

src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3245350/extras/AdventureTime-Logo.jpg?t=1731786765\" /></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Welcome to Adventure Time, a jacked-up Rogue-like game where you explore levels of a dark and twisting dungeon.\u00a0 \u00a0You will fight the ever more terrifying monsters of the deep, and you will ultimately face the Great Wyrm Red Dragon, Blazefang Cinderwing.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">To face these challenges, you are seeking ever-more powerful loot: Armor, weapons, jewelry and spell books.\u00a0 \u00a0You will find higher and higher quality gems, which can, via sockets, be used to augment the power of everything you wear.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you explore, you will find puzzle pieces.\u00a0 if you collect all the pieces for a particular puzzle, they will magically interlock and once activated, will open a portal to a boss fight!\u00a0 Also sometimes you will find minimalist looking dungeon levels that end in a boss fight too.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When you need a respite from battle, you can teleport to town, where there are a variety of NPCs to help you, from selling and buying gear, resting, healing, hiring mercenaries to aid you your battle.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you collect experience and level up, not only will you get more health and mana, but you will gain a combat bonus, get points you can spend on increasing your stats, and even get multiple attacks per turn.\u00a0 \u00a0The game is a balance between survivability (health), which constitution will help with, combat (strength and dexterity), and spell casting (mana), which intelligence helps with.\u00a0 You might want to spend some points on luck, as this causes improved drops from chests and monsters; wisdom, which helps with some saving throws, and charisma, which increases the number of mercenaries you can hire.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game is turn based, with a mixture of text and lots of high-quality images.\u00a0 It's pretty look at, yet still maintains the feel of a dungeon crawler like Rogue or Nethack.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There are two modes of play: Regular (dying has a penalty but death is not permanent) and Hardcore (you die, you are done!).\u00a0 Regular is a good way to come up to speed on the game without the fear of losing your progress, and Hardcore is the way to go if you want the more realistic Rogue-Like experience.\u00a0\u00a0 Regular has a range of difficulties, from Easy to Impossible.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong><i>A note about all the numbers used in the game</i></strong>: a lot of players are used to integer values, so by default everything is shown in rounded up integers (e.g. Health of 9.7 appears as 10; Damage of 3.2 appears as 4).\u00a0 But the game operates in fractional values, to sometimes you will see what appears to be strange results, like a monster with 10 health that doesn\u2019t die when the game shows you have done 10 damage. This\u00a0 would be because internally the monster may have had 9.8 health and the damage was 9.3 health, leaving the monster with 0.5 health \u2013 which would show as 1 health!\u00a0 If you don\u2019t mind seeing fractional numbers, you can go into the menu under File-&gt;Settings, and select \u201cShow decimals\u201d</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Getting Started</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3245350/extras/1-CreateNewGame.png?t=1731786765\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When you first launch the game, you will be presented with a screen that lets you choose your player's race, class &amp; name, and spend points on your player's stats (see the \u201cStats\u201d section below for detailed explanation on what the various stats are useful for).\u00a0 You can choose the game difficulty, plus select if the game is hardcore or not (in hardcore mode, if you die, the game ends).\u00a0\u00a0 You can also input a game seed, which is great if you want to repeat the same dungeon from scratch. (To locate the game seed later, look in the About dialog under the Help menu.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Once you have made your various choices, you will start in town with some basic armor, a sword, a couple of spells, a little gold and a few healing potions and keys.\u00a0 \u00a0In town you will see different non-player characters (NPCs) you can interact with to buy and sell items and take a variety of other actions described in the NPC section later below.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Once you are ready, you can teleport to the dungeon (\u2018t\u2019) and then the fun begins!\u00a0 Some basic keyboard commands you will want to know (or buttons using the mouse if you prefer):</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u2018w\u2019,\u2019s\u2019,\u2019a\u2019,d\u2019 [WSAD] (or 'n','s','w','e' [NSEW], you can change this in settings) will navigate the dungeon going north, south, west, east.\u00a0 On each level, you will find a room with a set of stairs down to the next level. &quot;&gt;&quot; will descend the stairs, and &quot; so keep an eye on your health, and keep a well-stocked supply of healing potions that you can buy from any Priest.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> \u2018M\u2019 will drink a mana potion.\u00a0 You can buy them from any Wizard.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">'E' will let you manage your equipment (armor, weapons, jewelry), switching it out for better loot as you go, and adding/removing gems from your gear</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">'t' will teleport you to town, where you can sell any loot you don\u2019t need to an NPC, along with spend your gold on a variety of loot and help</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> '?' will show help for all commands</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">For a full list of commands, see the &quot;Commands&quot; section below.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Keys are an essential resource in the game, as they open chests (most are locked) and unlock doors to certain boss fights.\u00a0\u00a0 Keys are fragile and break easily, but as you increase your Dexterity and Luck, you will find yourself able to up the odds that a key won\u2019t break.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you descend into the dungeon, you will find more and more powerful loot, but the difficulty of the monsters you encounter goes up.\u00a0 There are over 650 kinds of monsters in the dungeons, with a wide range of abilities so read the &quot;Monster Info&quot; section carefully each time you encounter a new monster.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your score is a combination of factors, including negative factors like how many times you died, how many trips to town you have taken. Positive factors include experience you have gained, monsters you have killed, how many spells you cast, and the value of all your gold and treasure.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Main Screen Areas</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3245350/extras/GameLayout.jpg?t=1731786765\" />The screen is divided into in six major areas:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Main Output Area: everything that happens in the game is displayed here</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Map of Current Level: a basic graphic map that shows everything explored on the current area</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Current Monster To Attack: shows all the information about the currently selected monster for attacking.\u00a0 If there is more than one monster in the room, you can use the dropdown to the left under \u201cSelect a monster to attack\u201d to pick the monster you want to be the default\u00a0 you are attacking.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Player Info: all the info about your character, along with 3 bars that show current health, current mana, and progress towards the next level.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Spell Shortcuts:\u00a0 these are \u201cquick cast\u201d buttons (with corresponding function keys) that will cast a learned spell at a specified power level.\u00a0 See the spells section for more details</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Commands: everything you can do in the game has a button you can click. As well, there is a keyboard equivalent for every command.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There is also a heads-up display over top of the Main Output Area, which shows some basic info about your character plus the health of your NPCs.\u00a0 The heads-up display can be enabled/disabled from the settings menu.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Using The Map</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3245350/extras/RoomWithAll4TypesSmall.png?t=1731786765\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you explore the dungeon, you will see the rooms revealed in a graphical map in the upper right of the game.\u00a0 Also, each room will be displayed in the character display on the left.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The character mode map shows you the room you are in, and on the right, left, top and bottom walls there will be a letter that indicates what room (if any) connects to that wall.\u00a0 In the center of the room, you will see a letter that indicates the ID of the room you are in.\u00a0 Underneath that letter, there will be letters in parentheses.\u00a0 These letters indicate major things in the room.

In addition, all seven can be found in Town.  Every NPC but the Innkeeper can buy items from you and will sell you items associated with their specialty, along with certain other special capabilities:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Alchemist: sells potions</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Blacksmith: sells weapons and armor; can repair your equipped armor; can add sockets to armor, weapons, rings and amulets (repairing and adding sockets costs gold)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Innkeeper: lets you safely rest for 8 hours; hire mercenaries; access your private stash</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Jeweler: sells amulets and rings; sells gemstones for equipping in sockets</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Shopkeeper: sells a wide variety of items</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Priest: sells healing potions; can resurrect dead mercenaries, can cast &quot;Restore&quot; which brings you and your hired mercenaries health and mana to full, and removes any negative effects (note that restore and resurrect cost gold)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Wizard: sells scrolls and spell books.\u00a0 They also can convert your loot into magic shards, which can be gambled to win even more powerful loot!</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The NPCs in town have their inventory refreshed every 24 hours, so come back often to see what is for sale.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mercenaries</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3245350/extras/Mercenaries.png?t=1731786765\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can hire mercenaries at any Inn.\u00a0 The number you can hire is determined by your Charisma; the higher your Charisma, the more mercenaries will follow you.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Once hired, mercenaries will become part of combat, attacking the monsters as well as drawing their attacks (monsters attack any mercenary or you with equal probability).\u00a0 Mercenaries earn experience and can level up, just like a player.\u00a0 They can also die, so keep them well stocked with healing potions. If they die, a Priest can resurrect them (for a donation of course!), as can casting a resurrect spell.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Using 'm', you can manage your mercenaries, both their equipped items and their stat points.

For example, to save against a magical attack, the higher the related stat is, the more likely you save.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Stats start at 1 (very bad) and have no upper limit, although the higher the stat you are trying to increase, the more stat points you need to spend. Stat points are given out every time you level up.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The primary purpose (aside from successfully saving against a magical attack) of each stat:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Charisma: adjust the number of mercenaries you can hire</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Constitution:  adjusts health points every time you level up</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Dexterity: adjusts your armor; adjusts success rate and damage of ranged weapons like a bow or crossbow; adjusts the odds of a key not breaking after opening a chest</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Intelligence: adjusts the success rate of a spell; and adjusts mana points every time you level up</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Luck: adjusts the odds of getting extra loot from a chest or a monster; adjusts the odds of a key not breaking after opening a chest</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Strength: adjusts the success rate and damage from a hand-held weapon like a sword or a spear</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Puzzles</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3245350/extras/PuzzlesBasics.png?t=1731786765\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you explore the dungeon, you will find pieces to magical puzzles. These pieces, once fully assembled, will give you the ability to open a teleportal to a boss fight. Note that there can only be one teleportal in a room.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Once you activate the puzzle, you will go immediately to the fight and won\u2019t be able to leave until you die or defeat the boss. There will be permanent portal from the room where you activated the puzzle and the boss fight room in case you need to go back to continue the fight or pick up loot.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Finally, note that the deeper you go, the more powerful the bosses you will find.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Spells</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Spells range from level 0 to level 9, and have an escalating mana cost per level of the spell.\u00a0 In addition, large majority of the spells can have their strength and effectiveness increased by spending more mana.\u00a0 This is called the power level of the spell, and your ability to use higher power levels depend on your own level and what the spell itself allows.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You obtain spells by finding and transferring spell books to your master spellbook \u00a0(capital \u2018C\u2019 to transfer all the books in your inventory).\u00a0 You find higher level spells the deeper you go into the dungeon.\u00a0 Wizard NPCs sell spellbooks as well.\u00a0 Finally, level 0 spells are special in that they cost no mana, and so can be cast every turn.\u00a0 If you want to play as a spellcaster, level 0 spells are super handy until you build up your spell repertoire</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">To cast a spell, either click on the button with \u2018c\u2019, or press \u2018c\u2019 on the keyboard.\u00a0 The following screen with all your learned spells appears.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3245350/extras/Spells1.png?t=1731786765\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">From this screen you can see all your spells, and you can search the list and filter based on level.\u00a0 When you have selected the spell you want, click \u201cCast\u201d and the following appears:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3245350/extras/Spells2.png?t=1731786765\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Here you can select the power level using the slider, and as you adjust the slider you will see the mana cost, the amount of damage spell will do, and changes to the saving throw the monster will have to make.\u00a0 The information displayed:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Caster Level Required: what level you need to be to cast this spell</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Creature Save:\u00a0 the basic save needed, adjusted by your proficiency bonus and the power level of the spell (which sets your casting level bonus)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dice: number basic damage, adjusted by the power level of the sell</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Settings: indicates spell related settings;
