{"about_the_game":"Built by Bombardier in Derby, England, the Class 375 third-rail DC, 4 car electric multiple units entered service in April, 2001. They are a member of the Electrostar train family, the most numerous EMU built in post-privatisation Britain. Due to their high power consumption major upgrades were carried out to the 750V DC third-rail power system used on the Southern region. The trains are used extensively on services in south London and on rural commuter services throughout Sussex and Kent where they replaced the aging 4CIG and 4VEP slam-door stock.<br><br>In May 2015, unit 375301 was moved from Ramsgate Depot to Derby Litchurch Lane for a full refurbishment. On 16 May 2015, it was returned to the Kent depot wearing a new livery, similar to, but not based on the 'Highspeed' livery carried by the high speed Class 395 EMU, with a more vibrant shade of blue on the saloon doors and bolder stripes to highlight First Class and Disabled areas. Internally, the unit has received new carpets and lino flooring, new table top covers and the grab poles, side panels and table legs have been re-powdercoated. The existing seatcovers have been retained, but were dry cleaned to provide a brighter, cleaner interior. This work will also involve combining the two separate First Class sections on four car units into one section in the end of MOSL coach. It is intended for all class 375 units to receive this refurbishment between 2015 and 2018.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Scenarios</h2>The Class 375 Southeastern Livery Pack does not include scenarios but scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
