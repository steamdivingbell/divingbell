Its prime task was to study the possibility of time travel. In the process of research, scientists discovered the so-called &quot;principle of the reversibility of the past.&quot; This principle assumes that the object does not move in time in the state in which it is at the moment of transfer. Moving into the past - he is getting younger, into the future - he is getting old. That is if you travel to the past before the onset of an important event, and then move to the future after the event, it will not happen. <br>  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">During the next test in 1995, a strong energy release occurred on the archipelago for unknown reasons, after which most of the base was destroyed and the project was closed despite all the prospects.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">After 20 years, a scientific expedition is sent to the archipelago. During their stay on the island, scientists notice inexplicable phenomena that lead to sudden aging or rejuvenation of objects. After some time, the strongest release of energy again occurs on the archipelago, communication with the explorers' camp disappears, and the archipelago turns out to be inhabited by dinosaurs.
