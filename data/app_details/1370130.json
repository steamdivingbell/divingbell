{"about_the_game":"This is the moment it\u2019s all been leading up to. Those years watching your team, idolising the players, collecting the stickers, playing shoot-outs in the park and mud soaked local league games. Never did you think it would come to this, stood in front of the goal with the weight of years of practice, of team-mates, of heartache and pure joy, on your shoulders. This is the moment forged in passion. Rezzil Index Lite, your soccer practice, on demand. <br><br><strong>Take the kick, connect boot to ball, slam it into the net.</strong><br><br>Rezzil Index Lite puts you in the soccer boots of elite players. Built with Rezzil\u2019s professional level VR simulation technology used to train pros in clubs around the globe, the game features \u2018real world\u2019 drills and challenges.

Take your place on the pitch and score as many goals as you can in heated 30, 60 or 90 second rounds. Be fast but be precise and slam those top bins in. Fancy a more casual session? No problem switch to endless mode for a fun crossbar challenge or just play at your own pace.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1370130/extras/rezzil-player-smashing-it.gif?t=1627046480\" /><br><br>With physics and ball control honed by top clubs, you can smash the ball first time, take a touch or control the ball for more accuracy. You can even freestyle if you like, with every touch of the ball, every action, every kick feels amazingly realistic.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Color Combos</strong></h2>Upgrade your Rezzil Index Lite experience with \u2018Color Combos\u2019, one of Rezzil\u2019s most popular drills used by elite players around the world. Simply hit the correctly colored balls with the side of your boot the game commands. It seems simple but as the pace quickens the pressure ramps up in this rapid-fire test of body and mind. You want harder? You want faster? Then push the limits higher and add modifiers to create a drill that would have the pros gasping for breath!<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1370130/extras/rezzil-player-color-combos-wide2.jpg?t=1627046480\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Gear Up</strong></h2>Open up your locker to view a variety of <strong>genuine Adidas boots</strong> and balls available to purchase to enhance your Rezzil Index Lite experience.
