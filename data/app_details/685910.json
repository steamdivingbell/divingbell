{"about_the_game":"Battlefleet Engineer is a game about smart ship design, fleet composition and tactical control in real-time battles. Fully physics-based movement, detailed damage model, and ship resource system make designing ships an engineering puzzle where you need to compromize between maneuverability, defence and firepower. This leads to interesting emergent behaviors and specialized ship designs that counter others, providing endless combinations and possibilities. In the battles you need to choose and time your engagements carefully, exploiting your fleet's advantages against the enemy and countering theirs.<br><br>If you are more casually inclined, the game comes with a library of ready-made ship designs to use in randomized and custom battles. You can be watching ships tear each other apart or flying around shooting at enemies yourself with just a few clicks.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>RTS-style battles with up to dozens of ships per side.
