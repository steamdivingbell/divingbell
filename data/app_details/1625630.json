When the dust had settled, The Artifact took hostile action, hacking satellites, government databases, Military intranets, everything that it could access.

All probes the we sent would disappear instantly once across the perimeter, without transmitting any information back. The first expedition of marines and scientists vanished without a trace. Misinformation and secrecy surrounding The Artifact eventually devolved into mass riots, panic, famine, unprecedented economic crisis and suicides rates, and as tension grew, it was decided that we make a preemptive strike using Tsar Bombs. After what seemed to be the first successful attack, The Artifact suddenly emitted a powerful blast, shifting the World back in time.

They are the few remaining that remember what actually happened. And so The <strong>Earth Defense Alliance (EDA)</strong> was formed, a shadow government controlled by The Artifact to gain influence across the world under the guise of preparing humanity for alien threats in the near future. As the EDA's influence increased, a faction within the EDA called <strong>Sons of Cain (SoC)</strong> openly opposed the organization, declaring war, labelling the EDA \u201calien puppets\u201d who are driving humanity to its extinction. The EDA retaliate, ousting the SoC to the world as a terrorist organization, and so SoC members were hunted and exterminated on sight. Now, 35 years after the Time-Shift event, The Artifact abruptly cuts all commutations channels and its primary protocol is activated. The EDA quickly send a new recon team to investigate. Joining them, a talented Quantum Engineer, <strong>James Danziger</strong>, who has just arrived back on Earth from the EDA's Intensive Training Facilities on the Moon.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625630/extras/AE_WaterAK.gif?t=1670102346\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">We are planning to add in future:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Intriguing and original story with many layers to explore<br></li><li>Multiple factions with their own values and goals, YOU decide who will become friend or foe.<br></li><li>Many new and Innovative interaction mechanics<br></li><li>Upgradeable robot-dog companion<br></li><li>Multiple solutions to  different problems<br></li><li>Free roam, scavenging across open territories<br></li><li>Real-time dynamic AI for wild animals and wild life population<br></li><li>Hunting<br></li><li>Fishing<br></li><li>Treasure hunting, stashes, dig/hide minigame (and metal detecting)<br></li><li>Trading minigames (different vendors need different approaches)<br></li><li>Designing and setting traps<br></li><li>Further mod support<br></li><li>Additional Acrade games (disks may contain different games with hidden messages)<br></li><li>Additional cooking options<br></li><li>More weapon customization<br></li><li>High quality and adaptive AI<br></li><li>Other healing options<br></li><li>Safehouse upgrades and customization<br></li><li>Global worldwide seasonal events </li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625630/extras/AE_TakePhoto.gif?t=1670102346\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625630/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1670102346","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625630/page.bg.jpg?t=1670102346","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625630/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1670102346","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1625630/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1670102346","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Supported","id":53},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Killing human and non-human enemies,  wild animals."},"detailed_description":"<strong>AB AETERNO is a story-driven hardcore survival experience with both well known and brand new survival mechanics designed and polished for VR from the ground up.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>ABOUT GAMEPLAY IN VR:</strong></h2>Some game mechanics can be seen in this video : <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Full body and fully customizable avatar.<br></li><li>Crafting evolution.
