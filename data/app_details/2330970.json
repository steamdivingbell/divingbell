Flying ships may snatch the cats you are after, making it harder for you to retrieve them. If you collide with geese, your screen will be covered in feathers and you may lose the game. When you find bones and give them to dogs, they will find a cat for you. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2330970/extras/themeGif.gif?t=1729066960\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Moreover, the customizable theme of the game provides players with the freedom to personalize their experience.
