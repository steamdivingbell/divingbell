{"about_the_game":"<i> It happened for no reason. They just started appear up all over the world like a natural disaster. They have no goal, no plan. The World Eaters appeared out of nowhere. First in Europe, but after a day they filled the whole world. We called it Invasion. They wreak havoc and destruction everywhere, they destroy cities, they attack soldiers and civilians, and even each other. They keep appear. From now on, no one can feel safe and all that we can is to resist them for the sake of our survival.

You will play as an elite demon hunter and resist the chaos in which the world has plunged, captured by incomprehensible monsters from another world.

You can be opposed not only by a soulless artificial intelligence, but also by any willing player who has enough place in the collective mind of the demons. Invite friends or strangers to your game and fight to become a LEGEND! While your overall goal is to tackle the highest threat, your personal goal is to become the greatest demon hunter in history.
