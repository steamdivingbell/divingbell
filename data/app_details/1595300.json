{"about_the_game":"<strong>Try the Free Demo Today!</strong><br><br>Kells is a retro puzzle game similar to the original Lemmings except instead of issuing specific commands to your Kells, you manipulate their movement using special Gravity Tiles instead. These tiles change the direction of gravity as Kells walk or fall over them, allowing you to manipulate your Kells in crazy ways like making them \u201cfall upwards\u201d to clear obstacles, \u201cfall forward\u201d to avoid dangerous spike pits, and even walk up or down walls!<br> <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1595300/extras/top-image.png?t=1662285421\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Objective</h2>The objective seems deceptively simple! All you have to do in each level is figure out how to get your Kells from the entrance to the exit flag. The thing is, you can't control them directly and unlike in Lemmings, you can't issue them commands either. What you can do is place tiles around the level to change the flow of gravity! Can you figure out how to make use of careful Gravity Tile placement to guide your Kells on a journey through 100 levels and 8 themed islands to find the mysterious Last Level?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Kellective</h2>As you progress through the game, you'll find many lost Kells on your journey to build up The Kellective and make it stronger and stronger. You will care for your Kells - you can rest them when they are injured, check in on them between levels to see how they are feeling and mourn them when they die.<br> <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1595300/extras/kellective.png?t=1662285421\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Uncover many secrets and hidden treasures</h2><br>Kells is full of secrets and unexpected twists and turns!
