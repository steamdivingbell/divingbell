For example, the shortage of steel for the production of weapons affects the combat power of the country. An attempt to increase the army to compensate for the decrease in combat power leads to the mobilization of peasants. A decrease in the number of peasants reduces the volume of food production, and this affects the extinction or migration of other estates, such as artisans. Artisans work in industries and produce luxury goods for export that replenish the country's treasury. As a result, any decision made triggers a chain of consequences.
