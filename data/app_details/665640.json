{"about_the_game":"SpaceWorms is a game for 2 to 5 players (on a single computer or via the mighty internets) in which you launch rockets, conquer new planets, gather way too powerful upgrades, and probably end up shouting at each other.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou play the game in turns (the rage is real-time, though), starting with an underdeveloped planet full of puny little worms in an overkrauted (You guessed correctly, we are from Wormany.) and pretty flat solar system. Since rockets promise more fun than diplomacy (take that, Civilization!), you bomb each other to worm hell (except &quot;wormagnostics&quot;) until only one worm people remains. But beware: These rockets will be influenced by the old nemesis of all what is worm: gravitilation (it's squared!). Choose your strategy wisely, mighty one, for only then you will be the last worm crawling.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Unlocked BRAIN CAP upgrade!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/665640/9410c02b83bb7d9c4a040dfd646c6e00e1b732f6.jpg"},{"name":"Unlocked CLONE WORM upgrade!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/665640/8d9f2264fa65708776851a5e991d4047a3503526.jpg"},{"name":"Unlocked GRAVITILATION CLOAK upgrade!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/665640/49d2dd6527b2a7ca8d0ccda1b5e7686121cdea39.jpg"},{"name":"Unlocked LAZOR GUN upgrade!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/665640/1f6b3a26ef799325fe5386d4fc99f974017fe3f7.jpg"},{"name":"Unlocked NINJA WORM upgrade!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/665640/021be5a7bcc1d73ea689776f16b7263745f2d89a.jpg"},{"name":"Unlocked PANSPERMIA upgrade!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/665640/39b55db33442fe604037d9d531d5376461792759.jpg"},{"name":"Unlocked SPACE VIAGRA upgrade!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/665640/b4ec2d23640d91779fb8908729b08cddce470a4a.jpg"},{"name":"Unlocked TARGET COMPUTER upgrade!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/665640/42f8298b08e988758369c4f3f24591446028d445.jpg"},{"name":"Unlocked TURBO upgrade!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/665640/232e95f24fd0086d292616833e21f8316a7f4741.jpg"},{"name":"Unlocked WORMCHADE upgrade!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/665640/deffb3c530c221404e693f68c28456e85faf8747.jpg"}],"total":45},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/665640/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1550562489","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/665640/page.bg.jpg?t=1550562489","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/665640/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1550562489","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/665640/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1550562489","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"- Cartoon violence\r\n- Politically incorrect language"},"detailed_description":"SpaceWorms is a game for 2 to 5 players (on a single computer or via the mighty internets) in which you launch rockets, conquer new planets, gather way too powerful upgrades, and probably end up shouting at each other.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou play the game in turns (the rage is real-time, though), starting with an underdeveloped planet full of puny little worms in an overkrauted (You guessed correctly, we are from Wormany.) and pretty flat solar system.
