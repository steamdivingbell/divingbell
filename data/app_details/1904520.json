{"about_the_game":"After you saved the entire city of Phlan and located the Pool of Radiance, a simple trip to Tilverton should have been as easy as a noon-day stroll. But it wasn\u2019t\u2026 Ambushed, captured and knocked unconscious, you awake with no idea who attacked you or how you arrived in Tilverton. You only know that five azure-blue symbols are imprinted under the skin of your right arm. The mystical power of the azure symbols ensnares your will like metal bonds! And when the bonds glow, you must do as they command, No magic can dispel them, no prayers can remove them. Your only hope: search the world for members of the alliance who created the bonds and regain control of your own destiny. Only then can you be free of the Curse of the Azure Bonds.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1904520/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1648573609","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1904520/page.bg.jpg?t=1648573609","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1904520/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1648573609","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1904520/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1648573609","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"After you saved the entire city of Phlan and located the Pool of Radiance, a simple trip to Tilverton should have been as easy as a noon-day stroll.
