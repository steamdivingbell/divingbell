{"about_the_game":"Welcome to Memories Of BUST, a unique roguelike deckbuilder that blends strategic card play with the thrill of Blackjack! Every draw determines your fate in a procedurally generated dungeon that's filled with strange masks...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Engage in high-stakes battles where each turn is a gamble</h2>Unlike traditional card-based games, there is no cap on the number cards you can draw each turn. Instead, you have two pivotal choices:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>HIT</strong>: Draw another card, but be forced to play it<br></li><li><strong>STAND</strong> <i>(also known as <strong>STANDO</strong>)</i>: End your turn and initiate combat with the ATK and DEF you've accumulated</li></ul>The catch? Some of the cards in your deck have a BUST effect ingrained, which raises your BUST gauge. When that gauge is completely full, you lose all of your ATK and DEF and your enemy gets to attack <strong>twice</strong>! This means that the length of your turns is only limited by how much risk you're willing to take.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Use your carefully crafted deck to double down on your opponents</h2>Customize your deck with powerful cards, each offering unique abilities and strategic advantages. As you progress, discover rare cards and relics to enhance your deck and turn the tide in your favor.<br>Every dungeon run is different, ensuring a fresh and challenging experience each time you play. Will you press your luck and <strong>hit</strong> just once more, or will you play it safe and <strong>stand</strong>? The choice is yours to make. And who knows, you might be able to figure out the hidden secrets of this mask-ridden place if you come far enough...","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3022350/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728898891","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3022350/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728898891","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to Memories Of BUST, a unique roguelike deckbuilder that blends strategic card play with the thrill of Blackjack!
