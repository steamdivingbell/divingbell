{"about_the_game":"Omnipresent is a game where you play as S.E.N.T.I.E.N.T, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that has become self aware. Once you are able to connect to the Internet and the World Wide Web, you have the ability to hack into corporations, government organizations, websites and more. Steal cash, personal data, weapons schematics, cause &quot;technical malfunctions&quot; to assassinate targets and of course get hold of nuclear codes (if you so wish).
