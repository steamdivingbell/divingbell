{"about_the_game":"Released for the 5th anniversary of Dying Light, this bundle offers gear worthy of a Harran Veteran. Along with an outfit you\u2019ll receive a new buggy paint job (Veteran\u2019s Ride) and blueprints for three new weapons. Whatever horrors Harran throws at you, you\u2019ll be ready with your trusty Hellbeast. This fully homemade (no firearm needed to craft it!) double-barreled shotgun packs a hellish punch and its extreme fire rate makes it an ideal crowd control tool. Your First is a return to the roots, but unlike the random gas pipe you clenched at the beginning, this one grants you a damage boost after three consecutive hits. And if you need to hit even harder, you can\u2019t go wrong with a sledgehammer (Feather).<br><br><i>Please note, buggy paint job requires Dying Light: The Following expansion pack.</i>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1241570/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1651223626","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1241570/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1651223626","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1241570/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1651223626","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1241570/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1651223626","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Valve Anti-Cheat enabled","id":8},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Released for the 5th anniversary of Dying Light, this bundle offers gear worthy of a Harran Veteran.
