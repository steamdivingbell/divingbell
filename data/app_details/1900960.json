{"about_the_game":"Base Commander is a competitive 5v5 showdown, where one team emerges victorious by capturing a majority of empowered bases scattered across the map. Every individual base your crew successfully holds grants your entire team an epic perk, like deadly bonus attack damage, lightning-fast speed, or even a game-changing tactical advantage. Rally your friends, outplay your rivals, and stake your claim as the ultimate Base Commander.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1900960/extras/new_free_multiplayer_games.gif?t=1709999931\" /><br><br>This isn't your typical MOBA.
