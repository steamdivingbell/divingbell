{"about_the_game":"Sakeretsu is an open world turn based RPG with a unique single-use item based combat system built around collecting rare items found by exploring the over-world and defeating monsters. You must traverse the land of Mu, the place between life and death, to discover the truth behind your demise. You may capture a monster to aid you on your journey, and accompany you in this desolate land. You must overcome four bosses, each overlooking their own territory. Only once they have been conquered you can face the final boss, the Sakeretsu.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"A New Beginning","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/613400/69018b57f50d58b53051a5515110388f4f729883.jpg"},{"name":"I Am Not Your Enemy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/613400/e28db4479208ed635eed9686815796d9bedb4095.jpg"},{"name":"You Are Strong","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/613400/d20bef5921cbbb90a9e744a3efd97e5825133837.jpg"},{"name":"\u2026Interesting","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/613400/7a30ae8e7489055c30f140c28680177ade04a516.jpg"},{"name":"It\u2019s Almost Over ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/613400/e55e46138a11fcf88c2baae6610bcb0efea4a660.jpg"},{"name":"Live ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/613400/49bc02634be0f213c5f1a4664741f4e94da62faa.jpg"},{"name":"Making Progress","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/613400/0dbb89828c9b2e886869faf5315bcfc4b6cc006b.jpg"},{"name":"Vigor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/613400/0dbb89828c9b2e886869faf5315bcfc4b6cc006b.jpg"},{"name":"Power","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/613400/0dbb89828c9b2e886869faf5315bcfc4b6cc006b.jpg"},{"name":"Might","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/613400/0dbb89828c9b2e886869faf5315bcfc4b6cc006b.jpg"}],"total":16},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/613400/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1618809946","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/613400/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1618809946","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/613400/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1618809946","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/613400/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1618809946","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Sakeretsu is an open world turn based RPG with a unique single-use item based combat system built around collecting rare items found by exploring the over-world and defeating monsters.
