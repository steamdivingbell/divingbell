Move in OPPOSITE directions, and TwinCop will go nowhere. Move in the SAME direction, and you will move swiftly and heal yourselves. Moving together is the ONLY way to heal, and it also charges your combined super ability, Twinsanity, which slows down time and really lets you gain the upper hand in tough situations.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">STORY MODE: ABSURD 80s SATIRE</h2>You and your partner were the best cops in the greater Twin Cities metropolitan area until a horrific pontoon boat accident nearly killed you. The police department took half of each of your mangled bodies and combined them together using the latest technology to save your lives, combining you into one super-cop: TwinCop. You and your partner now each control half of the same body, so you\u2019ll really need to be in sync with one another if you\u2019re going to survive. What truly happened with that pontoon boat accident? Who is funding the war on these streets? What does the PopTop Corporation (creators of the delicious and healthy PopTop Drink) have to do with any of this?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CUSTOMIZE YOUR COP</h2>Over 25+ character combinations to try! Choose one of the eight most elite members of the Twin Cities police force, each with their own unique special ability. Try to match up abilities for maximum carnage! Who will you choose?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">HILARIOUS MINIGAMES</h2>When you\u2019re TwinCop, everyday tasks become quite difficult. Defuse bombs by cooperatively cutting wires, chase bad guys through busy intersections, fist bump yourselves after a job well done. You\u2019ll never take these tasks for granted ever again.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">***THIS GAME IS BEST WITH 2 LOCAL PLAYERS AND 2 CONTROLLERS TO ENJOY***</h2><br>This game does not contain Online Play, however you can use the free application Parsec to play with others remotely.<br>You can use Parsec to play with someone else remotely.
