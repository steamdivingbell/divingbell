And how did you even get here in the first place?<br><br>The Overseer is a sokoban/multiban adventure puzzle game set in science fiction world of the Overseer Corporation Gaming Centre, where The Overseer helpfully guides you and your faithful RoboBuddy through a series of game challenges. <br><br>It is strictly forbidden by The Overseer to leave the boundaries of the game, but what's the worst that could happen if you do leave when you find the opportunity? <br><br>Along the way you may encounter other friendly AI systems and members of staff. You may even unravel the events that led up to the start of your game and follow the fate of humanity on Galactic News as sinister events related to the Rise Of The Overseer unfold across the galaxy.  <br><br><strong>Demo Contents</strong><br><br>The Rise Of The Overseer demo includes access to approximately 25% of the full game of Rise Of The Overseer, so demos much of the key gameplay and concepts from the full game. However, as a freeloading, non-paying customer of the Overseer Corporation, The Overseer is free to administer your game appropriately.
