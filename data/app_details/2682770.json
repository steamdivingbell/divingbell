What kind of a game is this?</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> It's an MS-DOS puzzle game with EGA graphics, where you're tasked with placing objects on the playing field to route Broomba to collect all the stars. The Broomba might be a little faulty because it only makes a left turn when hitting something. In addition to static objects like books and boxes, there are flower pots, balls, and bottles, each with their own behavior and place in the puzzle. The levels gradually get harder, ensuring there's brain-racking to be had. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Demo features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">40 levels of Broomb-tastic (and demonstrative) challenges </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Level editor to create your own puzzles, but without saving :( </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Some say it has great graphics\u00a0(me) </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Some say it has great music (me, again) </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Cats, gatos, chats, Katzen, \u732b, \u03b3\u03ac\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 &amp; kediler </p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MS-DOS?!
