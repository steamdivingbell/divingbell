{"about_the_game":"Zombielantis is more than just a zombie game. It's an epic open world online multiplayer first-person shooter where you choose to either play on the zombie or human side. Each has their pros and cons that balance the strengths and weaknesses of both species. Massive teams clash together, fighting for dominance in a beautiful tropical island setting far away from civilization where only the best will be able to survive. No artificial intelligence, only real players.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>PLAY AS ZOMBIE</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1892780/extras/Title_Play_As_Zombie.gif?t=1732545895\" /><br>Hunt down humans with your special abilities. Don't worry, zombies are not completely brain dead, they can drive quad bikes and loot certain weapons. Toggle on your innate thermal vision to facilitate spotting players around you. Engage and chase your target to land that contagious bite!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>PLAY AS HUMAN</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1892780/extras/Title_Play_As_Human.gif?t=1732545895\" /><br>It takes more than a headshot to kill the zombies. Sharpen your senses and prepare to eradicate an ever evolving horde of infected. Once a &quot;human&quot; is bitten, it's not over! It's where the fun begins - You'll turn into a zombie yourself.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>ZOMBIE SERUM</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1892780/extras/Title_Zombie_Serum.gif?t=1732545895\" /><br>This special loot item is sparse, but allows human players to remedy a zombie bite and stop the infection. If consumed prior to being bitten, it will turn you into a fully fledged zombie for a short period of time. The twist is that you'll go unnoticed amongst other zombies and you can decide to perform a deadly bite on them or sneak past making your way to safety.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>SAFE ZONE DOMES</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1892780/extras/Title_Safe_Zone_Domes.gif?t=1732545895\" /><br>Simply put, zombies cannot enter safe zones. These domes appear on random positions after a certain amount of game time has passed. As non-infected player you better find and enter one of these domes before the zombies take over Zombielantis. Just keep in mind that the protecting force field energy depletes over time until only one active safe zone is left. The force field also absorbs any attack from outside, so trying to shoot through it won't have any effect.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>UAV DRONES, ATVs, ARMED SPEED BOATS</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1892780/extras/Title_Vehicles.gif?t=1732545895\" /><br>Be the pilot of a UAV drone for air support. Fight your way through the endless bush with agile quad bikes or master the sea with armed speed boats. Use a pickup truck or jeep when you want to drive something more robust.

You'll encounter classic, modern, primitive and futuristic objects. Every season will add new lootable items. Prior to jumping into a new match, you can customize your unlocked loadout to fit your gaming style. Weapons can also be modified on demand during a match. Loot is located in random locations.
