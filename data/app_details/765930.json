His journey to find his parents, or at least what happened to them, takes him into his worst nightmare, as he fights to find a way through, while staying alive and sane. The place of education has been turned into a place of horror and death. Starting with just a handful of items to help him get through the darkened corridors, Marcus has to summon all his strength to survive and keep on looking for his parents. Although it might already be too late, his hope to find them alive will be the last to die.

Keep your eyes open, as the flashlight you\u2019re holding might go off any minute and engulf you in darkness again. Sneak through the corridors, explore each room, backtrack to find more clues and access additional parts of the university\u2019s campus.
