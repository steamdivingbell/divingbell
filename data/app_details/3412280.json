Critters start off on foot, but over time they'll learn to use parachutes and drop into the middle of the map instead of starting on the edge. The game ends if too many of them successfully make it to the other side.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As your score gets higher, your chances of encountering a rare Hawk, Grasshopper or Mangolin go up.

The most common type is the <strong>Acorn</strong> which bounces up to 3 times on the ground before disappearing. The <strong>Coconut</strong> breaks and creates a slowing puddle as soon as it hits the ground. The <strong>Pistachio</strong> explodes on impact with the ground, hitting all nearby critters and power-ups. Lastly, the <strong>Walnut</strong> creates a vertical barrier that blocks critters. All nuts can bounce any number of times after hitting a critter, but they lose speed from each bounce.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3412280/extras/AboutPowerupBanner.png?t=1738289460\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Hitting a power-up using any kind of nut will collect it and earn you a small, temporary advantage.
