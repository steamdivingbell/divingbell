{"about_the_game":"RplGenStudio is a specialized video production software designed for creating videos similar to galgames, tabletop game replays, and audio-visual novels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese types of videos are characterized by their fixed structure and lengthy duration, which means that using traditional video editing software to create them would involve a tremendous amount of repetitive work. As a result, RplGenStudio was developed. RplGenStudio was primarily designed to assist content creators in crafting their video stories as easily as writing a document, allowing them to dedicate more of their energy to the creation of visuals and content rather than getting bogged down in the intricate and tedious process of video editing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhy choose RplGenStudio?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1. Maximum Customization: Unlike conventional tabletop game replay video production software, RplGenStudio allows users to highly customize their visuals. In addition to the typical combination of character illustrations and speech bubble frames, it also supports chat window-style performances resembling instant messaging apps. All visual elements can be freely moved and configured with transition animations and text effects, maximizing design flexibility. RplGenStudio also includes practical dice rolling and hit point animations, with plans for future updates to cater to various tabletop game replay video needs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2. Professional Exporting: RplGenStudio supports built-in MP4 video export, eliminating the need for screen recording software and the hassle of replaying the performance for preview. This ensures stable video quality without stuttering or dropped frames, even on less powerful computers. On high-performance computers, NVIDIA GPU hardware acceleration can be utilized for faster video exporting, minimizing waiting time. To meet the needs of professional video creators, RplGenStudio not only exports MP4 videos but also offers the option to export scripts as XML project files compatible with Adobe Premiere Pro. The project files retain separate layers and tracks, allowing for customized post-production effects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3. Efficient Project Management: RplGenStudio provides a systematic project management mode, supporting batch import and manipulation of images, audio, and font media. Users can easily transfer projects to other disks or computers and continue editing seamlessly, greatly optimizing the experience of collaborative editing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4. Rich Text-to-Speech Sources: RplGenStudio integrates over 200 text-to-speech voice sources from multiple services, along with system-embedded voices and typewriter sound effects that can be used offline. This ensures a wide range of audio options to fulfill users' audio requirements in video production.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n5. User-Friendly Interface: In the Project View of RplGenStudio, most functions offer convenient keyboard shortcuts, including but not limited to save, copy, paste, find, replace, delete, and sort operations. With abundant audio and video features, the script editing process is straightforward and user-friendly. The built-in script editor in RplGenStudio 2.0 provides professional text editing capabilities. All commands related to parameter settings, character selection, and media switching can be auto-completed using the text suggestion engine of the script editor, allowing users to focus on their storytelling.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2550090/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1710255646","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2550090/page.bg.jpg?t=1710255646","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2550090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1710255646","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2550090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1710255646","categories":[{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"RplGenStudio is a specialized video production software designed for creating videos similar to galgames, tabletop game replays, and audio-visual novels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese types of videos are characterized by their fixed structure and lengthy duration, which means that using traditional video editing software to create them would involve a tremendous amount of repetitive work.
