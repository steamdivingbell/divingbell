{"about_the_game":"Years after leaving his family to wander Overworld, Viktor returns home to find his mother has long since passed away and his brother, Zane, has risen from the rank of recruit to commander of the Legion. Although his ascent through the ranks was quick, Zane finds himself struggling with the many pressures that come with his position. Having left his brother to struggle alone once before, Viktor is determined to join the Legion to support his brother in any way he can. Shortly after he joins, however, a chain of events begins to unfold that will change the face of Overworld forever. Things are not always as they seem, and in bloody times like these, loyalty is more precious than gold.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Features</strong></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Follow Viktor's origins story first hand as you climb through the Legion's ranks, years before the events of the first game</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Complete over 90 missions each with their own unique challenges</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Master Viktor's unique phase mechanic, which allows you to phase through enemies, projectiles, and even walls</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Unlock over 40 different upgradable weapons and rare armor pieces with unique properties</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Challenge yourself with bounty hunter missions that pit you against a plethora of fierce minibosses</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Explore the world around you, discover the secret rooms and hidden passages in every level</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Conquer a New Game+ mode that unlocks more than just difficulty</li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Training Dummy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/624320/d7aa0a285ad3a80b1257c11a775f3efc18e60772.jpg"},{"name":"Hoarder","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/624320/7e9d330f61af9c8eb4e44ed2f37fcb9866c392c5.jpg"},{"name":"Bloodthirsty","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/624320/14b8b53d006854867bae933dc58cea632c3a09a4.jpg"},{"name":"Exterminator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/624320/fe6da6cb3bad3b296be988d242d440f2731b19e0.jpg"},{"name":"Assassin","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/624320/6c82cf98d543848a03f05b318b011eb0036a8895.jpg"},{"name":"Sharpshooter","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/624320/67a698578575c730557d53c387a081f61e540dc2.jpg"},{"name":"Point Blank","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/624320/6581a2007f7afa487244cee9ea042d55cacb4874.jpg"},{"name":"IED","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/624320/ec384866fc204f41309d5dec85af63f3b3239525.jpg"},{"name":"Talented","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/624320/d0f260e8ce7db8f0cdcc810f652dcd62212b1e3e.jpg"},{"name":"Good things come to those who wait","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/624320/e7bfa7a3150186ff5fb099d89967a2dd9bc13975.jpg"}],"total":25},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624320/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1521241063","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624320/page.bg.jpg?t=1521241063","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624320/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1521241063","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624320/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1521241063","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Years after leaving his family to wander Overworld, Viktor returns home to find his mother has long since passed away and his brother, Zane, has risen from the rank of recruit to commander of the Legion.
