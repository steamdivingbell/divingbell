{"about_the_game":"<strong><u>JumpBeard</u></strong> is a tactical platformer adventure with one legged captain Rupert and his annoying companion Randy about leaping your way through challenging terrain in a search of mythical treasure. Every wrong jump counts and will make you fall back where you started.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>You are a Pirate! </strong></h2>Your adventure begins in small coastal city Tortuga. You will find out about mythical treasure on top of local fortress and you, as greedy and rumthirsty pirate must not miss opportunity like that. Jumping is your only way up. To get through various hand-painted locations with different mechanics in each of them. <br>You will need to prepare your mind, because only your skill and patience will decide!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Gameplay</strong></h2>  <br><br><strong>Going up with simple movement</strong><br>With wooden leg you can only do one thing at the time. You need to decide, if you want to move further by walking or jumping. But it takes some time to gather your strength to jump as far as you can. Thanks to your great physique, even bouncing off walls isn't impossible. <br><br><strong>Falling down in style</strong><br>Like every mortal, even captain must obey the laws of gravity, so think before you jump. Result of your jump depends only on you and your patience because your fall will be saved right away. <br><br><strong>Interesting companions during journey </strong><br>During your adventure you will encounter many remarkable people. Scottish prisoner, drunken trader, and many more will accompany you on your path of jumps and falls. Sometimes giving you another quest on your already painfull journey. <br><br><strong>Getting better and better time</strong><br>With every fall, you master the precision. With precision, your run might end up faster than your previous one. Don't worry, because you will always know your best time aswell as time of your previous run.  <br><br><u>Many options will occur during your journey, that will change the rest of your captain's life.
