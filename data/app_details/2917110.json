{"about_the_game":"Game has been updated to version 5.0. All players are advised to update to the latest version to experience the new content.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n**Update Details:**<br />\r\n<br />\r\n**New Content**<br />\r\n1. Added an experience and level system. Correspondingly, new talents using level upgrades have been added to the Spiritual Fountain talent tree interface. The amount of experience gained is related to difficulty.<br />\r\n2. Added ancient equipment. After difficulty level 10, legendary or higher quality equipment has a small chance to become ancient equipment, with a random attribute enhanced to 1.6 times its maximum value.<br />\r\n3. Added two ring equipment slots and dark gold quality equipment. Dark gold equipment comes with a passive skill and random 1-4 dark gold potentials.<br />\r\n4. After difficulty level 10, added gameplay one: clearing this level drops the final arena key. The arena challenge opened by the key involves continuous small monster battles. Surviving 24 waves guarantees a drop of one dark gold ring. Each subsequent wave increases monster difficulty by one level, and there is a small chance of dropping dark gold rings until death.<br />\r\n5. After difficulty level 10, added gameplay two: the final challenge against Mimir. In Chapter 5, you can initiate a battle with Mimir. Mimir cannot be killed, so do your best to deal damage before dying. Defeating Mimir unlocks the enhancement platform, which can activate dark gold equipment potentials (by consuming ancient equipment to gain ancient affixes).<br />\r\n6. Added a batch of new attributes:<br />\r\n   1. Four types of weapon mastery, independently increasing damage.<br />\r\n   2. Suppression chance and suppression damage multiplier, initially 3% and 150%. Any damage triggering suppression will duplicate this damage by 150%, creating new damage. When the final critical hit rate exceeds 100%, every 2 points of critical hit rate convert to 1 point of suppression chance.<br />\r\n   3. Added endurance damage reduction and endurance threshold-related attributes. When current health reaches the endurance threshold, the player gains additional endurance damage reduction effects.<br />\r\n   4. Added a batch of spell point damage attributes, increasing the base point damage of corresponding spells.<br />\r\n7. Adjusted the random types and quantities of rune affixes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n**System Adjustments**<br />\r\n1. The weapon system has been adjusted. There are now twelve initial weapons to choose from, derived from the original sword, axe, spear, and katana. Each weapon's divine blessing now includes a corresponding ultimate talent.<br />\r\n2. The difficulty value of levels has been significantly compressed. Now, 20 levels are approximately equal to the original 100 levels.<br />\r\n3. Rune forging can now be performed multiple times, upgrading rune enhancement skills. Additionally, the effects of dark gold runes and dark gold ring rune forging have been added.<br />\r\n4. Adjusted the effects of some runes, sets, and blessings.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n**Notes**<br />\r\nDue to the significant adjustments in this update, save files are not compatible with versions prior to 4.0. It is strongly recommended to play the new version for a fresh gaming experience. If you want to play the previous version using your old save data, please select the old version when starting the game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2917110/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1716897598","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2917110/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1716897598","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2917110/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1716897598","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2917110/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1716897598","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Game has been updated to version 5.0.
