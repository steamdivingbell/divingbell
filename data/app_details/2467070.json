{"about_the_game":"Inner Seasons is a cinematic experience with unique and fun platformer gameplay. Learn from your mentor, Farley, as you go through &quot;therapy&quot; sessions with him. Farley teaches you about his past, and teaches you how you can get through your present. There are two stages of the game. Cut scenes with Farley teaching you, and going inside your head to explore. Exploring your mind causes you to speed slide, while you slide, you experience the seasons of life and learn from them. If you play with a calm and humble mindset, you'll most likely have a positive experience.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2467070/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1692665641","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2467070/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1692665641","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2467070/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1692665641","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2467070/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1692665641","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Inner Seasons is a cinematic experience with unique and fun platformer gameplay.
