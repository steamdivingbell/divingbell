The continent is divided into 5 kingdoms that live in relative harmony, Patheron, the Holy Kingdom of Prosperity, Aurelios, the Kingdom of Enchantment, Aquatous, Kingdom of the Sea, Kharterah, the Draconic Empire, and Luvielle, the Kingdom of the Faire-Folk, all of which are watched over by the Guardian Angels of the Astral Plane, a realm in the clouds. The population of Orgathus mainly consists of male beings who often engage in sexual interaction to honor the Divine One and always expose themselves to the elements, in return, they allow them to live a long and healthy life, as the power of love is the cornerstone of the Dik Crystals' existence and power. As of recently however, the seal has begun to weaken and the darkness has begun pouring back into the world in the form of a demon called Inikka who has sworn himself to the Dark One and has established his own Empire within a nearby land overseas known as the Outerrealms, with the intention of conquering all of Orgathus with his army of The Shadowless, corrupt creatures who can influence the minds of the people, replacing love and compassion with pure lust and aggression, turning them into hulking beasts of unbridled sexual intensity. The only hope of saving the continent is a pure-hearted hero chosen by the Guardian Angels to become the next Celestial Knight to reunite the 5 Dik Crystals within each Kingdom and prevent the resurrection of the Dark One once again.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2952370/extras/_4.jpg?t=1717186126\" /><br>The Holy Kingdom, Pantheron lies at the center of the continent and is a very prosperous country that is very ahead of its time, dedicated to the Guardian Angel Ramiel and the Divine One. Pantheron contains several thriving cities and tribes, home to a large population of humans, elves, and barbarians who live together peacefully, ruled by the kind-hearted King Jericho and his 5 sons. The city is well known for its bountiful harvest as well as its advances in technology thanks to the power of the Earth Dik Crystal entrusted to them by Ramiel to watch over until the day it is needed. The country\u2019s colors are blue and gold to represent the sky and sun, the home of the angels.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2952370/extras/2gLC0l.gif?t=1717186126\" /><br><br>CHARACTERS<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2952370/extras/chaA.png?t=1717186126\" /><br><strong>Race:</strong> Human <br><strong>Age:</strong> 22 <br><strong>Hometown:</strong> Remaire City, Pantheron Kingdom <br><strong>Occupation:</strong> Knight, Blacksmith (part-time) <br><br>Duncan Carpenter is part of a wide-scale, Blacksmithing family company, currently owned by his father, and next in line to inherit the business as the oldest of the next generation.

Kostas declares himself as Duncan\u2019s ward, hoping to find the challenge he has been searching for all his life, intending to come back a true champion worthy of the title, while at the same time, hoping to make Duncan his mate as he sees him as the perfect match for him in many ways.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2952370/extras/chaE.png?t=1717186126\" /><br><strong>Species: </strong>Angel <br><strong>Age:</strong> 3000+ <br><strong>Hometown:</strong> The Astral Plane <br><strong>Occupation: </strong>Guardian of Orgathus <br>Ramiel is the Astral Guardian of the continent of Orgathus, providing health and prosperity to all and does his best to keep the peace, as he is a firm believer that the people should love each other as they would love themselves.

That day, Ramiel swore that he would never let anyone be judged based on appearances ever again, however, after discovering that a demon resembling his former lover, has unleashed the Shadowless on the world, he chooses Duncan as the new Celestial Knight in the hopes that he can save him from himself before he plunges the world into darkness.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2952370/extras/chaF.png?t=1717186126\" /><br><strong>Species:</strong> Incubus (formerly Archangel) <br><strong>Age:</strong> 3000+ <br><strong>Hometown:</strong> The Outerrealms <br><strong>Occupation:</strong> Ruler of the Shadowless Empire <br>Raziel was once an archangel of the mortal plane, watching over humans from the sky and partaking in their traditions and activities while entertaining them with a variety of tricks and trades. He had once fallen in love with the guardian angel Ramiel, who invited him to the Astral Plane, in the hopes of uniting the two planes into one community, a notion that the angels objected strongly to due to their belief that all angels must not directly interfere with humans, accusing Raziel of corrupting Ramiel to abandon his duties as the next guardian. As punishment, Raziel was forced to cover his face with a demonic mask that would not release him until he was to find someone on the Mortal Plane who could love him as himself, which most mortals could not bear to do so as they found his appearance terrifying. Rejected by the very people he thought were his friends, Raziel retreated to the Outerrealms where he chose to become exactly what the world had accused him of being, an Incubus, by unlocking the power of the Shadowless, Raziel, under the name \u201cInikka\u201d aims to conquer the continent of Orgathus, through pure lust and depravity caused by the Shadowless creatures\u2019 influence.
