{"about_the_game":"Wizards and Warlords is an indie turn-based strategy game, where you play in a randomly generated fantasy world, filled with rival wizards and warlords. Create a customized sovereign or choose from one of many predefined templates. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBlending 4X with grand strategy and simulation, the game offers a plethora of settings and randomly generated cultures and races. It is up to you if you want to fight great wars, crushing powerful rivals in the pursuit of world conquest - the challenge of survival in a grim and dangerous world, perhaps even beset by planar invaders and ancient evils - or a balanced game, where you control but one of many realms in the world, immersing yourself in an emergent story driven by random events and the interactions of randomly generated cultures and factions. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nManage your cities and fortresses, increase your power through research and industry, design arcane constructs, recruit armies and heroes, explore and exploit dungeons and ruins, and experience random events and event chains. You can mod several aspects of the game and create your own world maps.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/567080/28ad472f4c69ae7af8a2eba420e408e824a8dd7e.jpg"},{"name":"50 Shades of Wizardry","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/567080/28ad472f4c69ae7af8a2eba420e408e824a8dd7e.jpg"},{"name":"The Wand Is Mightier Than the Sword","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/567080/f96507de6685474061a02f81017afe01aac54ef0.jpg"},{"name":"Novus Magus","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/567080/f96507de6685474061a02f81017afe01aac54ef0.jpg"},{"name":"Fortified Frontier","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/567080/d8119ce7e78d55a3986c2c475c9b85c7afb50a41.jpg"},{"name":"Hired Hands","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/567080/53dab9f59f28636711ad16a886c6b7e5727d2721.jpg"},{"name":"Hack and Slash","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/567080/28ad472f4c69ae7af8a2eba420e408e824a8dd7e.jpg"},{"name":"My First Siege","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/567080/d8119ce7e78d55a3986c2c475c9b85c7afb50a41.jpg"},{"name":"No Stone Unturned","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/567080/28ad472f4c69ae7af8a2eba420e408e824a8dd7e.jpg"},{"name":"Enigmatic Refusal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/567080/28ad472f4c69ae7af8a2eba420e408e824a8dd7e.jpg"}],"total":29},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/567080/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1692162411","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/567080/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1692162411","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/567080/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1692162411","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/567080/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1692162411","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Wizards and Warlords is an indie turn-based strategy game, where you play in a randomly generated fantasy world, filled with rival wizards and warlords.
