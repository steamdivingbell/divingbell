{"about_the_game":"The crash on the asteroid really hurt you. An exoskeleton is all that keeps you standing, however it is just a help, so with broken legs giving inputs is not a good idea. But you managed to save a grappling hook and a laser pistol from your shipwreck. One for each hand. The crash was so hard you now are in a deep cave-system in the comet you crashed on. It all is quiet, until you hear some weird noises and see some green being running towards you...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is played with just 2 keys, by default LMB (shoot the laser cannon) and RMB (shoot the grappling hook/hold to grapple towards it). It is a jump and run adventure with the twist that you cant jump... or run. Broken legs are not made for that kind of action.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1216270/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1585931620","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1216270/page.bg.jpg?t=1585931620","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1216270/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1585931620","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1216270/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1585931620","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The crash on the asteroid really hurt you.
