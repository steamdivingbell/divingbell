Nancy Drew\u2019s longevity, financial success, and unanticipated breadth of appeal argues that a primary female character is no hindrance to a videogame series and might in fact be an asset. Although some developers would like to convince us that the work needed to provide the option of playing as a woman is too difficult, for 16 years Her Interactive has built a truly singular female lead.\u201d<br>Kill Screen Daily<br><br>\u201cThe puzzles are this game\u2019s bread and butter, and they live up to every standard. I quite enjoyed the challenge of some of them, the submarine puzzle being a particular favorite. Also, I cannot remember the last time I had to take out notepaper and write down all of the clues so that I wouldn\u2019t miss an essential bit of information, but I had to do it for this game.\u201d<br>Killeen Daily Herald<br><br>\u201cNancy Drew: The Shattered Medallion\u2019s amazingly funny characters, fascinating dialog and New Zealand setting are fantastic.\u201d<br>Video Games
