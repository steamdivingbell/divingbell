{"about_the_game":"* GAMEPLAY<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNightmare Trek: The Next Level Challenge is a minimalist, 3D precision platformer game that is much more challenging than it looks. You will be running from enemies, jumping over bottomless pits, dodging red lunging spikes, balancing on small floating blocks and pillars, and timing jumps just right to land on moving platforms. Sounds simple enough, right? That's where you're wrong. Only a determined, skilled few can make it to the end of the game. It may be a simple platformer, but don't let that fool you, there is only one difficulty setting: Nightmare Mode.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat's not all. This game will be constantly updated and upgraded. This isn't even CLOSE to its final form!
