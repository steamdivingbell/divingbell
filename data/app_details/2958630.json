{"about_the_game":"In &quot;Echo in Capistrano,&quot; players immerse themselves in a heart-pounding survival horror experience set in the treacherous depths of the Capistrano mountain range. Assume the role of an elite cave rescuer, a specialist in navigating subterranean dangers, as you embark on a perilous mission to locate and save missing survivors lost within a vast and intricate cave system.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game challenges players to master the art of survival in an environment where the slightest misstep can be fatal. The caves are a maze of dark, narrow passages, creating a claustrophobic atmosphere that tests your ability to stay calm under pressure. With limited visibility and disorienting tunnel networks, every decision you make could mean the difference between life and death.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour primary tool in this treacherous environment is your unique echo-location ability. Use it to navigate the labyrinthine caves, locate the missing survivors, and chart a safe path to escape. However, be warned: the echoing sound can attract something sinister lurking in the shadows. A primal entity resides within the cave, a terrifying presence that you hoped never to encounter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Echo in Capistrano&quot; is not just a test of physical endurance but a psychological thriller that pushes your fears to the limit. Run, hide, and use your wits to outsmart the dangers that lie in wait. Find the survivors and lead them to safety before it's too late.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWill you emerge as the savior of the lost, or will the echoes of the cave become your final resting place?
