{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Blast your way through 18 levels of platform mayhem in a quest to save mankind from the grip of a totalitarian\u00a0 regime.\u00a0Every level is a playground of possibilities, where quick thinking and quicker reflexes are the keys to survival.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This fast-paced platformer demands split-second timing and combat precision. Players navigate through meticulously crafted levels that shift from neon-drenched industrial zones to snow-covered mountain outposts, each area presenting unique platforming challenges and enemy types. Rusted worker bots patrol abandoned factories, sleek combat drones sweep across open valleys, and massive mechanical bosses guard crucial chokepoints.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In a world overrun by hostile machines, survival depends on quick reflexes, perfect timing, and knowing when to upgrade your gear. Mechanoid delivers pure platforming action where every jump matters and every improvement counts. Each movement must be calculated, each shot timed perfectly. One wrong step or delayed reaction can end in disaster.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you progress, you'll find opportunities to enhance your crucial systems. Weapon upgrades pack more punch against tougher enemies. Shield improvements give you better protection when things get hectic. Battery enhancements let you push deeper into hostile territory. And perhaps most crucial of all, life support upgrades keep you alive in increasingly dangerous environments.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Mechanoid strips away unnecessary complexity to focus on what matters: precise platforming, intense combat, split second timing and meaningful progression that rewards a player's skill.</p>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3486490?t=1740524802","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3486490/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1740524802","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3486490/407aaea4d8a5ad0044bd95e824eea4afc280760d/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1740524802","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3486490/407aaea4d8a5ad0044bd95e824eea4afc280760d/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1740524802","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Blast your way through 18 levels of platform mayhem in a quest to save mankind from the grip of a totalitarian\u00a0 regime.\u00a0Every level is a playground of possibilities, where quick thinking and quicker reflexes are the keys to survival.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This fast-paced platformer demands split-second timing and combat precision.
