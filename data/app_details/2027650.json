{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Shards of the Broken Sky</h2> <i>Flying realm down!</i> A <i>13th Age Roleplaying Game</i>\u00a0 sandbox adventure for player characters level 1-7 (and a bit beyond). <br> When the flying realm of Vantage crashes to earth in the Dragon Empire, a long-kept secret is revealed: it was the control point for magical wards that kept a dozen ancient evils in check.<br> The icons have offered you rival opportunities for glory, plunder, and/or heroic sacrifice in Vantage. Will you rescue its survivors? Restore its magical wards? Or loot everything that isn't nailed down while trying to stay one step ahead of the apocalypse?<br> Use <i>Shards of the Broken Sky</i> however you like: as an entire campaign in and around this fallen flying realm, a one-shot or mini-arc, or a source of new races, monsters, and magic items! If you run it as a campaign, the characters' icon relationships will shape the plot, NPCs, and locations, keeping the story relevant to their backstories and goals. You've played through once?
