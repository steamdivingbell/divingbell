Despite all the insanity around the concept \u2013 and aside from all the weird &quot;challenge mode&quot; variants, unlockable ships, cute level descriptions, and all the other quirk \u2013 Retro/Grade is a well-designed music game with a completely original soundtrack.\u201d<br>4/5 \u2013 Joystiq<br><br>\u201cThe game has the feel of something that was much-loved and fussed over. There is no aspect of the game that isn\u2019t fun to look it or read, and that level of dedication goes a long way to helping the game stand out in a crowded marketplace.\u201d<br> \u2013 Penny Arcade<br><br>\u201cUntil now, Amplitude has been without a doubt my favorite music game, ever. Retro/Grade scratches that very same itch, but its unique marriage of high-concept premise and classic rhythm gameplay make it an all-around more satisfying experience\u201d<br>10/10 \u2013 Thunderbolt Games","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/222660/ss_bbb78365044cb792fcd6125b51e7b39070bddb33.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447356820","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/222660/ss_bbb78365044cb792fcd6125b51e7b39070bddb33.600x338.jpg?t=1447356820"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/222660/ss_e7e6e85d96e96506b5f8074c3003817c28175060.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447356820","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/222660/ss_e7e6e85d96e96506b5f8074c3003817c28175060.600x338.jpg?t=1447356820"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/222660/ss_8eac79f81e41b56ff96319d0366efacb9b9747b9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447356820","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/222660/ss_8eac79f81e41b56ff96319d0366efacb9b9747b9.600x338.jpg?t=1447356820"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/222660/ss_5978dd2ee743ad58b0c01b3eb0fc34be661579f3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447356820","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/222660/ss_5978dd2ee743ad58b0c01b3eb0fc34be661579f3.600x338.jpg?t=1447356820"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/222660/ss_eb3676decd091108a1f274e49e14cccdc38d96a7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447356820","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/222660/ss_eb3676decd091108a1f274e49e14cccdc38d96a7.600x338.jpg?t=1447356820"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/222660/ss_271b2f3560c22d839fb8fcfb8757cc923983e69f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447356820","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/222660/ss_271b2f3560c22d839fb8fcfb8757cc923983e69f.600x338.jpg?t=1447356820"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/222660/ss_34496aef8d98b8c28a4c21bd5e40e23bd89ac482.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447356820","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/222660/ss_34496aef8d98b8c28a4c21bd5e40e23bd89ac482.600x338.jpg?t=1447356820"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/222660/ss_f90fb3c634a7c358fb35fd1749259a57b6936352.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447356820","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/222660/ss_f90fb3c634a7c358fb35fd1749259a57b6936352.600x338.jpg?t=1447356820"},{"id":8,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/222660/ss_d9f342ce3531ddbaf45be8feb9b138afd1be26fe.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447356820","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/222660/ss_d9f342ce3531ddbaf45be8feb9b138afd1be26fe.600x338.jpg?t=1447356820"},{"id":9,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/222660/ss_a700033f8db1254561c6a119deafb9031658d83e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447356820","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/222660/ss_a700033f8db1254561c6a119deafb9031658d83e.600x338.jpg?t=1447356820"}],"short_description":"Play a classic Shoot 'Em Up... in reverse!","steam_appid":222660,"support_info":{"email":"help@retrogradegame.com","url":"http://forum.retrogradegame.com/"},"supported_languages":"English<strong>*</strong>, German<strong>*</strong>, French<strong>*</strong>, Italian<strong>*</strong>, Spanish - Spain<strong>*</strong><br><strong>*</strong>languages with full audio support","type":"game","website":"http://www.retrogradegame.com"}
