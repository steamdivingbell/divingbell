{"about_the_game":"It\u2019s your basic boy meets rocket, boy loses rocket, boy gets dragged along the ground, and crushed against a wall story. You fly around with a super-fast rocket between your legs. You fire cables from your rocket at pylons to turn and to clothesline your opponents (preferably really good friends, who take losing badly).<br><br>You knock them off their rockets. You steal their rockets. You plow them over, repeatedly, with their own rockets. Then, you snag them with your cables and you drag them along the ground, bashing them into walls and things. As if this wasn\u2019t already Nirvana, the soundtrack features the legendary surf guitar rockin\u2019 Dick Dale!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Modes</h2><strong>Rocket Ball</strong><br>Croquet, it ain\u2019t. Try latching onto different kinds of balls, some that bounce\u2026others that explode! Heave them into the goal or at other jockeys! All while they try to turn your head into pudding pie!<br><br><strong>Rocket Racing</strong><br>Makes drag racing look like bingo. Rocket around the arena, cutting between pylons, smacking fellow jockeys into the wall and out of the race. All while avoiding oncoming walls. To win, you need a strategy. A twisted, demented, crackbrained, sicko strategy, but a strategy nonetheless!<br><br><strong>Rocket War</strong><br>Last one on a rocket wins! More importantly though, said winner, gets to scream in the losers\u2019 faces. Isn\u2019t that what it\u2019s all about?! Clothesline opponents, drag them along the ground at speeds over 100 MPH, plow them over, torch them with jet exhaust and absolutely crush them against the hood of your rocket! All\u2019s fair in love and war\u2026and we ain\u2019t talkin\u2019 bout\u2019 love!
