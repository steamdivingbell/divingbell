Comit and Jupi must once again stop Krater before it is too late. Comit in Krater Returns is a platformer game where you will be running, jumping and bursting your way though several stages collecting items, crushing enemies and saving the universe again. Collect 5 Red Stars in a stage to go to the bonus stage where you play as Jupi through a timed maze like area. It's the only way to unlock Meta Comit. New items include shields for an extra layer of protection, Hearts to refill health, clocks to boost the new time limit systems and moon shards which can increase your max health system. New to the game are high scores and speed runs to compete with the community or for personal bests.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/981040/extras/features_red.png?t=1726982627\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">New Engine - Improved Physics</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">New Bonus Stages - Play as Jup</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">New Items - Shields, Moon Shards, Hearts &amp; Clocks</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">High Score and Speed Runs</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/981040/extras/engine_red.png?t=1726982627\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Comit in Krater Returns features a new engine with smoother gameplay.
