{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A Game of Gods: Infinium is an ambitious new open world to explore. You wake on an island nation gripped by war with no memory of who you are. Recollect your memories and ally yourself with the factions you believe in or seize the crown yourself. Become a hero or try and live a normal life in this fantasy world as each choice matters and shapes the narrative.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Infinium is a lush and beautiful island nation where kingdoms have rises and inevitably fell over the centuries. Today a relatively young race of beings, Man, claim the island for themselves. They sneer at those who came before and swiftly eradicate all in conquest. Decades of hostility towards the natural balance of life has led to the uprising of a new, angrier race; Kebari. Little is known of these sentient beings, however humans consider them to be the result of the ancestors they once dominated. Village elders often tell a tale of the Kebari manifesting from the sheer hatred of the forest.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This demo is an early build of the game and will still have some placeholders like animations, icon images, &amp; dialogues. 80% of this build is textures and therefore resolutions have been cut in half to make the demo smaller. The full game will have a slightly higher graphical fidelity due to this. Consider this product a beta rather than a demo for a finished game.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3279720/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728858555","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3279720/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1728858555","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3279720/310d558bd6ebc4a75977d732107253d2dbc7a53b/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728858555","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3279720/310d558bd6ebc4a75977d732107253d2dbc7a53b/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728858555","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A Game of Gods: Infinium is an ambitious new open world to explore.
