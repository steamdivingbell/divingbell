{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Shadow of the Demon Lord</h2><strong> The End Is Just the Beginning</strong>  <br>As the Demon Lord's shadow creeps across the world, it creates the chance for heroes to seize their destinies and villains to accomplish their despicable goals. As you play the game, you and your friends tell stories about thwarting the plots of twisted cultists, hunting down and destroying bizarre demons, exploring lost lands, investigating weird mysteries, and so much more. <br> Sometimes the world needs heroes. But in the desperation of these last days, the world will take all those it can get: heroes, blackguards, madmen, and whoever else is willing to stand against the coming darkness. Will you fight the demons or will you burn it all down and dance among the ashes? Who will you become when the world dies?\u00a0 <br> Shadow of the Demon Lord(R) opens a door to an imaginary world held in the grip of a cosmic destroyer. Enter a land steeped in the chaos and madness unleashed by the end times, with whole realms overrun by howling herds of beastmen, warped spirits freed from the Underworld, and unspeakable horrors stirred awaken by the Demon Lord's imminent arrival.\u00a0 <br> A complete tabletop roleplaying game, Shadow of the Demon Lord provides everything you need to create and play characters, form groups in pursuit of adventure, and tell exciting stories with your friends. As well, the book gives Game Masters all the tools they need to create adventures, over one hundred foul creatures, a detailed region of the campaign world, and extensive advice to help run the game. <br> The ruleset includes character sheet and combat automation to make running games easier for players and Game Masters.<br><br><i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by:</i> <strong>Damian Hupfeld, Kevin Heffernan and Allen Dodge</strong>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2157030/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1666101243","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2157030/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1666101243","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2157030/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1666101243","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2157030/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1666101243","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Shadow of the Demon Lord</h2><strong> The End Is Just the Beginning</strong>  <br>As the Demon Lord's shadow creeps across the world, it creates the chance for heroes to seize their destinies and villains to accomplish their despicable goals.
