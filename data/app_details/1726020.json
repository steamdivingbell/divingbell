{"about_the_game":"\u201cNever End, Neverland!\u201d is a 2D story-based adventure game, focused on dialogue and unique puzzle gameplay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollow Amber, an 11-year old girl who wakes up one day in Neverland. It's a magical, dream-like place where your outer appearance is reflective of your own self-opinions. People take on wild forms in Neverland: horrible monsters, cute bunnies, and anything in between.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEveryone in Neverland is sent there because of their own personal demons, and are not permitted to go back to the real world until those problems are addressed. Candyman, a stubborn showman and entertainer, refuses to address his problems, claiming that Neverland wants to change people against their will. Instead of leaving and returning to his old life, he is trying to create a \u201cbetter life\u201d for himself by taking over Neverland and convincing others to do the same. Amber is quickly shoved into this conflict, and along with Quinn, another resident of Neverland, she must put an end to the fighting if she wants to return home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn &quot;Never End, Neverland!&quot;, players can walk around a cartoony, whimsical overworld and meet plenty of strange characters. You can talk to anyone and everyone, from major characters to minor NPCs, and they all have their own unique stories. Instead of turn-based RPG battles and leveling up, \u201cNever End, Neverland!\u201d uses different puzzle minigames for its combat system. Encounters with enemies will have you solving problems in-tune with the enemy's own personal demons.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1726020/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1647889582","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1726020/page.bg.jpg?t=1647889582","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1726020/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1647889582","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1726020/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1647889582","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"\u201cNever End, Neverland!\u201d is a 2D story-based adventure game, focused on dialogue and unique puzzle gameplay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollow Amber, an 11-year old girl who wakes up one day in Neverland.
