Lucky for you, you can buy upgrades to help your chances, and find special potions in the dungeon itself to make your journey easier.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2829890/extras/explore-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif?t=1734800921\" /><br>Navigate your way through the dungeon, featuring procedurally generated unique and different floors, each harder, with different monsters who are determined to not let you out, and not let your recover any treasure.
