The rule of the church declined. After a hundred years of chaos, a great plague dealt a fatal blow to the continent. People died or turned into monsters. The protagonist, after being infected with the plague, fell into an endless nightmare, only to be awakened by a mysterious voice, which told him to go to the Cathedral of Holy Light, once the center of the continent.
