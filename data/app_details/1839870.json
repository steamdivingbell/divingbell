{"about_the_game":"unHappy Hour! is a sometimes too-accurate life sim about youth and precariousness. You are 21 years old and struggling to pay your bills, your mom\u2019s treatment, and finish your studies. Thus, you apply for a waiter job in a crappy bar. Forget everything you read about work-life balance. Be prepared to endure 100 hour weeks pouring beers and countless stressful all-nighters. But smile: the (un)Happy Hour begins!<br><br><strong>This vicious caBARet</strong>: Despite its miserable working conditions, this lousy bar is always filled with clients. Memorize their orders, inform the chef, and serve them everything they asked for. The fewer orders you serve well, the less money you will obtain. Don\u2019t forget to clean up the mess before you leave or it will affect your salary!<br><br><strong>Life on the rocks</strong>: Not everything is work, though. Even if it seems impossible, you must pay attention to your studies, your friends, and your mom\u2019s health. Crunch too much or neglect other aspects of your life and your stress will skyrocket. That can affect your performance at the bar, the money you receive and eventually your whole life. If you burn out, it is almost game over. <br><br><strong>Our pixelated drama</strong>: Being young, wild, and free is just a Bruno Mars song. This game is developed by people who know how hard is to obtain your first job once you graduate. Precariousness is out there, waiting for you. That\u2019s why we created this pixelated drama: to make visible the situation that many youth people is forced to live in.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1839870/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1695832475","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1839870/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1695832475","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1839870/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1695832475","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1839870/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1695832475","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"unHappy Hour! is a sometimes too-accurate life sim about youth and precariousness.
