{"about_the_game":"Farmers\u2019 Market is a strategy game which requires the farmer to harvest crops and sell them at the local market in a set amount of time.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you start a new game, you will begin collecting randomly generated crops while driving your tractor.  While you collect fully grown crops, others will sprout and grow, giving you more crops to collect.  You can monitor the growth of the new crops on the tractor\u2019s onboard GPS system.  Each crop type has a different value.  Be careful though.  If you do not get your harvested crops to market in time, they will go bad and you will not collect a profit.  After each round of 1 minute, 2 minutes, or 3 minutes, depending on the amount of money you have saved in the bank, you will have the option to upgrade your tractor model, drive speed, harvest time, and harvest regrowth.  It is then time to head back out to the farm and grow some more crops and make some more money!  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe object of this game is to see how much money you can earn and place in the bank.  However, in order to make more money, you are forced to spend money to increase your production.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPut on your flannel, roll up your sleeves, and get farming!  These crops aren\u2019t going to harvest themselves. It's time to play Farmers' Market!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1735640/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1699572413","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1735640/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1699572413","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1735640/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1699572413","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1735640/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1699572413","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Farmers\u2019 Market is a strategy game which requires the farmer to harvest crops and sell them at the local market in a set amount of time.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you start a new game, you will begin collecting randomly generated crops while driving your tractor.
