{"about_the_game":"Set in Canada's frozen boreal forest 'The Cabin' is a 2D Survival Game where you must balance resource management, combat and exploration to survive the harsh winter and battle against the mysterious 'Augs' who've caused you to flee here.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInitially you'll spawn with nothing but an ax outside of the cold, unstocked Cabin. You'll need to gather firewood to heat it up, this can be done by navigating to a tree and clicking on it to swing your ax. Once you've collected the wood return to the cabin and heat it up by clicking inside to deposit the wood. Once you've heated the cabin up and regained your energy your next priority should be retrieving the handgun you dropped while fleeing here. It'll be around the cabin. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRunning and gunning is no sensible way of combating the mysterious 'Augs', you'll need to stand still to properly shoot them. Press 'A' to toggle in and out of attack mode and click where you wish to fire. If you run out of ammo you'll need to loot the local cabins for supplies, otherwise your only means of defense will be firebombs constructed from wood and gas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Moose are harmless to yourself but can trample trees and destroy good sources of wood and lumber. A handgun stands no chance of dropping them, you'll need to grapple with them gouging with the ax or find your neighbors shotgun. Finally there are the wolves, who generally will leave you be. That is until they hunt the moose population in your region to extinction. Handguns are useless, they are too fast and can withstand several shots. The neighbors shotgun is the only way of killing these beasts.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1336170/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735892381","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1336170/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1735892381","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1336170/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735892381","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1336170/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735892381","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Violence and gore in the game could be disturbing along with the more realistic and detailed \"stills\" that appear during certain cut scenes."},"detailed_description":"<h1>Announcement</h1><p>Have added Fullscreen functionality along with cleaning up several bugs related to the menu's crashing the game under specific circumstances.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Content Updates</h2>Cleaned up the GUI<br><br>Increased loot spawn rates<br>Fullscreen functionality</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Set in Canada's frozen boreal forest 'The Cabin' is a 2D Survival Game where you must balance resource management, combat and exploration to survive the harsh winter and battle against the mysterious 'Augs' who've caused you to flee here.<br><br>Initially you'll spawn with nothing but an ax outside of the cold, unstocked Cabin.
