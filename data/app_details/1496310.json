{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the vast wilderness of South Africa's Northern Province, a battle is raging between the ruthless poachers who seek to exploit the region's natural resources, and the dedicated game rangers who are determined to protect the animals and preserve the beauty of the land. &quot;Poached: Hunt The Hunter&quot; puts you in the shoes of a game ranger, tasked with defending the nature reserve from the poachers who seek to destroy it.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Here you must fight to survive. It\u2019s man versus beast versus man versus man. And if you\u2019re no stranger to danger, come play as a ranger fighting off armies of ruthless poachers with nothing but your wits, harsh language, braai tongs and an arsenal of weapons that would make any arms dealer green with envy. You wake up in your camp, make breakfast, get your orders and shoot poachers on sight using high powered automatic weapons. Simple. Or you skip breakfast, that\u2019s up to you. Or you chase chickens around for half an hour, grow hallucinogenic plants in the shed, spend the day barbequing goat chops to perfection, race ostriches or rescue lost rangers stuck in trees, I\u2019m not going to tell you how to live your life.
