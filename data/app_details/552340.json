{"about_the_game":"So, you\u2019ve finally decided to show up, eh? Do you even know what you\u2019re here for? Whatever. Our previous subjects kept dying on us, so you\u2019ll have to do. Just stand there and destroy the turrets before they destroy you. Oh, and please do your best to not suck like the others. What do you mean there're too many of them? Sigh, are you that slow? Just suck in what the turrets are hitting you with and fire back a huge explosive shot! Also, in case you haven\u2019t noticed, (which I doubt you have, with your dimwittedness) the lasers are dangerous too. And they're fast. You might want to avoid them if you have any attachment to life, not that it matters to us. Don't worry, if the worst happens, there're others waiting to take your place.
