{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dolven is a Tactical RPG with a deep card-based battle system. The gameplay loop revolves around strategic card play where each hand dealt must be tactically deployed to defeat enemies. In this demo, you will experience the first of 16 dungeons. Each dungeon has 10 procedurally generated rooms. Some rooms are like escape rooms with puzzles to solve.  Overall, rooms offer tactical hand to hand combat, cards to play and gear to collect.  And if you fail in a room, you can 'retry' the room without going back to the start.  There is a short 2min tutorial at the outset and you can skip the cutscenes.   </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The demo introduces you to the rich narrative and deep story, setting the stage for the journey that lies ahead.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3155820/extras/Pillars_Small.gif?t=1736464432\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Pillars allow you to create various hand combinations that range from matching cards and suits, playing a pivotal role in your quest to accumulate more Mana, Gear, Cards, Skills and even exerting influence over the game's environment.
