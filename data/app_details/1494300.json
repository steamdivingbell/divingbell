{"about_the_game":"This historical campaign is dedicated to the Soviet ground attack aviation regiment under the command of Major Leonid Karpovich Chumachenko which was tasked with interdiction of the German 'air bridge', the air supply route for the encircled Paulus' 6th Army during one of the most intense episodes of the Battle of Stalingrad in December 1942. During this time-frame, Soviet command had to simultaneously solve several problems: disrupt enemy airborne re-supply operations, contain 284,000 German and Romanian troops who have been encircled, and repel a very dangerous counter-strike by the German 4th Panzer Army from the area of Kotelnikovo (Operation &quot;Winter Storm&quot;).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou are expected to search and destroy German transport planes in the air, to strike at airfields and troops inside the cauldron, and to conduct reconnaissance along the Stalingrad front. At the final stage of the campaign, you will take part in the hardest battles on the Myshkova River, which determined the outcome of the entire German counter-offensive and sealed the fate of the German army trapped near Stalingrad.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTime frame: November 29th - December 25th, 1942<br />\r\nUnit: 505th ShAP 226th ShAD<br />\r\nAvailable aircraft: IL-2 AM-38 (model 1942)<br />\r\nDuration: 15 missions<br />\r\nAverage playtime: 7 hours<br />\r\nAuthor: Alexander =BlackSix= Timoshkov","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1494300/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734533139","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1494300/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1734533139","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1494300/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734533139","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1494300/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734533139","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This historical campaign is dedicated to the Soviet ground attack aviation regiment under the command of Major Leonid Karpovich Chumachenko which was tasked with interdiction of the German 'air bridge', the air supply route for the encircled Paulus' 6th Army during one of the most intense episodes of the Battle of Stalingrad in December 1942.
