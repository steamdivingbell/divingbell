{"about_the_game":"\u201cDaffodil Yellow: a few poems from an insect collector\u201d is a 3D game/interactive experience about the reconciliation between someone and a season.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story takes place at the very beginning of summer. This season makes the collector see everything in black and white. One day, after taking a nap, he turns into a butterfly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe will go through three memories that are dear to him, which took place during previous summers. Looking for a color in each of them, he will repaint his current summer. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach memory, each flower, each color has a meaning, creating an ambience through the music and the visuals. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn abstract story without words, this project is about the different translations of a feeling. A precise feeling, told as visuals, sound, text and interactions through a 15-20 minute long experience.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1386830/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1646230814","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1386830/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1646230814","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1386830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1646230814","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1386830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1646230814","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":1412800,"description":"Demo Scene"}],"detailed_description":"\u201cDaffodil Yellow: a few poems from an insect collector\u201d is a 3D game/interactive experience about the reconciliation between someone and a season.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story takes place at the very beginning of summer.
