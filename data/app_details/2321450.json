{"about_the_game":"Welcome to QR Escape, a game designed by QR Mosaics.<br><br>QR Escape is essentially a fun escape-room puzzle-solving game, with a unique twist. You play the game on your PC/laptop device while interacting with a QR reader app on your mobile device. You are playing one of the first games in a new interactive gameplay genre.<br><br>To progress in the game, you will need to solve puzzles, and once complete they will reveal/construct a QR code. When scanned with a reader, those QR codes will provide a 6-digit password. That code is then plugged into various keypads in the game to open doors and make progress. The codes change each time the game is played, so each game execution is a unique experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">QR Codes</h2></h2></h2><br>There are many QR codes to scan in the game. Some are required to progress the game, some provide clues/hints, some are for fun and others are simply gallery QR artwork to look at and enjoy!<br><br>Because scanning QR codes is a very important aspect of the game, please feel free to test your ability to scan using the picture below before you purchase the game. If you can scan this picture on your screen and see the words &quot;puzzle time!&quot; on your QR reader, you can play the game! Scan from a distance!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2321450/extras/Mosaic_38_500.png?t=1685328293\" /><br><br>If it doesn't scan right away move your phone AWAY from the screen so it appears small, or zoom-out. QR readers are best at reading screen QR's from a few feet away.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Where Do I Get A QR Reader?</h2></h2><br>if you have a mobile phone, you certainly will be able to scan the QR codes.<br><br>1) Modern iPhone or Android devices will scan from the built-in camera. Just start up the camera app and point the camera at the QR code on the screen and the camera will detect it. You may have to enable QR Scanning from your phone settings if it is currently disabled.<br>2) Download a custom QR reader. There are literally hundreds to choose from, most work fine, but a few are not so good. The free QR reader app I used personally to test the game (on an iPhone) is called &quot;Qrafter: QR Code reader&quot;. I found it an excellent reader, but it will show adverts. I have no personal connection to the reader and do not profit from it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Story</h2></h2></h2><br>You have been asked by the curator of a unique art gallery to investigate strange goings-on in the basement of the gallery. The basement is used as a store room and to provide heat. However, the curator has been locked out of the basement and strange noises are coming from downstairs.  As you enter the gallery, the door locks behind you and you realize you must escape. Delve into the underbelly of the gallery to discover the source of the mystery and escape!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Achievements</h2></h2></h2><br>If you like achievements, this is the game for you.
