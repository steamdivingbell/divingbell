Explore the void, chart mineral-rich asteroid belts, and destroy pirate outposts in an epic struggle for survival.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1049910/extras/Survival_Mode.png?t=1667018965\" /><br>Fight to your last in this endless game mode. Survival mode charges you with a sole starbase in a vast area of space; in this vast area, you will find trouble, and rewards. Gather resources, build up a fleet, and prepare for the alien menace that lurks in the darkness of space. Your enemies are relentless and will mercilessly destroy everything you have built; only the strong will survive. Fight on for as long as possible, accumulating score on an international leaderboard. Prove to your friends that you are worthy of the mantle of Admiral!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1049910/extras/LargeScale.png?t=1667018965\" /><br>Ever dreamed of a hundred starships blasting each other apart in fiery battle in the void?
