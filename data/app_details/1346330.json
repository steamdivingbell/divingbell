That doesn't matter at all, of course, as the core gameplay is fun and challenging enough to justify itself a place in the library.\u201d<br>NA \u2013 The Dreamcast Junkyard<br><br>\u201cFlea is a stunningly good independent game with a unique mechanic that is bound to make the retrogamer in us all smile and laugh our heads off whilst keeping the difficulty curve to make this game good for speed running. In my opinion, this game is good and addictive enough to be the next Super Meat Boy, and is also family friendly enough that both the dad and the kids in the family will want to play it.
