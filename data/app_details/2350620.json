{"about_the_game":"&quot;Dive into the dynamic world of 'Asteroid King,' a game where exhilarating pace meets innovative gameplay. This game isn't just about speed and action; it's a celebration of engaging mechanics and exhilarating excitement. For those seeking a gaming experience that combines classic charm with fresh features, 'Asteroid King' is your perfect match. Get ready for an adventure that redefines both fun and coolness!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Asteroid King, beings from the second dimension have breached our third dimension through rifts in spacetime. Their leader, known as the Asteroid King, has harnessed gravity to hurl asteroids towards our planets. You are among the last surviving captains of an ancient fleet of warships, remnants from our long-lost homeworld, Earth. These ships are barely functional and desperately need upgrades and resources to regain their full strength. The question is, can you revitalize them before the Asteroid King reaches our solar system? Good luck - you're humanity's final hope!&quot;","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Finished_Tutorial","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2350620/4d2bfdfe11157f57639aaaa80d919e20f0196541.jpg"},{"name":"Charge Weapons!
