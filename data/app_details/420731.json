Will her darkling music bring ruin to the village she now calls her home? Can the heroes earn the townsfolk's trust, or must innocence be sacrificed for the heroes to save town from the mysterious hauntings that plague a village huddled in the shadow of an accursed ruin? <br><br>This dark fantasy adventure is perfect for 1st-level characters using the 5th edition of the world's most famous role-playing game.
