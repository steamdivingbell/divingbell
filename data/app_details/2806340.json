{"about_the_game":"1. Game Content<br />\r\nThis is a textual reasoning game. You will follow the protagonist's perspective to explore the hidden truth beneath the &quot;non-existent things&quot; in multiple dreamscapes. The game features free scene investigation, and there are many scenes and clues hidden in the details waiting for you to discover. There are also some secrets hidden behind the puzzles. However, what is the true reality of this world? Is it a sweet cake or a poisonous poison? Just like Alice falling into the rabbit hole - &quot;So, are you going to eat me, drink me, or... save me?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2.Game Features<br />\r\n2D light reasoning, pure plot-oriented no cultivation, female-oriented AVG. It's a realistic setting with some fantastical elements. The description and elements in the plot have little connection with the real world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3..Gameplay<br />\r\nThis game is told from the perspective of the female protagonist.<br />\r\nSimilar to the beginning of amnesia, at first, the female protagonist can be used as a heartless evidence-gathering tool. Her personality will gradually emerge as the story progresses. There are many names/aliases for the female protagonist, and the current appearance of Shiratori Rurika is not her real name.<br />\r\nThe worldview will also gradually reveal as the female protagonist solves the mysteries.<br />\r\nThis game is tentatively set to have two characters that can be developed, and they are both male. One of them is expected to appear relatively late in the main text, but he will appear early in the spin-off.<br />\r\nThere is no separate love line, and emotions are closely linked to the plot, with the plot advancing emotions.<br />\r\nImportant clues have prompt symbols, and there are also free-clickable scenes for non-important clues. Open the clue collection interface to view detailed information on clues, and some clues can be clicked to view details. There are a few pages where clicking on a clue can reveal a new clue, and clues can be combined to generate new clues.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"\u5149\uff0c\u5f71\u548c\u9e29\u9152","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2806340/bf1ab2f7f8b3394425e53eaa800148004c245e80.jpg"},{"name":"\u771f\u5b9e\u7231\u4e3d\u4e1d","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2806340/4d690ad34d35f28884ac8b26fadb8355ac77ba98.jpg"},{"name":"\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u81ea\u6211","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2806340/15a816512f22fa71ae55ab64acd43ca48698ed67.jpg"},{"name":"\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u81ea\u6211","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2806340/a2fd3df127c7ab78668f1143edd358877e804165.jpg"}],"total":4},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2806340/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1711096670","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2806340/page.bg.jpg?t=1711096670","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2806340/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1711096670","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2806340/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1711096670","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"1.
