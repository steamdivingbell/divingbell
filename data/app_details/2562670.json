Rolls or kicks are an important part of the gameplay: during the roll, the player's character becomes invulnerable for a short time, which allows avoid damage if the roll was performed in time. In close combat, the player has access to a special move: a kick, for which you need to press a button in time. Upon successfully parrying an enemy strike, they will be briefly stunned and open to attack.<br><br><strong>Events</strong><br>Dynamic game world includes randomized game events like Crash Sites, Earthquake, Ambush and special Trading Quest events.
