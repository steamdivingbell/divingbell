You\u2019ll face enemies like medieval knights, futuristic robots, and cosmic creatures, and the action never stops as waves of enemies keep coming from all sides.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Auto Firing Weapons</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your weapons fire automatically so you can focus on movement and loot. As you progress and survive longer, you'll unlock upgrades that boost your abilities, making each run unique and fun! \u00a0</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combining Survivors with Physics</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Gravity Survivors you have to worry about explosions pushing enemies, where your black holes will throw them, and how your attacks will affect your own movement. By adding physics into the mix, Gravity Survivors offers a unique experience that leads to crazy situations and a lot of fun!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Roguelike Progression System</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With a roguelike progression system, no two runs are the same. Defeat enemies to earn upgrades and adapt to the cube\u2019s ever-changing challenges. Waves of enemies become increasingly difficult, and gravity keeps shifting, adding complexity and excitement to every moment.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay Loop</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Gravity Survivors, you go into each round and spawn into a massive cube, with each wall being a random map that you can explore to get rewards and fight different enemies. You collect guns through the shop at the end of each round. Once you defeat the floor's boss and get the shop, you can change the gravity in the cube and go into the next round. Keep doing this to unlock insane weapons like a black hole gun, time-freezing wand, and many more!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Do you have what it takes to survive the relentless chaos of Gravity Survivors?</h2>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2496760/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730265069","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2496760/page.bg.jpg?t=1730265069","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2496760/d45bdc5c6fe3391ecb06280441175edbd1f6b2a1/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730265069","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2496760/d45bdc5c6fe3391ecb06280441175edbd1f6b2a1/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730265069","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Gravity Survivors throws you into an intense battlefield inside a massive cube, where each wall has its own theme.
