Destroy an armored wall first so you can then shoot through the hole into the vulnerable center. Try to hit a bomb in the environment.

You will start each stage with a limited set of parts and you will need to find a strategy on how to use them to destroy all main target blocks. You will unlock new parts the further you progress, and every world comes with it's own special environmental mechanic.
