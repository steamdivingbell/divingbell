{"about_the_game":"The Role Music Player (RMP) is a digital soundboard application designed for Tabletop RPG sessions, aimed at providing players with a more immersive experience through audio (Music, ambient sounds, transitions). Through Dimensions, users will have access to a vast library of soundtracks to implement in their narrative campaigns in an accessible and intuitive way. The RMP's great differential is the ability to control the density of each theme, allowing the immersion provided by the musical score to remain intact and adapt to each type of narrator. The possibility of using music at low densities means that reducing the volume of the music is not necessary when it tends to drown out the narration. At the same time it is possible to reserve high densities for epic moments in the narration","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3069260/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734386795","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3069260/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1734386795","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3069260/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734386795","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3069260/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734386795","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3387530,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"The Role Music Player (RMP) is a digital soundboard application designed for Tabletop RPG sessions, aimed at providing players with a more immersive experience through audio (Music, ambient sounds, transitions).
