Arthur's attempts to woo Lancelot are a comedy of errors that would make even the most seasoned court jesters envious. He can lead armies into battle while twirling in a sequined cape, but when it comes to courting Lancelot, he's as graceful as a flamingo wearing glass slippers on an ice rink. His love for Lancelot is a secret so well-guarded that even the kingdom's most flamboyant gossip queens can't spill the tea, and believe us, they've tried.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2819110/extras/b7973e7b922c221f427c4c2533fd67d9_original.png?t=1739948372\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Race:\u00a0Human<br>Age:\u00a018 <br>Hometown:\u00a0Camelot <br>Occupation:\u00a0Knight <br>Long story short:\u00a0Mean boy</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">His grandmother is an elf so Kay has some elfy features, Kay is typically depicted as a skilled and valiant knight. He is known for his loyalty to Arthur and often serves as one of the prince's most trusted companions. However, he can also display a gruff and sometimes irritable demeanor. But here's the twist: Kay's heart beats to a different rhythm, and it's not for the typical damsels in distress. No, Kay is as gay as a unicorn wearing glittered horseshoes.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2819110/extras/8262c6b594b18a523c714957b29f40e6_original.png?t=1739948372\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Species:\u00a0Satyr<br>Age:\u00a03000+ <br>Hometown:\u00a0SylvanGlam Woods <br>Occupation:\u00a0Guardian <br>Long story short:\u00a0Immortal magical creature gets bored</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Allow me to introduce you to Aricen, the flamboyantly fabulous gay satyr who rules over the most enchanted corner of Camelot's woods. Aricen has a penchant for playing love games with the unsuspecting visitors who wander into his domain.
