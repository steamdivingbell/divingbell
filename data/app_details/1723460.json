{"about_the_game":"ToyPark is a social VR platform where you can easily create games and experiences using our SDK and in-game tools or play what others have created.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How is ToyPark different from other social platforms like VRchat or Rec Room?</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">1. Cutting-edge VR physics in multiplayer</h2>Awesome Boneworks-like physics is built-in ToyPark's DNA from the start. And it all works flawlessly whether it's PvP or PvE.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">2. Focus on games and experiences </h2>We are going way beyond avatars and worlds. In ToyPark creators can upload whole games of any genre and style. Who knows maybe the next Half-Life: Alyx will come out of one of the ToyPark's creators?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">3. Intuitive in-game VR tools</h2>You don't have to learn new made-up programming languages to create new levels or maps inside ToyPark. All the world creation tools are on the tips of your fingers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">4. SDK contains everything needed to build awesome games</h2>Advanced creators won't have to code basic stuff like guns, enemies, or props from scratch. All of that is covered in the SDK and works beautifully with Unreal Engine's native Blueprint scripting.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">For players: endless worlds of fun and mayhem</h2><br>Jump into the action right away: drive cars, shoot enemies, solve puzzles, and discover new worlds with your friends. Or make friends with other ToyPark players!  <br><br>And if you are feeling creative grab our in-game tools and create your own dream games or experiences. All the content that has ever been uploaded to ToyPark is at your disposal. Create a game you always wanted to play, no coding skills needed.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">For creators: a x10 faster way to build and test your game ideas</h2><br>We provide creators with an SDK based on Unreal Engine where you can find all the classes/components/functions needed to build immersive multiplayer experiences. No need to dive into complex networking or IK code - it all works behind the scenes via the SDK. <br><br>Little to none Unreal Blueprint visual scripting experience is needed to build a multiplayer version of Blade and Sorcery, for example. But that's not all. You can upload any scripts or levels and it will work.
