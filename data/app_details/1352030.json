And it happens to be the temple of Alyanas, the Goddess of victory and fortune, guarded by a legendary ancient gladiator, Alyanas' chosen champion Daria.

Can they succeed when everyone else fails?<br><br><strong>2)The trial of Gortus:</strong><br>One morning, a volcano in the Feelands erupted, coming with a violent earthquake. At this time, the chief priest of the Gortus temple declared that Gortus, the god of war, is about to wake from a long sleep, and when he does, he will be full of anger. The volcanic eruption and earthquake was a sign. Soon a trial of the braves will be held in the temple of Gortus to appease the wrath of the god of war.
