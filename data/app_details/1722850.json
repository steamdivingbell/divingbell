I'm really impressed with the quality of the animations - Ahmad's actions all look amazingly fluid and natural, even with the game's throwback vibe. This is a seriously terrific piece of work as well as an important perspective that we have never seen in a shooter before.\u201d<br>Ian Boudreau, freelance writer for PCGamesN<br><br>\u201cI got Rank A after a long time playing. Too much fun! Your game is very cool, bro! After you get the tricks of the pixel where you shoot (especially from a distance) it's really nice to play. Congratulations! I saw a lot of Max Payne references, I loved the character movement also!\u201d<br>Val, freelance writer for MeuPlayStation<br><br>\u201cI tested the demo and it ran really fine on my PC. It's already a positive point because it shows great accessibility. It's a super fun game. It reminded me a lot of games like Max Payne, despite the high difficulty (which can be fixed eventually). A valid criticism is the lack of being able to have a graphic options menu since I was wanting to reduce the graphic details to improve performance on my PC. And also the motion blur, which I think could be smoothed out. Otherwise this game is 10 of 10.\u201d<br>Sandirne Pasta,
