{"about_the_game":"<u><strong>Features:</strong></u><br><br><strong>Gameplay:</strong><br>Blok pairs rain from the sky so do your best to rotate and place them as well as you can. If four bloks of the same colour are in a row then they are destroyed, your score goes up, and all nearby ground gets destroyed. Win by getting rid of all the special blue bloks buried in the ground. Try and get the most points possible or go for for the fastest time to see how far up the leaderboards you can get. The game features full controller support so play with a controller or simply use your keyboard.<br><br><strong>Difficulty:</strong><br>There are 3 primary difficulties, each with their own leaderboard. Beyond this, you can adjust specific characteristics of the difficulty to tailor your experience to exactly how you want it, but rounds played with the custom difficulty do not contribute to the leaderboard. These specific changes you can make include: the depth of the dirt placed at the start of the ground, the speed at which bloks fall to the ground, and the quantity of special blue bloks buried in the ground.<br><br><strong>Whak Atak:</strong><br>A unique way to play the game where after certain numbers of bloks are place, crazy effects take effect on the game: your controls could be reversed, gravity could stop working, special new bloks could show up, and many more. This offers a more unpredictable way to play and can be done in the single player mode or can be played in the two player mode.<br><br><strong>Two Player Mode:</strong><br>You can play the game against a friend and see who can beat the game the fastest or maybe you could crank the difficulty up and see who can survive the longest. This mode keeps track of the number of times each player has won a game so you can <i>really</i> see who the best player is. Both players can play using the keyboard or have one player use the keyboard while the other uses a controller.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1411140/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1599584264","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1411140/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1599584264","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1411140/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1599584264","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1411140/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1599584264","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<u><strong>Features:</strong></u><br><br><strong>Gameplay:</strong><br>Blok pairs rain from the sky so do your best to rotate and place them as well as you can.
