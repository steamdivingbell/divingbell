{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Career mode</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The career mode is all about a simulation-style experience. Team performances evolve over time and even new teams enter the field replacing old ones. You start in a backmarker team trying to work your way up. Solid race performances will aid development and refined teamwork over the years improves car setups, but at some point it's often better to move on. Keep up with the active driver market and impress with your race performances to secure a seat in the best possible team for the following season. When you have the car for it, push hard for the championship!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Feel the traction</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Formula cars are the greatest racing cars in the world with amazing speed, downforce and grip. The game's driving model is built to emphasize this; hitting that apex just right really makes a difference. Slipstream overtakes and intense side-by-side battles create a great race experience. The AI drivers make mistakes, line up for overtakes and offer an engaging challenge for all skill levels.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1969650/extras/pit.gif?t=1732471317\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Pit strategy</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Optimize risk in your tire strategy on different tracks and temperatures to maximize grip throughout the race. Push to gain positions with your fresh soft tires or try to hold your ground long enough with hard tires to take advantage of the extra durability. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dynamic weather</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dynamic weather adds a whole other dimension to strategy. Do you start with wet tires on clear weather to get ready for the coming rain or leave those who do in the dust with soft tires? Or maybe you will do a longer stint with intermediate tires since the rain is light and won't last long. Whatever your plan, always be ready to adjust during the race. Reacting to the strategies of others and taking risks can make underdogs into winners.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Damage and engine modes</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Watch out for damage that will affect your car's speed and suspension, some can be fixed during a pit stop, but not all. Whenever you feel the race is slipping away from you and you need just a little extra power, you can push your luck with the high engine mode. If you end up with an engine failure or you just want to conserve your tires, you can use the low engine mode to control the situation.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Online multiplayer and leaderboards</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Play with friends for fun or arrange races on the Discord server to test your skills against the best. Hit up time trials to chase the perfect lap and climb the leaderboards.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Steam Workshop, spectator mode and more</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Tinker with the data to create your fantasy series; driver and team data and textures files are all moddable and can be shared in the Steam Workshop. Lay back and watch the AI drivers do their thing in spectator mode. Unlock tiny cars and do donuts. Enjoy!</p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Winner","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1969650/18920d6097bba40086d34ed6ba37190f80b0aad4.jpg"},{"name":"Champion","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1969650/14cee59a1bed4e6941638341322614a125ee6e3a.jpg"},{"name":"Dominant","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1969650/3f3b8feee29ed2db56a602ca0c18d4f2c0642640.jpg"},{"name":"Legend","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1969650/ba261d6ed9f2418316036eb2dc72c5c23bf2e57e.jpg"},{"name":"Star","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1969650/2c478f1863fa890399e75b3ab3a60f5cc547ce20.jpg"},{"name":"Prodigy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1969650/9976d1a70a2b053269f83b3ff66c221a36f4b85d.jpg"},{"name":"Loyal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1969650/c757fb88a87eee52e7c969b1a986187b12a9b1eb.jpg"},{"name":"Journeyman","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1969650/140ef832006cb1a5769d5426b063c80df5969ea3.jpg"},{"name":"Rookie","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1969650/f251ddfbbf2b6dc3d59fb8bf6f45457225cfce24.jpg"},{"name":"Veteran","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1969650/1ab846f7e9efae472302b24cd5dba6865d1e4a06.jpg"}],"total":12},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1969650/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732471317","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1969650/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1732471317","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1969650/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732471317","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1969650/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732471317","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Career mode</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The career mode is all about a simulation-style experience.
