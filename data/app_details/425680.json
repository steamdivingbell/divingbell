{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Create a game ready grenade </h2><br>Follow along in this free and compact ~2 hour long free tutorial as we create a game ready grenade aimed for first person view as you would see it in a modern first person shooter game right in front of the camera. Starting with the scene setup in 3Ds Max, you will learn how to set up reference images and determining the right size for our object. We will then continue with the low and high-poly modeling in which we make use of advanced actions, modifiers and tools to help us create our grenade. After the modeling process we will jump straight into the UVW Editor and focus on the importance of an optimized UV-Layout to get the maximum out of our texture.<br><br>In the Substance Painter part we will then bake our normal map as well as other important support maps. Right after that you will learn how to create an ultra realistic texture for our grenade. Follow and learn how to create our base layer materials and how to use procedural textures, masks and generators to form up the wear and tear on our grenade resulting in a photo realistic appearance.<br><br>To give feedback on some of the discussion on this tutorial, this model is not aiming to be a third person or world view model. The poly count is aimed at first person view and is not representing a game model that would only consume up a bit of space on the screen. If you have any questions you can contact me through facebook.
