At that time, the game only supported local multiplayer, but most players wanted to play with their friends online. So, we spent the entire year of 2024 developing online multiplayer. We decided to release the game as <i>Out of Hand: Deluxe</i> since we made improvements to every aspect of the game along the way and felt it would be more fun to launch it as a whole new game rather than just updating an old one that probably no one remembers anymore.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Online and Local Multiplayer</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Play online with your friends or with random people on the internet, or gather your friends in the couch and plug in some gamepads to play up to 8 players on the tv</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3193680/extras/Out_of_Hand_Deluxe_Gameplay_ezGIF.gif?t=1739351341\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Physics Based Hand</strong>  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Use your  hand to grab items around the map, then throw them at your friends</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3193680/extras/Sword_GIF_2.gif?t=1739351341\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Physics Based Dodge Roll</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Use the dodge roll feature to become a ragdoll at any time</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3193680/extras/Out_of_Hand_Deluxe_Dodge.gif?t=1739351341\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>And then combine them</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3193680/extras/Out_of_Hand_Deluxe_Minigun.gif?t=1739351341\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Unlockable Outfits</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Get different outfits by unlocking achievements</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3193680/extras/Steam_bred_outfit_bild.png?t=1739351341\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Tons Of Levels</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Play on more than 40 unique levels with varied gameplay</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3193680/extras/LevelsL\u00e5ngsam.gif?t=1739351341\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3193680/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1739351341","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3193680/page.bg.jpg?t=1739351341","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3193680/fc80475f80fe3546cb2961eb0ac3786fd6b3dcf7/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739351341","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3193680/fc80475f80fe3546cb2961eb0ac3786fd6b3dcf7/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739351341","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":3248590,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Out of Hand</i> is a fast paced action party game with a unique controllable physics based hand, and a very physics based dodge roll. 2-8 players fight to be the last one standing in short rounds on a variety of islands with tons of different and unique items.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Demo Out Now </strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Play the demo!
