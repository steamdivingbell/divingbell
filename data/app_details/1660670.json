{"about_the_game":"<strong>Dungeoneers</strong> provides an authentic, tabletop dungeon crawling experience, streamlined for quick, solo play.  You\u2019ll be slaying dragons before you can say <i>gelatinous cube</i>.<br><br>This demo is different than the full game (releasing in July) in two ways:<br><br>1 - The full game includes all the in-game features labeled as Advanced.<br>2 - The full game includes a world map, with a dozen more regions.<br><br>Nonetheless, this demo is a full-fledged, highly polished dungeon crawler. We hope you enjoy it and add Dungeoneers to your wishlist.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dragons to be Slain</h2><br>The villagers need a hero, and you're the nearest one. Each time you save the village from the latest threat, you'll rise in fame and unlock more features.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dungeons to be Crawled</h2><br>Gather better weapons and magic as you navigate non-linear dungeon levels. Choose paths that offer the most reward at the least risk. When ready, enter the dragon lair and finish the job.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Turn-Based Tactics</h2><br>The combat mechanics involve hex grids, attack modifiers, and poly dice. The strategy involves using room layouts to your advantage, wielding the proper weapons and magic, and knowing when it\u2019s time to sneak, fight, or ... flee!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Streamlined Gameplay</h2><br>Witty NPC remarks, without long monologues or dialog trees. Meaningful weapon choices, without complicated inventory management. Fantastic art, without annoying cut-scenes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tag Team Heroes</h2><br>Use the best hero for the job, swapping mid-quest as needed. The <strong><i>Human Swordsman</i></strong> is a well-rounded fighter who excels with his blade. The <strong><i>Elven Huntress</i></strong>, with her archery and leaping ability, does best when keeping her distance. The <strong><i>Dwarven Brawler</i></strong>, relying on his trusty shield and deadly fist, enjoys charging into a crowd. With experience, each hero will gain new skills and improved feats.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Weapons &amp; Scrolls</h2><br>You\u2019ll start each dungeon run with weapons that only a blacksmith\u2019s mother could love. That <strong><i>+1 Sword of Cutting Remarks</i></strong> will not always be helpful. Procure better swords, shields, and bows through stealth or force. You'll also find magic scrolls such as <strong><i>Flame</i></strong> to create defensive barriers, <strong><i>Leap</i></strong> to reposition yourself, <strong><i>Haste</i></strong> for a free action, <i><strong>Vanish</strong></i> to become unseen, and <strong><i>Bolt</i></strong> to cast lighting when you have all your orcs in a row.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Monsters You'll Recognize</h2><br>Engage (or elude) 125+ monster types, ranging from <strong><i>Rats of Unusual Size</i></strong> to <strong><i>Lich Queens</i></strong>. Some creatures, such as <strong><i>Purple Worms</i></strong> and <strong><i>Cavern Crawlers</i></strong>, will attack other monsters, not just you. Monster art is derived from a popular line of tabletop figures by <strong>Reaper Miniatures</strong>.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Outdoor Hunts &amp; Dungeon Tourneys</h2><br>Partake in daily outdoor hunts for an XP bounty, and join weekly tournaments to test your dungeon prowess against other players.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Play from Anywhere</h2><br>When you aren\u2019t on your Steam account, you can play from a web browser. Our servers save your progress regardless of how you are connecting.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Steadfast Developers</h2><br>Our assorted wizards and gnomes are dedicated to the ongoing development of <strong>Dungeoneers</strong>. We don\u2019t have a genie, but add us to your wishlist, and we\u2019ll see what we can do.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1660670/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1623295772","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1660670/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1623295772","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1660670/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1623295772","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1660670/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1623295772","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Dungeoneers</strong> provides an authentic, tabletop dungeon crawling experience, streamlined for quick, solo play.
