On that day, I launched the original <i>BUTTON: A game about pressing issues</i> on Kickstarter. With no marketing, no advertising, and no plan, the people found us.

And I need to stop being so humble.<br><br>Enter <i>Josh Powlison's BUTTON: Mildly Remastered Edition</i>.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What is <i>BUTTON: Mildly Remastered Edition</i>?</h2><br><i>BUTTON: Mildly Remastered Edition</i> is <i>BUTTON</i> but mildly remastered.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What does it mean for <i>BUTTON</i> to be mildly remastered?</h2><br>&quot;Remastered&quot; is such an ostentatious term. It assumes any one of us has achieved true mastery. Why is it that &quot;Remastered&quot; games can get &quot;Remastered&quot; again? Clearly, the devs had gained more mastery!<br><br>This folly is why I refuse to ever claim I have fully &quot;Remastered&quot; <i>BUTTON</i>. When you experience a euphoric title like <i>BUTTON</i>, you quickly come to the realization that you can never remaster a true classic- that true classic remasters <i>you</i>. With this understanding and this new shared foundation, I'd like to propose that we appreciate how remastered a mild remaster might be, while understanding that we will never master the remaster enough to produce a fully remastered classic. Instead, we are the ones who will be mastered.<br><br>In short, I am updating the game while preserving the original heart and soul of the work. My goal is that it is at least vaguely reminiscent of the original <i>BUTTON</i> while encompassing modern features expected of modern games, like widescreen support.<br><br>I didn't think it was possible to improve <i>BUTTON</i>. But then I realized that that would mean it was impossible to improve <i>myself</i>, and after much soul-searching, I realized I was wrong. I know you might lose trust in me as a developer for admitting error, but I must be honest, or else I could not look myself in the mirror as a man.<br><br>Where are the achievements? Where is the mod support? Where are the forums?<br><br><i>BUTTON</i> will always be greater than the sum of its parts, and I recognize that I am merely a part of <i>BUTTON</i>, just as <i>BUTTON</i> is a part of my soul. But still, the sum of its parts must become greater, and to do that, the parts of its sum must become greater. It's basic math.<br><br>Thus, <i>BUTTON: Mildly Remastered Edition</i> was conceived. And now I wish to publicly birth it before you, with your help.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Why Early Access?</h2><br>I knew <i>BUTTON: Mildly Remastered Edition</i> would be a crazy ride. Little did I know <i>how</i> crazy. You see, I used to think that game development was easy and that anyone could do it. I've come to the realization that I was right. But I've also come to the realization that I was wrong.<br><br>You see, making games is easy, it just takes a long time. The hard part about making games is making an <i>audience</i>. I want to see if an audience can exist and grow perpetually for BUTTON. Like, <i>forever</i>.<br><br>I want to bring you along on the journey. Not just <i>a</i> journey, I'm talking about the journey of a lifetime.
