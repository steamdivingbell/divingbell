Pingu - your best friend who, oddly enough, happens to be a penguin \u2013 just finished reading his TV guide. According to these utterly professional sources, Christmas must be saved by 8:00 PM\u2026 Hot on the holiday tracks of this mistletoe mystery, our Elf must uncover the squalid truth behind this well-beloved institution.
