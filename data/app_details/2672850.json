{"about_the_game":"This is LITERALLY just a game about flicking a switch. It's in the title. You, in a room, four pale-green colored walls, stained carpet, and those funky ceiling tiles you definitely imagined punching out when you were a kid.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAre you looking for groundbreaking mechanics? There's one function in the game - you flick a switch.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaybe award-winning graphics? Well, it is Unreal Engine 5. But let's be honest here, the engine is not in the slightest sense utilized to its highest ability in this game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow about immersive story-driven gameplay? Nope. Not here. Unless you consider the story of you really reconciling with the fact you spent money to flick a virtual switch, when you and I both know you are most likely sitting in a room right now that has a few switches scattered around the walls. Have fun staring at your bank account later, wondering where it all went wrong as you dove helplessly into the immersive world of a 9x9x9 room with ONE SWITCH ON THE WALL FOR YOU TO INTERACT WITH.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnyways, let's jump ahead to the key features:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are none.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDepending on how you judge the &quot;ending&quot; of a game, or how you would quantify your sense of sanity in terms of time spent playing a game where you do absolutely nothing but stand in a single room flicking a single switch as time around you ticks on; endlessly disregarding any sense of desperation for it to slow down so that you may bask in the sanctity of joy for even a brief moment, until hopefully the power cuts out, or someone comes to your aide to end this troubling sense of self infliction -- It should take you around 1 - 30 minutes to complete the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBuy it, don't buy it. Totally your decision. This game will not keep you up at night, nor will it have you beckoning for more; but if for some reason it does butter your cups, douse your daisies in oil, or roll your drums, then I may consider you take some time away from gaming for a short period, or maybe the whole period.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI do not, in any sense of lacking the word, hope that you do not find, to any extent, any amount of enjoyment from this game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinal note: The selected reviews above are totally not from ChatGPT. They are real, and so are the names of those who wrote them.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"An Achievement?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2672850/5799e2be8980a0468e693799b266d44446583e4e.jpg"},{"name":"Move it!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2672850/d547514512880bd89d9733d7f8f6ee10bf0acd9a.jpg"},{"name":"48 on.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2672850/01c5fc89a7f30a9cd010bebd765c6053154b8e5f.jpg"},{"name":"48 off.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2672850/c82bef905d6aec8aded02ddab0b9f5a22477dac9.jpg"},{"name":"Error Averted","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2672850/84f86a7425a6568218bc50c5ec753dd9827f1677.jpg"},{"name":"I think your faucet's leaking.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2672850/ab4ddb42d734321cb91d33c28ce9cd7efef9f244.jpg"},{"name":"Welcome to the show.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2672850/bf9bea7d41182d4531fb13539f9fe0ab71879647.jpg"},{"name":"Why are you still playing?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2672850/6a392f05c7b54678f09ee571df53229718c1805d.jpg"},{"name":"A bit stubborn are we?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2672850/9526595f0f34e6f9db93a06957512c2992898d93.jpg"},{"name":"Don't cue the music","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2672850/7e13c941a1e7487dc58a94ab53df151a0f5f219f.jpg"}],"total":31},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2672850/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1718979371","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2672850/page.bg.jpg?t=1718979371","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2672850/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718979371","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2672850/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718979371","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This is LITERALLY just a game about flicking a switch.
