Genes control the bending of internal <i>bones</i> or <i>branches</i>. Pixels cover the bones to create the shape of the body. The shape of the body and the number of different pixels determine the <i>physiology</i> of the life form.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Pixels and body shape determine biological function: <i>hydration, nutrient use, movement, perception...</i></h2>Each life form has a metabolism that processes <i>hydration</i> and <i>nutrients</i> at a rate determined by the <i>metabo</i> gene. The larger the life form (the more pixels in its body), the more hydration and nutrients it will need each metabolic cycle. <i>Surface area</i> determines how much hydration each life form evaporates. The more wrinkled the body is, the more surface area there is.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Simple graph-shaped brains create emergent behavior: <i>fear, aggression, attraction...</i></h2>A simple set of rules, derived from genes, controls the behavior of each animatroid. Animatroids have external sensors (<i>motion/scent/water</i>) and internal sensors (<i>hunger/stress/thirst</i>). Animatroids' brains have attraction/repulsion relationships between these sensors. It is these relationships that determine each animatroid's behavior.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Natural selection and breeding are the only way to evolve your life forms - <i>unless you &quot;cheat&quot; with genetic engineering!</i></h2>Your animatroids and fungols will evolve over many generations into new species. The genetic code of each life form is passed down to its offspring during reproduction, with a chance of mutation. Evolution is a slow process. To speed things up, try crafting and drinking a lot of sugary beverages. Toxic waste can also be useful (and dangerous!)
