The game itself takes place in Hell where the main hero, Lou, is to find booze and rescue the hottest Mistress from the clutches of a fat clown. The game consists of four levels / chapters representing different areas of Hell, such as the hellish Big Wack fast food caf\u00e9, Skeleton Slums and the Red Light District. The idea behind those levels is to kill specific bosses. Each boss represents a unique multistage fight and it is pretty challenging.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/669950/extras/Gameplay1.gif?t=1643752918\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/669950/extras/nerdo_trap.gif?t=1643752918\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/669950/extras/FlamePony.gif?t=1643752918\" /><br><br>The player has to choose between six weapons and one magical ability.
