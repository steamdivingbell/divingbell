Insane prophets predict a coming apocalypse. Blood cults openly perform sacrifices... You will lead the last army of the Order of the Gatekeepers and stop the coming chaos. Not just humans are ready to join your banners, but also tough dwarves, mysterious elvers and half-wild turans. But keep in mind that not everyone will be happy to fight side by side with other races. <br><br>Travel across an open world full of mysteries and dangers. Complete quests. Find rare artifacts and equip your soldiers with them. Improve unit stats, learn new active and passive skills. <br><br>Show your tactical genius in challenging turn-based battles. For each battle, choose the fighters who are most suited to take on specific opponents. Consider unit line of sight, facing, morale and accumulated fatigue. Change the battlefield: build barricades, dig ditches, freeze rivers, chop down trees. When fighting night creatures, make fire and light the battlefield. Crush your enemies with all the power of iron and magic! <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1864690/extras/KeyFeatures_en.png?t=1735371235\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Detailed combat system takes into account unit morale and fatigue, as well as facing and line of sight, level of illumination of each cell of the battlefield, weather effects and much more. <br></li><li> Interactive environment: almost every object on the battlefield can be interacted with. <br></li><li> Before the start of the battle, you can use one-time scrolls to make it rain, poison enemies or build a catapult. <br></li><li> Open world: despite the presence of a story campaign, you decide where to send your army. <br></li><li> Each playthrough is unique: quests, random battles, goods in cities and much more are all randomly generated. <br></li><li> Ability to adjust the game to your liking: choose the overall difficulty level plus adjust hit chance, the amount of HP, rewards received and much more. <br></li><li> Convenient unit and map editor.
