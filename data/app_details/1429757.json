{"about_the_game":"From regional express to bustling freight, experience a multitude of operations in Train Simulator with Bahnstrecke Riesa - Dresden!<br><br>Dating back to the 1830s, the line between Dresden and Riesa was built with the idea of linking the cities of eastern Germany, an idea that once realised saw the creation of Germany\u2019s first long-distance railway. The line was immediately doubled in 1840 to boost capacity as the route\u2019s importance continued to rise.<br><br>The line saw difficulties following the Second World War, reparations saw capacity dwindle with busy sections such as Dresden to Coswig reduced to a single track. Things would not start improving until the 1960s, and by the end of the decade the route between Dresden and Riesa was electrified.<br><br>With upgrade works since 2009, which accompany other improvements in the area, inter-city journey times have been significantly improved, and while the route between Riesa and Dresden is not high-speed capable, fast services can beat the commuter rush through the use of separate fast and slow lines that each take a different path through the Saxony countryside.<br><br>The Bahnstrecke Riesa - Dresden route for Train Simulator features both the fast and slow lines, allowing for two different views out the windscreen as you take on the challenges of inter-city, regional, s-bahn passenger services as well as freight. Keep an eye on the expertly crafted KS and HL signals, which have been built with cabride and plans reference, as they can display a multitude of aspects and work for both normal and wrong-line running operation, as well as display dynamic signal speeds around Dresden as per reality.<br><br>Explore the packed city of Dresden and discover various lineside industries.
