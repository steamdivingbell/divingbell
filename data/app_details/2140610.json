{"about_the_game":"Build Residential Rental lots in any livable World with up to 6 units per lot and households of up to 8 Sims per unit. Choose to live as a tenant or property owner in The Sims\u2122 4 For Rent Expansion Pack. Your Sim can now own and manage multiple Residential Rental lots or move into a home where they\u2019re closer to their neighbors than ever (perfect for snooping!). From potlucks to evictions, there\u2019s a lot to do and a bustling new world to do it in.<br><br><strong>KEY FEATURES:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>New Lot Type</strong> \u2014 New Residential Rental lots give you the chance to get creative with multi-family dwellings. Give your Sims a basement suite to rent out, a duplex to keep 2 families close, townhomes for multiple families, or even build apartments of up to 6 units (or more if you know the cheat). Each Residential Rental can be customized to your specifications.<br><br></li><li><strong>Property Management</strong> \u2014 Property owner Sims can be present property managers, living among their tenants, or they can live in a separate residence while generating income from several property investments. If your Sim doesn\u2019t want to manage the whole property, then perhaps the new Handyperson Career might be better suited to them. Property owners should keep their Unit Ratings high because, if they don\u2019t, they could face consequences like a Tenant Revolt.<br><br></li><li><strong>Closer Than Ever</strong> \u2014 Sims in Residential Rentals will inevitably get tangled up in each other\u2019s lives. They\u2019ll meet with other tenants at Social Events like a community potluck, in the garden, or other common areas at their Residential Rental, and have ample opportunity to discover their neighbor\u2019s secrets by eavesdropping, snooping, or even breaking and entering. If you discover something juicy, you can blackmail other Sims for a bribe, too!<br><br></li><li><strong>Bustling and Beautiful</strong> \u2014 One of the most iconic scenes Tomarang has to offer is the Night Market where your Sims will savor new foods and add unique objects such as the pressure cooker and electric kettle to their homes. As you explore the world, you might even see children playing new games of marbles and hopscotch or discover the 4 new traits and 4 new aspirations unique to For Rent.</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2140610/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1721945254","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2140610/page.bg.jpg?t=1721945254","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2140610/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1721945254","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2140610/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1721945254","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Remote Play on Tablet","id":42}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Build Residential Rental lots in any livable World with up to 6 units per lot and households of up to 8 Sims per unit.
