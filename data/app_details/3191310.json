{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>STORY:</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In a galaxy far, far away, the peaceful Pizza-verse faces its greatest threat yet as the malevolent Falagans, a race of extraterrestrial beings with a disdain for all things pizza, embark on a ruthless campaign to conquer the solar system and forever eradicate the beloved dish from existence.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With pizza-loving civilizations trembling in fear, hope emerges in the form of the Piamia, a legendary spacecraft renowned for its unparalleled speed and firepower. The Piamia stands as the last bastion of defense against the Falagan onslaught. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As the Piamia embarks on a perilous journey through the cosmos, they must confront the relentless Falagan forces, thwart their sinister plans, and try to preserve the legacy of pizza for generations to come.

Anyway, the goal of the game is to not only to get the most points possible, but to also slay bosses and Falagans, which are your prime enemies. But be warned! There is a time-limit!
