{"about_the_game":"Pathfinder RPG - Pathfinder Module: We Be Goblins! <br> A most unusual adventure for 1st-level goblin characters. <br> The Licktoad goblins of Brinestump Marsh have stumbled upon a great treasure--fireworks! Yet unfortunately for them, the tribe member responsible for the discovery has already been exiled for the abhorrent crime of writing (which every goblin knows steals words from your head). To remedy this situation, the Licktoads' leader, His Mighty Girthness Chief Rendwattle Gutwad, has declared that the greatest heroes of the tribe must venture forth to retrieve the rest of the fireworks from a derelict ship stranded in the marsh. In order to prove themselves as the Licktoads' bravest goblins, the PCs must complete a series of dangerous dares, from swallowing bull slugs and braving the dreaded Earbiter to dancing with Squealy Nord himself. Yet even once they've proven their mettle, the adventure is just beginning. For the ship in question is far from uninhabited, and Vorka the cannibal goblin would like nothing better than a few tasty visitors.... <br> We Be Goblins! is an adventure for 1st-level characters in which the PCs play a horde of malicious and murderous goblins, written for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and compatible with the 3.5 edition of the world's oldest RPG. The adventure takes place outside the town of Sandpoint in the Pathfinder campaign setting, but can easily be adapted for any campaign world. <br> Written by Richard Pett. <br> <br>  It has been lovingly converted for use within Fantasy Grounds and features the following additions: <br> <br>  <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li> All maps resized and set up with a preset grid to make combats easy to manage <br> </li><li> Individual area descriptions linked to maps, containing new encounters, treasure parcels and descriptions for just that area <br> </li><li> Tokens for each encounter are all pre-placed in starting locations on the map.
