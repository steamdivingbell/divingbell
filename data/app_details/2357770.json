{"about_the_game":"<strong>SLYME BREAKER</strong> is the RPG that hates the genre. Inspired by the early Paper Mario titles and the Shin Megami Tensei series SLYME BREAKER has a core focus on proactive, aggressive combat, deep and involved exploration and meaningful deconstruction of RPG standards.

No problem! Who needs friends when the action economy is a free market! </li><li> Be proactive on both offense and defense using action commands to block, parry, and even strike back on enemy turns! </li><li>Dealing damage to enemies will eventually STUN them! Denying them their turn and making them vulnerable for more pummeling! </li><li>Strike a stunned enemy or defeat an enemy to claim a BREAKER! Enemies will be so stunned by your display of brutality that you'll get to take an extra turn right then and there! </li><li>Don't think that combat will be a cakewalk though.
