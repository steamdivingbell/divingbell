{"about_the_game":"Neighbors can sometimes create problems more serious than noise at the wrong time of the day. In this game you have to face an unusual neighbor, whose home is full of chilling secrets. Get into his house unnoticed, bypassing all the traps and video cameras, and get to the truth that can shock you!<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2486930/extras/Record_1.gif?t=1719599325\" /><br>The main character in this interactive thriller is yourself, thanks to a realistic camera from the first person perspective. Moving to a new home, you discover some oddities in the behavior of your unsociable neighbor from the house across the street. He never leaves his home, from which strange and unsettling sounds can be heard, like cries. And one dark night a neighbor drags out of his house a bag with something that resembles a human body. It becomes clear that something suspicious is going on. You can not stay away - you need to get into the neighbor's house and find out what's happening inside! However, this will not be so easy to do! Each corner of his yard is adorned with a movable video camera, and all doors and windows are securely locked. And the neighbor himself is a rather dangerous person who will stop at nothing, just to hide all his dark deeds. If he discovers you, you are unlikely to be able to leave his house alive! Stay unnoticed, use your own ingenuity and uncover a terrible secret!<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2486930/extras/Record_2.gif?t=1719599325\" /><br><br>Features:<br><br>Advanced camera system from the first person perspective, allowing you to move around freely and look without any delay!<br><br>Finding and using useful items.
