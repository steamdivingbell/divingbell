Each with different ups and downs in combat, you can customize your team to better fit your playstyle. Prefer slow moving but heavy hitting units? Or quick and long ranged? Build the team that best suits your needs.<br>Each unit is also their own individual character, and the more you upgrade a unit the more conversations you unlock as well. Get to know each unit and find out their outlook on the war, their life or what it means to be just a copy of a copy of the memories of someone long dead.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Farm Resources and Read Lore</h2>During battle, you can gain seeds that grow into fruits and plants that are highly concentrated in essence, the currency that all of the Witch Queen\u2019s magic relies on.
