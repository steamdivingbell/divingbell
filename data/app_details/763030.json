The game started out as a birthday present for his girlfriend and got wildly out of hand. In 2016, he even made another Nelly game called Nelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The HD remastering of Spoonbeaks Ahoy! brings the original game back to life, with a streamlined interface and loads more pixels and voice over (!) for the first time. Read the details below!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Alasdair has been tweaking and polishing (and breaking and fixing) Nelly Cootalot: Spoonbeaks Ahoy! for many months now. 1920x1080 HD resolution and a FULL VOICE OVER in English are the obvious highlights. Here is the\u00a0full list of the improvements we've made to the original 2007 game.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New resolution</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game now runs in full 1920x1080 HD, (as well as other widescreen resolutions). This is flipping massive compared to the tiny, square original graphics (see trailer video).</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Full voice acting (English only)</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Extremely cheap voice acting by Alasdair Beckett-King, real Nelly and literally no one else.
