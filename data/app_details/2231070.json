If you attack an enemy, you're also attacking the tile they occupy as well and it may break, sending the enemy to the previous floor. This same logic applies to your opponents as well. If the tile you occupy breaks, you fall to the previous floor as well. Defeat all monsters on a floor and an elevator appears on the floor, taking you to the next floor. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2231070/extras/Comp-2.gif?t=1736784804\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Story</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">2 years prior in a distant land, strange creatures spawned from the top of a large tower and began their invasion, killing millions of people and consuming their souls.
