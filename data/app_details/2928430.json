{"about_the_game":"Bullet Rain is a competitive shooter where the objective is to capture objectives on the map or eliminate the opposing team. Players can expect thrilling firefights and tactical challenges against other players.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a grim future, the skies unleashed a torrent of destruction as a colossal battleship bombarded the planet, earning its fearsome moniker \u201cBullet Rain\u201d and alien life forms revealed themselves to humanity. Peaceful negotiations were never an option for them. Even the dragons fought among themselves to acquire resources. Earth became the battlefield of an unprecedented scale. Though the planet had to be evacuated, many remained behind to defend it. Welcome to the year 2102, three decades after the first appearance of dragons, where the face of Earth has forever changed. Humanity confronts the relentless reality that it is not alone in the universe. Dragons and other extraterrestrial species have revealed themselves and claim resources that once belonged exclusively to humans. Earth finds itself in an end-time scenario, marked by destruction and desolation. Cities have crumbled into ruins, once bustling streets now lay deserted and overgrown with vegetation. The remnants of human civilization serve only as a reminder of past grandeur and loss. Despite the apocalyptic landscape, humanity has not given up. With a mix of advanced technology, they wage a desperate battle against the overwhelming invaders. Each day is a struggle for survival, and the boundaries between good and evil blur in this endless conflict for resources and power. Amidst this chaos, clans and factions have formed, fighting for the remaining resources. Loyalty to a group can determine life and death as humanity strives to stand against the looming extinction. Yet even in times of darkness, there are glimmers of hope that keep faith in a better future alive. Welcome to &quot;Bullet Rain\u201d.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Bullet Rain, all players stand on an equal footing, without any additional abilities or special skills. The focus is entirely on skill, teamwork, and strategic thinking. Each player can contribute their individual skills and experiences to lead the team to victory. With a variety of weapons and equipment at your disposal, there are numerous options to develop your own playstyle and compete in the 5-versus-5 battles. Showcase your shooting skills, collaborate closely with your teammates, and defeat the invaders in this action-packed competition for the fate of humanity.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2928430/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1717793659","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2928430/page.bg.jpg?t=1717793659","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2928430/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1717793659","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2928430/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1717793659","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Bullet Rain is a competitive shooter where the objective is to capture objectives on the map or eliminate the opposing team.
