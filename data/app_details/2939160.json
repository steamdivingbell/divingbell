{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Tower of Dead Thieves (5E)</h2>  <strong> Dare You Enter the Tower of Dead Thieves?</strong>   Many have tried, All have failed.  Once every seven years, the tower's doors swing wide for the latest bold adventurers. Can you overcome the devious traps to claim the legendary treasure? Or will your bones be the latest to decorate the tower's halls?  Tower of Dead Thieves is a 5e adventure designed for three to six Tier 1 characters to provide low-level characters with an epic experience that rewards problem-solving and skill use over combat. More than just a dungeon crawl, the tower is one large puzzle, a puzzle whose solution yields great reward for those willing to risk a terrible death.  The Tower of Dead Thieves rises in the city of Eastgate, piercing the sky like the point of a spear held by an angry god. Its halls are said to be filled with untold wealth and magic, all guarded by the deadliest of traps. Once every seven years, the tower's doors open as a challenge to the boldest adventurers. Master thieves and treasure hunters from across the Lost Lands have tried to plunder its secrets -- but none has ever returned. Will your characters suffer the same fate? Or will they solve the mystery of the Tower of Dead Thieves? &quot;","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2939160?t=1715094952","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2939160?t=1715094952","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2939160/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1715094952","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2939160/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1715094952","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Tower of Dead Thieves (5E)</h2>  <strong> Dare You Enter the Tower of Dead Thieves?</strong>   Many have tried, All have failed.
