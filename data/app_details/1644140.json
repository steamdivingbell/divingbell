You place blocks of houses that come in different shapes and sizes, surround fields, towers, gain points for abilities and create bridges to cross lakes and rivers. In Valley of No Roads you can enjoy the view and build the town as you want it or try to make it as dense and optimal for competing at the leaderboards.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1644140/extras/text_02.jpg?t=1623394779\" /><br><br>You start the game with few blocks made of houses, placing those on the corners of previous houses. Every area has its tasks to be fulfilled, requiring you to place certain amount of blocks, creating new bodies of water or migrating a market square to the area. These tasks vary and by fullfilling those, you unlock new parts of the map. You are rewarded of every block you place and every task you fullfill, so gaining points can be tricky!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1644140/extras/text_03.jpg?t=1623394779\" /><br><br>Valley of No Roads has a strong focus on the sceneries you build, so you'll have full control over the camera and UI, just to get the most serene videos and screenshots. It also features day/sunset setup, that can be changed to fit your mood. Daylight is nice, but some of us love the humidity setting over the dim landscape.<br><br>Valley of No Roads has most of its features made, but I'm interested of hearing how you enjoy it and what kind of elements would you like it to have in it. As a solo developer, I'm all about listening the community and expanding the experience.
