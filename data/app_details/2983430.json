{"about_the_game":"Explore a mysterious labyrinth of rooms and hallways, but be careful - for you are not alone in the Hallway of Horrors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBe careful indeed, as if you die, you die for good - there is no saving, so if you quit or die you will have to try from the beginning.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures you can expect:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Permadeath gameplay<br />\r\n- Realistic Graphics using Unreal Engine 5.2<br />\r\n- 30 unique rooms for you to explore, intricately decorated to resemble real-life environments<br />\r\n- 5 different monsters to scare you, each with their own unique behaviour<br />\r\n- Unsettling ambience for each room<br />\r\n- Short and Sweet: The game can be completed within 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on how often the player dies.<br />\r\n- A psychedelic atmosphere<br />\r\n- Jumpscares<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is played by walking through a series of small to large rooms using a VR-teleport based movement system. In most cases, a green light will signal where the door to the next room is. Red will signify danger. A virtual reality headset is required to play this game.
