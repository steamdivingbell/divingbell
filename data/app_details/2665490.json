{"about_the_game":"Stuck in a submarine at the bottom of the sea, guide your crewmate around the sea floor to gather parts and repair the sub while avoiding the source of a mysterious light. Learn the required Morse Code on the fly, or surrender to the mysterious presence lurking in the deep blue...<br><br>The Old Gentleman is a short half-hour horror game inspired by the real-life &quot;Old Gentleman&quot; dive suit and games like Iron Lung. Featuring challenging gameplay, a grungy retro artstyle, FMV sequences, and deep-blue ocean atmosphere, The Old Gentleman is a tense mini horror experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GAMEPLAY</h2>Learn a variety of mechanics under pressure to escape a watery grave:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>3D adventure game controls.</strong> Navigate between several fixed-perspective views in a 3D submarine, and interact with the submarine's control monitors with the mouse.<br></li><li> <strong>Master Morse Code to communicate with your crewmate.</strong> Reference the codebook and pulse dots and dashes into the transmitter to guide his movement and actions.<br></li><li> <strong>Recover the missing submarine parts.</strong> Use the submarine's map to guide your crewmate around the seafloor.
