Players will be able to embark on campaigns as any of the 35 existing Legendary Lords from both games.

Instead, it offers the classic sandbox Total War experience in the Warhammer Fantasy Battles world, expanding your empire in any direction you choose with no limits. You\u2019ll still experience the escalating Chaos Warriors invasion from the original Total War: WARHAMMER Old World campaign, but with an exciting new twist: the forces of Chaos don\u2019t just attack from the Chaos Wastes, but from other, unexpected directions as well\u2026 <br><br>Mortal Empires also features many of the new campaign features introduced in Total War: WARHAMMER II.

As such, certain factions have unique new starting positions. The Skaven warlord Queek Headtaker of Clan Mors, for example, begins with ownership of Karag Orrud in the south-eastern Badlands. This puts him in the heart of Greenskin territory in the Old World.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/617810/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1601638186","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/617810/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1601638186","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/617810/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1601638186","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/617810/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1601638186","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Requires Ownership of Both Games to Play</h1><p><br></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/617810/extras/Mortal_Empires__616.jpg?t=1601638186\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/617810/extras/GIF1.JPG?t=1601638186\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Total War: WARHAMMER II \u2013 <i>Mortal Empires</i> </strong></h2><br><br><strong>This content is a massive free expansion to owners of both Total War: WARHAMMER &amp; Total War: WARHAMMER II, and requires ownership of both games to play.</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A new grand scale campaign set across the Old World and the New World.  <br></li><li>Play as any Legendary Lord from both games and any owned DLC.<br></li><li>Thousands of hours of gameplay.<br></li><li>295 conquerable settlements.<br></li><li>117 starting factions.<br></li><li>Up to 35 playable Legendary Lords.<br></li><li>Free to owners of both Total War: WARHAMMER &amp; Total War: WARHAMMER II.</li></ul><br>Mortal Empires is a new grand-scale campaign, free to owners of both Total War: WARHAMMER and Total War: WARHAMMER II.
