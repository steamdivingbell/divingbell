{"about_the_game":"Spellslinger is a Strategy RPG Word Game where you play as a Spellslinger: a powerful wizard brought back from the dead to stop The Dark One from regaining power. You will spell words from a 4x4 tile grid to defeat your enemies. Throughout your adventure you will unlock Spells and Artifacts that you can use to create powerful strategic builds. Artefacts act as passive effects to give you bonuses, while Spells are special tiles in your grid that amplify your attacks. Combine synergies of Spells and Artifacts to exploit weaknesses and defeat even the most powerful of foes. Explore a world with multiple unique areas such as deserts, volcanoes, and islands in a semi-non linear fashion. Use your knowledge and intellect on your quest to defeat The Dark One.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3036110/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1718025073","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3036110/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1718025073","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3036110/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718025073","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3036110/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718025073","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Spellslinger is a Strategy RPG Word Game where you play as a Spellslinger: a powerful wizard brought back from the dead to stop The Dark One from regaining power.
