{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Meanders Map Pack: Shard Roads</strong></h2><br>This pack contains 29 Ice-Themed Meanders Maps sized specially for FG at 1350x900 and under 500 kb each to help prevent slow-down during play. Meanders maps are somewhat special by having a built-in repeating entrance/exit point so that no matter whether you put another map on the left, right, above or below or flip it top to bottom, either itself or a different Meander Map - the pathways will line up allowing continuous sprawling landscapes and terrains for your adventurers to explore. They are sized to perfectly fit a 50px or 60px grid that you can manually place over the top of the map using Fantasy Grounds.<br><br>This pack is an expansion set used on its own or in conjunction with Venmire Woods or other GTW Meander Map Packs. Meanders maps are highly-detailed and feature themed maps for a huge range of encounters. Shard Roadsincludes numerous icy roads with bends, straights, crossroads and T-junctions, dead ends with caves, icy ravines with or without bridges, frozen lakes, rivers and crystal chasm, various cavern entrances, a forest cemetery, an ice temple, a glacier and ice floes leading to the sea, assorted joins to forest or road, two blenders that transition from snow to jungle or snow to desert, a range of flipped versions of some of the maps to help bend roads, end roads, end terrain, or make new map variants from mirror joins. It also includes a few maps that are completely exclusive to this pack - and - a special blizzard tile for total white outs. This set also contains a Map Selection Panel: a convenient visual display of all the maps pinned with a link (shown as a red pin) that you can simply click to bring up.<br><br>Join the maps together or encounter them one by one - it's up to you. Users can opt to load/lay the maps manually and build a custom layout - or use a combination of Time-lapse, Role-play and/or the supplied Random Roll Tables to determine when maps are used and where adventurers end up next.The 2 Random Roll Tables (one for all maps and one for Roads Only) are weighted so that some environments are more likely to be rolled than others including a slim chance of a blizzard.<br><br><i>Converted by: </i><strong>Kris Mc Dermott</strong><br><br>Released on July 20, 2018.
