The game doesn't involve any survival, retaliation or &quot;hide and seek&quot; style gameplay. Atmospheric horror elements are emphasized, along with creepy and borderline disturbing imagery. Most of the events in the game are scripted and straightforward although there are puzzles and riddles to be found. This game follows more of a &quot;Walking-Simulator&quot; style of gameplay than an action oriented one. If you're looking for a fast-paced, action-packed survival horror experience, this game probably won't satisfy that need. If you're looking for a slower-paced, narrative-driven experience that puts a strong emphasis on fear, give this game a try.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/898030/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1645454729","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/898030/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1645454729","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/898030/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1645454729","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/898030/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1645454729","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Description</strong><br><br><i>God's Basement</i> is a first-person, narrative-driven, single player horror game.
