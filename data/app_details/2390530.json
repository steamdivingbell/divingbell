{"about_the_game":"PoW is an immersive open-world RPG that rewards exploration with exciting surprises at every turn. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the key features of the game is its customizable gameplay, which allows you to distribute stats freely among your three characters and choose from a vast array of over 50 unique skills and three factions, each with its own unique gear. This not only affects your options in combat but also shapes your experience in the game's vast and diverse open world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven though all the abilities and their complex reciprocal effects can be overwhelming \u2013 e.g., there are over 10 different damage types - you can also just get right into it and learn by trial or read the skills in detail as the game is easy to play and hard to master. Choose the difficulty that brings the most enjoyable game experience for you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour characters\u2019 personality traits play a significant role in shaping the game's narrative, as they determine your dialogue choices. Accumulating merit points enhances your persuasive abilities, allowing you to sway others to your cause. While ruthless choices may yield quicker success in some situations, taking a more compassionate approach may win the cooperation of more people. Sometimes though hard decisions have to be made to lead your cause to victory. Over the course of the game your choices will be reflected in how your surroundings react to you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery choice you make, from the way you customize your characters to the way you interact with the many people in the dystopian world, shapes your playstyle and ultimately leads to one of over 10 different endings. With over 20 hours of gameplay, PoW offers an immersive and highly customizable RPG experience that will keep you engaged and entertained for many hours and make you want to try out completely different approaches.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Soldier","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2390530/a22afc00dd9c8be3c02f614c1f30a6b4ef213ae6.jpg"},{"name":"Quickshot","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2390530/d305117addb80c0c47ea9d9814228bf763213a7c.jpg"},{"name":"Survival","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2390530/283adb166d78e5830586fbbe49358c9fce2a52aa.jpg"},{"name":"Design your own FATE","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2390530/2e2d9e7a95b0051674c3efbeb327cbf948f8f404.jpg"},{"name":"Love goes through the Stomach","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2390530/c9012130b62d4a21efc9a23905e717dc3a95c243.jpg"},{"name":"Handyman","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2390530/128b3b588ba03be35a58cfef4420a34c212d71db.jpg"},{"name":"Stylist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2390530/12c80a3c564af6aed319b8ec987eed1bee1e5308.jpg"},{"name":"Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2390530/296e577a249fda84bfbe6e80758007a5af22f277.jpg"},{"name":"The Stray","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2390530/ee45f02a7b89dfbcf6bf4920555dd3f73bb3cd77.jpg"},{"name":"The Surgeon","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2390530/94e4844d979f41480493c06a841e24613a984b60.jpg"}],"total":51},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2390530/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725128393","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2390530/page.bg.jpg?t=1725128393","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2390530/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725128393","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2390530/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725128393","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2551650,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"PoW is an immersive open-world RPG that rewards exploration with exciting surprises at every turn. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the key features of the game is its customizable gameplay, which allows you to distribute stats freely among your three characters and choose from a vast array of over 50 unique skills and three factions, each with its own unique gear.
