{"about_the_game":"Why not try these classic carriages, built between 1896 and 1898 to the design of John McIntosh - the Locomotive Superintendent of the Caledonian Railway. This was the second generation of 45 foot coaches with higher arc roofs due to a redesign of the gas lamp flues, making them shorter. These carriages were intended to replace earlier non-bogie carriages. As built they were gas lit and stayed this way well into the 20th century. They were common all over the Caledonian system, mainly on branch and suburban trains. There was no provision for passenger emergency braking, but this was thankfully retrospectively fitted in the early 1900's!<br><br>After the grouping in 1923 they were gradually repainted into the LMS full panel livery.
