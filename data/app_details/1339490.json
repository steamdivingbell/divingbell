{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Do you remember how, as a child, you used to holiday with your parents, traveling in an old camper? It's still in the garage, wasting away. The the neighborhood kids used it to paint graffiti on it; it is eaten by rust, and the furnishings and equipment are just scrap at this point. Renovate it, equip it and go on holiday to a selected location! Have adventures at the campsite - although it may not be an idyll, with a troublemaker son and a grumpy wife. If, at the end of your holiday, you find a buyer for your camper - sell it, and use the money to buy another, larger camper. And since you've done so well and had a great time to boot, expand the business of renovating campers to earn money and organize your next holiday in new places.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1339490/extras/2_Modify_fix.gif?t=1728513744\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Get rid of graffiti and rust, repair the most important elements, weld, cut sheet metal, tighten, invest in new parts.
