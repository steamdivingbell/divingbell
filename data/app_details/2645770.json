{"about_the_game":"&quot;Hello, This Is Bear&quot; is a game where you control a little bear to solve sokoban style puzzles.  Bear may be small, but is more than strong enough to push around a variety of heavy looking puzzle mechanics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUse a boat to explore a vast ocean world littered with puzzles handcrafted by the god of mischief, Loki, who appears in game to guide bear on their adventure.  With Loki's help, bear sets out to find their friends and learn what's happened to this suddenly broken world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLevels are found in a variety of biomes influenced by the 9 realms of Norse Mythology, with unique mechanics from each realm.  Story Mode will take you on a scenic and challenging tour of the universe, but the game doesn't have to end there - hundreds of bonus levels are available on a rotating basis, and a level editor is included so that you and your friends can share your own ideas with each other.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor those who are truly dedicated, every level has a bonus objective - a treasure chest filled with unbelievable splendor!  Reaching the chest may make a level much more difficult to complete, so we hope you appreciate what's inside.  Collecting enough of these treasures will let you show off your accomplishments visually through the many ridiculous hats available for Bear to wear.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game was originally created for NovaLiminal's ChillVibesJam, for which there are no awards, but several people played it and said that it was fun and cute.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2645770/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729539672","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2645770/page.bg.jpg?t=1729539672","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2645770/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729539672","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2645770/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729539672","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;Hello, This Is Bear&quot; is a game where you control a little bear to solve sokoban style puzzles.
