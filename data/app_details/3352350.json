{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">In the world of Walk, you can roam freely and immerse yourself in the breathtaking beauty of a virtual realm. Let these stunning landscapes bring comfort and solace to your heart.</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Walk is a single-player open-world walking simulator. With regular updates and player feedback, we are committed to continuously enriching the game by adding more content.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We will periodically expand the map, providing you with more spaces to explore and enjoy. We are dedicated to delivering richer gameplay experiences while steadily improving Walk in alignment with our development goals.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Sincere Apology: Why Our Game Lacks Audio Elements</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We deeply apologize for the absence of sound elements in our game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">All members of DeafTeam were born with congenital hearing impairments. This has made it impossible for us to appreciate music or sound effects, let alone determine whether certain sounds or background music are suitable for our game. We cannot ensure that audio elements are used appropriately, nor can we judge their quality. To avoid negatively impacting your experience, we decided not to include more audio features. While this choice ensures consistency, it also means the game lacks many sound effects, and for this, we sincerely apologize.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Challenges and Our Commitment</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Our visual artist and writer live with moderate cerebral palsy, which has resulted in slower development progress and limited operational capacity. However, we are working tirelessly to deliver consistent updates and improvements for all players.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We recommend that you play your favorite songs using external music apps to create the desired atmosphere during gameplay. We deeply regret that we cannot currently offer a more immersive audio experience.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About Us: DeafTeam</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">DeafTeam is a small team of three individuals who came together with no prior experience in game development. Through years of experimentation, learning, and perseverance, we brought this game to life. Despite the challenges, we are passionate about what we do and promise to continue learning, improving, and delivering better content for you. Regular updates and maintenance of Walk are part of our unwavering commitment.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Our Goals</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">1.
