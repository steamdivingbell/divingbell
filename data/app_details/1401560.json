{"about_the_game":"Kilta is a game about being a Guildmaster of a newly established guild. The guild accepts commissions and quests from all walks of life firstly to promote the common good and secondly to grow as an association. A party needs to be dispatched to take on the challenges and earn glory and recognition, as well as hefty rewards for the guild. It's the Guildmaster's responsibility to assign the party to suitable missions and equip them accordingly.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1401560/extras/Character_Banner.png?t=1682086142\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GROW YOUR GUILD</h2>Recruit new guild members from a growing cast of heroes. All heroes are unique with their characteristics, abilities, and dialogue. Should you recruit Rufus, the mighty macaque guardian that excels in traditional martial arts known to his people? Or Maryu, the heart-warming but savage old lady that can curse your opponents?<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1401560/extras/Grow_Your_Guild.gif?t=1682086142\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">HONE YOUR LEADERSHIP</h2>Always check what enemies your party is going to face in the upcoming quests. By equipping better items, choosing correct party members, and checking enemy compositions you can minimize your losses and always topple your foes. Try to find the perfect (or the most broken) combinations of heroes and items!<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1401560/extras/Hone_Your_Leadership.gif?t=1682086142\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MANAGE YOUR INVENTORY</h2>Items are divided into weapons and equipment. One of your tasks as the Guildmaster is to equip your heroes with whatever you have at hand. Items are earned through quests and occasionally through dialogue. There are no character-related restrictions on the items. You are free to experiment with different combinations of items and discover the most powerful builds.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1401560/extras/Manage_Your_Inventory.gif?t=1682086142\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE BLACKSMITH</h2>Always remember to pay a visit to the Blacksmith.

When the party comes across enemies on their quests, they have to engage them in battles. At the beginning of each battle, it is important to consider the enemies, their abilities, and their formation when positioning your heroes. The heroes will fight by themselves but your preparations will ultimately decide the outcome. In appearance, the battles offer explosive visuals, insanely good music, and cinematic camera action.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1401560/extras/Combat.gif?t=1682086142\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WHAT KIND OF GUILDMASTER ARE YOU GOING TO BE?</h2>Every hero has a background that they may want to share with you. Most often the heroes are arguing by themselves and it's up to you to resolve their conflicts in a way or another. Some choices might lead to surprising outcomes that can even affect the results of the battles up ahead. Are you a caring and capable leader or do you swing to be the worst kingpin of them all?<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1401560/extras/What_Kind_of_Guildmaster.gif?t=1682086142\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Hunger Satiated","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1401560/a0d809fb6eb1dfb0a3c8b85d1167dfe327481272.jpg"},{"name":"End of the Being","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1401560/664d857898be27c20f02ec27a7ae827f38ba4835.jpg"},{"name":"Crystal Clear","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1401560/8dd229461bed41bc1e87676e39a098b7cb4c07db.jpg"},{"name":"Overseen","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1401560/28c418005714d65559806872dcb9f13b7c22f4eb.jpg"},{"name":"No Wolf","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1401560/042e0291f03a1215e074100a11e2468756641332.jpg"},{"name":"Expanding Business","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1401560/04705dbff931ac1fab5ac4d9ccc1fa777f286491.jpg"},{"name":"Another Wolf Down","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1401560/05aeb380c2e0cb65313cff66d195d2cdddf8bb3f.jpg"},{"name":"Full House","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1401560/9c35449dd237f435cb32efbb961b637a6ac4f201.jpg"},{"name":"It's Just a Flesh Wound","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1401560/09db3f339e41bc44e81039c64c5c943a08d147ba.jpg"},{"name":"Last Hero Standing","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1401560/9b2d528e564309f4e999817c250013a9f3a96a4d.jpg"}],"total":22},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1401560/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1682086142","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1401560/page.bg.jpg?t=1682086142","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1401560/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1682086142","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1401560/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1682086142","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Join Our Discord</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1401560/extras/Discord_Banner.png?t=1682086142\" /></p><br><h1>Accessibility Mode</h1><p>Here are the current instructions on how to play the game in Accessibility Mode.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Option 1:</strong> Upon launching the game from your Steam library, you are presented with the launch options window.
