Read files and emails to find clues and riddles which will give you access to more accounts. Data found on their systems will help you learn about the motives of the organization, and how dark their plans can get. You may also discover dirty little secrets about the employees as well. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHacking into new accounts or discovering key information will increase your skill level. As you achieve your goals, you will move closer and closer to the final achievement; over 50 levels deep! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt's time for a Hack RUN!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Accepted Offer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/378110/e9c923e2e72dcfd295dcebf83658207e2fdf2247.jpg"},{"name":"Localhost Started","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/378110/e9c923e2e72dcfd295dcebf83658207e2fdf2247.jpg"},{"name":"System Command","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/378110/e9c923e2e72dcfd295dcebf83658207e2fdf2247.jpg"},{"name":"Readme","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/378110/e9c923e2e72dcfd295dcebf83658207e2fdf2247.jpg"},{"name":"Hack Routine","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/378110/e9c923e2e72dcfd295dcebf83658207e2fdf2247.jpg"},{"name":"Gateway Server","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/378110/e9c923e2e72dcfd295dcebf83658207e2fdf2247.jpg"},{"name":"Hacked the Gateway","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/378110/e9c923e2e72dcfd295dcebf83658207e2fdf2247.jpg"},{"name":"Hacked Alice's Workstation","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/378110/e9c923e2e72dcfd295dcebf83658207e2fdf2247.jpg"},{"name":"Hacked Brian's Workstation","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/378110/e9c923e2e72dcfd295dcebf83658207e2fdf2247.jpg"},{"name":"Hacked Cathy's Workstation","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/378110/e9c923e2e72dcfd295dcebf83658207e2fdf2247.jpg"}],"total":52},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/378110/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736944143","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/378110/page.bg.jpg?t=1736944143","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/378110/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736944143","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/378110/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736944143","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Ever wanted to be a hacker?
