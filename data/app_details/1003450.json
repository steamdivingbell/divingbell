Honestly we could hardly believe it the first time we saw the game through the glasses - it jumps straight out of the tabletop and you can look at every level from any angle.  Just download the game with your Tilt Five glasses connected and it will appear before your eyes.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1003450/extras/description_img3.png?t=1718983732\" /><br>We took all your feedback over the past year and redesigned SO much of the game - we call it our BLOOD OCEAN update and it\u2019s finally the way we always wanted to play.<br> <br><strong>Here\u2019s our top 10 list of updates:</strong><br>1. Respawn at Checkpoints! No more frustrations mid-level! We even place a little ghost granny in every spot you\u2019ve died before so you can remember those difficult moments.<br>2. A proper campaign with over 50 levels across multiple planets<br>3. PERSISTENT GORE - it\u2019s everywhere now and accumulates each replay<br>4. Gooey Moogu do so much more now! Stick monsters in place and build fuses<br>5. Maker Mode works so much better now with height adjustments to make more complex levels. Assigning paths to creatures is much smoother too.<br>6. Fixed so many mechanics - Beckon plants aren\u2019t annoying now and monsters have clearer hitboxes. There\u2019s even a poison cloud and tornado now!<br>7. Every level starts with a flyby animation that lets you see what you\u2019re about to conquer.<br>8. 100+ new assets in Maker Mode - we found them between the couch cushions and figured why not?<br>9. New and improved animated cutscenes - honestly we\u2019re just better at 3D now.<br>10. You actually have to confirm before we delete your Maker level. This was a stupid one that\u2019s totally on us. RIP all those accidentally deleted levels.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1003450/extras/Terrorarium_-_Official_Release_Trailer.gif?t=1718983732\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1003450/extras/Features.png?t=1718983732\" /><br><strong>Explore surreal alien worlds, protect your beloved Moogu spawn, and hurl them at enemies to their murderous - and hilarious - deaths.</strong><br> <br>\ud83c\udf44 Survive a gauntlet of  50+ level campaign<br>\ud83c\udf44 Shepherd expendable Moogu and hurl them at enemies to solve puzzles<br>\ud83c\udf44 Craft your own levels in Maker Mode with over 200 3D obstacles<br>\ud83c\udf44 Share your creations in-game via Steam Workshop<br>\ud83c\udf44 Play and rate community-made murder gardens<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1003450/extras/Terrorarium_Gameplay_GIF_Shroomovator__1_.gif?t=1718983732\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1003450/extras/About_Terrorarium.png?t=1718983732\" /><br>Terrorarium is an action-packed puzzle platformer about setting out to win the annual murder garden competition hosted by the Intergalactic Horrorcultural Society.
