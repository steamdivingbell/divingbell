{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>The Deed\u00a0</strong>is a game in which you must commit a murder and then, through a process of making the right choices and planting the appropriate evidence, convince the authorities of your innocence and somebody else's guilt. The stand-alone expansion <strong>Dynasty</strong> offers three new scenarios based on this original concept. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Taking place in three different eras, each of these new scenarios allows you to explore the sordid ancestry of the Bruce family as you take control of a character who aims to commit a murder and escape free of suspicion by framing one of the other characters in the game. You will explore a 15th century English castle and a wild west frontier saloon, before finally returning to Dunshiel House fifty years prior to the events of the original game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Just as in The Deed, every decision you make can influence the outcome and lead to one of many possible endings, which are even more varied and numerous this time.
