{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Set on the desolate surface of the moon, this intense game pits a team of engineers and scientists against a deadly tentacled alien in disguise. Players must work together to repair the damaged moon base while secretly trying to identify the alien, who is sabotaging their efforts and hunting them down. When suspicion arises, any player can call for a meeting, and the crew must vote to accuse and disintegrate someone. If the crew successfully eliminates the alien, they win. But if they make the wrong choice, the alien will have a chance to destroy the moon base and devour the entire crew. Can you survive the moon's isolation and the alien threat, or will you be the next to fall?</p>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3267620?t=1728580207","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3267620/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1728580207","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3267620/694ed4bebff9ccc79df458a9e886cab8a206e5a3/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728580207","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3267620/694ed4bebff9ccc79df458a9e886cab8a206e5a3/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728580207","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"One player is tasked with killing the other players with deadly weapons that will cut off parts and cause other players to explode.
