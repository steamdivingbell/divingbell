{"about_the_game":"Players play the role of the flying general Lyu Bu and experience the battles and interesting things in life during the Three Kingdoms period to unify the world and live up to the ambition of a man.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2710120/extras/8.png?t=1718269971\" /><br>The basic combat gameplay of this game is a trading card battle. Players need to send troops and 4 to 8 generals before the battle. Each general has three ability values: force, intelligence, and charm, as well as two dynamic values: Luck and loyalty. <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2710120/extras/1.png?t=1718269971\" /><br>During the battle, you can randomly draw cards from the deck and make strategic matching with the dispatched generals. Cards are divided into policy cards and soldier cards. Policy cards have different effects such as disasters, general numerical comparisons, and resources. Soldier cards include spearmen, cavalry, shield soldiers, archers, sword soldiers and other mutually restrained units. According to different stages In response to the rhythm, both sides compete with corresponding cards.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2710120/extras/2.png?t=1718269971\" /><br>In addition to the basic combat gameplay, this game also has various events that appear randomly to enrich the effects within the battle. You can buy outside cards in the market and use them in battle; you can get different props or effect rewards through players' self-answered questions in adventures; you can recruit your favorite generals in the tavern to make your lineup stronger; You can recuperate, exchange time for blood volume recovery, etc. There are more than ten different types and hundreds of different events, allowing you to experience the humanistic features of the Three Kingdoms and the joys and sorrows of the troubled times from the side.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2710120/extras/5.png?t=1718269971\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2710120/extras/6.png?t=1718269971\" /><br>As the personal biography of Lyu Bu in the Three Kingdoms series, this game has uniquely designed the &quot;father-worshiping system&quot; and &quot;patriricide system&quot; that are suitable for Lyu Bu's personal characteristics. The goal of unifying the world and proclaiming emperor are related to each other. In the father worship system, only when the battle fails and Lyu Bu meets the relevant father worship conditions, he can change his family, deviate from his original foster father, and worship the enemy's lord as his new foster father, thereby avoiding the outcome of a failed battle. In the patricide system, when Lyu Bu has relevant props and meets the conditions, he can enter the patricide battle - a one-on-one battle between Lyu Bu and his adoptive father. Once the patricide battle is won, Lyu Bu becomes independent and randomly obtains part of his adoptive father's territory and territory. Generals will not be prevented from naming other people who meet the conditions as adoptive fathers afterwards.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2710120/extras/7.png?t=1718269971\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2710120/extras/4.png?t=1718269971\" /><br>As Lyu Bu, players can conquer all directions and unify the world by occupying one city and one pool. They can also skillfully expand their actual sphere of influence by worshiping and killing their fathers at critical moments. Of course, players can also choose to recuperate every day, not participate in battles, until the end of life, and achieve the related achievements of a pacifist.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2710120/extras/9.png?t=1718269971\" /><br>As the saying goes, everyone has a share in the Han Dynasty's city. If you don't give up, you will be worshiped as your adoptive father. Lyu Bu will be among the people, and the red rabbit will be among the horses. Fang Tian will draw a halberd and stab the adoptive father.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"\u4e09\u56fd\u4e16\u754c","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2710120/c3d721489e3534980200bee6f0b2d1b2e97eb26e.jpg"},{"name":"\u65e0\u53cc\u00b7\u7b80\u5355\u00b7\u4e00\u7edf","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2710120/043428ae7dca0c2fc62c2fc00904dddf1b8e45e5.jpg"},{"name":"\u65e0\u53cc\u00b7\u56f0\u96be\u00b7\u4e00\u7edf","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2710120/043428ae7dca0c2fc62c2fc00904dddf1b8e45e5.jpg"},{"name":"\u65e0\u53cc\u00b7\u68a6\u9b47\u00b7\u4e00\u7edf","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2710120/043428ae7dca0c2fc62c2fc00904dddf1b8e45e5.jpg"},{"name":"\u4eba\u4e0b\u00b7\u7b80\u5355\u00b7\u4e00\u7edf","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2710120/043428ae7dca0c2fc62c2fc00904dddf1b8e45e5.jpg"},{"name":"\u4eba\u4e0b\u00b7\u56f0\u96be\u00b7\u4e00\u7edf","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2710120/043428ae7dca0c2fc62c2fc00904dddf1b8e45e5.jpg"},{"name":"\u4eba\u4e0b\u00b7\u68a6\u9b47\u00b7\u4e00\u7edf","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2710120/043428ae7dca0c2fc62c2fc00904dddf1b8e45e5.jpg"},{"name":"\u4e0d\u5b5d\u5b50","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2710120/965167b6aaa6fd39e1466aac7d2eb11f6ced9f0e.jpg"},{"name":"\u706d\u7238","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2710120/965167b6aaa6fd39e1466aac7d2eb11f6ced9f0e.jpg"},{"name":"\u4e49\u7236\u6bc1\u706d\u8005","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2710120/965167b6aaa6fd39e1466aac7d2eb11f6ced9f0e.jpg"}],"total":18},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2710120/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1718269971","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2710120/page.bg.jpg?t=1718269971","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2710120/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718269971","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2710120/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718269971","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"When you enter a recuperation event or a duel, temptation and other triggering events in battle, the corresponding video will appear."},"detailed_description":"Players play the role of the flying general Lyu Bu and experience the battles and interesting things in life during the Three Kingdoms period to unify the world and live up to the ambition of a man.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2710120/extras/8.png?t=1718269971\" /><br>The basic combat gameplay of this game is a trading card battle.
