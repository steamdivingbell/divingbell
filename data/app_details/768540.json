The Survivor mode puts the players ability to survive as a dinosaur to the test in a variety of treacherous regions where players must navigate through environment hazards and sometimes fight in order to obtain resources. Aside from surviving a brutal environment, the player is also given an objective and that is to defeat a guardian that resides within each region. Defeating a guardian marks the completion of a region. Unlike other modes that features dinosaurs from cretaceous North America, the Survivor Mode features dinosaur from cretaceous Asia.<br><br>The Arcade Mode is a mode designed for players who prefer simulation type gameplay where players would live the life of a dinosaur from juvenile to adult in a dynamically populated open world environment. The world in the Arcade Mode changes as the player grows, creatures will migrate or go extinct, corpses will decay overtime, creature behavior changes based on available resources and competition, and all of these dynamic elements are designed to give players unique challenges that would test their ability to adapt to the ever changing world.<br><br>The Free Roam Mode is designed for players who prefer a more serene and hassle free gameplay experience where the player can choose to play as a dinosaur without the worry of missions and objectives.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/768540/extras/DPS_Desc_Header_2.png?t=1724303746\" /><br>Dinosaurs Prehistoric Survivors lets players choose from a selection of more than 25 dinosaur species, from the feeble Parkosaurus to the mighty Tyrannosaurus, ranging from multiple game modes.<br>\t<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/768540/extras/DPS_Desc_Header_3a.png?t=1724303746\" /><br>Dinosaurs Prehistoric Survivors brings a variety of environments for players to explore and experience.
