{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What If Summer Could Last Forever?</h2><br>Summer is a magical time: suspended between past and future, long days and warm nights.

Why do the people in the camp\u2019s photos look like they never age? Why is the groundskeeper always lurking on the edges of the camp?
