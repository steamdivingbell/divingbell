You seek food by gathering, hunting, and gathering supplies for life and battle in dangerous areas. You need to look for old books to upgrade your technology and learn some skills. Along the way, you encounter all sorts of dangers, including mutant creatures, dangerous beasts, wild men who have lost their civilization-bound ways, and ubiquitous radiation and infections. You need to go through countless difficulties to recover your memory and love, and try to survive in this doomsday world.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1061250/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1559309290","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1061250/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1559309290","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1061250/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1559309290","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1061250/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1559309290","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Time traveler is a doomsday survival RPG independent game developed by us.<br />\r\nIn the future, a solar storm will destroy a large number of civilizations and creatures on earth, and almost all human beings will die.
