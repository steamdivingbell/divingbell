collect that unlock mirrors, which are trampolines, to climb faster.<br>- There's a day/night cycle, so at night you have a torch to activate to see where you're going.<br>- You'll also find teleporters to take you further along the map.<br>- There's also an aiming system that switches you to 1st-person view, helping you use the grappling hook for your ascent.<br><br>Good
