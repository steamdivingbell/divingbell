{"about_the_game":"Welcome to GameGuru Demo, game making for everyone. Our mission is to create the easiest and most enjoyable game creator. Join us and our great &amp; enthusiastic community on this journey.  Imagine creating a world that you and your friends come together and play... and creating it could be a matter of minutes with no technical jiggery-pokery needed at all! Of course, you can happily spend hours, days..even weeks creating your masterpiece, the great thing about GameGuru is, you won't be held up by learning strange alien languages or using complex modeling tools. The time you spend with GameGuru is all about creating and having fun whilst doing it.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172740/extras/GG-NewCollage2.png?t=1570630159\" /><br><br>When you first launch GameGuru, it may appear to be a simple level editor, but it's actually crammed with lots of useful tools you will need to make your own game, including a character creator, model importer, building maker, complete scripting language and of course, with the full version, over 6GB of complimentary game assets to get you started. The fact it's as easy as any in-game level editor is a plus, and unlike level editors, you get to save out what you've made and even sell your game!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172740/extras/GG-NewCollage3.png?t=1570630159\" /><br><br>We've created a small game level for you to play and enjoy, which shows you how you might layout your level, and balance the combat to give the player a challenging experience. You can, of course, edit this level any way you wish and learn from an existing demo level rather than start completely from scratch. We believe there is nothing on the market which enables you to create and share a 3D game as quickly as GameGuru, thanks to a massive starter collection of assets, our easy drag and drop approach and built-in game logic so you don't need to code it yourself (unless you want to).<br><br>GameGuru offers you an easy yet comprehensive game creation process that is open to non-programmers and designers/artists, or anyone who aspires to become a game creator. It also has powerful editing tools for those who want to take their game creation to an even greater and more complex level. The power is there at your fingertips.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1172740?t=1570630159","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1172740?t=1570630159","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172740/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1570630159","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172740/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1570630159","categories":[{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to GameGuru Demo, game making for everyone.
