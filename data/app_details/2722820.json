{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dash &amp; Roll - Magic in Motion: Dash, Jump, Smash the Crystal Curse!</h2><br>In &quot;Dash &amp; Roll,&quot; players are transported to a mesmerizing world where not everything is as it seems.<br>As a once ordinary marble, you're imbued with mystical abilities by a benevolent wizard,<br>transforming your existence from mundane to magical. But with great power comes great<br>responsibility. The world is littered with radiant crystals that harbor an unknown force, and you, as<br>the enchanted marble, are the sole hope in navigating treacherous terrains to shatter them. This isn't<br>just about dexterity and agility; it's a journey to uncover the truth behind the crystals, the wizard,<br>and your own newfound abilities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">&quot;Dash &amp; Roll&quot; seamlessly marries classic platforming elements with a fresh, magical twist. </h2><br>Players will<br>use the marble's three core powers: dash to sprint past obstacles and enemies, jump to vault over<br>pits and barriers, and brake to strategically halt momentum or plan the next move. These abilities are<br>not just for movement; they're essential for tackling the myriad challenges that each level presents,<br>especially the radiant crystals which need to be destroyed to progress.<br>As players venture deeper, levels evolve in complexity, introducing intricate puzzles, diverse terrains,<br>and menacing adversaries. Yet, at its heart, &quot;Dash &amp; Roll&quot; remains a casual platformer. Its narrative,<br>though light, is compelling enough to keep players invested, as they piece together the story of the<br>wizard's realm and the purpose of their enchanting journey.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Meet Wizard","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2722820/c31c3c82959ce6789f99ad3054041c0022e0d524.jpg"},{"name":"Unlock Fun Forest","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2722820/c31c3c82959ce6789f99ad3054041c0022e0d524.jpg"},{"name":"Unlock Cemetery Level","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2722820/c31c3c82959ce6789f99ad3054041c0022e0d524.jpg"},{"name":"Unlock Snow Level","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2722820/c31c3c82959ce6789f99ad3054041c0022e0d524.jpg"},{"name":"Unlock Desert Level","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2722820/c31c3c82959ce6789f99ad3054041c0022e0d524.jpg"},{"name":"Unlock Lava Level","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2722820/c31c3c82959ce6789f99ad3054041c0022e0d524.jpg"},{"name":"Unlock Dungeon Level","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2722820/c31c3c82959ce6789f99ad3054041c0022e0d524.jpg"},{"name":"Reveal the Wizard's intentions","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2722820/c31c3c82959ce6789f99ad3054041c0022e0d524.jpg"},{"name":"Unlock Final Arena ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2722820/c31c3c82959ce6789f99ad3054041c0022e0d524.jpg"},{"name":"Defeat the Wizard","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2722820/c31c3c82959ce6789f99ad3054041c0022e0d524.jpg"}],"total":10},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2722820/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725287411","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2722820/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1725287411","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2722820/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725287411","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2722820/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725287411","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dash &amp; Roll - Magic in Motion: Dash, Jump, Smash the Crystal Curse!</h2><br>In &quot;Dash &amp; Roll,&quot; players are transported to a mesmerizing world where not everything is as it seems.<br>As a once ordinary marble, you're imbued with mystical abilities by a benevolent wizard,<br>transforming your existence from mundane to magical.
