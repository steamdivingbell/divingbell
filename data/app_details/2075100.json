You\u2019re a planewalker who travels through parallel worlds in search of the precious, high-energy material called Chernobylite. Cut off from the world, trapped in the Zone, attacked by hordes of nightmare creatures, you must fight for survival and unite the handful of remaining survivors.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">OPEN WORLD EXPLORATION </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Explore and analyze the big and realistic open world of the real Chornobyl Exclusion Zone in switchable first-person or third-person perspective - you won't miss a single detail.
