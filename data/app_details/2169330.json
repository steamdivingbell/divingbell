{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2169330/extras/RogueType.jpg?t=1670817044\" /><br><br>RogueType is the first typing game that borrows roguelike elements, while on the surface it looks like a traditional 2D game, it's both familiar and unique because on one hand, you have standard 2D minigames that everyone is familiar with (there are also newly designed ones) but the minigames are being remixed with a typing mechanic. Every time you have a new game you will have 20 stages that have random typing minigames, each time having larger words that will make them harder, you can also get card stages that contain a random effect that can make your game easier or harder, after finishing the 20 stages your score will be compared to your previous scores to unlock new characters.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2169330/extras/TypeBetter.jpg?t=1670817044\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2169330/extras/TypeFaster.jpg?t=1670817044\" /><br><br>Minigames are divided into 2 types, speed with precision and memorization, speed with precision minigames will reward you by giving you a lot of points but if you fail a word it won't take away a lot of points for you, memorization minigames will punish you by taking more points.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2169330/extras/Precision.jpg?t=1670817044\" /><br><br>At the bottom left there are the hearts you have, you start with 5 but can have up to 10, if you fail stages and lose all your hearts it will be game over and you will start again in stage 1.<br><br><strong>A note from the developer: </strong><br>If you\u2019re thinking about buying RogueType please keep in mind that while I am super passionate about this game, I am a solo developer. This is not a triple-A experience with hundreds of hours of content.
