When used on an opponent's coin, it allows you to take (co-)control of it in subsequent rounds as long as the SeaWeed is alive (and gorging). Additionally, each weapon modifies its effect to a greater or lesser extent when used on a coin with a SeaWeed on it - check it yourself! :)<br>When the SeaWeed touches the coin, it jumps forward, but at a random angle, which you can also use to try to capture your opponent's piece. Remember, however, that you cannot touch coins under &quot;virgin protection&quot; with your SeaWeed. There is also a &quot;SeaWeed protection&quot; which means that when a coin with a SeaWeed falls into the water, it is returned to the board.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2779820/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1706822265","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2779820/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1706822265","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2779820/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1706822265","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2779820/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1706822265","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>By purchasing PREMIUM you get:</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Kink Skin!<br></li><li> Access to special weapon: <strong>SeaWeed</strong>!<br></li><li> You buy me food and support the further development of the game ;p</li></ul><br>In the future, a single-player campaign involving solving puzzles on non-standard boards is also planned.
