{"about_the_game":"<strong>Seeds of Unity</strong> is a unique story-driven farming RPG that also has aspects of sci-fi, romance, and exploration embedded within. Set in the distant future where humanity is beginning to explore the cosmos, colonists are the new dream job for every child. You play as one of those interstellar pioneers, where you will embark on a journey to a new planet -- <strong>Raea</strong>. Create lasting friendships, help the newly found colony thrive, dive into the unexplored surface, and perhaps even find that special someone along the way.<br><br>Although the promise of a new life on a new planet may be enticing, it does not come without challenges. The journey is long and perilous, and assuming you make it to Raea (a bold assumption!), you must soon focus on supporting the colony in any way you can. Any growing settlement is bound to have some disputes, but we're sure that with your help, those will bring no harm in the long-term. Also, be careful when exploring the nearby wilderness! Who knows what plants (and animals?) lurk outside of colony grounds, but we're sure the colonists will take care of anything that gets thrown their way.<br><br>At least, that's how you were told it was supposed to be. But with these difficult and extensive journeys, something is bound to go wrong. For you and your crewmates, your ship never got up to maximum speed, and therefore arrived much later than other ships. How has the settlement progressed, and what have you missed out on over the years? Before you can look towards exploring the planet, you should probably work on integrating yourself into this foreign place. Who knows how the colony has changed?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1894910/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1713819316","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1894910/page.bg.jpg?t=1713819316","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1894910/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1713819316","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1894910/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1713819316","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Captions available","id":13}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Seeds of Unity</strong> is a unique story-driven farming RPG that also has aspects of sci-fi, romance, and exploration embedded within.
