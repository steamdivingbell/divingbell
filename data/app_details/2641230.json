{"about_the_game":"Welcome to Mazes and Labyrinths, a deceptively difficult single screen puzzle game set in the fantasy world of Antinomia. Play as Will and Ari as you battle the prophet Sybilla and the invading Omniety, an alien being reshaping the planet to its whims. Use your wits, powers, and even the enemies themselves to find an exit to every maze and save Antinomia and its people from certain destruction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreated by OnlineVideoSurfer, Mazes and Labyrinths features over 70 puzzles in the main campaign plus a robust level editor to make and play your own levels. For more dedicated players, most levels also feature a bonus medal to truly test your ability to break the game. The goal is an almost arcade-puzzle experience, with short, bite-sized levels and simple graphics that nevertheless disguise deeply complex, rule-based design. Learning the intricacies of the powerups, the enemies, and the full implications of your abilities is essential to both mastering the campaign and making your own mazes for others.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are no pay to win mechanics, no in-game currencies, nor any other monetization features to diminish the game. This is a free game made by one person for anyone that wants challenging yet thoughtful puzzles or desires to make their own levels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPersevere and overcome the challenges and you will hopefully find a rewarding puzzle game that, by the endgame, will push your reasoning to its limits. For everyone that tries, I wish you luck.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Starting Adventurer ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2641230/56a7c125648aa0d9608012e2be1adc2b554bd2ea.jpg"},{"name":"Novice Adventurer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2641230/1ba959aca556c47d5e66202ef55f62f0c82e1f7b.jpg"},{"name":"Advanced Adventurer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2641230/aa1995aedda5599cc732fef3d63c3b3e12351595.jpg"},{"name":"Lead Adventurer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2641230/c06655daa1614240d4e1312b508120573b38545b.jpg"},{"name":"Starting Collector","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2641230/6062a47c7ca1b4910b53edf29d2a5b1763ff36dd.jpg"},{"name":"Simple Collector","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2641230/cc77d19bb15d429acbad63fb2c4861c07ee13480.jpg"},{"name":"Attentive Collector","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2641230/6f6a48f10c34b3da2543ea58637f5ea7ed88256e.jpg"},{"name":"Collection Complete","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2641230/8efc4e0f06e748b4153f289b4b8f074918f0794c.jpg"},{"name":"Basic Adventurer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2641230/45f0fa9ae1ab3c0f8a34c3e200866bb82eb6e961.jpg"},{"name":"Skilled Adventurer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2641230/51672970fba07b5d981b9b1c1825674d46b03d7e.jpg"}],"total":14},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2641230/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734047598","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2641230/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1734047598","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2641230/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734047598","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2641230/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734047598","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to Mazes and Labyrinths, a deceptively difficult single screen puzzle game set in the fantasy world of Antinomia.
