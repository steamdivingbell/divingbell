Play as one of the many legendary figures of Gensokyo and wield their powers and abilities in combat. Hit your opponent as hard as possible and send them flying in a beautiful yet unhinged Battle of Bullets!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2>Gensokyo is suddenly hit by weird boundary irregularities! Various mysterious bubbles have started to surround various parts of Gensokyo, and it seems to be expanding little by little as time passes. Those who enter the barrier is given an indestructible and never aging body that rivals even a Hermit. However, due to it giving what's practically immortality to also humans, humans may never have to fear youkai. Before these barriers consume the entirety of Gensokyo and endanger the balance between Humans and Youkai, our heroines must find a way to destroy it somehow.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> </h2>However, it seems that the break for this phenomenon is rather straight forward: Abuse the power of immortality to the boundary's limits and shatter it with the same unshattering bodies it gives to its inhabitants. In other words, a battle with no restraints! To solve this disruptive incident, Danmaku battles are completely unhinged and fighters are allowed to use even their most powerful attacks!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Danmaku and Grazing</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2290860/extras/Bullets.gif?t=1734254202\" /><br>In Gensokyo, Bullets are a means of communication to resolve conflict. Every Fighter is equipped with some form of projectiles.

Whenever a fighter grazes any attack, their Spell meter fills up. With Spell meter, Fighters gain access to their strong attacks.
