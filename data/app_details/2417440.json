{"about_the_game":"<i>Path To Knighthood</i> is a 250,000-word interactive fantasy novel written by Ian Lai, where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based\u2014without graphics or sound effects\u2014and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. <br><br>This game depicts a classic story in a new way. A brave and dashing knight on the back of a white horse, rushing headlong to slay the dragon and come to the rescue of the beautiful princess - that is what the books usually tell the tale. Here, those childhood stories are darker and more realistic, intertwined with the complexity of humanity. <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Play as male or female, straight, gay, or bi.<br></li><li>Triumph over your opponents in the tournament.<br></li><li>Save a damsel in distress?
