Therefore, in terms of the music style, we did not use the common music style in the quadratic works, but imitate the music method of film and television works, and turned our eyes to the more traditional and classic instrumentation, in order to give the players the audio-visual experience.<br />\r\nThe album is divided into three parts. &quot;Disc 1&quot; contains 10 songs, five post-credits tracks and their vocals in each of our seven branching directions. &quot;Disc 2&quot; contains 47 songs and is a set of scene-specific soundtracks arranged in dramatic order. Disc 3 consists of eight songs and is a soundtrack with no specific plot direction.<br />\r\nI hope that the songs on this album will make you think back to the humble village in 1995 and recall the story of that era that we have played for you.<br />\r\nLooking forward to seeing you again!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2365720/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1679636476","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2365720/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1679636476","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2365720/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1679636476","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2365720/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1679636476","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Hello everyone, I am gzsn, the sound design director of this game, and I am also responsible for the soundtrack.<br />\r\nFirst of all, I would like to thank you all for supporting Dragon's Habitat and the soundtrack album.<br />\r\nAlthough the work is presented in the form of the so-called &quot;quadratic galgame&quot;, it is far from the general quadratic style in terms of its painting style, work content and spiritual core.
