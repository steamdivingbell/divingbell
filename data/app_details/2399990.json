{"about_the_game":"You\u2019re a new agent with a tricky case and plenty to prove. With your hellhound partner and devil boss, can you catch a magical arsonist before you lose your heart?<br><br>Forbidden Magic is an interactive paranormal romance game by Frances Pauli, author of Brimstone Manor. It's entirely text-based, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.<br><br>At the Organization for the Protection of Sorcerous Secrets, the boss is a real devil. No, literally, they\u2019re a devil. The vampire who works in the basement is out to get you; a rogue arsonist is lighting up the whole city; and your hellhound-shifter partner\u2026well, you two have a history. You\u2019re a human, but you\u2019re still trying to get back onto the right side of the law after being caught using illegal magic. Some people even think you might be the arsonist!<br><br>You\u2019ll need every bit of your wits to navigate office politics with goblins, centaurs, and elves; and every bit of your own magic to investigate this unconventional crime. And when you\u2019re not doing that, you\u2019ll need to work hard to make sure that mundane humans don\u2019t find out about the magical creatures and secrets that exist right under their noses.<br><br>But the closer you get to finding the arsonist, the closer you get to losing your heart. Will you grow close to a fellow agent on the long hours of a stakeout? Rekindle old love with your hellhound high school sweetheart?
