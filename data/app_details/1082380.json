{"about_the_game":"Vertigo 2 is a single-player adventure built from the ground up as a game for high-end VR. Deep underground in the reaches of Planck Interdimensional's Quantum Reactor VII, you awake to finish your journey home. No closer to your goal than when you first arrived, you must count on the help of the mysteriously familiar stranger who saved your life. On your way towards the center of the reactor, you will have to face bizarre alien flora and fauna leaking from other universes, and deadly android security forces whose job is to purge the Reactor of all life. As you try to determine who to trust, sinister forces lurk just out of sight, and you may find yourself learning more than you want to. With a branching story hinging on key decisions, there's no telling what you'll encounter in this absurd world. The only certainty is that there's danger around every corner.<br><br>Enter Vertigo 2, a game building upon and reaching beyond the 2016 original.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Native Valve Index support<br></li><li>Support for both teleportation and smooth locomotion<br></li><li>Free demo <br></li><li>Original soundtrack<br></li><li>Fully voiced characters<br></li><li>Huge arsenal of 16 unique weapons<br></li><li>Dozens of unique enemy types<br></li><li>Full unlockable lore encyclopedia<br></li><li>Steam Audio integration<br></li><li>6+ hour long campaign</li></ul>","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1082380/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1675015142","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1082380/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1675015142","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"The Vertigo 2 demo contains obscene language and graphic violence."},"detailed_description":"Vertigo 2 is a single-player adventure built from the ground up as a game for high-end VR.
