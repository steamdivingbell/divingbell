{"about_the_game":"Play jetpack soccer!  You take control of a super athlete playing a football/basketball style sport in the future.  You can take to the skies with a powerful jetpack.  Maintain your speed by bunny hopping (or skiing) downhill giving way to unrestricted movement.  The ball inherits all of your momentum as you throw, so speed plays a big part.<br><br>The game is being made by a solo developer.  Please be warned that the game contains some &quot;programmer art&quot; at this time.  There is no tutorial yet but it is in the works.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/666590/extras/jetball_jetpack_soccer_.jpg?t=1623773806\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Objective</h2>The objective is simple.
