In 1949, his grandparents take him in, helping him achieve sobriety, but his fragile peace shatters when his grandmother accuses him of stealing her medication. One night, Thomas awakens in her room, surrounded by blood, with no memory of what happened, and his grandmother is missing. Wracked with guilt and fear, Thomas goes into hiding for twelve years.
