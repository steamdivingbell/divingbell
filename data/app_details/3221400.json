{"about_the_game":"Tower Defense: Goblin Wars is a tower defense game designed with stylized and colorful graphics that invites you to defend the lands occupied by goblins. In the game, you will step into a great battle with three different archer characters, each with unique abilities. As the goblin armies get stronger with each level, you will face challenging challenges that test your strategic intelligence and reflexes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this tower defense game that draws you in from the beginning, each of your characters offers different advantages. While the Standard Archer targets enemies one by one with his classic aiming ability, the Fire Archer can destroy enemy groups with flaming arrows and damage large areas. The Ice Archer freezes enemies and immobilizes them, thus making your attacks even more effective. You must stop your enemies intelligently and meet them with an impassable defense.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game offers twelve different levels that are increasingly difficult. In each level, it is your duty to destroy a certain number of goblins and defeat large goblin BOSSes. While you face fewer goblins at the beginning, the number of goblin armies increases in later levels and you have to fight much larger and stronger goblin BOSSes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso, while you only fight against one goblin at a time at the beginning, you have to fight against more than one goblin at the same time as the levels progress. In such cases, if you have a fire or ice archer, using their special abilities may be the right choice for you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTower Defense: Goblin Wars goes beyond being a simple defense game. When you complete each level, you move on to the next level and face even greater threats. The dynamic structure of the game requires you to develop different tactics each time. Your enemies are not only superior in number, but also become more intelligent and aggressive with each level. Your mission is to stop this goblin invasion and protect your kingdom.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach level offers players the opportunity to develop their strategy skills and try new techniques. While shooting your fire arrows at enemy hordes, your ability to stop them with your ice arrows can completely change the course of the battle. With each level you succeed in, you will encounter stronger enemies, but with the experience and skills you gain, you will be one step closer to victory.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe visual world of the game offers a feast. Colorful, 3D and stylized graphics draw players into a fascinating atmosphere, while fluid animations and impressive battle effects make every moment unforgettable. Each level invites you to a different challenge, but each victory motivates you for the next great battle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTower Defense: Goblin Wars offers players not only a tower defense game, but also the opportunity to write a story of victory. In each level, it is up to you to determine the right strategy, accumulate gold to buy new archers, and repel the goblin armies. The sense of satisfaction of progress will take you further at every moment of the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this great war where you are given the task of protecting your kingdom, victory will only be for the brave. Defend your towers and lands by resisting the ruthless attacks of the goblins. Each new level means a greater challenge, a greater strategy, and a greater victory.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3221400/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727459964","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3221400/page.bg.jpg?t=1727459964","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3221400/ec3c5c790118c3b3cfa7d858b8eb4b614baad323/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727459964","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3221400/ec3c5c790118c3b3cfa7d858b8eb4b614baad323/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727459964","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Tower Defense: Goblin Wars is a tower defense game designed with stylized and colorful graphics that invites you to defend the lands occupied by goblins.
