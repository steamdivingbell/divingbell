{"about_the_game":"Harley-Davidson\u00ae / Third Edition (1999): Designed by industry veterans, Lonnie D. Ropp and John Borg, this table grabs your attention with its chrome trim, classic rock n\u2019 roll soundtrack and loud shaker motor that simulates the roar of a real Harley motor. The playfield features a player controlled up-post between the flippers and a 1/10 scale model of a Harley-Davidson Fat Boy\u00ae that does a wheelie to reveal a ball lock below it. This table was among the first to use three Multi-Ball modes: Speedometer Multi-Ball, Stop Light Multi-Ball and Harley Multi-Ball.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/569245/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1482865847","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/569245/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1482865847","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/569245/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1482865847","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/569245/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1482865847","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Harley-Davidson\u00ae / Third Edition (1999): Designed by industry veterans, Lonnie D.
