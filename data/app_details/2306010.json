{"about_the_game":"In this game, players take on the role of a nordic soldier in a post-apocalyptic world where a mysterious virus has wiped out most of the population. As the player navigates through the ruins of their once-great city, they must scavenge for resources, defend themselves against dangerous scavengers and mutated creatures, and uncover the truth about the virus and its origins. The game is set in a sprawling, open-world landscape that has been ravaged by a virus. The player starts in their apartment, which serves as a safe haven and base of operations. From there, they can explore the city and the landscape, which is filled with abandoned buildings, overgrown streets, and other hazards. The player will encounter other survivors along the way, some of whom are friendly and willing to trade or provide information about the virus or the mutated, while others are hostile and will attack on sight. The gameplay in &quot;Surviving the Fall&quot; is a mix of survival, exploration, and combat. The player will need to gather resources such as food, water, and medical supplies to stay alive. They can scavenge for these items in abandoned buildings and on the streets, or trade with other survivors for them. The player will also need to defend themselves against scavengers and mutated creatures, using a variety of weapons such as guns, melee weapons, and traps.<br />\r\nAs the player progresses through the game, they will uncover clues about the virus and its origins. The player will have to decide whether to try to expose the truth and bring those responsible to justice, or to focus on simply surviving in this new, dangerous world.<br />\r\nOverall, &quot;Surviving the Fall&quot; is a tense and immersive survival game that puts players in the shoes of a lone soldier fighting to stay alive in a post-apocalyptic world. With its open-world setting, deep survival mechanics, and compelling story.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2306010/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1721777174","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2306010/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1721777174","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2306010/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1721777174","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2306010/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1721777174","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"in this game you fight against mutated creatures and you have to protect yourself with the weapons you have at hand. you as the player can choose how much you damage these mutated creatures, so the more you damage them the more blood and gore you will see."},"detailed_description":"In this game, players take on the role of a nordic soldier in a post-apocalyptic world where a mysterious virus has wiped out most of the population.
