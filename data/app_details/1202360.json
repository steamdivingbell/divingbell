Diffraction counts as the often underestimated value. Camera manufacturers promise a huge resolution sensor, but this can only be used in very specific situations and is usually just a marketing idea. If we ignore all other influences (which additively worsen everything further), a full-frame camera (24x36mm) with an aperture of 8 only has the possibility to bring about 30 megapixels of information to the sensor due to diffraction. At aperture 11 it would be 15 megapixels and at aperture 16 it would only be 7.5 megapixels. Conversely, the resolution increases with a smaller f-number. At f / 5.6 it would be 60 megapixels, at f / 4 it would be 121 megapixels. You might think that everything is fine, when you use a maximum aperture of 5.6 with a 50 megapixel 35mm camera. There are two problems with this. The lesser problem nowadays is the optimal sharpness of the lens, since this is technically well solved, that it is reasonably homogeneous over a few aperture steps. The bigger problem is that the higher the resolution of the image, the lower the sharpness level, especially the closer the subject is. This means that if you are not close to the infinity focus of the lens, the focus level will be too small if you use a small f-number. This inevitably leads to focus stacking in order to achieve a greater depth of field, which in turn leads to other problems (keyword movement).
