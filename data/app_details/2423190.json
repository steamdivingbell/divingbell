{"about_the_game":"Epic conclusion to The House of the Da Vinci series. This third instalment of this popular\u00a0Video Game is filled with a range of emotional and tense moments. And the soundtrack reflects it in every way possible. From the work with thematic materials, to developing instrumentation - the music covers all important parts of the game. Tomas Zivor (composer for the whole series) approached composing this third part in a grander way. By using choir and periodic instruments, accompanied by strings, the whole album feels very cinematic and true to the source - the game and its story. Featuring Czech singer Kamila Nyvltova in the Main Theme. Immerse yourself in the wonderful world of The House of Da Vinci.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2423190/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1690725391","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2423190/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1690725391","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2423190/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1690725391","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2423190/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1690725391","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Epic conclusion to The House of the Da Vinci series.
