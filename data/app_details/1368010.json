With summer break over, a new semester of fall events awaits. There\u2019s the annual academy festival, the sports meet\u2014the list goes on! As I walk to class on my first day, my heart races in anticipation at what my new campus life will be like. That is, until students start approaching me a short distance from the campus gate\u2026 You see, Ainoshima Academy has two student councils that are always vying against each other. Here, let me break it down for you real quick: <br>Gekka Council: Steeped in history and tradition, Gekka is as old as the academy itself.

Before I transferred, the student vote was split evenly between them, which means my vote will be the one that decides who gets the majority! Word has it that a similar deadlock happened six years ago, and it was a transfer student who broke it. Coincidence, huh? Anyway, as you can imagine, since day one of me moving here, neither faction will give me a moment\u2019s peace!
