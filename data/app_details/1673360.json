{"about_the_game":"In 2023, industry leading pharmaceutical company &quot;HT Pharmaceuticals&quot; found the complete cure for COVID-19, and they released the vaccine to the public.

The original outbreak occurred in New York. Before the infection, you were the lead scientist who worked on the project for HT Pharmaceuticals, so you understand how it functions. Towards the end of the project, you retired very rich. Now you are part of a small group of survivors who live deep in the city, struggling to survive.
