{"about_the_game":"Lil Big Invasion is an exploration based action-adventure game with a unique and quirky take on the 2D dungeon crawler genre. Awake your protective instincts and challenge your brain trying to rescue cute little fireflies which got lost in dangerous dungeons.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/491240/extras/title_cards4.png?t=1720972754\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About</h2><br>Those cute little fireflies got lost in dark and dangerous dungeons. Find them, keep them together and lure them with your light to the exit, which happens to be a giant vacuum cleaner, in order to suck them back home. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/491240/extras/store_help__.png?t=1720972754\" /><br><br>In those dungeons you have to outsmart winds, spider webs and glowing flowers.

Sounds easy but trust me, it's a hard job. Especially for an aged firefly guardian like yourself. You've been sleeping for just one second and yep, they've invaded every dungeon. It's a 'Lil Big Invasion'. Now you have to remember your training and save those poor little cute creatures.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/491240/extras/store_plot.png?t=1720972754\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Compete</h2><br>After getting to know a dungeon, you can try beating the clock and other players as well. Every dungeon in the main game has its own leaderboard. The quicker you get through, the more points you will get. But be aware that the number of rescued fireflies counts as a multiplier. So make sure to catch them all when you go for that high score.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/491240/extras/store_compete.png?t=1720972754\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Win 5 unique boss fights<br></li><li>Explore 40 handcrafted dungeons<br></li><li>Rescue over 400 cute little fireflies<br></li><li>Throughout 5 different and exotic worlds<br></li><li>Unique dungeon crawler puzzle solving mechanics<br></li><li>Charming but also challenging (100% challenge + bonus content)</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Input</h2><br>This game is designed for mouse input and touch screen devices.
