Make your game huge by clicking and getting Bytes which is the amount of storage your game takes up and as we all know more Gigabytes = better game. Type commands into the console to make code that brings your games storage up automatically, upgrade your mouse to gain more bytes per click and drink some coffee for a boost and purchase a server to make your game even bigger. Get immersed and become a Lua game developer today in Lu[Idle].
