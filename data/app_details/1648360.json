As your world falls into chaos the more dark magic is harnessed and exploited (warping the world and its inhabitants) &quot;You&quot; and your fellow Luminaries evolved to make use of the world's less prevalent resource, light magic. With that power, as you grow stronger throughout your adventures, you will gain the strength needed to rid your world of darkness, and bring back the light.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1648360/extras/TurnAroundClip.gif?t=1738107539\" /><br><strong>MAIN FEATURES of LUMINARY</strong><br>Aside for the overall graphical fidelity, and ease of access to the Openworld ARPG genre for all, There are 6 main pillars of Luminary, that the gameplay and mechanics focus on:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EXPLORATION AND ADVENTURE</h2> - A dense world to explore with a robust fun locomotion system that allows you to go anywhere. Running, Jumping, Gliding, Swimming, Climbing. Just moving around the world and exploring is truly fun.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1648360/extras/ExplorationClip.gif?t=1738107539\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BATTLES AND COMBAT</h2> - A real time yet forgiving skill base combat system, where you can dynamically switch between fighting styles with the press of a button.

Every time you start a new world, locations, rarities and difficulties change. Explore infinitely, by joining friends in their worlds, or make new ones yourself with a new game plus.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LOOT UP AND PROGRESSION</h2> - Not only are there many different types of weapon/armor/item categories you can skill up in, but each of those categories have many different variations. Didn't find that specific flame sword you were looking for to complete your horde collection? Join a friends game and try your luck there. They already found it? Maybe they will trade it to you, for a hefty gold price I imagine. And not only will you skill up in all weapons/armors/items as you use them, but your Luminary Level will also increase with experience, unlocking massive new abilities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ROLE PLAYING</h2> - And last but not least, we want Luminary to not only feel like a game, but a continually enjoyed experience. There will be all of the aspects you expect from a role playing game, such as character customization, cosmetics, emotes, job tasks, etc. Play your character the way you want.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1648360/extras/DarkShrineClip.gif?t=1738107539\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DREADNOUGHT AND DARK MAGIC - THE GOAL</h2>In the simplest terms, there is one True Goal in Luminary every time a map is played, Find and Destroy the Dreadnought. Simple right? However, both \u201cfind\u201d and \u201cdestroy\u201d may not be such an easy task in the beginning.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1648360/extras/DreadnoughtClip2.gif?t=1738107539\" /><br><br>The Dreadnought is a Gigantic Beast that spawns in random locations at the start of the game across a large map. Lurking somewhere in this vast landscape, exploration will become a real key in finding it. You can go at this task Solo, or cover ground faster with the help of others. Climb tall mountains and scour deep valleys, searching for where the Dreadnought calls home, this time around. The Dreadnought is the strongest and most difficult enemy to destroy in the game, but fortunately there is a proper way to go about this fight.<br><br>The world is filled with Dark Magic, and all of the creatures, bosses, and even the Dreadnought feeds off this Darkness for ultimate strength. A Dreadnought at full strength is a powerhouse, and to attempt this fight at beginning stages, even with a strong group of four, would still likely be suicide. Finding the Dreadnought in early game is always helpful, and with the ability to mark it on the map after discovery, you will at least know where to avoid, until you can bring down the world\u2019s Dark Magic Level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LUMINARIES</h2>Your character is your own. Tied to your account, you can custom create and progress your character across any world, or gaming platform. At the forefront of Luminary is Role Playing, and we want the player to choose to look how they want, and even play how they want. There are no defined classes, you progress through your actions. Want to get better with fire magic, then use it. How about your tolerance to poisons? Get poisoned. Bows? then use them. The more you use any measurable tool/item/weapon/armor the greater your proficiency at that thing becomes. <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1648360/extras/SteamLuminaryCharacters.JPG?t=1738107539\" /><br><br>However, maybe you aren't into combat but still want to hang out with your friends. That's great, there will be plenty of other Role Playing activities for you to progress and earn money with, from  Fishing, Mining, Animal Catching, etc. Not every hour spent in Luminary should just be about killing the Dreadnought, sometimes lets just hang out in a beautiful world together.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1648360/extras/LuminaryLogoClip.gif?t=1738107539\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1648360/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738107539","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1648360/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1738107539","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1648360/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738107539","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1648360/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738107539","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1648360/extras/addtowishlist_gif.gif?t=1738107539\" /><br><i>Wishlist/Follow and then Join our Discord and the Army of Luminaries</i><br><br><br>You are a <strong>Luminary</strong>, a warrior of light.
