{"about_the_game":"On a fateful day, the Sword of Will goes missing from the Sacred Altar, stripping the human Kingdom of its strength. The hellish monsters from the surrounding lands become emboldened, marching out of the darkness and attacking our villages.  There had been a Prophecy of old that this day would come. That a knight would rise and quell this darkness.  Many brave warriors have ventured out, fighting back the monsters, in search of the Sword of Will\u2026but none have returned.  As you work, forging armour for the Kingdom, you meet a Stranger in the wilderness that commissions you for a dangerous quest.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Blacksmithing</strong><br>Knight Foretold has a fully modular armour system, allowing you to create and equip a variety of armour and gear sets.
