{"about_the_game":"In 1931, the DRG ordered ten locomotives from the firm of Henschel that were taken into the fleet as numbers 85 001 to 85 010. The Class 85 was intended for hauling passenger and goods trains. They were however also employed as pusher locomotives on the Hoellentalbahn in the Black Forest. Thanks to this engine, the Hoellental Railway could do away with rack railway operations from 1933. The running gear and the superheated system were taken from the Class 44. The boiler, with a few minor alterations, was the same as that of the Class 62. All the locomotives were stabled at the Freiburg shed. This DLC features the DB BR85 001 in PBR quality with a high quality interior.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2088130/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1658896738","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2088130/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1658896738","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2088130/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1658896738","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2088130/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1658896738","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In 1931, the DRG ordered ten locomotives from the firm of Henschel that were taken into the fleet as numbers 85 001 to 85 010.
