{"about_the_game":"Jump into the football boots and try to score as many goals as you can. You vs goalkeeper, who will score more goals and who will delight the audience more?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>You play versus AI goalkeeper who can not only defend his own goal, but he can also shoot and sometimes score if you are not prepared to defend. Play as much as you can without any time limit and train your dribbling and shooting skills. There are three types of shot (straight shot, chip shot, finesse shot) that you can use in various situations. You can dribble past the goalkeeper and score, but you must be cautious because if you get too close to goalkeeper he will use sliding tackle on you and you will end up on the ground. Every ball bounce is covered with sound effect depending on what is hit. There are 40 fans beside the pitch waiting to see and celebrate some spectacular goals.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Future additions</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>More different venues and surfaces: Concrete, Grass, Sand...</li><li>Full player customization</li><li>Full player moves: Pass, Tackle, Header, Dive...</li><li>Dribbling skills</li><li>Online 1v1</li><li>Online Teams and Transfers</li><li>Big soccer stadiums for large amount of players (5v5 and more)</li><li>VR</li><li>and much more</li></ul><br><strong>Manual</strong><br>Use WASD or arrow keys to move and mouse to look.<br>Hold SHIFT to sprint (sprint is available only when going forward)<br>LMB = straight shot<br>Z + LMB  = finesse shot<br>C + LMB = chip shot<br>Shot power depends on how long you hold LMB<br><br><strong>The possibilities for new features are endless, so I expect to hear some very good advices from the Community!</strong>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/719970/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1630197025","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/719970/page.bg.jpg?t=1630197025","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/719970/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1630197025","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/719970/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1630197025","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Jump into the football boots and try to score as many goals as you can.
