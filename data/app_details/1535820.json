{"about_the_game":"Scrap Seas is an Action Rogue-Like that can be described as &quot;Mad Max Meets the Ocean.&quot; The game is about building and piloting your ship through a colorful comic book world where the ocean has reclaimed the earth.  <br><br><strong>BUILD YOUR SHIP</strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1535820/extras/Shop.gif?t=1629475358\" /><br>Start with a big boat and fight your way to an ENORMOUS BOAT!  And then take that enormous boat and fill it with every kind of cannon, laser beam, and whatever the hell else you can find.   You can also collect comic book panels which can provide a variety of buffs to your ship.  Ah, and don't forget about melee weapons.  Every boat worth piloting needs some buzz saws, or at least some electrified spikes.<br><br><br><strong>FIGHT!</strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1535820/extras/robotFight.gif?t=1629475358\" /><br>Use your fire power and maneuvering skills to sink ships, robots, and other stuff.  Destroy your enemies, and save those you care about.  Use your boosters to ram into enemy ships head on or to flee like a coward.  Just make sure you don't DIE, because if you DIE you'll die forever, and it's pretty easy to DIE.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1535820/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1629475358","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1535820/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1629475358","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1535820/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1629475358","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1535820/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1629475358","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Scrap Seas is an Action Rogue-Like that can be described as &quot;Mad Max Meets the Ocean.&quot; The game is about building and piloting your ship through a colorful comic book world where the ocean has reclaimed the earth.  <br><br><strong>BUILD YOUR SHIP</strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1535820/extras/Shop.gif?t=1629475358\" /><br>Start with a big boat and fight your way to an ENORMOUS BOAT!
