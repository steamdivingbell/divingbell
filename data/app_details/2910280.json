There\u2019s no ancient bloodline, no chosen one, no grand destiny. You\u2019re just a nobody trying to survive in a harsh, unforgiving medieval fantasy world.<br><br>You begin as a humble peasant who\u2019s grown sick of the so-called heroes: arrogant adventurers who rampage through your village while pretending to fight for a greater cause. Enough is enough. It\u2019s time to take your fate into your own hands.<br><br>Venture through a world brimming with danger, deceit, and opportunity.
