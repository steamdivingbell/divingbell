{"about_the_game":"RAM is a classic top-down roguelike shooter in the vein of Nuclear Throne, but with a redefining twist. As a bodiless AI programmed for violence, you must play as the same enemies you fight against- weaving a path of indiscriminate (and hopefully stylish) carnage through hordes of very quirky robots until your mysterious objective is reached. Switch control at a moment\u2019s notice between unique enemy types, each with a distinct moveset and playstyle, and their own upgrades to unlock. In addition to a shooter, RAM is a frenetic real-time puzzle of planning who your next host will be, how to dispose of your current body once you are forced to abandon it, and which enemies would be best turned against which others to clear each room as efficiently as possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this demo, try out the first level of RAM: Random Access Mayhem!<br />\r\nWith access to four hosts, dozens of upgrades, and randomly generated floor sequences, try to defeat the boss at the end.<br />\r\nThe demo includes various difficulty modifiers for those looking for an extra challenge, as well as some unlockables.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn RAM, no host body is permanent. Swap control to a new enemy every or die.<br />\r\nSwap too often and you\u2019ll eat into your total energy. To keep swapping, you must keep killing.<br />\r\nRacking up points isn\u2019t just for fun: your score is in-run currency. Execute trickshots and kill with style to unlock a diverse array of upgrades that enhance and modify how each hosts functions, then pit your accumulated strength against dangerous bosses with unique swap-related mechanics of their own.","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2481800/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1720759354","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2481800/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1720759354","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"RAM is a classic top-down roguelike shooter in the vein of Nuclear Throne, but with a redefining twist.
