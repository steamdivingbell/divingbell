{"about_the_game":"An apprentice wizard, seeking always to gain more power, enters the service of a powerful sorcerer to do his bidding. Now, trapped in eternal servitude, you are sent on a quest across the planes of existence to seek out and slay the Doomlords who preside over reality itself, all in the name of preventing universal disaster.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE MASTER OF DEATH</h2>The master of death has been resurrected. The powerful wizard that holds your contract signed in blood can no longer survive from the power they siphon from entities they've bound all across the planes of existence. To become more powerful than death itself, he sends his army of cultists to slay the entities and amass enough power to dethrone a god.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SLAY OR BEFRIEND</h2><br>You don't have to honor the contract. In the different planes of existence, you can choose to slay or befriend the shackled entities, changing the conclusion of your story. Will you be a ruthless justicar, meting out pain and death? Or will you instead find common ground and friendship?
