{"about_the_game":"Secret of Harrow Manor was created because I wanted to make a VR game in the survival horror genre that put you up against zombies and monsters in a creepy abandoned mansion setting similar to the games that inspired me so deeply when I was growing up. One where even an individual zombie was to be feared, and you needed to search the area for ammo and keys in order to make it out. Along the way you'll also find many documents to read that will slowly reveal the story of what happened at this mansion and what created the monsters in the first place.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNote to VR users! : The game was built to be played with just ONE tracked controller (because it was designed with mobile in mind) so just pick the left or the right controller. The selections are either done with double tapping or with swiping gestures, no picking things up like in a proper VR pc game here, sorry.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/838840/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1549405030","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/838840/page.bg.jpg?t=1549405030","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/838840/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1549405030","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/838840/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1549405030","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Supported","id":53},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Secret of Harrow Manor was created because I wanted to make a VR game in the survival horror genre that put you up against zombies and monsters in a creepy abandoned mansion setting similar to the games that inspired me so deeply when I was growing up.
