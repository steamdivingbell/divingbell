{"about_the_game":"Welcome all to the flashlight sim experience! We want to congratulate you on your new purchase of our all-in-one package!<br><br>With your purchase of this amazing one-of-a-kind experience, you have been granted access to over 24 different flashlights to suit your needs with any given situation as well as a complete phycological overhaul. Life is not easy but within this simulation all your worries will fly away at an instant. You will be set free and free to live in your own world as you see fit. The simulation takes notice of your surroundings and implements that into the world, already familiarizing yourself with its surroundings and making sure you feel at home. You're in dire need of change, and we at flashlight co are proud to deliver that to you. Allow us to cover more of our groundbreaking features within this worthwhile experience:<br><br>1. <strong> 24 different unique flashlights which serve varying purposes </strong><br><br>Expanding on what we've said before these lights offer a collage of differing gameplay styles tailored to our users. <br><br>2. <strong> 4 distinct trials to help make sure you are clear for entry further into the simulation. As you may know many who have undergone the task of entering the simulation fully have been found in an odd state </strong><br><br>We use this as a safety precaution, I'm sure you'd understand. Safety and science are both of our top priorities. <br><br>3 <strong> The simulation has for sure seen some hard times in the past, but we are dedicated to ensuring a better life for anyone who wishes for change.  </strong><br><br>Remember, this is not just a game; it is a life changing experience. <br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3015230/extras/FLSIM.gif?t=1723901652\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Trial 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3015230/41eefc85f686ec50e4d195eb23238627c09ae26f.jpg"},{"name":"Trial 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3015230/f8dbe4a30da892c7dfa39dc7d5681fe4c5f7799e.jpg"},{"name":"Trail 3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3015230/98ef16212f3ec1039f49fb3d2aa5783d9ba95834.jpg"},{"name":"Trial 4","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3015230/0be54e43a8bbb4e09b9c3d6da00101b60efa7c89.jpg"},{"name":"Master Flashlighter","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3015230/0080c54d13278548ac1dfd573ac89d325027e9f8.jpg"},{"name":"EXP 01","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3015230/5eff70eb41d29e00b71b021cdefd90f432a9de01.jpg"},{"name":"Good Ending","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3015230/4338f3bca00ae8ca126de630a7bc5f8c994c462b.jpg"},{"name":"Bad Ending","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3015230/09996ca17dfb1c93bb2c20f58f09c5758820caa8.jpg"},{"name":"She's Right","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3015230/3aa1d3cbe723c93fc6742f5987617601b04ff27a.jpg"},{"name":"I am in a game afterall","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3015230/7aec647a33518916f1c460cb087e6dcef8611b01.jpg"}],"total":20},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3015230/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1723901652","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3015230/page.bg.jpg?t=1723901652","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3015230/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1723901652","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3015230/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1723901652","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":3141010,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Welcome all to the flashlight sim experience!
