{"about_the_game":"You are hired by a local grocery store in a newly developed seaside town to do deliveries and run errands mostly on a fully functional motorized Scooter. <br>You will be asked to complete jobs such as gathering fruits up a tree to bring back to the store, climbing a mountain to feed an animal, to simply throwing magazines at the doorstep of local stores/residents. No two jobs are the same but they all involve a delivery. Expect to ride through town traffic, climb the mountain range, enter buildings, interact with animals and/or people, hop on/off the Scooter and more all while listening to public radio. This is just the beginning of your new life in VR. This experience is tailored to those who enjoy driving, the open road and the radio while doing simple deliveries in a living environment.
