{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Abstract</h2><br>Lamia must die! was a contest entry done for Encounters of Boss Kind. Since it actually placed 3rd of 28 entries (going for a tie with Demon Slayer Z), I went ahead and improved the game with improved graphics and more depth involving battle system before release to general public.
