However, there is a dark secret that clouds this friendship; one that has haunted certain members of the group for years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe day before their graduation, on their way to their marching practice, they are kidnapped and taken to a remote location, their long-term memories locked away and leaving them frightened. Stainless steel bracelets decorate their wrists and they find themselves in the dead center of a sterile white room with one TV on the far wall and a locked door opposite of it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe TV comes on and you learn that a dark secret has been hidden from Kris.
