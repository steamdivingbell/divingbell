{"about_the_game":"This historically inspired single-player campaign is set during mid to late 1942 on the Caucasus Front. The German 17th army and several mountain divisions pushed to the Caucasus mountains, culminating in a drive toward Tuapse - their ultimate goal was the Soviet oil fields at Maikop, Baku and Azerbaijan. This offensive was largely abandoned in November of 1942 due to Hitler's need to marshal forces around Stalingrad. After the defeat at Stalingrad the remaining German forces were ordered to withdraw toward the Taman peninsula to the northwest.<br><br>This campaign focuses on a fictitious, but historically plausible A-20 Boston, or &quot;Havoc&quot; squadron flying interdiction missions against the over-extended German supply lines.
