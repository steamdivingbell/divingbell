{"about_the_game":"Rise is a science fiction sandbox strategy MMO. The game is centered around a moon called Vieneo. The current game style does not lead you through any story lines or arcs. So it's pretty much a sandbox setup for sci-fi role playing. We started developing on it again about a year ago with a new server and the expectation to offer VR soon!<br><br>The ultimate goal of this game is to have fun flying sci-fi aerospace vehicles and trade your way to riches. Players start out with a car making small amounts of credits doing taxi runs. Eventually, with some help from other players, you may make it up to an E-series spacecraft hauling a variety of materials and passengers. Once you profit enough from passenger runs you can move onto buying property, constructing buildings, and mining ores.<br><br>The community is terrific. We have some core players that are eager to help newcomers. If you play your cards right, you might even get the keys to a W-6 &quot;Manx&quot; which can go to orbit with 3 cargo containers. <br><br>If you are hardcore enough you should definitely check out this game. At the very least it should stir up your imagination.<br><br>Key Features<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Unique Game Engine \u2013 Explore this huge world in a first person, vehicle focused view.
