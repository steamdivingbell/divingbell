{"about_the_game":"Take a voyage to the outer space. Shoot a small comet through a colorful galaxy and use dark holes to warp you to the next level. Dodge asteroids and use planet gravitation, cosmic streams and other celestial bodies to influence the flight path of the comet. You need to estimate trajectory and force well to make it into the goal and unlock the next level. But don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll get as many tries as you need. The levels are designed in a clear comic style for a relaxed pastime.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1200300/extras/store-description-01.png?t=1582225218\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Journey through unknown galaxies</h2><br>On your journey there await you four different galaxies with different challenges.
