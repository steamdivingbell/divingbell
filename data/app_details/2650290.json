You play as a dragon hatchling who haven't learned how to use their little wings yet. But do not fret, as there may be other dragons in this world who can guide you, so you can grow to be as powerful as them!<br><br>Are you ready to prove yourself? Well, start <strong>climbing</strong>!</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Falling</strong></h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2650290/extras/Falling.gif?t=1738519014\" /><br><br>Dragon Hop is all about getting as high as you can get, to see all this world has to offer. Naturally, slipping, falling, and <strong>trying again</strong> plays a big part in that. Your journey will be hard, but there are ways for the keen-eyed and curious to make it easier.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Treasures</strong></h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2650290/extras/Treasure.gif?t=1738519014\" /><br><br>If you like exploring, in Dragon Hop you shall be greatly <strong>rewarded</strong>, as there are plenty of treasures scattered around the world, waiting for you to find them! Found a hidden door? There's likely a golden chest waiting on the other side. See a cave entrance? Time for spelunking!

Well, it's time to use them! Speak with your dragon guide to exchange crystals and learn new <strong>skills</strong> for your dragon. Gliding? No problem! Spitting fireballs? Bring on the heat! Flying? If you just believe, there shall be nothing stopping you from touching the sky!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Enemies</strong></h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2650290/extras/Spider.gif?t=1738519014\" /><br><br>While you may find those who guide your journey in Dragon Hop, there are also some <strong>creatures</strong> who would like to slow your hasty ascent. They are not here to completely ruin the fun... just to be a bit annoying. Nevertheless, you could find a great deal of satisfaction in sniping them off of platforms with a well aimed fireball! And who knows? Maybe it's treasure they were guarding after all.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Interactions</strong></h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2650290/extras/Rhino.gif?t=1738519014\" /><br><br>Having a hard time hopping?
