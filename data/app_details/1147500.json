{"about_the_game":"In this era, the word &quot;gay&quot; appears more and more in TV and movies. Compared with the past, the whole society seems to be more inclusive for the homosexuals. However, looking around, there are not so many homosexuals who are willing to confess their gay identity and come out to their families. Too many homosexuals don't seem to be accepted as we imagined. This lets us start asking ourselves, do we really understand them? How many difficulties in their lives are often overlooked by us? This game may help you to understand more about the homosexual group and to understand the problems and obstacles they encounter.<br />\r\nThe game allows players to experience the first-person perspective to a gay boy's life. As a protagonist, you have discovered from childhood that you don't like girls, and for the first time in adolescence, you start to fall in love with boys. Then you fled from the small county to the big city, while feeling that the gay community is accepted by more people, but when you return home, you still see the eyes that your loved ones don't understand. As you go deep into the open circle of homosexual relationships, marriage system, surrogacy, undisclosed homosexuality, fraudulent marriage, etc. You see too much content beyond your moral bottom line. Accepting or resisting makes you feel confused. The sense of identity with the self is also changing over time. In the end, will you choose to receive treatment, swindle to avoid stress, or spend a lifetime with someone you love?
