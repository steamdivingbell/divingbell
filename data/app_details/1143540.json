You are an old spare tire, destined for the junk yard. Until you decide you are worth more then that, and you want to feel the wind in your treads one last time. But now you can't stop, and there is no sign of slowing down. How far can you go before you run out of gas? Can you reach the ending? Is there even an ending?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1143540/extras/ER_Siders.png?t=1668708104\" /><br><br><strong>One Button Gameplay: </strong> The game uses a simple, one-touch system to play. Press the space bar, or click the mouse to jump and avoid obstacles. Travel as far as possible, collect coins, and avoid hazards such as stray dogs, hedges and bottomless pits. Because you are constantly in motion, you can't control the speed, only vertical movement.<br><br><strong>Procedural Track Generation:</strong> Algorithmic based track creation builds each course on the fly. Obstacles, ramps, coins and power-ups never spawn in the same position twice. You never really know for sure what might happen next.<br><br><strong>Steam Leaderboards:</strong> Climb the worldwide leader board to become the best that ever lived. Or just try to beat your own high score. Get as far as you can and deposit your gold to see where you stack up against the universe. Compete casually locally with Steam Cloud stats. Compete competitively worldwide on the Steam Leaderboards.<br><br><strong>Steam Achievements:</strong> 5 actually obtainable Steam achievements for achievement hunters. Veteran achievement hunters can bang out a perfect game in only a few sittings, but you will have to work for them.<br><br><strong>Free Soundtrack DLC:</strong> 20 synthesized electronic chip tune music tracks composed to simulate vintage arcade machines and old home computer technology.
