{"about_the_game":"A small &quot;horror&quot; narrative game about isolation and depression.<br><br><i>My Friend The Spider</i> is a 10-15 minute walking simulator where the player finds<br>themselves voluntarily locked in a room to escape and isolate due to their current emotional<br>state and befriending a spider that grows in size with the story's progression.<br><br>I originally worked on the game for a month and a half around October 2022. My idea was to experiment with the Unity engine in order to practice my coding and get used to the engine. I had a short story in mind based on personal experiences and thought it would be a good idea to flesh it out as a narrative &quot;game&quot; instead. Everything bar the art assets was done by me. My wife helped with the voice acting (and emotional support).<br><br>After releasing it, it got quite a few number of views and plays - seeing people's comments about how they were moved by it, I realized a Steam release was in order. I took my time, but after sitting down and fixing some nasty bugs and others (white text on a white background? Really dude?) I am now happy to release it on Steam and let it be free with a nice, deserved final update. <br><br>I hope you enjoy it. Take care.","achievements":{"total":0},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2743220/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1704418666","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2743220/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1704418666","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2743220/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1704418666","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2743220/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1704418666","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A small &quot;horror&quot; narrative game about isolation and depression.<br><br><i>My Friend The Spider</i> is a 10-15 minute walking simulator where the player finds<br>themselves voluntarily locked in a room to escape and isolate due to their current emotional<br>state and befriending a spider that grows in size with the story's progression.<br><br>I originally worked on the game for a month and a half around October 2022.
