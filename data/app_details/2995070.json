{"about_the_game":"You\u2019re a member of the Liminal Layer Society: an organization of spellcasters who protect the world from entities that leak from the Void. You set out to explore the \u201cLiminal Layer,\u201d which is the bridge between reality and the Void. <strong>YOU WILL DIE. A LOT.</strong> Death is progress.

They are the currency for your spells and portals to enter the next layer safely. Survival in each layer is determined by your \u201cDeath Counter\u201d and your ability to prevent liminal entities from touching you.
