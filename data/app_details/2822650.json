{"about_the_game":"<i>What a strange dream. I stood in a bloody field in front of a heart that pulsated while floating in the air.

The clear boundary no longer exists.</i><br><br>This sci-fi horror game challenges players to explore a mysterious space station and uncover the secrets of its tragic fate. Immerse yourself in an atmospheric narrative as you traverse the eerie corridors of the station and unravel the truth behind the enigma that shrouds this desolate outpost.<br><br>&quot;Primordial Genesis&quot; is a kinetic visual novel that explores themes such as isolation, the desire for immortality, and the origin of life.<br><br><strong>NOTE: This game features A.I. digital art. I'm aware that A.I. graphics often carry a certain stigma, which is why the price of the game will be minimal. Unfortunately, I'm currently unable to provide graphics created by human graphic designers, though I hope this will change in the future. By utilizing A.I. graphics in the game, I'll have more time to focus on the story, coding, and enhancing the game's atmosphere. If you enjoy sci-fi psychological horror, I hope you can overlook the use of A.I. digital art and still appreciate a story that attempts to explore the question of why people desire immortality and what immortality means for organisms like us.</strong><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2822650/extras/cistac.png?t=1728587024\" /><br><br>ABOUT THE GAME:<br>Gameplay: Kinetic visual novel<br>Theme: Body horror, Sci-fi, Horror, Existential crisis, Cosmic creatures<br>Languages: English, Serbian<br>Developed in: Game Maker Studio 2<br>Platform: Windows<br>Release date: TBA<br><br>FEATURES<br><br>Lore-rich world<br>Immersive atmosphere<br>Dark sci-fi story<br><br>PRESS KIT can be found on the game's official page.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2822650/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728587024","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2822650/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1728587024","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2822650/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728587024","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2822650/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728587024","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"This game contains graphics and subjects that may cause \r\ndiscomfort and are unsuitable for younger audiences."},"detailed_description":"<i>What a strange dream.
