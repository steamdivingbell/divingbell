{"about_the_game":"<strong>About this Game</strong><br>Pin City is a bowling game unlike any other bowling game you\u2019ve played before. We strove to bring the spirit of mini-golf into the world of bowling. We\u2019ve taken the standard bowling setup (straight lane, 10 pins, 1 ball) and expanded, transformed, and evolved it. We wanted to give people a chance to bowl in ways that would be impossible, illegal, or extremely impractical.<br><br><strong>Scoring / Structure</strong><br>At its core, Pin City is a bowling game. That means two throws per frame (three on the last frame), and standard spare and strike scoring apply. That being said, there may not always be the same amount of pins!<br><br><strong>Levels</strong><br>Pin City will have 50+ handcrafted levels spanning a wide range of mechanics to really challenge your bowling arm. The levels are 3 frames each, and are grouped into thematic chapters.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2345280/extras/Plinko.gif?t=1722209884\" /><br><br><strong>Mechanics</strong><br>The various mechanics we explore include (but are not limited to)<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Ramps &amp; topography!<br></li><li>Fire!<br></li><li>Gravity manipulation!<br></li><li>Hazards &amp; obstacles!<br></li><li>Absurdity!</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2345280/extras/SpikeWave.gif?t=1722209884\" /> <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2345280/extras/TargetLevel.gif?t=1722209884\" /><br><br><strong>Setting</strong><br>You might be familiar with Pin City already.

Outside is a cracked and peeling parking lot, watched over by a flickering and buzzing neon sign. When you enter, you\u2019re immediately greeted by the bright neon pattern of the carpet, and the oily aroma of fried food. There are outdated light fixtures above you, draping everything in a slightly yellow light. To your left is a rattling hum from the several aging vending machines.
