There are real-time characteristics that set this game apart though! Each battle starts off with a chance to encounter stronger or weaker enemies that will have a buff or de-buff on certain stats. The player will get an indication so it's important to keep an eye on the battle announcements at the top of the screen!<br>     Once you start your battle though you still have to stay on your toes! The enemy's willingness to fight back will increase or decrease. You will also notice an increase in power from time to time due to your latent powers awakening! During this short time, it's a good idea to take advantage of any moves that would benefit from it. <br>     Other moves that affect stats will be real-time as well. Damage over time or de-buffs on stats like strength can hinder your battle speed. So, you can either wait it out and risk the enemy running or try to use other moves that aren't affected by them.<br>     No matter which way you like to play though you'll be able to customize your characters to play the way you want.
