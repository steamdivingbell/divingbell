{"about_the_game":"The supporter edition is for players who want to support our small indie game studio MaFi Games and help us to continue and scale our work on Captain of Industry. This pack was created for our generous backers who pledged towards the development of the game before it was released here on Steam. We understand that many people missed this opportunity, so we decided to offer this upgrade for everyone. We are incredibly grateful for your continued support, and as a small &quot;thank you&quot; we've prepared a few exclusive items for you to enjoy!<br><br>Signed co-founders,<br>Marek and Filip<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tomb of Captains</h2>As time passes by, it becomes apparent that the island is not ruled by just a single Captain but by a generation of Captains. The Captains are so loved by their people that they decide to build them the Tomb of Captains, which serves as their final resting place (well, one of the Captains made the order to build it, but this is not in the official statement released by the Captain\u2019s office). This building is incredibly massive and no costs were spared on it. It\u2019s so lavish that it has to be built in 6 stages.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Crater map</h2>There are rumors that this crater was not formed naturally, but it is a long-abandoned uranium mine. While the uranium is gone, there are still many valuable resources left exposed. You will need to be extremely careful to not breach the outer perimeter otherwise the ocean will flood the entire crater!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Golden statue of maintenance</h2>You can upgrade the Statue of Maintenance to be made of gold! This truly shows your people that maintenance is something you deeply care about.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Settlement square with fountain</h2>You will be able to build a working fountain as part of your settlement!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Flowers</h2>Flowers are a new crop that can be grown on farms. You can use them to decorate the Tomb of Captains.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Journey of the game book (PDF)</h2>We have spent more than 6  years working on this game until the release on 31st of May 2022. This book will document our progress from humble prototypes in JavaScript, through endless iterations of different mechanics and features, all the way to the state the game is at now.<br><br>ATTENTION: This book is not finished, and this PDF is just a placeholder. Until now, we have been focused on delivering and polishing the game first. We will finish this book by the time COI is ready for a full release.
