If they are available, the player has a random probability in the line of sight of the enemy (holding a sniper rifle - 100%) to release a shuriken at the enemy during a shot from a weapon, while the shuriken takes half the damage from the weapon that you have in your hand. That is, if you fired with a sniper rifle, and the damage from it is 110, the shuriken will take damage 110/2 = 55.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1900230/extras/shuriken.gif?t=1729007123\" /><br><br>Also don't forget that you can throw grenades at different distances depending on how long you hold it in your hands.
