{"about_the_game":"&quot;The Amnesiac: Final Chapter&quot; is a narrative text game. The story takes place in a low-magic world reminiscent of the Middle Ages. In the silent darkness of a decaying baron's castle, lights flicker and a table is filled with sumptuous food. However, the atmosphere is eerily quiet, devoid of the usual sounds of merriment one would expect at a banquet. Instead, there lies the lifeless body of the baron on the cold floor, surrounded by a group of individuals who have just awakened from a stupor, but have lost their memories. Even as traces fade into the night, unable to be extinguished completely beneath the twilight, the truth will inevitably greet the dawn. As for you, you will become a wisp of a soul, embodying any one of them, and delve into their respective stories and secrets.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiple Character Role-Playing</h2></li></ul>Players can assume the role of any of the 10 amnesiacs, exploring their past and identity.
