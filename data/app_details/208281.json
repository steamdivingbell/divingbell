{"about_the_game":"The BR143 Add-On offers one of the most accurate and involving locomotive driving experiences currently available for Train Simulator.

As a result, the locomotive utilises a great many more controls than the majority of our locos, and most drivers will find that it is necessary to read the manual thoroughly and familiarise themselves with the controls and driving modes. As the driver, you are required to get the locomotive ready for work before starting out, including raising the pantograph and switching on the main power circuit. You then select the required driving mode, depending on what kind of service you will be running, then set off using one of two different speed control systems. All aspects of the locomotive\u2019s operation have been replicated with great attention to detail, giving all the capability and flexibility of a real BR143.
