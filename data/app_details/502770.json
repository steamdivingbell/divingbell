{"about_the_game":"Welcome to the Voodoo Garden! You're owner of a little hut in a bustling swamp. With the help of little spirits you can earn powers and gold by producing various voodoo supplies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Voodoo Garden you plant trees, shrubs and herbs in order to grow various fruits, leafs, mushrooms and more. By harvesting your plants and catching wild swamp animals you gather ingredients for your production of occult accessories. And you're not alone. Cute pets keep you company. Feed and raise them and you have the option to make a sacrifice and summon little helper spirits. There are many new plants, totems and animals to unlock, purchase and upgrade. Have fun expanding and improving your enchanting garden!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Crocodile","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/502770/0a4c881bdeca91a0693c7dd915e7cf0d04aff71b.jpg"},{"name":"Skull","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/502770/825aec5a2739d948f49461f1be681cd503098812.jpg"},{"name":"Beenest","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/502770/68d23076e92c47ed59fe5295867d7d4753c40204.jpg"},{"name":"Dragonflywing","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/502770/fce2be53dbb96ab7e0137fd3e833500c73b0ed69.jpg"},{"name":"Frogleg","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/502770/9fbe989e45b69be3cd73bb9c7b1985eb13854833.jpg"},{"name":"Lizardtail","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/502770/15d697a0a7a46c76258bf9fd9be6d28bb624cdd9.jpg"},{"name":"Mushroom","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/502770/3b1dc3d2af4893cac3f53fbdee5764add8022f0d.jpg"},{"name":"Root","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/502770/a2cc93390d9183b03b740174785ccece543de9ce.jpg"},{"name":"Snailhouse","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/502770/45cce0242f84e12d50596b2397366d541892fd51.jpg"},{"name":"Snaketooth","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/502770/c83502d1a9a7390ba6039720e0a38fe2a0566df2.jpg"}],"total":33},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/502770/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1669191153","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/502770/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1669191153","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/502770/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1669191153","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/502770/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1669191153","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to the Voodoo Garden!
