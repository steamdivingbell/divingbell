class=\"bb_paragraph\">Fate of Fire offers <strong>High Replayability</strong> with <strong>Two Game Modes</strong> and <strong>Three Level Difficulties</strong>.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The <strong>&quot;<u>Classic Mode</u>&quot;</strong> lets\u00a0 you enjoy the story and progress in the game unlocking new levels.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The <strong>&quot;<u>Runner Mode</u>&quot; </strong>can be enabled once a level is unlocked and it alters the game mechanics and adds a time limit for each level to push your speed to the limit.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">All your records are saved in <strong>The</strong> <strong>Kyvedy Trials,</strong> a book you'll find in the Prism's library.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As each level can be played as many times as you like, you can always challenge yourself to see if you can do better !</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p

<strong>&quot;Monster&quot;</strong>, <strong>&quot;Human&quot;</strong> and <strong>&quot;Feather&quot;</strong> are the three level difficulties. </p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Human is the<strong> standard</strong> difficulty.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Feather is aimed for a   more <strong>relaxed and chill</strong> playthrough. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Monster difficulty lets you face an harder version of the level and <strong><u>adds Handicaps</u></strong> to your run.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can change game mode and difficulty at will while in the world map to fine tune your experience or try different things. <br>\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p
