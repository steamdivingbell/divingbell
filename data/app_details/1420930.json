It\u2019s an automated approach that helps you create videos in no time. All you need to do is import your files and choose a theme. The program will create a presentation in the blink of an eye. You can also set the target video length and change the titles. Already have a favorite transition style? Create a custom theme and use it whenever you want.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1420930/extras/Start_with_the_Slideshow_Wizard.png?t=1703524761\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Give It the Perfect Look</h2>Try zooming in and out of pictures, use the fade-to-black effect, or make your slides roll over. Thanks to the upgraded Pan &amp; Zoom tool, you can now use several presets one by one. Use filters to sharpen details, reduce camera shake, and make your images brighter and more colorful. Use the Transition Wizard to join all clips at once and smooth out the flow of your presentation. You can make it even more dynamic by adding transitions to both main and supplementaryl tracks!  Another cool feature is object tracking: now you can choose scenes featuring your favorite characters and work with them only.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1420930/extras/Give_It_the_Perfect_Look.png?t=1703524761\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Audio enhancement</h2>Use new audio tools to optimize videos with poor audio quality. Choose the decibel level and get rid of any noises lower than that. Lower the difference between loud and soft noises. With audio effects, you can distort music and voice. But you can also save the original sound \u2014 for example, change audio speed without changing the tone. Sound visualizer will help you to eliminate noise jumps during the montage.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1420930/extras/\u0410\u0443\u0434\u0438\u043e\u044d\u0444\u0444\u0435\u043a\u0442\u044b_en.png?t=1703524761\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Try Hollywood-Style Directing</h2>Add a Hollywood touch to your visuals and throw in some special effects. Use Chroma Key to change the background and place your characters in completely different surroundings. Add dynamic elements with the Pan &amp; Zoom tool. Slow-motion will create suspense and have your viewers on the edge of their seats. If you want to cut out scenes with a particular character, try the Scene Detection.
