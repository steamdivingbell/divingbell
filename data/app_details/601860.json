{"about_the_game":"Based on a true story and the bestseller by Edith Bruck, Anita B., tells the story of an orphaned, young, Hungarian survivor of Auschwitz after World War II. Anita quickly finds herself involved in an intense and passionate affair that almost shatters her, but eventually gives her the strength to rebel and start a new life. Anita B., is a story of hope and reconciliation, and above all a promise of a new beginning. Anita goes to live her with her resentful aunt Monika, her husband Aron, their son Roby, and Aron\u2019s brother Eli after World War II has ended. In the town where her aunt lives, the former inhabitants have been forcibly ejected, their homes taken over by returning prisoners and refugees. There is an air of increasing tension, as the communists prepare to seize power. Anita struggles to find her place in this new world, as she is often silenced and put down by the people that surround her. After her initial isolation in her aunt\u2019s home while awaiting her papers, Anita emerges into the world hopeful, and desperately looking to make connections with her neighbors, her family, and her co-workers. Anita begins a relationship with Eli, with whom she falls deeply in love. Anita soon discovers that Eli is not the man she had hoped, and is faced with a life-altering and difficult decision. Anita B. is a story of hope, and a true testament of strength to the survivors of the Holocaust who were not only able to survive the atrocities of the war, but were able to dream of a better world.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/601860/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1552348540","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/601860/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1552348540","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/601860/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1552348540","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/601860/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1552348540","categories":[{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Native Steam Controller Support","id":33},{"description":"Captions available","id":13}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h1>Steam Video</h1><p>This content is only available in an online streaming format.
