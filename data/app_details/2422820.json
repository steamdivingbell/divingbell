{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Arcadia Issue 015 - April 2022</h2>  Welcome to ARCADIA! Inspired by old-school tabletop magazines, ARCADIA is MCDM's digital magazine for 5th edition GMs and players. We hope you like it! <br> <br><strong> Embrace the Flesh</strong> by Basheer Ghouse with art from Patrik Hell and Miska Fredman. Inspired by Carrion, Prototype, and Venom, the Way of the Flesh monastic tradition teaches a monk to shape their flesh into long-reaching tendrils that can grapple enemies and allow them to swing from rooftops. By recognizing that one's body is just a vessel for the soul, these monks can absorb their enemies' flesh to gain their appearance and memories. This article includes an NPC and a retainer stat block and an encounter with a monk of the flesh. <br> <br><strong> Nightmare Dragon</strong> by Alex Clippinger with art from Henrik Rosenborg and Faizal Fikri. Imagine living your worst nightmare ... and now picture the force that created that thing you fear. Nightmare dragons are progenitors of terror, feeding on the fright of victims whose dreams they twist nightly in the Astral Plane. This challenge rating 24 dragon comes with a stat block, lair actions, plot hooks, and plans. <br> <br><strong> What They Know May Hurt You</strong> by Marcello De Velazquez with art from Gustavo Pelissari. When it comes to learning the location of buried treasure, the secret weakness of a villain, the long-lost heir to the throne, or simply the next adventure, NPC informants are worth their weight in platinum. This article presents three new NPC informants ready to give your characters the information they need ... for a price! &quot;","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2422820/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1684244081","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2422820/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1684244081","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2422820/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1684244081","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2422820/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1684244081","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Arcadia Issue 015 - April 2022</h2>  Welcome to ARCADIA!
