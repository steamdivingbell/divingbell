Master your glyphs, unlock upgrades, and prioritize targets to unleash devastation on your foes and stay alive. How fast can your fingers fly?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Type to Shoot</h2><br>Type the word above an enemy's name to fire your main weapon at it. It's as simple as that. All other acquired weapons are triggered by that same action, so you have to pick which enemy to fire at carefully.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2415020/extras/desc01.gif?t=1716877663\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Endless Upgrade Combinations</h2><br>Between random loot and level up upgrades, there are hundreds of combinations for you to explore.
