Roll and control your Glizzy on a path to eat all the humans you meat (pardon the pun).  The more you devour, the bigger you get, so slam your meat - and grow in size.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Avoiding the Dogs</strong></h2>With GlizzPoints on hand, keep them safe from those ever-hungry dogs on the prowl.  Although they may look harmless, those speedy mongrels will do anything to get your meat!  Be sure to swing by a BBQ to deposit your GlizzPoints, or you will be lunch!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>104.7 GlizzRadio</strong></h2>Enjoy the soothing sounds of a custom radio station with a song for every taste.  Radio personality Danny Blanco will spin up the freshest hits from Epidemic Sound while you roll your way through a variety of environments.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Skill Tree</strong></h2>What do you do if you want to get stronger?  You go to the gym.  What do you do if you want to get smarter?  You go to school.  So what do you do to become your best Glizzy?  Spend your GlizzPoints in the Skill Tree!  Become faster, get stronger, or even control human minds - all for a few GlizzPoints.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Achievements</strong></h2>Want to feel a false sense of accomplishment?  Complete menial tasks and get that dopamine rush when you see &quot;100% Complete&quot;!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Different Environments</strong></h2>With two playable maps (Town and Old West) and even more to come, you can change up your scenery as you complete your tasks.
