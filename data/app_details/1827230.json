{"about_the_game":"Discover Black Ink, the GPU-based painting application that redefines artistic creativity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLeave behind pens, papers, and traditional techniques to embrace an entirely computer-based, generative approach to creation. Whether you're an experienced artist or a first-time digital painter, Black Ink offers a world of possibilities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBlack Ink empowers you to transform your brushes into extensions of your creativity. Modify them at will, from realistic brushes to the most imaginative ones, and share your creations with others for endless possibilities. The unique node-based system allows you to easily define brush behavior and experiment with advanced configurations without constraints and for those with advanced skills, you can even program your own brushes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith its intuitive interface and node-based layer editor, you can create without limits in a non-destructive manner. While it may seem confusing at first, you'll quickly adapt to this innovative way of working.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, thanks to Black Ink's GPU technology, pixels are no longer a concern. Create in high definition, whether it's 4K, 10K, or even 64K, without any loss of performance on real bitmap documents. The only limit is your imagination.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n..................................................................................................................................................................................................<br />\r\nKey Features<br />\r\n..................................................................................................................................................................................................<br />\r\nGPU rendering technology offering unprecedented speed with full bitmap high resolutions documents (4K, 10k up to 64K)<br />\r\nNon-realistic brushes for generative computer based creation<br />\r\nPowerful node-based brush customization tool<br />\r\nBrush Shader Language<br />\r\nUnique and intuitive user interface<br />\r\nNode-based layer editor","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1827230/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1709887530","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1827230/page.bg.jpg?t=1709887530","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1827230/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1709887530","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1827230/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1709887530","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Discover Black Ink, the GPU-based painting application that redefines artistic creativity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLeave behind pens, papers, and traditional techniques to embrace an entirely computer-based, generative approach to creation.
