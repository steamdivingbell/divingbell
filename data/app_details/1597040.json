The player is trapped in a massive underground facility, Sierra, located in a remote location in Alaska. The player must use their head to find clues and solve puzzles to escape the facility.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MULTI ENDINGS</h2>The game features several massive maps that the player can play in any way they want. Their decisions will decide the ending of the game. Once the player escapes the depths of Sierra, they are faced with the sprawling landscape that is, the Great Sitkin Island. The main story campaign will be a solid length of around 6 to 10 hours of gameplay depending on your skill level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">POWER TRIP</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1597040/extras/Action.gif?t=1708706585\" /><br>Experience a massive arsenal of weapons as you plow through a huge library of enemies. The game features a wide range of weapons that are not just traditional firearms, your standard FPS arsenal of Shotguns and rifles, but also weapons of science fiction! Weapons that can warp physics and crush your enemies' bones in seconds! The game runs on the power of the Unreal Engine, enabling crazy particle effects and physics as well as difficult enemy squad AI that tries to flank the player and calls for reinforcements as the situation dynamically calls for it. Enemy dinosaurs will use all their sense to track the player as well. A Velociraptor on the other side of the base is there...hunting you...always coming.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CHALLENGING ENEMIES</h2>The game enemies also span into our Homosapien brothers. The enemy soldiers will call for reinforcements, radio ahead to comrades on the other side of the map to prep for the player, talk to each other, provide covering fire, flank manoeuvers, can spot dead comrades, watch and listen for the player to make sounds, and even spot the player clicking on their flashlight. These guys are tough but the player can cut them down with fun weapons like the black hole gun!<br><br>The Dinosaur AI is likewise very aggressive. Velociraptors have incredible eyesight and can hear every move you make. They tend to travel in pairs and love to perform flanking maneuvers as well. Raptors, however, are not the only baddies you will encounter. But you will have to play to find out!<br><br>Players are encouraged to record, make twitch, or youtube videos about Fossilfuel. <i>Make sure you link to the game if you do so.</i><br><br>A FREE Demo featuring the terrifying introduction level is also on the Steam store.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">For Speedrunners and completionists</h2>Fossilfuel features a wide range of achievements.
