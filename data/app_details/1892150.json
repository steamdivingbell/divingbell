{"about_the_game":"Are you looking for some pixelated animations to integrate with your fancy retro styled graphics? Then this pack can solve your problem with a blink of an eye (and a few copy / pastes too)!! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith a selection of physical, magical, and status-changing animations, this pack covers plenty of possible skills! Common magic attacks like fire, water, earth, darkness, and light all have 3 different animations so that you can give more powerful spells fitting animations. Give your weaker wind skill a simple swirl of green magic and save the twisting tornado animation for your powerful whirlwind spell. You don\u2019t have to give only your mages some new animations though, since this pack includes weapon slashing, piercing, and hitting animations perfect for warriors. Each physical attack also has fire, ice, and thunder variations, so your magic swordsman can make the most out of both the magical and physical animations!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeyond the animation sheets, this pack also includes the animation data for VX Ace and MV so you can drop them right into your game to save yourself some time while setting them up.
