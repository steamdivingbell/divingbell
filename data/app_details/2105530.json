There are offensive, defensive and special energies, and when you collect enough of one type, its level increases and you can choose from three improvements associated with that energy. Some of the improvements are passive and increase, for example, your maximum health or your material yield, while others change the attacks or movements you can carry out.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> </h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2105530/extras/Section_Middle.png?t=1733692470\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New and Old Acquaintances</h2>During your excursions into the dungeon you will also meet other people from time to time which you can take back to your village.
