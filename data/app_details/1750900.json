{"about_the_game":"Put your creativity to the test in the <strong>frenetic, sandbox combat</strong>. Do whatever it takes to win against equally capable opponents, in levels that are different every time. Between each fight, choose from a random selection of techniques to<strong> perfect your style</strong>. You\u2019ll be <strong>breaking everything you touch</strong>, either by hitting someone with it or by hitting <i>it</i> with <i>someone</i>.<br><br>Similar to the style of <strong>classic beat \u2018em ups</strong> like Streets of Rage or River City Ransom, but with the unpredictable and highly replayable design of <strong>modern roguelites</strong> like Spelunky and Nuclear Throne. Combine all that with the slapstick improvisation of a Jackie Chan movie, and you got a beat 'em up with <strong>endless possibilities</strong>.<br><br><strong><u>Features</u></strong><br><strong>Everything is a weapon</strong> - From beanbag chairs to ping-pong paddles, mop buckets to candy boxes, everything can be swung, thrown, kicked, and used in creative ways to defeat your opponents. No magic, no guns, no swords, no killing. You\u2019ll have to take advantage of everyday objects around you just to stand a chance against the relentless opponents.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1750900/extras/kick_throw_hit_HQ.gif?t=1637809930\" /><br><i>It's up to you to decide how to use the objects you find.

No boring stat boosts, these upgrades change the way your moves work or introduce entirely new ones for you to master.
