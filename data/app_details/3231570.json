{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Years after societal destruction, the resistance has begun removing bombs that have been places throughout the world. Gear up as a bombseeker and take on the responsibility of making the roads between towns safe once more.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Bombseeker, you take the role of a new resistance recruit who is assigned to be the Bombseeker in a town called Alanther. After a quick six level tutorial, you will be able to begin assisting the citizens of Alanther by clearing the paths to neighboring cities of bombs. This will be done by marking bombs that you come across. For each bomb that you mark, you will receive payment of one coin as well as one coin for finding a safe path to travel. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each level presents you with a challenge inspired by the game Minesweeper, which tiles shedding light on how many bombs are nearby. There are 11 static levels spread across 2 campaigns. If the static levels are your style, then you can enjoy randomized maps that will still add to your total coin count. </p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3231570/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736999593","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3231570/page.bg.jpg?t=1736999593","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3231570/25b79a556307fac1e58b9949cc19d558313d985d/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736999593","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3231570/25b79a556307fac1e58b9949cc19d558313d985d/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736999593","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Years after societal destruction, the resistance has begun removing bombs that have been places throughout the world.
