{"about_the_game":"Our first-ever release!! <i>Astroblaster</i> is a retro-style top down, single player, space shooter. Your mission is simple: Clear away the asteroid belt and the space pirates that have been using it for a hideaway. Asteroids contain weapons that can help. Pirate ships leave behind vital raw material that can be used to produce a steadier supply of munitions. You also need to rescue astronauts who've been left adrift in space after pirate attacks. They can build weapons from the raw material.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Rescuer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2058250/fbf1225e02f15fa40e4a62df6a3d8eb79ed4830a.jpg"},{"name":"Lifeguard","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2058250/1061457e11756d1492f55db889f89f872553d98d.jpg"},{"name":"Hero","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2058250/930a238defe8746f2c2e18b591ff740b894f90e4.jpg"},{"name":"Marksman","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2058250/370d2d2c144454452afb78fb11845fb6dbbcb1e8.jpg"},{"name":"Sharpshooter","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2058250/e8cff38570df31770228c89a0e3a4f48b18f709f.jpg"},{"name":"Expert","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2058250/d5d070adb0f666fdad566ff7979e6f25e908296d.jpg"},{"name":"Elite","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2058250/00675740858888b25174ba62e7149629d3ccb93c.jpg"},{"name":"Scavenger","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2058250/67d8f8061c74eef1a33a9e9b87e4a516b651896d.jpg"},{"name":"Tracker","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2058250/3ff17c77e67866d5fc10d3887bda70ca6da9188a.jpg"},{"name":"Bounty Hunter Third Class","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2058250/64f66db2682d0c05a440efb69248bc41aecda855.jpg"}],"total":12},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2058250/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1657519171","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2058250/page.bg.jpg?t=1657519171","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2058250/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1657519171","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2058250/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1657519171","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Our first-ever release!! <i>Astroblaster</i> is a retro-style top down, single player, space shooter.
