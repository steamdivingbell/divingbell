Now, he haunts the realm with a terrifying blend of humour and horror, yearning for the laughter he once inspired\u2014only to be met with screams. Unleash the madness with three unique abilities that define Morgus\u2019s erratic and deadly playstyle. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Banana Bar (Passive)</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Track Morgus\u2019s emotional state with the Banana Bar, which influences his behaviour and speed. Morgus starts off sad and slow, but as he collects bananas around the Ritual Site<strong>,</strong> his mood and pace gradually improve, his mood and pace gradually improve. Being dazed will reset the Banana Bar, and once it hits 100%, Morgus reaches his peak of wild unpredictability. Additionally, he can contort himself to slip through cracks, further amplifying his erratic nature. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Go Bananas!</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When the Banana Bar hits 100% unleash a spree of chaos, with increased speed, strength and resistance to light. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Hysterical</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Grip your victim, unleashing a relentless laugh that drains their Sanity and inflicts terror, leading to their eventual death. Morgus\u2019s obliviousness to his strength makes his playful grip lethal. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Jack-in-the-box</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Deploy a Jack-in-the-box trap. Upon activation, it delivers a shocking scare, draining Sanity, slowing the victim, and marking them for the Infected. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3238110/extras/Phantom.png?t=1727949438\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Curse: The Phantom</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When banished by vote, instead of being eliminated, the Phantom\u2019s passive activates, turning them into a Menace.
