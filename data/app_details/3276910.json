{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Story and Atmosphere</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Eye: The Journey</strong> continues the mysterious world introduced in <strong>Sqube: The Beginning</strong>. In this game, some of the unanswered questions from the past will be addressed, while new mysteries and puzzles await the player. Our main character finds themselves in a more complex and dangerous environment, striving to uncover their origins and what lies ahead. As the player progresses, more about the world will be revealed, but the story will maintain its air of mystery until the very end. The narrative is not told through dialogue, but rather through the atmosphere and environment, allowing players to immerse themselves fully in the discovery process.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3276910/extras/0.gif?t=1736424859\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Gameplay</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Built upon classic bouncing ball mechanics, <strong>Eye: The Journey</strong> offers a unique platforming experience. Players control a bouncing ball, navigating through platforms and interacting with the environment. In certain stages, the ball can use lasers to move objects or gain new abilities, such as breaking walls to access previously unreachable areas. Each new power enables the player to solve different puzzles and advance in the game. As the game progresses, the puzzles become increasingly complex, testing the player's intelligence and strategy through creative mechanics.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3276910/extras/1.gif?t=1736424859\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Design</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Set in a 3D side-scroll format, <strong>Eye: The Journey</strong> presents a world rich in depth and detail. While the game utilizes 3D models, the gameplay unfolds from a side perspective, focusing on platform elements while still allowing players to explore a vast world. Each level features its own unique color palette, creating distinct atmospheres\u2014from dark and ominous environments to vibrant neon-lit sections. The original and creative level designs break away from traditional platform games, offering players a fresh and engaging experience at every turn.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3276910/extras/2.gif?t=1736424859\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Control</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The controls are kept simple yet fluid; players control a single bouncing ball, but this simplicity doesn't diminish the depth of gameplay. With intuitive mechanics such as jumping, using lasers, and solving puzzles with newly acquired abilities, players are fully drawn into the experience. The controls are responsive and precise, offering players a sense of full control, making the puzzle-solving aspect all the more satisfying.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3276910/extras/3.gif?t=1736424859\" /></p>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3276910?t=1736424859","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3276910/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1736424859","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3276910/c2ea51e19957fbbc2ae630ce206a0c01287855e2/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736424859","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3276910/c2ea51e19957fbbc2ae630ce206a0c01287855e2/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736424859","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Story and Atmosphere</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Eye: The Journey</strong> continues the mysterious world introduced in <strong>Sqube: The Beginning</strong>.
