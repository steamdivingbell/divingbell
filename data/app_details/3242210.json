{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A store management game that supports AFK. In the game, you will play the role of a new store owner and deal with various customers. In this process, you will understand these customers, know their preferences, and know what products to place on the shelves that can bring you more profits. Of course, you can decide for yourself what goods to place on the shelves. You can open a grocery store, butcher shop, fish shop, or clothing store. Different products have different enthusiasts.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The role you play is a new store owner who does not yet possess the abilities of a mature store owner. As the game progresses, you will be able to determine the direction of your character's growth, such as being able to observe the money carried by customers (which cannot be viewed at the beginning of the game), adding popularity to your store or increasing prices for products without citing negative reactions from customers, and meeting more friends.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can also find friends for the shop owner you play in the game, who can help with your business. You may meet a new supplier and become friends with them, so that you can purchase unique products. Some friends can help you develop yourself and make the role you play become an excellent shop owner faster. Some friends can also inform you of upcoming events, allowing you to anticipate market changes in advance.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Every time you start a new game, it's a new experience because the proportion of customers near you changes every time. After observing the sales of products, you may be able to analyze which products are the right choice to sell at the moment. Excellent friends are rare, and the friends you can make every time you play may not be the same. This is your small shop, where you can completely decide on the business model of your shop, whether to sell small profits with high turnover (selling a large number of low profit goods), to eat for a year (selling rare items in small quantities to earn a lot of profit), or to only sell the goods you like.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is a casual game (at least that's the original intention of my development), where you don't have to spend a lot of time managing this small shop. Of course, spending a certain amount of time on management will help the small shop develop. What I mean is, no matter what, the business of the small shop will always make progress. I hope this game can become an entertainment where you don't have to spend a lot of energy. Watching your own small shop little by little should be a happy thing (at least in my opinion). This is also the reason why I believe this game can be presented.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3242210/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727495385","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3242210/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1727495385","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3242210/89528b7bb1c0ec9e688f3d30a64787843f7b2e03/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727495385","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3242210/89528b7bb1c0ec9e688f3d30a64787843f7b2e03/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727495385","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A store management game that supports AFK.
