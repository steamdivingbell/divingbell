There are four directions and climates: the cold tundra in the North, the forests in the West, the desert in the South and the wetland in the East; each with their own land types and points of interest for you to interact with.

Being entirely text-based, the game is open to your imagination, and while other graphical games need to visually represent rules and mechanics, RoH often summarises several aspects of city-builders and strategy games into more abstract concepts. For instance, all resources both represent your moral choices <i>and</i> your ability to construct buildings. For instance, increasing your Health (one of the resources) allows you to better respond to the health-related events that can happen at each turn; and it also allows you to recruit unique disciples, and to construct buildings such as a Farm or a Quarry. A shortage of Health has consequences, as well as an excess of Cruelty or Vanity (two other resources).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3273130/extras/production.png?t=1737305455\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Production works via an input / output flowing system.
