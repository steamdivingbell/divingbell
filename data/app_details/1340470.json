Life is Beautiful!</strong> while I was going through one of the roughest periods of my life and perhaps I\u2019m still here precisely because of this game. I never aim to bring you down, I just want to tell you a story about something that may affect everyone. That nearly happened to me, and may you never be that close to the edge. I don\u2019t really hope to save someone or to make any global impact, but I do hope that you will simply enjoy my game and maybe learn something for you.<br><br>Suicide is one of the most common causes of death worldwide. If you or someone you know is depressed and/or suffers from suicidal thoughts, the best thing to do is to seek professional help. In such a situation, even the closest people (who do not have the proper training/preparation may - and often will - only make things worse). There are signals that can let you know that your friend or relative is in a crisis and needs help. I hope that maybe <strong>Wait! Life is Beautiful!</strong> will remind you to be attentive to your loved ones. Even if they seem doing perfectly fine, they may be going through rough times.</i></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>The process of playing <strong>Wait!
