Click on as many as you can, and then confront the deity in purrgatory for a final battle.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Why does this game even exist?</h2>Cat Clicker is a game I blatantly threw together out of stock images and poorly written gamemaker code. I made this game initially in order to see how well a game put on steam for one dollar would sell, and eventually fell in love with the terrible-ness of it at some point in development. I personally think it's fully worth the money, especially if you like weird, terrible, or trashy games. The game can probably be beaten in 15 minutes, so it isn't likely to overstay its welcome or get annoying.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1746970/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1637778384","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1746970/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1637778384","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1746970/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1637778384","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1746970/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1637778384","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Time for Clicking Cats is Nigh!</h2><br><i>One Cursor.<br>Six Levels.<br>Multiple Cats.</i><br><br>&quot;Cat Clicker really makes you <i>feel</i> like someone who clicks on pixelated stock images of cats&quot; - someone<br><br>Cat Clicker is an Arcade-ey, On-Rails-Shooter-ey, Stock image-ey game about clicking on cats.
