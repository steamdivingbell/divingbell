{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tomomi: Demo</h2><br>After moving away from his home town to enrol in a special university, Haru is completely alone for the first time in his life. His family are all back home and he has no friends in this strange village in the middle of nowhere. Independence is what he wanted and he's sure as heck going to get it here. Not long after settling in he has an encounter with a strange girl with some unusual quirks. He wants to get to know her, partly out of boredom and partly because she was cute, but how does he approach a girl who seemingly has no interest in him, or anything else around her, for that matter?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">In this demo</h2><br>Play through the first couple scenes of Tomomi as Haru Takamoto tries to adjust to life in this quiet coastal village.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1251260/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1639640960","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1251260/page.bg.jpg?t=1639640960","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1251260/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1639640960","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1251260/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1639640960","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tomomi: Demo</h2><br>After moving away from his home town to enrol in a special university, Haru is completely alone for the first time in his life.
