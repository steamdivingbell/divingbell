{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Overview:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Synchronous</strong> is a 2D puzzle platformer game based around metal boxes that move synchronously. Different boxes have unique abilities. However, each metal box possesses a <strong>magnet</strong> that enables it to remain on any metal surface on command. (This is the main mechanic of the game.) </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Content:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game contains <strong>49 meticulously crafted puzzle levels</strong> divided into <strong>five chapters</strong>, each featuring numerous gizmos and gadgets that must be navigated and utilized to reach the goal. Each level also contains an elusive collectible to reward creative thinkers. Some levels test primarily platforming skills, while others are solely puzzle-based. In the platforming levels, when one box is destroyed, the level must be restarted. This is not the case for the puzzle levels.
