{"about_the_game":"&quot;Pathfinder 2 RPG - Sky King's Tomb AP 2: Cult of the Cave Worm<br> <br> Finding a legendary tomb requires tracking an equally legendary cave worm said to dwell there. As the adventurers set out from Highhelm, they must brave the Darklands' dangers, navigate a treacherous fey city, and recover the relic that retraces the cave worm's path. Yet in doing so, they learn of nefarious rivals who also seek the tomb--rivals the adventurers might stop by infiltrating an unforgiving underground metropolis. <br> <br> Cult of the Cave Worm is a Pathfinder adventure for four 5th-level characters, continuing the Sky King's Tomb Adventure Path, a three-part monthly campaign in which a group of adventurers travel deep underground to discover a legendary dwarven king's tomb, seek subterranean treasures, and heal millennia-old injustices--all while stopping an ambitious villain from weaponizing those same discoveries. This adventure also includes a study of cave worm ecology, a gazetteer of the underground dwarven city of Hagegraf, potent relics, and several monsters to threaten underground explorers. <br> This product is not a PDF or accessible outside of Fantasy Grounds.
