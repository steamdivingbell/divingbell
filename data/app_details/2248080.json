{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Mini-Dungeons Bundle #196-200</h2>  Mini-Dungeons are short, setting-agnostic adventures for 5th Edition which can be easily inserted anywhere in your campaign. <br> This bundle contains five such adventures for use with Fantasy Grounds Unity (line of sight included). <br> <br> <strong> MINI-DUNGEON #196: TIANA'S ENSORCELLED SORROW</strong> <br> <br> <br>  4-6 characters of level 2 <br> <br> Some ruins bewilder, others inspire awe, but for Tiana they just cause sorrow. <br> On her last day alive she witnessed the walls of her home crumble, her father buried. Men and women set to protect her home bled out around her. Vernye, her loving dog, was buried beneath debris. Then: the red gleam of her blood on a blade. <br> The recently established village of Khorol lies close to the site of this tragedy and the new residents quickly discovered the haunting. Yet, trade with the north was the sole reason for settling here, travel at night unavoidable--a small bridge was set in place, everyone hoping for the best. <br> A vicious storm befalls the party on the anniversary of the massacre, just as they stumble into the small village looking for shelter. What they discover is panic. A lone trader, bleeding and close to death, tells of the bridge being washed out and mentions two children trapped on the ruins' side, sheltered inside by a panicked guard. The locals agree that the kids are doomed. Galyna, the town's matron, begs the party to attempt a rescue, offering a reward alongside free room and board for a week. <br> <br> <strong> MINI-DUNGEON #197: DEAD FLOOD OF DWFN-EIR-GRON</strong> <br> <br> <br>  4-5 characters of levels 7-8 <br> <br> When a sacred dweorg festival is raided by the drow, with hundreds slain and even more enslaved, abducted, and turned into undead servitors, a deity weeps. When the divine tear becomes a flood that puts to rest the undead, the party has the chance to follow the legion of living dead on sturdy dwarven kayaks through the caverns, riding the <br><strong> Dead Flood of Dwfn Eir-Gron</strong> . <br> The undead and their drow masters are stranded, briefly, but can the party prevail against a sheer endless legion of the living dead, punish the drow and rescue the few hardy survivors that remain? <br> <br> <strong> MINI-DUNGEON #198: STORMLORD'S REST</strong> <br> <br> <br>  4-5 characters of level 2 <br> <br> Plenty are the colorful and grandiose epithets used by warlords and powerful leaders, though the man once known as &quot;Stormlord&quot; chose a more apt one than most: obsessed with lightning and engineering, ostensibly blessed by the storm winds, the realms breathed a collective sigh of relief when he finally fell in battle. His humble final resting place, though, has continued to baffle would-be tomb robbers. <br> Can the party succeed where others have failed, or will their lightning-charred bodies join the ancient warlord in the Stormlord's Rest? <br> <br> <strong> MINI-DUNGEON #199: FORGED IN HELLFIRE</strong> <br> <br> <br>  4-5 characters of level 6-7 <br> <br> The implements of war required for any serious campaign of subjugation and conquest are plentiful indeed, and maintaining a steady supply of weaponry is of tantamount importance. So far, the Dread Tyrant's armies have excelled in their inexorable march towards total dominance, crushing any resistance with an iron fist. <br> This is about to change. <br> The Dread Tyrant's adversaries have managed to pinpoint to location of one of his most vital garrisons, a forge that provides a significant amount of weapons to his war effort. Going deep undercover behind enemy lines, it is up to the party to disrupt the Dread Tyrant's supply chain and end the ceaseless production of weapons Forged in Hellfire! <br> <br> <strong> MINI-DUNGEON #200: FORGED IN HELLFIRE</strong> <br> <br> <br>  3-4 characters levels 1-2 <br> <br> The Great Artificer Mage, Aliza N'thuziel, famed and feared far and wide, is missing. <br> In fact, she has been missing for years. <br> At this point, the consensus among her fellow magicademics is that she at least isn't on this plane of existence. Her various workshops strewn across the Material Plane are guarded by construct servants and loyal familiars. Her northernmost workshop, disguised as a cabin from the prying eyes of her rivals, while her least favorite, still has its fair share of guardians to keep its secrets safe from thieves and adversaries. <br> The party might have come across N'thuziel's cabin while seeking shelter on a snowy forest path, another mage could have asked them to steal the important research, or they may be after the secrets for themselves. <br>  &quot;","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2248080/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1672755235","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2248080/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1672755235","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2248080/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1672755235","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2248080/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1672755235","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Mini-Dungeons Bundle #196-200</h2>  Mini-Dungeons are short, setting-agnostic adventures for 5th Edition which can be easily inserted anywhere in your campaign. <br> This bundle contains five such adventures for use with Fantasy Grounds Unity (line of sight included). <br> <br> <strong> MINI-DUNGEON #196: TIANA'S ENSORCELLED SORROW</strong> <br> <br> <br>  4-6 characters of level 2 <br> <br> Some ruins bewilder, others inspire awe, but for Tiana they just cause sorrow. <br> On her last day alive she witnessed the walls of her home crumble, her father buried.
