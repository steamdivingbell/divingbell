A piece of drum-loaded mobile artillery that brings pump-and-thump action to your table and explosive mayhem to the next. Add our Millionaire\u2019s Bacon for a sweet and salty maple treat. When you\u2019re so hungry you feel you could rip a skulldozer in half with your teeth, we suggest ordering the 12G \u2018Steakout\u2019 shotgun. Lovingly crafted from organic polymers, layered with locally sourced stainless-steel, the \u2018Steakout\u2019 brings the sharp kick you want.
