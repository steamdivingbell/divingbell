{"about_the_game":"<strong>Nemesis: Siege of Dunkirk</strong> centers on a long-running operation, far behind the front, that began in September 1944 but only finished after World War II. The remarkable Allied siege of Axis-held Dunkirk on the French coast of the English Channel. <br><br>The latest <strong>Steel Division 2</strong> mini-expansion pits the hardened and ever-raiding  <strong>Festung Dunkirchen</strong> garrison against the Allied armored battlegroup <strong>CIABG</strong> made up of Czecholosovakian troops and Free French soldiers. <br><br><strong>Nemesis: Siege of Dunkirk</strong> is a community-voted DLC offering two brand-new battlegroups meticulously researched and expertly modeled. A host of unique new units, with new skins, accurate voice lines and weapon loadouts, await to be commanded in solo, coop, or multiplayer.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Festung Dunkirchen</strong></h2>Tasked with holding on to the critical port of Dunkirk, <strong>Festung Dunkirchen</strong> kept up the fight until the war\u2019s end. Unlike similarly surrounded formations, the motley battlegroup kept up high morale and aggressivity, allowing commanders to deploy elite <strong>Stosstruppen</strong> and <strong>Jagdkampf</strong> raiders. The true strength of the division lies in its powerful artillery, support, and AA units, from Soviet-made <strong>Flak 31(r) 88mm</strong> to emplaced aircraft guns <strong>Erdkampflafette 43</strong> and captured French <strong> K 419(f) 155mm</strong> guns. <strong>Festung Dunkirchen</strong> excels in defensive combat.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>CIABG</strong></h2>The <i>Czechoslovak Independent Armoured Brigade Group</i> (<strong>CIABG</strong>) was formed from Czechoslovakian troops who got their first taste of combat at Dunkirk in 1944. Augmented by British, Canadian, and Free French units, including <strong>FFO Fusiliers-Marins</strong> assault scouts, the <strong>CIABG</strong> can call on a wide array of armored vehicles, from the new recon <strong>Humber LRC Mk. III</strong> to the <strong>Cromwell VII</strong> and uparmored <strong>Cromwell VIII</strong>. Strong artillery and AA forces, even siege guns, such as the  <strong>BL 7,2-inch 182,9mm</strong>, can be deployed. The <strong>CIABG</strong> can field an impressive array of armor on the battlefield.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Main Features</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Command two unique battlegroups in solo, skirmish or online multiplayer: the besieged but resolute forces of <strong>Festung Dunkirchen</strong> or the tank-supported Czechoslovakian <strong>CIABG</strong>. <br></li><li>Discover dozens of new units, from Kriegsmarine recon <strong>KM Jagdkommando</strong> and <strong>Festung Grenadiers</strong> to captured <strong>Flak 28(p) 40mm</strong>.
