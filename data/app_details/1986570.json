Meet the 43 M. Toldi III, a Tier III Premium German light tank that comes with the DLC \u201cStealthy Threat\u201d! <br><br><strong>Concealment and Speed:</strong> This vehicle is among the top-5 stealthiest Tier III light tanks, with excellent stationary and moving camo values. This will allow you to remain invisible to the enemy vehicles while revealing their positions to your allies, as well as to perform sudden surprise attacks on the unsuspecting opponents. This is where vehicle\u2019s good maneuverability comes in handy: even though the top speed is quite average for a light tank of its tier, you are still able to perform dynamic plays for flank attacks or circling more cumbersome enemy tanks.<br><br><strong>Firepower:</strong> The 43 M. Toldi III gun penetration values of 64/80/20mm are decent for a light tank, and its ammo rack holds 150 shells, meaning that even in prolonged battles you don\u2019t have to worry about running out of ammunition. However, the tank does not boast a high DPM and therefore is bound to play a support role in the battle, using its great camo rating for passive spotting and helping allies to finish off the opponents.<br><br><strong>Protection:</strong> Keep in mind that the 43 M. Toldi III is a light tank, and just like most light tanks it has a rather mediocre armor and an average HP pool of 410 HP, so try to stay stealthy and avoid enemy shots.  <br><br>This package also includes 3 days of WoT Premium account, that will help you to progress faster in the game by providing a variety of extra bonuses, such as more Credits and XP earned in battles, applicable modifier to XP, Premium missions, one more slot for excluded maps and more. <br><br><strong>DLC can be added to your World of Tanks account only once.<br>You\u00a0will\u00a0be\u00a0able\u00a0to\u00a0use\u00a0this\u00a0DLC\u00a0only\u00a0if\u00a0you\u00a0play\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0game\u00a0account\u00a0created\u00a0on\u00a0Steam.</strong>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1986570/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1718804711","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1986570/page.bg.jpg?t=1718804711","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1986570/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718804711","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1986570/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718804711","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">This Bundle Contains:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Tier III Premium German 43 M.
