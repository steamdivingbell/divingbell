{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The story takes place in the future Chaoge City, a metropolis full of modern atmosphere. Players will create unique characters from scratch by customizing character panels. The game uses a random birth point mechanism to make each new game experience full of unknowns. Before the Cataclysm arrives, players have the opportunity to gain insight into every corner of the city and possibly even anticipate certain upcoming events, using this information to change the future. As the story progresses, the player will be faced with a series of choices, and each decision will affect what happens next.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When the cataclysm really hit, Chaoge City suddenly became a dead city. Players will need to use their wits and courage to escape the zombie horde while searching for food, water, and weapons. The game has a variety of social elements, players can form friendly relationships with other NPCS, or join different groups to fight together against external threats. In addition, players can explore abandoned buildings, discover valuable supplies, and even build their own base in the ruins.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The most exciting part is the introduction of the &quot;infinite fantasy&quot; space. It is a mysterious realm of endless possibilities, which players can enter by completing certain tasks. In Infinity Fantasy, players will experience countless parallel world challenges, and each success will bring powerful rewards, allowing players to improve significantly in the real world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As the story progresses, players will face more severe tests, including Zerg, mechanical and more powerful zombie attacks. In this series of crises, players must not only protect themselves, but also lead the survivors against external threats. Eventually, in desperation, players acquire a mysterious treasure that has the power to turn the tide. Through this treasure, the player leads the human soul through time and space, back to the world before the apocalypse. However, this rebirth is not a simple repetition, but gives players the opportunity to change history. How players will take advantage of this opportunity to create a new future becomes the biggest suspense of the game.</p>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3321440?t=1731031119","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3321440/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1731031119","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3321440/31543145ffa91e743858e24b7494ad92c1e19f44/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731031119","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3321440/31543145ffa91e743858e24b7494ad92c1e19f44/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731031119","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The story takes place in the future Chaoge City, a metropolis full of modern atmosphere.
