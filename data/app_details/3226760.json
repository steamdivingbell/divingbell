{"about_the_game":"Riiiiing! Riiiiing! Click! &quot;Hello, this is GreenHouse Pizza! How can I help you? Huh? You\u2019re wondering if we can deliver in this Storm? Oh, come on, dear customer! For us, this is just a light breeze!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Pizza Delivery in a Storm, players take on the role of a pizza delivery person. Take orders, make pizzas, and deliver them on your motorbike! But be careful, the town is being hit by a massive Storm! Watch out for tornadoes! There are no predetermined routes for your delivery! You are only given a destination and a square field to work with! Keep experimenting to find the quickest and safest way to deliver your pizza!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe motorbikes in this game behave just like real motorbikes! Or more accurately, the \u2018motorbike-like\u2019 behaviors are exaggerated and stylized for fun! When turning, shift your weight to the inside, and when you jump, carefully adjust your landing by shifting your weight forward or backward! Mastering the motorbike turns the entire town into a giant obstacle course! Rooftops become your jumping platforms, and narrow alleyways that only people can squeeze through will seem like perfect shortcuts! Want to tear through the schoolyard on a motorbike? Well, in this game, you can!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe town is destroyed by the Storm every week! Bridges collapse, rivers flood! Roads that were once passable become impassable, and vice versa! That construction sign might just be the perfect stuff for jump!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven pizza-making is filled with freedom! Sure, the manager will want you to make the pizzas exactly as ordered, but that won\u2019t make the foodies happy! Add some more extravagant toppings! Oh, what\u2019s that? You\u2019ll go over budget with those ingredients? Well, how about swapping out some toppings for cheaper ones on an order from someone who isn\u2019t a gourmet, and pocket the savings instead?","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3226760?t=1728471913","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3226760/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1728471913","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3226760/bfa07f9effb7ca18564806992d28eb4493040ffb/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728471913","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3226760/bfa07f9effb7ca18564806992d28eb4493040ffb/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728471913","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":3262170,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Riiiiing!
