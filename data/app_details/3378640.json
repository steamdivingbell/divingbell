{"about_the_game":"Mika's Battle S 2 is a 2D platform action game based on the story of Mika, the Sunshineland warrior, who has been assigned with a special task, that is, to rescue Sayuri, the Sunshineland Intelligence Department officer, who has been kept inside a special cell located inside Rogho Corporation territory.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3378640/extras/store_page_story.png?t=1734267155\" /><br><br>A moment after Mika successfully defended the Eastern border of the Sunshineland territory against the attacks from the enemy soldiers, she was assigned with a special task which was not only associated with the Sunshineland intelligence department but with her life as well. It was about 10 years ago that Mika's mother, Sayuri, the then Sunshineland Intelligence officer, disappeared all of a sudden without a trace and almost all of the members of the Sunshineland army assumed her dead. Mika had always believed that one day she will be reunited with her mother and that she was alive. But there was not even a single clue about her whereabouts until recently, the intelligence department of the Sunshineland were able to trace the location of Sayuri and they concluded that she was alive and was kept inside a special cell located somewhere inside the Rogho Corporation territory. The Boss of the Sunshineland Warriors entrusted Mika with the special task of rescuing Sayuri at any cost because she was a part of the Sunshineland Intelligence department. <br><br>Mika began her journey and with the help of her best friend, Shina, she was able to enter the Rogho Corporation territory through secret passages and thereby, reaching an area which is located in the vicinity of the special cell. It was not that easy to enter the building because it was under a tight security. She had to find and take a different route in order to avoid engaging with large number of enemy forces. Mika was asked to retrieve the secret data by accessing Rogho Tech computers which could make the rescuing process easier. <br><br>You play as Mika, and will you be able to rescue your mother, Sayuri, who was imprisoned for 10 years? Will you be able to reunite with her? Your fate is now in your hands!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3378640/extras/mbs_2_gif_2.gif?t=1734267155\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3378640/extras/store_page_key_features.png?t=1734267155\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>15 Levels with stunning visuals!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Lots of powerful enemy soldiers having varieties of weapons!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>2 Boss Battles!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>3 Firing Modes which includes machine gun, laser and missile launcher modes!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Lots of Deadly Traps including spikes, saws, arrow throwers, and laser beams!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Ability to double jump and collect different items like health, ammo, blue gems, memory card, coins etc.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Story Driven.
