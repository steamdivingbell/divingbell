My name is Dr. Lionel Abrams, and I have created you for a mission that is of deep personal importance to me. You are being dispatched to the colony of Crux Asteria, a world once shared by humans and androids that tragically fell victim to a horrifying insurrection some 10 years ago. Nixie, we believed every human who ever lived there had either escaped or perished in the dreadful incident, but\u2026 that was until just recently. The Union of Human Affairs picked up a rather implausible distress signal. I didn\u2019t believe it at first when they told me, but when I saw the message for myself I was shocked. It was coming from my own son, Linus. He\u2019s still there \u2013 alive. Somehow\u2026 some way, despite my belief that he had been lost this whole time, he managed to survive! Your mission won\u2019t be easy, but it is simple: find my son and rescue him any way you can. I know I\u2019m placing a great burden on you, considering you\u2019ve just been brought into the world, Nixie, but you truly are my finest creation. I\u2019ve given you the strength and abilities you\u2019ll need to safely return to us with Linus. You will land shortly in terminal 298C of Port Valius. It\u2019s an abandoned import terminal, so hopefully you can sneak in undetected. Please be careful, Nixie, and trust no one. I will brief you further shortly after you land.\u201d<br><br>And now Nixie's mission begins, but there's much to learn... both about himself and about the captivating world of Crux Asteria.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2584810/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734998850","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2584810/page.bg.jpg?t=1734998850","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2584810/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734998850","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2584810/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734998850","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":2609820,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2584810/extras/animated.png?t=1734998850\" /><br><br>Nixie is a 2D story-driven exploration game about a robot\u2019s search for a missing human lost in an android space colony.
