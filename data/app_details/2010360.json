To achieve this goal, you can transform into a strategist, win over some factions to attack others, and use your superb diplomatic skills to betray your allies while making them grateful to you; Alternatively, you can become a legendary figure, with both the enemy and the enemy at your disposal. You can use your art of war command to ravage your opponents, plunder their wealth, and force them to become your subjects. As long as someone dares to oppose you, all that awaits them is a flash of dust and smoke; It's also good to be a wealthy and ruthless businessman, monopolizing the supply of goods, controlling logistics, speculating and hoarding. Continuously accumulating a large amount of wealth, using money to buy people's hearts, tempting enemies to die for you, in short, any problem that can be solved with money is no longer a problem for you.<br>If you are tired of the conflicts in the world and only think about the peaceful passage of time, then take a down-to-earth approach to attracting and cultivating talents, revitalizing the industrial system, improving social security, and encouraging scientific research to reward military achievements. Use your wisdom and patience to nurture your unique cause bit by bit. As long as you work hard and follow the right path in the world, there will naturally be subordinates to escort you and great scholars to argue for you.<br><br><br>Features:<br>Multiple ways to achieve victory.
