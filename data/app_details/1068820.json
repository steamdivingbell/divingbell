(VRChat, Beat Saber, mostly all SteamVR titles, etc.)<br></li><li> Desktop window viewing: Allows you to select a desktop window and display it above your hand, or pin it in the world around you.<br></li><li> Multiple desktop windows: Create multiple different windows and place them in the world around you.<br></li><li> Attach windows to tracked devices: You can make windows move around with either your left or right controllers, headset, or have them stationary in the world.<br></li><li> Curved overlays: Improves readability of large windows in VR by wrapping them around you by a configurable amount? Now you can! (Or you can make the window into a wall by curving it to the max, I don't judge!)<br></li><li> Window re-centering: Optionally enable window re-centering, this will make window's re-appear in front of you when you open Edit Mode. This is useful to easily pull windows to you so you can use them.<br></li><li> Quick selection of desktop windows: OVR Toolkit contains a configuration 'hotkey' menu that allows you to bind buttons on its UI to switch between specific windows in one click.<br></li><li> Intuitive desktop input: Scroll up and down on windows by dragging, make a selection by dragging, like using your finger on a phone but with a VR controller instead!

You can do these with our advanced settings!<br></li><li> Eco Mode: When enabled, performance mode will lower the capture rate of windows you are not using, this drastically increases performance and lowers CPU usage significantly!<br></li><li> Basic media controls: Spotify currently playing song will show on your wrist, along with a play/pause, skip, and previous button. (These buttons will work in other music players too)<br></li><li> Windows notifications: Display your Windows notifications in VR such as Discord messages, 'Your Phone' notifications, and anything else that would typically appear on your desktop as a push notification.<br></li><li> Macros: Create macro keybinds which can be activated by a click on the wrist to trigger a series of key presses. (Such as changing OBS scenes, muting/un-muting Discord, etc.)<br></li><li> Paste to Game: Clicking the Paste button found under the keyboard will automatically tab in the currently running game and push Ctrl and V.

Use Steam/SteamVR instead! You can set OVR Toolkit to auto-start with SteamVR by referring to our wiki!<br></li><li> Oculus' software will sometimes overlay over our overlay.

(Our application uses SteamVR to display, though, most Oculus games will have a SteamVR mode, we advise you use this!)<br></li><li> Running games through SteamVR on an Oculus headset may decrease performance, this is not an issue specific to OVR Toolkit. This is due to Oculus rendering the same image twice, once when SteamVR compositor renders the output, then again when Oculus Runtime renders the output. Unfortunately, this is something only Oculus/Facebook can fix!<br></li><li> Windows Mixed Reality users may experience decreased performance running SteamVR games due to double rendering. Please try performance with your games running through SteamVR before you purchase OVR Toolkit.
