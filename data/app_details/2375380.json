{"about_the_game":"This is a platform jumping game, the main process is our protagonist eraser through many difficulties, back to the story of the pencil case, the game process is not long, but the difficulty is very high, if you are very confident, to challenge it. Due to my limited abilities, the game uses an extremely simple drawing style, but it doesn't affect the core gameplay. Because our protagonist is a rubber, he has some elasticity, which is different from the platform jumping games we usually play. It is difficult for you to precisely control him to jump on some rugged or narrow Spaces or platforms, so you need to try constantly. Personally, I think the factor that can decide you finish the level is not your skill, but your luck. I believe every player has good luck.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is good for helping players with emotional management exercises. If you don't believe me, then you can try it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally wish every player have a good time!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Great victory","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2375380/02c0e16dcfad8a46905c909804bc784d39f68b94.jpg"}],"total":1},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2375380/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1683103091","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2375380/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1683103091","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2375380/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1683103091","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2375380/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1683103091","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This is a platform jumping game, the main process is our protagonist eraser through many difficulties, back to the story of the pencil case, the game process is not long, but the difficulty is very high, if you are very confident, to challenge it.
