Humanity has been invaded by an unknown entity and is on the brink of extinction.

Humans have become a species driven solely by the instinct to survive, living in constant fear.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In this chaotic environment, a small number of surviving scientists are searching for a solution.
