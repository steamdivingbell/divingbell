Lance in hand, he has range comparable to other weapon users, but is geared more towards power. Ride the lightning with pole vault drop kicks and angled dashes to close gaps and secure KOs. Similar to Ashani, his battery system stores charge and releases to enhance special moves! No where on the stage is safe from his super-charged bursts!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1376070/extras/8_Character_Title_Faces_AFIGALU.png?t=1721020181\" /><br><br><strong>Style - Tag-Team</strong><br><br>Ever wanted to play as two combatants at once? Now you can! Afigalu is what we call a &quot;Tag-Team'' fighter, meaning you control one of them at a time, while the other sits dormant. One soul, two bodies! Swap between them to volley your opponents from yourself to... yourself! Or pick up and throw the dormant one, only to swap to them midair! If you like managing two positions at once and setting up deadly mixups, Afi &amp; Galu (Afigalu) is for you!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1376070/extras/2_Character_Title_Faces_RAYMER.png?t=1721020181\" /><br><br><strong>Style - Zoner</strong><br><br>This intergalactic bounty hunter takes pride in his sharpshooting skills, boasting a wide array of projectiles to control space and snipe weak spots.

Intimidate the opposition with the big iron on your hip...<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1376070/extras/3_Character_Title_Faces_KIDD.png?t=1721020181\" /><br><br><strong>Style - Rushdown</strong><br><br>If you have a burning desire for high octane gameplay, strap in and brace yourself for take-off with the Rocket-powered Rapscallion. Kidd has unique movement options that allow him to combo, chase opponents down, and stop them from recovering. Aerial mobility is where Kidd SHINES! Use his jetpack's fuel system to hover over enemies or carry them to the blast zone!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1376070/extras/1_Character_Title_Faces_ASHANI.png?t=1721020181\" /><br><br><strong>Style - Rushdown</strong><br><br>With the highest run speed in the game, Ashani is your pick if you want to rush down your opponents with lightning fast mix-ups that lead into devastating finishers!

He wields a massive glave with a sweet spot on the tip, encouraging you to stay mindful of distance. Dragon's blood flowing through his veins allows him to sacrifice HP to enhance his special moves! When doing so, he emits a signature red glow, allowing him to control the ground with rising spikes, drift through the air with ease, or literally just explode!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1376070/extras/6_Character_Title_Faces_URDAH.png?t=1721020181\" /><br><br><strong>Style - Grappler</strong><br><br>She says it herself...  DON'T. GET. GRABBED! Urdah is our premier grappler and her boastful warnings with a smile should not be taken lightly. We've loaded her kit with all the tools she'll need to scare you into blocking, only to remind you what she actually wants! From command grabs on the ground AND in the air, to anti-air seismic slams reminiscent of another giant grappler from across the pond... Urdah is your pick if you want to win confidence!
