Your day job is fine - the daily grind of dealing with Sky Pirates pays the bills - but nothing compares to the rush of demolishing a ninety-ton mechanical monstrosity at the speed of sound. And you\u2019ll have your chance. As mechanized weapons converge on Root City, you\u2019ll have to be at the top of your game to survive, and you\u2019ll have to surpass your limits if you want to save the world.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/913060/extras/hangar1.5.gif?t=1726581143\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/913060/extras/JETL-descriptionHeader-FEATURES-600x100(1).png?t=1726581143\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Be A Badass</strong>: Jet Lancer is easy to learn but hard to master.
