{"about_the_game":"On September 24, 1942, 51 and 57As of the Stalingrad Front received orders on the night of September 27 to attack the positions of Romanian troops in the defile between lakes Tsatsa and Barmantsak, capture the village of Plodovitoe and reach Tinguta station. Elements of 51A were supposed to strike north to the railway road near the Abganerovo station. The operation plan envisaged the destruction of the Romanian 1 and 4IDs with subsequent access to communications behind enemy lines, as well as the diversion of German forces from Stalingrad.<br>The positions of 57A elements were located in the area of Sarpinskie Lakes. The army included the 15gds RD, 20DBde, 1188ATAR, 18 and 76gds MTRs, 1334RR from 442RD and 76FR. South of 57A the defense was occupied by 51A. Elements of 57 and 51As were opposed by divisions of the Romanian 6AC consisting of 1, 2 and 4IDs. Due to delays encountered during the march to the initial lines, the start of the operation was postponed to the night of September 29. At the same time, German intelligence was able to identify preparations for the offensive.
