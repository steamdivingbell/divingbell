{"about_the_game":"It's the year 1970 in Sweden, and the Cold War is upon us. None of the thousands of bomb shelters have been used, until now. You and 24 other players start in separate apartments as air-raid sirens go off. You don't have much time so gather as many supplies and weapons wherever and however you can. <br><br>What gear can you find? What supplies can you craft? Who can you trust? Use Shattle's in-game voice chat to make friends or enemies. You'll need all your wits about you to survive three bombing raids and make it to safety.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>20-minute rounds</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1730580/extras/Shattle_Shortmatches615x150.gif?t=1693311930\" /><br>No more hiding or camping.
