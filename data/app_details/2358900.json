{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Lockstone Mountains is a top-down, action-adventure game in which you Pilot large flying vessels in inhospitable skies. These floating ships are controlled using a signature rudder-and-keel system with a physics-based flying model.  Guns, cannons, missile launchers and much more are at your disposition to fight back swarms of enemies. Sails the winds along with other members of the Rook expedition, and uncover the secrets of the Lockstone Mountains, which is set in a hard-fantasy science-based steampunk setting.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Complete Your Arsenal!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The wealth of dangers roaming the skies are only matched by the expedition's ingenuity. Expand your arsenal to counter every threat you discover. From small mounted rifles to high-yield proximity detonated missiles, the sky is quite literally the limit! Every hull has a unique combination of hardpoints, each with weapon classes and a set cone of fire.
