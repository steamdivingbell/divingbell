{"about_the_game":"<strong>AquaBlitz: Alien Racer</strong> is a classic Arcade Racing game with a twist: You are racing in three dimensions underwater against your friends!<br><br>Set in a near future dystopian world, underwater racing became a sport between Humans, Aliens and Atlanteans. First you choose your character and a racer best suited for the upcoming race track, equip it with weapons, mod it, then you race against other players in this multiplayer race to be the first over the finish line - having the right weapons charged might help with that... <br><br><strong>But beware, racing underwater is somewhat special:</strong> You can stop to take sharp turns for a shortcut or to avoid a torpedo. The racing barrier only guides you most of the time, but not only in the open terrain are obstacles from rocks to machinery and whales. There are items to collect for modding your racer, too.  Don\u00b4t forget: you can overtake by sliding under your enemies.<br><br><strong>For fans of Racers, Arcade and SciFi.  </strong><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2946240/extras/GIFs-midracer.gif?t=1719140137\" /><br><br><u>Features: </u><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Singleplayer and Multiplayer (up to 8) Racers with weapons <br></li><li>Online leaderboards<br></li><li>Racer characters from 3+ races (Humans, Aliens, Atlanteans) <br></li><li>Distinctive racetracks from the worlds of each of the races.<br></li><li>Each race has their own unique racer models with different specs<br></li><li>Unique gameplay with underwater setting with sliding, shooting, breaking in 3 dimensions!<br></li><li>Track hazards from rocks, sucking streams, moving machines to whales and dolphins.<br></li><li>Reward system, mod and upgrade your racer<br></li><li>Items to collect during race to equal game and build new weapons<br></li><li>Classic tournament mode, Open Race, Battles<br></li><li>Appealing unique cell-shading style and electronic soundtrack </li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2946240/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1719140137","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2946240/page.bg.jpg?t=1719140137","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2946240/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1719140137","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2946240/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1719140137","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>AquaBlitz: Alien Racer</strong> is a classic Arcade Racing game with a twist: You are racing in three dimensions underwater against your friends!<br><br>Set in a near future dystopian world, underwater racing became a sport between Humans, Aliens and Atlanteans.
