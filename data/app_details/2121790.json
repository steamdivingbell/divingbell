{"about_the_game":"<i>Greetings surveyor! We have woke you from cryogenic sleep for an exciting opportunity!</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore musical playgrounds</h2>Alpha Periphery is home to a desert planet, an ocean world, and its icy moon. These worlds function as tracks of an EP, composed of purely synthesized music and sounds, which evolve and react to your input in real-time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Synthesize new abilities</h2>You start with nothing but a terrain scanner and limited cargo space. By collecting materials, you can unlock new abilities and enhance them further. When fully upgraded, you command these worlds in every dimension.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Uncover a mysterious past</h2>Alpha Periphery is also home to many secrets. With the terrain scanner, you discover new destinations with hidden structures and artifacts to examine. Together, they reveal insights into the true purpose of your expedition.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Stay for a while</h2>With zero combat or risk of death, you are free to linger or experiment. As you catch your tenth sunset on Alpha Periphery C, you wonder how high the sky goes, or what happens when you dive into the water at orbital speeds.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">An accessible experience</h2>Periphery Synthetic is fully playable without seeing the screen. Use echolocation and terrain sonification to navigate its worlds. Use your favorite screen reader to navigate its menus and access extra information while in-game. Toggle off its graphics to enjoy with audio alone.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Desert Planet","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2121790/083964455c9baa337fb033f587d8090bc11b1935.jpg"},{"name":"Ice Moon","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2121790/083964455c9baa337fb033f587d8090bc11b1935.jpg"},{"name":"Water World","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2121790/083964455c9baa337fb033f587d8090bc11b1935.jpg"},{"name":"Mission Accomplished","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2121790/083964455c9baa337fb033f587d8090bc11b1935.jpg"},{"name":"Achievement Hunter","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2121790/083964455c9baa337fb033f587d8090bc11b1935.jpg"},{"name":"Alpha Seed","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2121790/083964455c9baa337fb033f587d8090bc11b1935.jpg"},{"name":"One Giant Leap","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2121790/083964455c9baa337fb033f587d8090bc11b1935.jpg"},{"name":"Astronaut","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2121790/083964455c9baa337fb033f587d8090bc11b1935.jpg"},{"name":"Credits Received","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2121790/083964455c9baa337fb033f587d8090bc11b1935.jpg"},{"name":"Press F","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2121790/083964455c9baa337fb033f587d8090bc11b1935.jpg"}],"total":49},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2121790/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735346390","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2121790/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1735346390","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2121790/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735346390","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2121790/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735346390","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":2328330,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<i>Greetings surveyor!
