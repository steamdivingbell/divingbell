{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Druta-Cinta is the debut video game by Izyan Lopez.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is a concise and relaxing strategy simulation, but it also challenges you to replay the game in different ways.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Originally made as an unblocked school Chromebook time killer for my friends, this game was created when I was 14 years old. Now, after all these years, I am here to finish what I started by publishing it. It's the type of game I would like to play while listening to my music or talking to my friends, so feel free to turn off the music.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Content and features:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In this game, you play as a blue square from a top-down 2D perspective. When you stop, everything else stops. When you move, everything does. You can take your time on each level because of this. Beware the red-colored enemies that will do their best to attack you. You get to use great weapons in your arsenal including a gun, bombs, a sword, a boomerang, and a shotgun. You have to move around to reload your attack or activate certain things. There are a lot of silly and awesome sound &amp; visual effects that make it a good experience for the ears.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">I hope you enjoy this game and experiment with this small adventure to get all the achievements. Thank you!!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Here's a tip for playing: I advise you to turn the mouse sensitivity up to play faster, and with a controller, you can press on the left stick to make the cursor go faster.</p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Gun Mastery","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1483750/6ced75dd29f484fca926e28b5729ba19248afe17.jpg"},{"name":"Bomb Mastery","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1483750/90d354832892099c183e51d760c82f380543e1e3.jpg"},{"name":"Sword Mastery","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1483750/a5e27d2445df15e790a730112c4447890505ceea.jpg"},{"name":"Boomerang Mastery","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1483750/ed7fc85e8ac67cee79d54e472abfa706834e4cb1.jpg"},{"name":"Shotgun Mastery","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1483750/627a6ed84380b716978b7fe1bf2882237fdc4f47.jpg"},{"name":"Release","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1483750/8cbfbf2e0bcc3e22ffecead9d771fe31fef3fdd0.jpg"}],"total":6},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1483750/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733495195","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1483750/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1733495195","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1483750/6a6c32e73162d9abd4d9da69a08accd79ba054e6/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733495195","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1483750/6a6c32e73162d9abd4d9da69a08accd79ba054e6/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733495195","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Druta-Cinta is the debut video game by Izyan Lopez.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is a concise and relaxing strategy simulation, but it also challenges you to replay the game in different ways.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Originally made as an unblocked school Chromebook time killer for my friends, this game was created when I was 14 years old.
