{"about_the_game":"In this wave shooter game you have to stop the creatures at all cost, are you ready?  After the massive super volcano erupted sending the earth into darkness we have been seeing some seriously crazy stuff. There has been all sorts of creatures just pouring out of the earth from the cracks that have formed.  You will be dropped in a area that has been deemed very hostile and needs to be controlled. There are weapons laying around as well as ammo. We will pay and reward you for each creature you kill. This will allow you to purchase the weapons that are laying around, use everything to your advantage and stay alive as long as you can or you can find the item that will get you an extraction point.  There are also traps on each map that you can use to your advantage.  The purpose of the game is to get through as many waves of creatures as you can while in hostile elements.  Good luck and happy fighting!!! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease visit our Discord.. link posted in basic info","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Survivor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1475330/98d7cf0db0900f3d57ece0ce024d3ada6b1e6d72.jpg"},{"name":"Blow 'Em Up","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1475330/8747345b170fb8bb1f4f0576a80a363d71f8c113.jpg"},{"name":"Monstermoerder Throw Back","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1475330/d1fd587a739e1edd4a9b837835acf41a68521a08.jpg"},{"name":"Wave Killer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1475330/33834516ce88cb2760b8375464dead93d7c5e4aa.jpg"},{"name":"Staying Alive","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1475330/f56e8790f4aaef84f625335f93fa63cba2d1bcb2.jpg"},{"name":"True Survivor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1475330/81069de83ed87fd34a7653b2aa02ce8124f2d518.jpg"},{"name":"Badass","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1475330/6f91aa717aed0421e95f2006d7d1889f4e36b3b7.jpg"},{"name":"Wave Survivor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1475330/75de50ec54f8ccffc2bfa7a2afe959c339bfe1ca.jpg"},{"name":"Showing off","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1475330/7c240854b70ac73491be8e148d0f1a40f7e0ecf5.jpg"},{"name":"Getting Cocky","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1475330/f65d756a099fc4c2352c63f9f1fce745c4b97025.jpg"}],"total":11},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1475330/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714869585","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1475330/page.bg.jpg?t=1714869585","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1475330/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714869585","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1475330/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714869585","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Mild Blood, corpses of animals, violence "},"detailed_description":"In this wave shooter game you have to stop the creatures at all cost, are you ready?
