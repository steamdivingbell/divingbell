{"about_the_game":"Thing &amp; Fist is an isometric couch co-op brawler where two players battle their way through the city of St. Avalon as they work to pull off the heist of the century. St. Avalon is a shady city that is home to gangsterism and sorcery in equal measure, and players will need to work together if they hope to stand a chance against the nefarious baddies that lurk around every corner.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs Thing, players can zap enemies from a distance using powerful bolts of lightning while keeping the hordes of goons guessing by swiftly dashing around, behind, and even through them! For those that prefer a more direct approach to trouncing foes, playing as Fist will allow players to make short work of opponents with powerful punches and a dash attack that bulldozes anything in their way. When the throngs of opponents seem like too much to handle, players can stun crowds of enemies with a powerful slam as Fist or conjure a convenient bribe as Thing to direct their attention elsewhere. Players can also support their partner in crime with their character's unique shield ability to ensure that Thing &amp; Fist will be able to pull through each chaotic brawl they find themselves in on their quest to become filthy rich!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs they make their way through the two unique levels of the game, players will find themselves going up against numerous different enemies including slime cops, gunslingers, walking cauldrons, and shadow hands; each of which has their own methods of attack that players will need to work together to outmaneuver. Starting in downtown St. Avalon, players will make their way through the city streets, break in and out of the bank, and scurry towards the escape raft with the cash!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2894620/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1719951190","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2894620/page.bg.jpg?t=1719951190","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2894620/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1719951190","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2894620/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1719951190","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Thing &amp; Fist is an isometric couch co-op brawler where two players battle their way through the city of St. Avalon as they work to pull off the heist of the century.
