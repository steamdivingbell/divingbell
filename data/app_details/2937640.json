{"about_the_game":"Down with the J\u00f6tunn! Take down that giant!<br><br>A war-hungry giant has laid siege to your village. Play as a viking village chief and raid nearby villages to build your home back up from the ruins. Risk losing your gathered loot by venturing further into the continent and raiding more difficult villages. If you're strong enough, you'll reach the J\u00f6tunn's village and take revenge!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gather Supplies</h2>Each village is stocked with chests and other containers full of building supplies, currency and equipment to help your village grow. The farther in you go, the more loot you can acquire.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Choose your build</h2>Choose between different sets of weapons and armor, each giving you different stat upgrades and attack abilities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fight for your life</h2>Your health is limited. Losing all of your health on a raid will cause you to drop all of your acquired loot and return to your home village.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Upgrade your village</h2>Had some successful raids? Use the supplies you gathered to upgrade buildings in your home village, giving you access to better equipment and new abilities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Wield God-like powers</h2>Utilize 1 of 5 possible powers of the Norse gods while on your raids, giving you special abilities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Avoid the Storm</h2>Some Norse deities do not like loot hogs. After spending too much time in a single village, a storm will appear, forcing you to move on or perish.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Navigate Through the Fog</h2>Until the storm arrives, each village you raid is filled with dense fog, making it difficult to find your way around.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">No Two Villages are the Same</h2>Each village is procedurally generated. Just because you found your way before does not guarantee you will again.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2937640/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737590252","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2937640/page.bg.jpg?t=1737590252","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2937640/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737590252","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2937640/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737590252","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Contains Violence, Blood, and Death."},"detailed_description":"<h1>Roadmap</h1><p>Here's what we plan to add to the J\u00f6tunn's Greed playtest!<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2937640/extras/JGRoadmap_Steam.png?t=1737590252\" /></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Down with the J\u00f6tunn!
