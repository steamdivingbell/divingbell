{"about_the_game":"Star Fisher is a top-down action fishing game where you fish for celestial beings from the reflection of a night time lake.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour poor cat is hungry, and as a fisher you are looking to feed him by hunting for fish. Unfortunately, you haven't much luck catching fish on your usual routes, so you have to explore an enchanted lake. Here, the reflection of the night sky allows you to capture cosmic fish!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour movements will need to be precise, as crystal growths and monsters are looking to block your progress. The fish themselves are tricky to grab, as they like to quickly swim away when you get close! By swinging your net with careful timing, you should be able to catch enough to feed your cat. Take too long to catch anything, and you\u2019ll both still be hungry!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKey features include<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Procedurally generated levels for infinite replayability<br />\r\n* Five levels with unique enemy and world generation algorithms<br />\r\n* 12 different kinds of fish and monsters to encounter!","achievements":{"total":0},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1707690/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1636539238","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1707690/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1636539238","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1707690/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1636539238","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1707690/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1636539238","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Star Fisher is a top-down action fishing game where you fish for celestial beings from the reflection of a night time lake.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour poor cat is hungry, and as a fisher you are looking to feed him by hunting for fish.
