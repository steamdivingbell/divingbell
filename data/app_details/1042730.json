{"about_the_game":"This DLC unlocks a fourth playable character, Xandria aka Cyberwitch, who specializes in active ability uses. It also adds a lot of new combat abilities that can be used by other characters as well, and new unique ability for each of the characters. You can also equip experimental psionic accelerator as a secondary weapon that can interface with your abilities and vastly improve their efficiency. Psi-acc can hold two additional abilities, meaning that you can enter the mission with two combat abilities activated in your Psi-acc and two additional of your choice for support. Burn your enemies with plasma fists or throw fireballs around, summon chain lightning or crush their heads from distance. Depending on your character, you will be able to squeeze heart of your enemy so hard it'll explode, cover the way to your hideout with energy mines, suck energy from nearby enemies to support your offensive abilities, or even summon a melee weapon from pure energy.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1042730/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1554484090","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1042730/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1554484090","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1042730/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1554484090","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1042730/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1554484090","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Includes intense violence and blood."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"This DLC unlocks a fourth playable character, Xandria aka Cyberwitch, who specializes in active ability uses.
