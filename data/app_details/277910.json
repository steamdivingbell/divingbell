{"about_the_game":"Mars Colony: Challenger is a 3D first / third person game that offers you the challenge of setting up a remote base on the surface of Mars. At its core, the game was derived from a simulator where everything is interactively tied together. You will have to setup and maintain the equipment that supplies pressure and a breathable atmosphere to the base. You are also tasked with growing food, setting up communications and extracting resources in order to make the base self-sufficient. The game offers three zones, each with their unique challenges. There are 7 phases to each mission. Each of the phases expands the base and offers a new set of orders for you to complete. You advance through the ranks as you score points for your performance.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/277910/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1447360336","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/277910/page.bg.jpg?t=1447360336","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/277910/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1447360336","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/277910/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1447360336","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Mars Colony: Challenger is a 3D first / third person game that offers you the challenge of setting up a remote base on the surface of Mars.
