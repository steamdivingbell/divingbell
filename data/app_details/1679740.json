It may be on the short side as to playtime but the price point reflects this. I do think the game could have some dark tones added to it so the main character can be seen a little more clearly and adjust the text so it can be read without the player having to climb into the screen. There are a few twists and turns in the plot that keep you hooked to push on to see its conclusion.\u201d<br>I Like It \u2013 LadiesGamers<br><br>\u201cOnce in Flowerlake is an atmospheric game for people with patience, and I genuinely mean that in the nicest possible way. It portrays individual components well, such as stagnant routine, temporary friendships, a foreign world, and what trudging through snow feels like, but all of these elements mixed together get in each other\u2019s way at times.
