{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Mpirimpa / Buraco / Canasta/ Baraziliya is a free online card game which allows you to play for free with your friends and other players one Vs one or in two pairs opposing each other. The game is widely played in Greece, Italy and South America. In Italy the game is called Buraco and in South America Canasta. The game is offered in two versions, the classic Mpirimpa and Mpirimpa Pro which requires players to 'justify' taking the cards from the pot and only allows players to make melds with sequences and not identical cards. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The objective of the game is to reach first the points set by the person who creates the table. Players play with chips against other players and the winners take their opponents' chips less a percentage taken from the platform. Users get free chips upon registration and they get additional free chips daily through a scratch card or daily bonus or by watching reward ads. If they run out of chips they can buy additional chips from the shop.  They can also send messages to other players using our online messaging tool and can also send pictures. Players who become VIP through purchasing VIP chips are also allowed to upload their own avatar and change their user name. Players can also make friends and invite them to private tables that only them can join.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Please check out our website  for instructions of how to play.<br><br><strong>*</strong> By logging in, you agree to the Orderear's <strong>Terms of Service</strong> &amp; <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> for the current website.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3294740/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736869407","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3294740/page.bg.jpg?t=1736869407","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3294740/d904a1a282d9bd79acb6703dc66ca1c6512f9a1b/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736869407","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3294740/d904a1a282d9bd79acb6703dc66ca1c6512f9a1b/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736869407","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Mpirimpa / Buraco / Canasta/ Baraziliya is a free online card game which allows you to play for free with your friends and other players one Vs one or in two pairs opposing each other.
