{"about_the_game":"Supraland is a mix of Metroid, Portal, Mario and Zelda. It is a first-person metroidvania.<br><br>Supraland is mostly about good exploration and solving unique puzzles.

You will constantly be puzzled and surprised by what you can do with them. Unlike in regular metroidvanias, where every ability is over and over used in the same way. I also avoid using abilities that are technically like keys, that only enable you to get through a certain color door type or so.<br><br>- Easily readable: I don't want the game to get lost in useless clutter.

There are many hidden systems.<br><br>- I try to avoid mechanisms and puzzles that feel generic. Ideas that feel generic are immediately rejected during the design process. The further you progress, the more you will encounter puzzles that you have never seen before.<br><br>- There is no minimap showing you usable or significant things. Maps like this cause you to play the radar instead of the game and not really look at everything closely. The world building is so varied that you will never get lost in a maze of equally looking corridors.<br><br>- There are lots of optional things and abilities to discover. If everything is mandatory, there is no mystery and no motivation to play the game again.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Through the fire pipe","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1000560/8e67416dfb53accf7edf477d7b81356267214082.jpg"},{"name":"The Blues","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1000560/872a41ee60284399bf854f032e73d759a02e4dda.jpg"},{"name":"Fast","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1000560/ae465a158de95ce5424954b52ee7e8687f60ef29.jpg"},{"name":"Regeneration","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1000560/4af984f5f8fa972d159a7d60c6dab1cd394820a2.jpg"},{"name":"Healthbar","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1000560/c1d92b3ddb39fbde9eabcefd9f2b686a5acfdf69.jpg"},{"name":"Force Cube","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1000560/7f078d8d0b6f8f8ec7f8c94f723705b9467f438d.jpg"},{"name":"Double Jump","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1000560/3fc4a46dfc76d1060d2ed9ec7b00892cd6f688e8.jpg"},{"name":"Triple Jump","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1000560/6c52e90089b6ada7b67589ae9030ca16e517dacf.jpg"},{"name":"Climb the hill","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1000560/39cd416b5ea5c38b775a8fa5847c11bbc6b7fe24.jpg"},{"name":"Telefrag","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1000560/856169d99b9e78de2eb0e9d5a7f8a12532acf44c.jpg"}],"total":17},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1000560/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725021442","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1000560/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1725021442","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1000560/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725021442","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1000560/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725021442","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Supraland is a mix of Metroid, Portal, Mario and Zelda.
