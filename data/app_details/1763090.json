{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A romantic visual novel set in a mental hospital. Shots of psycho-mistresses! But be careful... What if your girlfriend was replaced by the fantasy of an excited mind? Only you can decide what is real and what is not. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A woman is not a simple thing. And a psycho-woman? You need to be careful if you value your life! Make the right choices to win the heart of a lady. 5 heroines. You can share love with each of them! Psycho love...</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">No one has spoken to Sergei Ustinov his entire life. He has no friends. No girlfriend. Why? Because he is schizophrenic. And the truth has always been hidden from him. People around him had to lie. But now he knows everything. He hands himself over to the rich Phoenix mental hospital. His new life will begin here. With schizophrenia at hand, he goes to look for friends, and a girlfriend. But... Aren't crazy girls dangerous?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A silhouette in a white coat haunts him at night. An unpleasant, quiet voice. A frozen smile. What does he want? Who is he? Someone sends a watch. The address is missing. Sends suspicious letters. Something about Paradise... Another admirer? The psychiatrist is acting strange. Vague hints. Another parcel. A severed finger. Are you really you? This whole path... The path to this hospital? Was it really true?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">How do you start a new life if you can't even trust it?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>All characters are over 20 years old!!!</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1763090/extras/s2__6_.png?t=1738868011\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game's scriptwriter is an idiot! His knowledge of psychology, the work of mental hospitals, and diseases is extremely superficial. These themes are used for the plot of the story, as well as associations that will help the player cope with the plot. The setting of a mental hospital allows for a comprehensive disclosure of the problems of the work, as well as an easy way to convey the moral of the story to the player. If you are looking for authenticity, then you should not get acquainted with this game. Psycho Love will often bring the action to the point of absurdity. For example, one of the diseases will have a fantastic basis that has no place in real life. If the following warnings did not stop you, then we promise you a fascinating story. It will have wonderful visuals, eccentric characters, and mind-blowing music. You will experience heavenly pleasure!</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1763090/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738868011","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1763090/page.bg.jpg?t=1738868011","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1763090/50a1565f8dc28b93b43772323b2ebed35064f833/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738868011","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1763090/50a1565f8dc28b93b43772323b2ebed35064f833/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738868011","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,3,4,5],"notes":"Blood stains, pools of blood, images of corpses in the frame, images of mutilations, hints at unsuccessful suicide attempts of one of the heroines, associations with suicide, murders, scenes with knife and bullet wounds, explicit sex scenes, images of genitals, text with explicit sexual content, obscene language."},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A romantic visual novel set in a mental hospital.
