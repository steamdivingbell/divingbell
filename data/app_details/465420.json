{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Planet Under Siege</h2>Mars is under siege, and the colonists are fighting a losing battle. Assume the role of Blake, a private security operative who crash lands near the colony of Deadstone, following an outbreak on the Icarus space station. Care to guess who just landed the job of sheriff? <br><br>To survive, you\u2019ll need to use your combat expertise and lethal firepower to overcome an unrelenting enemy, but to win, you\u2019ll need a strategy. Every time an infected slips through your defensive net, a colonist dies. Can you save the colonists of Deadstone?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Two Distinct Game Modes</h2> Try out the first 10 missions of the 50 mission Campaign. Note: Survival mode not available in demo.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Campaign</h2> Deploy defences, choose your weapons and equipment, and get into the fight. Experience nerve wracking battles against the insidious infected threat across 3 mission types: Patrol, Arena, and Colonist Rescue.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Bring a Friend</h2> Experience Deadstone with a pal in local co-op. Note: A control pad is required for co-op play. The Xbox 360 wired controller is officially supported, however most controllers should work.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Play Your Way</h2> Develop the ultimate fighter with the unfortunately acronymed S.C.A.M. system, comprising 4 primary stats (Speed, Constitution, Accuracy, Mechanics), 11 secondary stats, and 70 perks.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Face an Evolving Enemy</h2>Prepare yourself for the full horror waiting for you at Deadstone by confronting the first 2 of the game's 6 enemies. Contend with an enemy that attacks under the cover of night and dust storm, and even burrows under the surface to ambush you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Defensive Hardware</h2> Deploy mines and turrets to create a defensive line. Upgrade your turrets\u2019 stats, and research completely new abilities for them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tools of the Trade</h2> Spend your hard earned credits expanding your arsenal. Get access to the first tier of Deadstone's upgradable weapons from 4 classes: pistol, shotgun, automatic, precision, and complement your selection with flares, explosives, and armor.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Twin Tales</h2> Experience two engaging stories, or play without if you\u2019re just here for the action. Choose between a straight up survival narrative and a tongue-in-cheek take on events.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Casual to Hardcore</h2> Deadstone has 6 difficulty settings, to accommodate varying levels of skill.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/465420/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1461882437","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/465420/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1461882437","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/465420/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1461882437","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/465420/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1461882437","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Planet Under Siege</h2>Mars is under siege, and the colonists are fighting a losing battle.
