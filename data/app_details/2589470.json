{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About This Game</h2>A game that combines Rougelike and traditional RPG.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay Introduction</h2>1. Team up with random Adventists, heroes from all ages of the world.<br>2. Break through layer by layer, each layer is only one battle, a total of 4-6 layers.<br>3. Each layer can randomly get blessings, weapons, armor, relics, items, etc. to increase combat ability.<br>4. The randomness is strong, the enemy characters are also random, and there are weather effects in the game to increase the randomness of the battlefield.<br>5. Victory in battle can earn Soul Crystals, which can unlock more functions. (e.g. increase the probability of receiving advanced blessings, etc.)<br>6. Both defeat and victory will go into the loop, items will be emptied, and heroes will leave the team. Equipment and hero levels will be retained.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Short Strategy</h2>1. Priority unlocking increases the number of initial taverns, so you can get more heroes before entering the level.<br>2. Secondly, unlock the Blessing Crystal's features related to Blessing Items, which can increase the ability to fight.<br>3. Unlocking Forge Item II allows you to craft a &quot;Detachable Tent&quot; so you don't have to worry about recovering between battles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About difficulty</h2>The initial round of brushing is very fast, and later it can unlock higher difficulty, and at higher difficulty, not only the monster's ability will be improved, but also the income will increase. What's more, there will be more battlefield factors, which means that the game will be more interesting so as not to repeat the boring.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About updates</h2>The game will be updated from time to time, unlocking more characters, equipment, skills, etc.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"></h2>","achievements":{"total":0},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2589470/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1720934404","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2589470/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1720934404","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2589470/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1720934404","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2589470/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1720934404","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"Some characters are sexy."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About This Game</h2>A game that combines Rougelike and traditional RPG.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay Introduction</h2>1.
