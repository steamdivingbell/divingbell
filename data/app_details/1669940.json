{"about_the_game":"In <strong>Short Night: The Half Pint Lady </strong> choose between four horny goblin coworkers while keeping The Half Pint Lady from falling into disrepair. Complete unique quests, find hidden items, explore each goblin\u2019s unique personality during the day, and tackle increasingly difficult mini-games at night. Try your best to handle your workload as your coworkers try their best to tackle your other load.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1669940/extras/header_Story.png?t=1726603888\" /><br>Roused from a welcome dream of horny, greedy goblins fighting over your dick; you awaken to find Cecilia, your hot, dwarven boss, wearing a knowing expression. She has come into some money and decided to hire some extra help. Perfect! Gods know you've been working doubles for as long as you can remember, so this is a welcome surprise! <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1669940/extras/Inn_Fleshout_002_SteamPage.jpg?t=1726603888\" /><br><br>The Half Pint Lady and more importantly you, could seriously use a pair of crafty little hands that can get into all those tight places humans can't reach. So, frivolously, Cecilia's solution is GOBLINS! Not one, not two, but four goblins all vying for the same position. Only one of them will be good enough for the arduous tasks to come, and it's up to you to figure out which one is the most tolerable to work with\u2026 both professionally and otherwise.<br><br>Interact with these four lil' goblins through dialogue sequences, cutscenes, and personal quest lines. By day, show these girls the ropes, keep them out of trouble. Get to know their deepest desires, and by night deal with their salacious, cock-hungry advances. But don\u2019t be fooled; these four shorties may warm your heart or even your cock, but distractions cause disaster!

It turns out that privateering was hard to come by for a plucky goblin in over her head. Instead, she shuffled through ports and taverns, looking for ANYONE  needing a tiny pair of helping hands. All she found were tall tales told and equally tall rejections. After a while, she used these stories to \u2018craft\u2019 her own backstory full of swashbuckling, near-death experiences, and unbelievable outcomes. Alas, few took her stories as honest, and even fewer would welcome her on authentic adventures. So Zaar found herself quickly short of coin and needing a job. Good thing The Half Pint Lady was hiring. Now, surely she can experience a couple of tall tales of her own!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1669940/extras/charBannerK.jpg?t=1726603888\" /><br>The runt of the litter, Kantii was always outshined for attention by her, far more needy and boisterous siblings. She grew up never feeling good enough for real friends, so sought the company of toads and swamp critters. Kantii convinced herself that she\u2019d never live up to her potential and opted to serve others instead. While this sad outlook quickly bottomed out her self-worth, at least she wasn\u2019t completely useless. Helpful or not, no one likes having a melancholy bump on a log, feeling sorry for herself, hanging around all the time, right? So Kantii took leave to travel to the closest inn for work, which\u2026 just happened to be The Half Pint Lady. Maybe working at a bustling tavern is just what she needs\u2026 or perhaps a tall, stiff dose of confidence is what she REALLY needs.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1669940/extras/charBannerD.jpg?t=1726603888\" /><br>Deemah has a lot to live up to, being the daughter of the once famous ledger smith Gemlo The Snide, who pulled the Royal House of Slevosh back from the brink of financial collapse. She grew up without real friends or potential lovers and instead focused on statistics, arithmetic, and gold management. Her no-nonsense way of looking at the world and her overly scrutinous eye meant it didn\u2019t take long for her to excel at every job that came her way. However, just when she thought she\u2019d settled into mid-level management, Deemah fell victim to her own success. Deemah soon found herself the enemy of her less precision-inclined coworkers. How droll! But of course, nothing can stop a goblin of her caliber, and as soon as she saw an ad for The Half Pint Lady; the cogs began to turn. Now THAT was a business she could flex her talents with\u2026<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1669940/extras/charBannerH.jpg?t=1726603888\" /><br>Harulu\u2019s well-connected father is rich beyond measure. She grew up with anything and everything her heart desired. The baby of the family, this big-titted bimbo became the epitome of a spoiled brat and quickly turned into more of a terror than anyone could handle! One after the other her servants quit. Gradually, this started to affect the only thing Daddy cared about more than Harulu herself\u2026his money! Her father then did something so horrible, and so drastic, something Harulu couldn\u2019t believe\u2026 he told her she had to\u2026 get a job! Like, GROSS! Thankfully The Half Pint Lady seems like an easy enough place to lay low and wait for Daddy to come to his senses\u2026 besides, surely there's someone she can entice into doing her work for her, right??<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1669940/extras/charBannerC.jpg?t=1726603888\" /><br>Little is known about Cecilia\u2019s past life before she took over The Half Pint Lady except that it came into her possession after her Uncle was lost on a dwarven expedition. Rumor has it that prior to running the inn, she was a gifted craftswoman who made some of the finest Dwarven armor, weapons, and other strange contraptions. The Half Pint Lady brims with a menagerie of these so-called devices and technologies, but getting the truth out of her is next to impossible. Local legend also says she used to be an adventurer, traveling all around the land with humans and other taller species.
