{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Vermilium</h2>  The new world is the last refuge of humanity, though it is one of untamed wilderness that has been changed by some supernatural force. Both the north and south continents, the Auroras, have grown over the bones of an ancient civilization that now lies in ruin, but this was not always so. They were once home to the Architects, masters of construction, and of the machinery and magic of the old world. At least, they were before The Bleed. According to the natives, the Pale -- the place where all magic originates, and where people's spirits once journeyed after death -- bled into the mortal realm thousands of years ago, changing both forever. <br> Now is a time of antiheroes: bounty hunters, tomb robbers, vigilante drifters, and soldiers of fortune all trying to survive on a dangerous frontier that has yet to be charted, tamed, or even understood. To follow the path of adventure is to accept a life of desperation, never knowing what the next job will be, or where the next meal will come from. <br> Vermilium is a western-inspired, dark fantasy RPG setting for the Savage Worlds Adventure Edition. Explore a world of humans, elves, dwarves, halflings, sasquatch, clockworks, and monsters, built over the ruins of a long-forgotten industrial revolution, all scarred by magic. Delve into crumbling factory complexes; hunt dangerous bounties, terrifying monsters, and ancient artifacts; and harvest supernatural components to craft and concoct weird and wonderful remedies, weapons, and even new items of power to aid you in your adventures. You're going to need them. All this and more awaits you in Vermilium as you take on the roles of antiheroes in a gilded, morally gray world of magic, machines, and manifest destiny. <br> Vermilium comes from humble beginnings at the gaming tables of my friends and I, where it organically grew as we played in it for many years. Since the campaign came to its epic conclusion in 2021, I released a number of award-winning adventures and character archetypes through the Savage Worlds Adventurer's Guild, based on the stories we told.
