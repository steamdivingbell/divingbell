Conquer telepads on the motherboard to get points and power-ups, shoot enemies, beat bosses and maybe, maybe you finally beat the game.<br><br><strong>Concept:</strong> The game value skills such as spatial perception, reactivity, tactical ability and of course the ability to create carpets of bullets as in the original game.<br>You have to prepare yourself to spend some time to master the controllers in this VR TPS to get a feeling for your ship, the distances to the enemies, obstacles and the bullets flight in the air.<br><br><strong>Design:</strong> The game is built up on 7 levels, 6 unique bosses and an end-game mode. The game is designed so it should take approximately 30 minutes to play through all levels. The highscore is central and a more aggresive(risky) playstyle can give more points.<br>The game also have 3 difficulty modes, each with it's own highscore.<br><br>And lastly... there is no autosaves (as in old games) and... you have only one life.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"680x0 boss from past","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1094410/cabfeaf6a3b5cef7535a6ba616e73a4a95915287.jpg"},{"name":"680x0 It's rotating","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1094410/24f77aa093f0aff3f7f68a89e55949748a5f0227.jpg"},{"name":"680x0 Spaceship","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1094410/6e163d6eda87f595a32c9d2ef088c551dea89488.jpg"},{"name":"Kickstart loaded","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1094410/d92a155a14743811d0369a64a5fcc665212f07f2.jpg"},{"name":"You've proven yourself!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1094410/52937a9deebb5a0eaf29c7582cbc59b7ca4be165.jpg"},{"name":"BUG Force Settler","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1094410/76eabd3d17e1b8e320b8766e4a4d0012147c4e01.jpg"},{"name":"BUG Force Explorer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1094410/3312c8a3c6fa5e99b7db57390f88c05faca966dc.jpg"},{"name":"Motherboard control","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1094410/373b69ef7adbf0a8fe2e9b2982049220ca72fef2.jpg"},{"name":"Started to proven yourself","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1094410/a26b32a4650386a33aad43cf8e0b7a3156648686.jpg"},{"name":"Partially proven yourself","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1094410/2dfaa0495189c36c2fac73f91643ab7f060aa226.jpg"}],"total":25},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1094410/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1644080252","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1094410/page.bg.jpg?t=1644080252","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1094410/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1644080252","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1094410/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1644080252","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"B.U.G.
