We started off making education games with the OGRE3D engine back in 2005 (college days) and pursued NSF grants - it didn't work out. After college, we continued to live our lives dispersed across the U.S., celebrated marriages, changed careers and grew our families - along the way we picked up the Unity3D game engine. Our moonlighting finally led us to create Descent of Man.</p><br><h1>Fun Facts</h1><p>The idea for Descent of Man started back in 2014. We wanted to create a game where the enemies hunted the player. Our inspiration was the short story &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot;. The original concept was actually designed to take place on an island - as you can tell some things have changed...okay a lot changed.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The guards use Bayesian Inference (its worth a google) to decide where to look for the player. As the player interacts with the environment, the enemies will see the changes and use the information to search for the player.<br></li><li>The enemies will fight each other if they encounter enemies of a different type - the player can force these encounters.<br></li><li>We really are a horror game that uses STEALTH as a real mechanic. You have a detection meter and everything.<br></li><li>The guards can see your flashlight, so watch where you shine that thing<br></li><li>We have some pretty cool puzzles<br></li><li>The story is historically inspired by the American eugenics movement from the 1900s. Google some of the names of the characters in our game, you might learn something bizarre!<br></li><li>Not a walking simulator</li></ul></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2>You play as Jarrett Reed, a member of a small post-apocalyptic community in a world devastated by disease.
