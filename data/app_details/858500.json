{"about_the_game":"Build towers and defend your lands from a horde of undead miscreants! Three modes of difficulty, including one made with kids in mind (age 5+), and a challenge mode where you must defend your castle while strategically placing your defenses.  Do you have what it takes to defeat Red Skelli and his army? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKid Mode - An easy mode made especially for kids. You start the game with loads of gold, and enemies move at half speed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNormal Mode - You will have access to three different types of towers of varying strengths and costs. As you defeat enemies, you earn gold. You must survive 30 waves of increasingly harder enemies to save your kingdom. The key to victory lies in placing the right towers, in the right place, at the right time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChallenge Mode - Here you will face a two-pronged assault. While building your tower defenses along the main road, you must also defend your keep. Undead will constantly approach from the south and assault your castle. Deal with them swiftly, for if ye olde castle takes too much damage, you will be defeated. You will need quick reflexes, a sound strategy, and a bit of luck to survive.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Perfect Game!
