You can see that for yourself in 3D if you have a suitable viewer such as; Virtual Desktop, BigScreen or a VR headset browser. <br><br>There are many more examples on the application website. The 2D input sample clips shown here have all been sourced as Free Stock Videos from Pexels.<br><br>Unleash the true potential of your video library with the cutting-edge software that revolutionises the way you view 2D videos. Whether you're a VR enthusiast, a proud owner of a 3D projector or TV, or simply seeking an immersive visual experience, Stream to 3D is your gateway to a world of captivating 3D content.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Real-Time Conversion and On-The-Fly Playback</h2><br>With a simple click, watch your 2D videos instantly transform into stunning 3D masterpieces. Stream to 3D allows you to enjoy your favourite content in 3D, converted in real-time, without the tedious process of pre-converting videos. Immerse yourself in a new realm of visual wonder, with depth, detail, and dimensionality that will leave you captivated.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Stream Video in Real-time</h2><br>Stream to 3D also provides first class support for video streaming, which means that you can now stream your real-time converted 2D to 3D videos to a host of new devices including your phone, tablet, laptop, Smart TV or Projector (both 3D and 2D devices are supported - via Colour Anaglyph 3D (Red/Cyan))  as well as stream direct to your VR headset. HTTP Streaming also supports subtitles and audio track selection.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cutting-Edge Technology for Realistic Environments</h2><br>Stream to 3D is powered by advanced algorithms, together with state-of-the-art technology, that ensure every frame is transformed into a realistic 3D environment.<br><br>Dive into your favourite films, TV series, and videos, and be amazed as the visuals leap off the screen, immersing you in a world of unparalleled depth and realism. Experience the magic of 3D like never before, and let Stream to 3D transport you to a whole new dimension of entertainment.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unleash the Power of Off-Line Conversion</h2><br>Stream to 3D also empowers you with off-line conversion capabilities. Convert your 2D videos to 3D one at a time or in batch mode, allowing you to unleash the full potential of your video library. Play on-the-fly converted videos while the off-line conversion takes place in the background, maximising the utilisation of the resources of your machine to deliver the highest quality results. Off-line conversion also supports subtitles as well as videos with multiple audio tracks.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Designed for the VR Community and Beyond</h2><br>Although providing full support for generalised 2D to 3D video conversion tasks, Stream to 3D has been crafted with particular attention to the needs of the VR community. We understand your desire for unparalleled experiences, and our software is optimised to work seamlessly with popular VR media player applications such as; Virtual Desktop, BigScreen, Pigasus and Sky Box VR Player (to name but a few). Combine Stream to 3D with PCVR media players like MPC-HC, PotPlayer, or VLC and unlock a world of 3D possibilities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Handle Any Resolution Video</h2><br>There are no software imposed limits on the resolution of the 2D input video and 3D output. A modest PCVR setup can easily handle 1080p conversion to 3D Full SBS output in real-time, 4K conversion to 3D in real-time is also possible with some parameter tuning.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Frame Rate Conversion</h2><br>3D output is generated at 24 FPS by default, but Stream to 3D can support output frame rates at up to 120 FPS, with a range of standard frame rates in between; 30, 48 and 60. Frame rate conversion is a resource intensive activity, but on a modest 3060 GPU based laptop (for example), real-time conversion frame rates of 48 FPS on 1080p input with HSBS 3D output is quite achievable. Obviously, unless you have a beast of a machine, the higher frame rates would be more appropriate to apply in off-line conversion.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Seamless Integration with VR Headsets</h2><br>Stream to 3D makes it effortless to enjoy your favourite content in stunning 3D on VR headsets. Simply download the Stream to 3D PC Windows application, open your 2D video file (with support for a wide range of formats, including .mkv and .mp4), and witness your videos transform into breathtaking 3D experiences. Whether you're using Virtual Desktop, BigScreen or streaming to an on-headset media player such as Pigasus, Stream to 3D seamlessly integrates with your setup, offering unmatched visual quality.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Customisation and Preset Configurations</h2><br>Tailor your 3D experience to your exact preferences with Stream to 3D's comprehensive customisation options. Create your own configurations for specific scenarios or choose from out-of-the-box presets designed for your favourite 3D media playback solution. All settings are fully customisable through the intuitive user interface, giving you complete control over your 3D experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Connectivity and Security</h2><br>We value your privacy.
