In the 19th century, before the hotel was built, there was nothing but a burial ground of Native Americans. But in 2005, the Hotel was built on the same site and many rituals were performed by some Devil worshipers in the basement of the hotel. It had definitely opened a portal to the spirit world which could not be undone. Jim explored the Hotel to find out more evidence of the Paranormal. But when he discovered the presence of many evil entities he was desperately looking for a way to escape the Hotel. <br><br>Will Jim be able to escape the place unharmed?
