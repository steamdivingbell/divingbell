Albert). Here, a fluid light show flows across the vertically-oriented playfield. The borders optionally display instructions imitating the appearance of a table-top machine, with a hundred-yen sticker helping to suggest the feeling you\u2019re stumbled on an obscure arcade relic. This illusion of D Life being a forgotten game from the \u201980s is assisted by 8-bit fonts and a blissful soundtrack from Yuriko Keino, who wrote the music for Super Pac-Man and Dig Dug. Expectedly, earning a spot on the local leaderboard earns a chiptune serenade that is unbearably soothing.
