{"about_the_game":"Get ready for new type of rhythm action game you may have never experienced before. Listen to various music, dodge various types of obstacles, and successfully finish playing each music to go on to the next level. Be warned, though, the more progress you make, the harder (and even impossible by the looks!) the level becomes for you to finish. (<strong>Note: </strong>This is a demo version of the game, and so will not contain certain features that are going to be included in the actual release of the game)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How This Game Works</h2>In each level, you will see a big circle and a small ball circling around the circle. Your main task here is to control the ball (i.e., put it either <i>outside</i> or <i>inside</i> the big circle) to dodge all the obstacles it encounters along the way and successfully finish the level. Each level is accompanied with certain background music, and it will be a lot helpful you listen to the music while playing the game since all the obstacles are positioned according to specific beats of the music.<br><br>But note that it <i>won't</i> be that simple; the game will do everything it can to prevent you from finishing each level. Most of the time, you will be required to &quot;focus&quot; on the beats and the obstacles no matter what the game does to you, such as changing the size of the circle, the position and/or speed of the ball, changing colors, and even showing off <strong>fake</strong> obstacles!
