{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When the richest CEO on Earth dies, cutthroat conglomerates seek to carve up his kingdom. Using the MERX app, rival businessmen can order private mercenary armies as easily as ordering takeout -- perfect soldiers for the corporate war! Only Rogue Point, an elite, independent vigilante squad, dares to fight back.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Campaign</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dive into the heat of battle in our campaign, where high-octane tactical combat meets strategic planning. Team up, gather intel, and launch assaults against top-tier mercenaries. Face off against the formidable 5 Star Merc, the pinnacle of MERX lethal contractors. Brace for tough, unyielding enemies and relentless action that will push your skills, gear, and teamwork to the extreme.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Relentless Replayability</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Fight and maneuver your way through missions spread across 4 diverse locations:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u25cf     The Airport</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u25cf     The Mall</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u25cf     The Office</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u25cf     The Oilrig</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each sprawling map is reshaped by the game's Parametric Design System, offering new strategies and challenges with every play. The constantly evolving gameplay ensures every mission feels as thrilling and unique as your first, keeping the excitement alive in every campaign.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">AI Classes</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Rogue Point, your enemy is MERX. These mercenaries for hire will challenge your team to strategize and work tactically. Each MERX class has their own AI playstyle that to pack a punch in their own unique way.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Soldier</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your basic grunt class. They carry pistols &amp; assault rifles, throw grenades, and work in a squad. You\u2019ll encounter these a lot in Rogue Point, but they are never to be underestimated. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Berserker</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Juiced up on substances and with no regard for their own life, the Berserker's singular goal is to close the distance and slice your whole team with a machete.  They are agents of chaos and will wreck your carefully crafted game plan. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Sniper</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Heavily fortified in the far distance, snipers will pin your team down and deny you entry into important areas.  Their only tell is the laser beam from their gun, and your teammate\u2019s head exploding next to you. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Heavy</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Heavies are big, slow brutes that don\u2019t take cover and eat bullets.  You can dump all your ammo into them with no effect.  Run the other way, or find their one weakness. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>5-Star Mercenary</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">These legendary MERX commanders have received the top star rating in the app.  Intel on these is sketchy, but we know that these endgame encounters will require your team\u2019s full strength to have a chance to take them down.  If you succeed, take a trophy from their body as proof you have triumphed. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Intuitive Gameplay</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Rogue Point is perfect for both fresh recruits and seasoned veterans, presenting an accessible entry point that reveals layers of depth for those who seek a challenge. Crave fast-paced action or deep, skill-driven gameplay? Rogue Point kicks down the door to a world of relentless, gripping excitement.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Economy</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Earn your keep on the frontlines, then purchase new hardware for your arsenal. Deck out your loadout with hi-tech attachments, and plenty of tactical equipment to make infiltration and extraction a breeze. Master the currency of combat. Own the battlefield on your terms.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build Your Team</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Work as a team to overcome the odds. Rogue Point is purpose-built to reinforce teamplay and pull players into the combat. You have to adapt, overcome, fight, and manoeuvre with your squad to win. Start with nothing more than a pistol and an armoured vest and earn an elite arsenal through successful missions and strategic team play.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Risk VS Reward</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Rogue Point has teams taking risks not just on mission, but in the planning and loadout stages as well. Use the game's Dead Drop for a chance at getting the best gear, and specialized weapons you cannot get anywhere else.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Weapons and Customization</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Complete missions to earn money and buy useful weapons and gear.
