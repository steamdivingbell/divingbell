{"about_the_game":"The art of rally OST has been masterfully composed and produced by self-taught musician Tatreal (aka Slava Korystov), from his studio in Kryvyi Rih, Central Ukraine. The OST is comprised of a massive 57 original tracks, each one exploring Tatreal\u2019s unique take on the much-loved Synthwave genre. Like a long Sunday drive through the alps, the soundtrack takes players on a 4+ hour journey \u2014 weaving its way through classic 70\u2019s, 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s homages to acts such as Kraftwerk, Daft Punk, ELO and Cerrone. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPaying special attention to authenticity, Tatreal employs classic drum-machines such as the Roland TR 707 and Yamaha RY 30, as well as virtual instruments like the Jupiter 8 and Moog Modular. The result is a striking and catchy beatscape that perfectly meshes with the rich ambience players will find themselves speeding through in art of rally.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1297600/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1701230426","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1297600/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1701230426","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1297600/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1701230426","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1297600/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1701230426","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The art of rally OST has been masterfully composed and produced by self-taught musician Tatreal (aka Slava Korystov), from his studio in Kryvyi Rih, Central Ukraine.
