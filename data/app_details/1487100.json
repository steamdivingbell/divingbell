In order to overcome insurmountable odds, the hero, Chrona, must manipulate the flow of time in order to gain advantages over opponents. Additionally, you will be able to discover various 'Magi' throughout the game, of which Chrona can transform into and gain different combat abilities. By changing Magi, you are able to effectively change your combat style and weapon of choice. Chrona herself is also able to learn abilities that will help you navigate the treacherous world. However, Chrona must learn to live with the consequences of her actions, and find out what her choices say about her.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1487100/extras/shizukapipe.gif?t=1678248094\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> A large world to explore, seamlessly and meticulously connected.<br></li><li> Overcome many bosses, foes, and puzzles, all which may require the use of your time control abilities.<br></li><li> Play and level up various playable &quot;Magi&quot; found throughout the game.
