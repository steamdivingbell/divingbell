{"about_the_game":"Even an infamous bounty hunter needs to let off a little steam sometimes and Chucho could do with a little sun. Equipped with two water pistols, a swim ring, and an inflatable plastic mammal, he's ready to just lie in the sand and work on that tan a little. That said... the water pistols look surprisingly similar to his regular pistols with some cool modifications, and you can hear a couple of sticky bombs rattling under his swim ring. Who ever said you can't be ready to collect bounties AND relax on the beach at the same time? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis DLC contains a custom skin for Chucho Krokk in Awesomenauts. You need to have Chucho Krokk available as a playable character in order to access the skin in-game. Owning this skin will also unlock the special portrait for use in-game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/399832/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1493970521","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/399832/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1493970521","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/399832/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1493970521","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/399832/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1493970521","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Valve Anti-Cheat enabled","id":8},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Even an infamous bounty hunter needs to let off a little steam sometimes and Chucho could do with a little sun.
