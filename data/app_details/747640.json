{"about_the_game":"In this instant arcade classic, you play as Harambe, the famous silverback gorilla.  Your goal is to survive as long as possible, running around the cage, dodging kids and collecting fruit.  As the days progress, the number of kids increases making the game more difficult.  Touch a kid and its instant death by the barrel of the zoo keeper's rifle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe kids will never jump, they fall into the cage and walk across platforms eventually making their way to the cave.  Once they've hit the cave, they will exit, and a piece of fruit will drop.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou must keep Harambe alive by avoiding kids.  Collect fruit, hamburgers, treasure chests and computers to get the high score!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/747640/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1593641580","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/747640/page.bg.jpg?t=1593641580","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/747640/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1593641580","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/747640/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1593641580","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In this instant arcade classic, you play as Harambe, the famous silverback gorilla.
