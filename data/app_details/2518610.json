{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Where Beasts Were Born</h2>is an experimental <strong>Action-RPG</strong> in which the creatures you fight against <strong>evolve and learn</strong> from previous rounds.<br><br>On your search for magical powers, you make your way through underground caves and tunnels, only to discover that they are filled with creatures of all sorts. These creatures want to protect their habitat from intruders and you need to fight to get past them. But there is a twist - due to the magical forces amongst which they live, the creatures mutate and evolve.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How it works:</h2>Each round, the game collects statistics about the creature's performance and (using a genetic algorithm) lets the best creatures breed the next generation for the next round. In this way, creatures adapt to your playstyle and become better and smarter. <strong>Prepare to die - many, many times.</strong><br><br>The backbone of the game is a creature generator which generates creatures from DNA strings. By mixing, interpolating and mutating these strings, we can create creatures that mix, interpolate and mutate - and simulate evolution.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2518610/extras/ezgif-4-8ed47d7b75.gif?t=1735939584\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Development</h2>Where Beasts Were Born is under active development by a (currently) very small team.
