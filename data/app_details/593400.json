Industrial buildings and pipe systems can be constructed in 3D infrastructure software. Different colours are used to help us find our way round the three-dimensional plans and indicate the diameter of the pipes. When we see these garishly coloured pipes running through an equally brightly coloured room, we are reminded of a glorious children\u2019s playground, but they can actually be traced back to the functionality of the programme.</p><br><h1>Act Natural</h1><p>with Joe Hamilton, Rick Silva and Kim Laughton\r\nComing to VR soon!\r\n\r\nIn January 2014, a picture turned up on a number of news platforms. It showed a screen swathed in deep grey smog standing in Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square. On it a huge sun shone out of a blood-red sky. According to the headlines, Beijing\u2019s residents were so hungry for daylight that virtual sunrises were being set up on screens all over the city. The report was false; it was only a scene from an advert. It had been readily believed; for a public conditioned to computer-generated worlds, a simulated sunrise was an absurd but feasible scenario.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Float Gallery is a new kind of exhibition space for contemporary art which focuses on digital instead of physical spaces.
