Oscillator synchronisation works only on analogue waves, not samples, and produces a sweeping robotic effect used in many 1980s-era pop songs. To use the effect, modulate the pitch of an analogue wave such as the Pulse Wave. Change the pitch quite strongly, try a sine wave modulator with a large depth to create a sound like a slow police siren.

This engine will apply its effect to all analogue waves present.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPositor is a wave shaping effect. Positor will flip any wave values below zero, then expands the wave to once again fill the whole signal. When the Positor is applied to a sine wave the wave will resembling rolling hills, and a saw wave becomes a triangle wave. When applied to samples the effect is often distortion. Apply the effect after a filter sweep for some interesting sounds. Note that due to the sample by sample nature of this effect, anti-aliased engines may sound quite different to non-anti-aliased engines when fed through this effect. Applying this engine after a saw wave in particular can produce noisy results when the engines are anti-aliased. This effect can upset the DC-offset of resulting samples.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2729320/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734436165","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2729320/page.bg.jpg?t=1734436165","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2729320/f130a94e66240abceebb26db91b1cabf45ee881a/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734436165","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2729320/f130a94e66240abceebb26db91b1cabf45ee881a/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734436165","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Special Engines Bolt-on contains 6 new special effect engines to boost capabilities of SFXEngine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDerez will lower the resolution of the sound in the same way that block-pixelisation lowers the quality of an image.
