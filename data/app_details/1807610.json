{"about_the_game":"Skeleton Scramble Deluxe is a fast-paced, head-to-head real-time strategy game, with a focus on local multiplayer.<br><br>You will take on the role of a necromancer, gathering resources to summon an army of skeletons and frantically building a gauntlet of defenses to fend off your opponent, (or a computer-controlled bot.) An innovative upgrade system lets you build units on top of one another to create new creatures and buildings, adding strategic depth without adding complexity to the controls.<br><br>Controls are simple and easy to learn, allowing new players to jump right into the action! Play one-handed using only the mouse, connect multiple controllers, or play head-to-head with a friend using a shared keyboard! Your army will move and attack autonomously, allowing you to focus on what to build, and when/where to build it. Most games last under 5 minutes, allowing you to experiment with bold new strategies, or rotate between players in group settings. Maps can be generated randomly, allowing for a more chaotic experience.<br><br>Planned Launch Features:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>2 player local versus with 5 control schemes<br></li><li>10 CPU-controlled bots with a variety of strategies and difficulties<br></li><li>Interactive Tutorial<br></li><li>Score-based Survival Mode<br></li><li>Rogue-lite Gauntlet Mode with stacking player-selected curses</li></ul>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1807610?t=1707750447","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1807610?t=1707750447","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1807610/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1707750447","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1807610/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1707750447","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Skeleton Scramble Deluxe is a fast-paced, head-to-head real-time strategy game, with a focus on local multiplayer.<br><br>You will take on the role of a necromancer, gathering resources to summon an army of skeletons and frantically building a gauntlet of defenses to fend off your opponent, (or a computer-controlled bot.)
