{"about_the_game":"Clan N is a beat'em up game which combines the classic arcades gameplay with today's modern brawlers. With a pick up and play nature, it's not only easy to play but also hard to master. You have to dodge, block and use your heavy/special attacks wisely to progress. With an ancient far east theme, you'll get challenged across 7 different levels with many different enemies, mid/end level bosses and casual mini games integrated into main gameplay.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1111230/extras/ActionShot1.gif?t=1588629037\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A fast paced beatemup which combines the classic arcades gameplay with today's modern brawlers.<br></li><li>A main story with 7 levels divided into more than 50 sections.<br></li><li>Levels contain casual minigames which are tightly integrated into the main story and can be played separately as well.<br></li><li>Can be played as local or online coop with up to 4 players.<br></li><li>A slick and clean pixel based graphics with accompanying far east inspired music and sfx.</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1111230/extras/ActionShot2.gif?t=1588629037\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Demo</h2><br>This (alpha) demo allows you to play a portion of the first level single or with up to 4 of your friends locally.
