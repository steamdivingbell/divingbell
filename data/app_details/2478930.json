{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Shadow of the Demon Lord The Queen Of Gold</h2>   <br> <br> <strong> The Queen of Gold: Tales of the Pirate Isles</strong> <br> <br> An 11-adventure campaign for Shadow of the Demon Lord <br>  <br> The Queen of Gold presents eleven connected adventures that form a complete campaign. You can run the adventures in the order they are presented in this book, or pick out the adventures you like most. <br> Set in the world of Shadow of the Demon Lord, characters will rise from meager origins to the heights of power as they struggle with evils coming from beyond the world's edge, a malevolence from which there is no escape. Like other adventures designed for Shadow, this campaign has no expectations for survival or even success, and it's entirely possible for the group to be the catalyst that brings about the end of all things. But that's how it goes when you're standing before the maw of the endless Void that is about to consume the world--and everyone's looking to you to stop it. <br>  <br> Important note: <br> This product is a complete, fully detailed campaign. However, there are notably fewer images than other FG products. Please look at the product images. Importantly, if you run combat encounters on maps, then the carefully go over the following list before purchasing. <br> You will need a copy of Shadow of the Demon Lord and Demon Lord's Companion to use this product. The Death and Spiritualism traditions are detailed in the Companion , along with a few creatures used in these adventures. You might also find the Shadow of the Demon Lord Freeport Companion useful, which includes a slew of rules for voyages and ship combat, along with paths and spells designed for maritime adventures. And Beyond the World's Edge provides detailed descriptions of several locations mentioned in this adventure, though the salient bits are included here. <br>  <br> Encounter Maps <br> Many encounters assume Theatre of the Mind. You may wish to have the following generic need several generic maps of wilderness and urban locations. Following is a list of suggested maps for encounters. If you do not have a specific map, then a rough approximation should work. <br>  <br> Ch 2 Night of Terrors <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li> beach <br> </li><li> forest <br> </li><li> cottage or hut </li></ul>   <br> Ch 3 Blood for a Child <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li> village </li></ul>   <br> Ch 4 Flying Colors <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li> (map provided) </li></ul>   <br> Ch 5 The Cursed Snuffbox <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li> village or town </li></ul>   <br> Ch 6 The Eelwives' Lament <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li> town </li></ul>   <br> Ch 7 The Lurid Lighthouse <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li> beach <br> </li><li> three storied ruins <br> </li><li> underground cavern half-filled with water </li></ul>   <br> Ch 8 The Queen in Exile <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li> a large sea cave partially filled with water <br> </li><li> jungle <br> </li><li> a small cavern with a pool of magma </li></ul>   <br> Ch 9 Show Down at Float Town <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li> an artificial island created from several shipwrecks lashed together <br> </li><li> a pirate ship </li></ul>   <br> Ch 10 She Who Eats the Sky <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li> jungle <br> </li><li> jungle village </li></ul>   <br> Ch 11 Nightmares of the Sleeper <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li> mountain path <br> </li><li> camp site <br> </li><li> large cavern </li></ul>   <br> Ch 12 The Necromancer's Mountain <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li> (map provided)</li></ul>   &quot;","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2478930/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1689687867","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2478930/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1689687867","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2478930/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1689687867","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2478930/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1689687867","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Shadow of the Demon Lord The Queen Of Gold</h2>   <br> <br> <strong> The Queen of Gold: Tales of the Pirate Isles</strong> <br> <br> An 11-adventure campaign for Shadow of the Demon Lord <br>  <br> The Queen of Gold presents eleven connected adventures that form a complete campaign.
