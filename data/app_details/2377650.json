{"about_the_game":"Inspired by similar &quot;Stick&quot; models from the past and based on the more modern-day design of Ultra Stick models, the Slow Ultra Stick is a &quot;slow flyer&quot; that also offers a wide range of performance and capabilities to deliver a unique flying experience unlike any other model available today! Use a 2S battery for slow flying indoors in large gymnasiums and other suitable spaces, in many yards, at most parks and sports fields \u2013 and to perform basic aerobatics including loops, rolls, and inverted flight. Or use a 3S 1300\u20132200mAh battery to hover and perform even more aggressive aerobatics thanks to the stiff and fully-molded EPO tails and wing with a semi-symmetrical airfoil. You can even install a second aileron servo to take advantage of the added capabilities flaperons and spoilerons offer. The Slow Ultra Stick is simple yet extremely capable while also being incredibly easy to fly for low-time pilots looking for a perfect &quot;Next Step&quot; after a trainer model and for experienced pilots looking for a model that offers a no hassles &quot;mild to wild&quot; flight experience they can't get with any other model.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nThis model is equipped with Horizon Hobby and Spektrum exclusive AS3X (Artificial Stabilization \u2013 3-aXis) and optional-use SAFE (Sensor Assisted Flight Envelope) Select technologies, and when SAFE Select is turned on using the mode switch (B on the Spektrum InterLink DX controller) it offers: <br />\r\n <br />\r\nPitch and Bank Angle Limits <br />\r\nThese envelope limits keep the airplane from rolling or pitching upside down.

It\u2019s also helpful for keeping the wings level during takeoffs and landings.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2377650/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1684359952","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2377650/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1684359952","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2377650/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1684359952","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2377650/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1684359952","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Inspired by similar &quot;Stick&quot; models from the past and based on the more modern-day design of Ultra Stick models, the Slow Ultra Stick is a &quot;slow flyer&quot; that also offers a wide range of performance and capabilities to deliver a unique flying experience unlike any other model available today!
