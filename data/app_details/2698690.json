Each fighter has unique special moves and attacks, but that's not all \u2013 each one has a story to uncover and exclusive stages to conquer. Initially, you can choose from Hiroshi, Miss Devil, and Pawat. However, by earning coins through completing the game, you can unlock the other three secret characters!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2698690/extras/2_Mix.png?t=1708366013\" /><br>Champion Road combines the gameplay of classic action-platformers with the combat typical of arcade beat 'em ups from the 80s and 90s. Easy to pick up but extremely satisfying for those seeking action without frills. The tournament-style setting, reminiscent of classic Fighting Games, makes Champion Road unique in its concept!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2698690/extras/3_Get_ready.png?t=1708366013\" /><br>In addition to the main mode, the game also offers exciting unlockable modes: 1vs1, Survival, and Art Gallery. Through the in-game store, you can unlock interesting extras such as additional palettes and unreleased sketches.
