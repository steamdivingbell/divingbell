This dark fantasy version of the Arthurian mythology invites you to manage a team of heroes on the dangerous battlefield, while also engaging in moral choices, hero management, and the rebuilding of Camelot.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1157390/extras/anim_Gameplay_New.gif?t=1715275835\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The dark fate of the kingdom</h2>Explore a land of nightmares where vile monsters and magical creatures lurk within castles and forests. The battle between Arthur and Mordred brought death, both of them falling at the hands of each other, and now the consequences unfold. Arthur, resurrected in Avalon, is now an undying mad king, his pain slowly turning this magical place into a nightmare version of Britannia. You are Mordred, brought back to life to find Arthur, and ultimately, kill him to end this accursed condition.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1157390/extras/anim_Resurrect.gif?t=1715275835\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Round Table reborn</h2>Gather your knights and send them on quests involving deep, tactical battles! Assemble a team of heroes, selecting from six classes (Defender, Champion, Marksman, Vanguard, Arcanist, Sage). Level them up, gain unique skill points, equip the best items looted from missions. But beware! Heroes can die, and the treatment of their injuries, curses, diseases take time. Between missions, make sure that Camelot has the right facilities for recovery, and prepare different heroes for different quests.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1157390/extras/anim_Roundtable.gif?t=1715275835\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A question of loyalty</h2>Heroes are your main resources \u2013 but no mere numbers! They have their own distinct personalities, goals, rivalries (even unique traits, skills and bond benefits). They will observe your decisions closely! Settle disputes, grant favours, select heroes who can work together, send them on missions they are comfortable with. Tread carefully, because their loyalty depends on many factors. They can even leave and turn against you!<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1157390/extras/headline2_heroes_notext.png?t=1715275835\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The making of a monarch</h2>You, as a king, have a personality as well, shaped by your actions and moral choices.

Those looking for even more challenge can also try Roguelite Mode. Here, every small decision matters \u2013 not only the moral choices, but actions taken in the turn-based combat as well. The campaign unfolds with a roguelite twist: no reloads, only regrets! The thrill of dealing with the consequences is half the fun, but your decisions also affect the story. Each playthrough can unfold differently, branching in unexpected ways.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1157390/extras/anim_Zombies.gif?t=1715275835\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The end is only the beginning</h2>Play through the campaign (once or see multiple paths), and after that, you unlock the endgame, reserved only for the bravest.
