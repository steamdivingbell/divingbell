{"about_the_game":"&quot; <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fallout RPG - Once Upon a Time in the Wasteland</h2>Explore the Nuclear-Ravaged Wastelands outside of Boston.  Once Upon a Time in the Commonwealth is a short campaign told in three quests, ideally meant to be played by a gamemaster (GM) and four-to-six players over several sessions. Player characters (PCs) should begin at level 1, though GMs wanting a less challenging game may choose to start the group at a higher level instead. Pre-gen characters for six level 1 characters are included in this starter set.  The campaign introduces the game rules as the story develops. By the end of the campaign, the group should be comfortable with the 2d20 System and able to run further quests in Fallout 2d20 with the help of the core rulebook. Though many rules are introduced and taught within this quest line, you are strongly encouraged to read the Core Rule Book and refer to it with your players when teaching the rules.  The campaign is suitable for first time players playing new or pre-generated characters but can incorporate existing characters too.\u00a0   Important Note for Fantasy Grounds users:   This campaign was originally designed to be used with the Fallout RPG Starter Rules booklet and other materials included in this Starter Set boxed set; however, it has been modified to work with the Core Rulebook included with the Fallout RPG Ruleset for Fantasy Grounds.
