{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Welcome to the World of Vorax</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Vorax</i> is an open-world survival horror game set on a Mediterranean island plagued by a deadly, mysterious infection. You are a mercenary sent to investigate the island, only to discover that what was supposed to be a simple mission has turned into a desperate struggle for survival. The island is crawling with mutated monsters, nests of biomass replicating living beings, and dangerous terrain that will test your resilience, wits, and courage.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>About the Vorax Basic Version</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We\u2019re thrilled to present the <strong>Vorax Basic Version</strong>, a comprehensive experience that lets you explore the full world of Vorax without major content restrictions. The Basic Version is a near-complete version of the game, allowing players to fully immerse themselves in the island, face the terrors that lurk in its dark corners, and survive by any means necessary. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The only difference between the Basic Version and the Full Version is how saving works.</strong> </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the<strong> Basic Version, </strong>you can only save your progress at <strong>checkpoints</strong>. This means every decision is crucial, every encounter could be your last, and there is always the tension of getting to the next safe point. This restriction adds to the survival horror atmosphere, making every moment on the island feel even more dangerous and consequential. It brings a true sense of challenge, ensuring that survival feels earned. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">However, in the <strong>Full Version</strong>, you have the freedom to save anytime, anywhere, giving you far more control over how you navigate the island. This is a complete game changer. It allows you to experiment freely, take more risks, and dive deeper into the game world without the constant anxiety of where the next save point will be. This freedom is perfect for those who want to explore without limits, making it easier to adapt to different play styles and schedules. Whether you have a few minutes or a few hours, the Full Version allows you to fully engage without the constraints of checkpoint-only saves.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We took this approach because we want as many people as possible to experience the world of Vorax. The Basic Version offers a significant and genuine experience while highlighting how much more convenient and strategic the Full Version can be. Plus, since the Basic Version is <strong>identical to the Full Version in content</strong>, it will receive <strong>every update, patch, and improvement</strong> that the Full Version gets. This means you\u2019ll always be playing the most current version of Vorax, whether you decide to continue with the Demo or upgrade to the Full Version. Your feedback will be instrumental in shaping the game as we continue our journey through Early Access, and we need your insights more than ever.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We are confident that this is the best approach\u2014not only does it allow players to experience the essence of Vorax without barriers, but it also provides you with an option to enhance your gameplay experience if you decide to upgrade. It\u2019s about giving you the choice and letting you decide how you want to face the horrors of the island.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Key Features of Vorax Basic and Full Version:</strong> </p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Survival Horror at its Core:</strong> Face off against a variety of mutated creatures in an ever-changing environment that keeps you on your toes.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Open World Exploration:</strong> Traverse a large, detailed Mediterranean island filled with secrets, dangers, and resources.
