{"about_the_game":"Bombardier is a 2 - 4 local multiplayer game, the players are pitted against each other and it is a battle of wits and mettle to be the last one standing. Each map has a limited amount of space with its own environmental dangers and comes with an assortment of Special Bombs. All levels are hectic and fast paced and if you pay attention you can use the environmental dangers to your advantage and outsmart your friends. Place bombs in strategic locations, kick them to your frenemies or simply use the <i>SharkZooka</i> to give them a taste of what an angry shark can do. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1899200/extras/SharkZooka.gif?t=1696105768\" /><br><br><strong>Play your own way!</strong><br>Go in <i>bombs blazin'</i> or take the strategic approach and gather special bombs before raining down destruction to be crowned <i>King of the Hill</i>!
