{"about_the_game":"<strong>Burning Sun</strong> is a narrative-driven adventure game set on an ancient holy city of Igra struck by a mysterious crisis: sun has been suddenly turned to eleven. Even a second too long in the sun and you will be burnt to crisp. Enduring the relentless heat, it is up to you to explore the city by dashing from shadow to shadow, aquiring tools and evading bone-crushing golems. What could have caused this? Who <i>-or what</i> is behind the mystery? <br><br>During your journey, your actions can and will change the lives of the other citizens, as theirs will change yours. In every crisis there is an opportunity, and in the holy city of Igra, opportunists are bountiful. Be careful who you help, and who you anger. <br><br>The game has multiple endings to explore, and the game world changes in accordance to the actions of the player. Will you be revered as the hero who saved the city, a diplomat who escalated or de-escalated the internal conflicts, or even as the nightmarish demon of death?","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1192490?t=1728484856","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1192490?t=1728484856","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1192490/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728484856","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1192490/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728484856","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Burning Sun</strong> is a narrative-driven adventure game set on an ancient holy city of Igra struck by a mysterious crisis: sun has been suddenly turned to eleven.
