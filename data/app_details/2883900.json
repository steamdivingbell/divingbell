{"about_the_game":"Two down-on-their-luck detectives, Joe and Dan, are overdue on their rent. After months of dodging payments, they're facing eviction from their seedy apartment if they don't make some cash. Then one day, a sorcerer appears to the pair and tells them that they're the legendary heroes as foretold in an ancient prophecy! Great riches await, but only if they travel back to medieval times and defeat some sort of ancient evil that's risen up. Yeah, why not, right? It's either that or going back to live with their parents. (They said a detective agency was a bad idea. Yeah, right!) <br />\r\n<br />\r\nArmed with nothing more than their guns, wits, and a dismembered ancient hand, Joe and Dan travel back to the past to secure their future, all while solving cases along the way. Fight your way through waves of enemies, and solve the mysteries of the past!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGameplay features:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-A turn based battle system where you can fight enemies. Defeat monsters and obtain EXP to level up!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Character customization that allows you to change your outfits and weapons in-game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-An overworld environment that you can walk around in freely. In this setting, you can interact with NPCs, buy items, rent a room at an inn, and more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-A prominent Chemistry aspect. Fighting together with your party members increases your friendship with each other, which can give you an advantage in battle!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-An in-game soundroom, theater, and gallery where you can listen to music, watch cutscenes, and view game art.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2883900/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729975365","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2883900/page.bg.jpg?t=1729975365","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2883900/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729975365","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2883900/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729975365","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2886070,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Two down-on-their-luck detectives, Joe and Dan, are overdue on their rent.
