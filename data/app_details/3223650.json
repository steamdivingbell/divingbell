{"about_the_game":"Trapped In The Omniverse: The Infinite Confluence is a challenging first-person survival game that combines interdimensional exploration with adventure and survival. You find yourself lost in the mysterious Antechambers of Quantum Dynamics, where reality blends and distorts. Your mission is to restore the Cosmoportal, the only means to return home, while facing creatures and overcoming obstacles in a chaotic environment. With exploration mechanics, strategic combat, and resource management, every step brings you closer to uncovering the secrets of the multiverses and finding your way back home. Can you restore balance and find the exit before it\u2019s too late?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3223650/extras/Trapped_In_The_Omniverse0021.jpg?t=1735917055\" /><br><br>Quantum Dynamics was a pioneering company in quantum mechanics and its applications during its peak in the 70s and 80s.
