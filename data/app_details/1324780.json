{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Easy Red 2</strong> is the game for those who know just what they want from a World War 2 shooter: <strong>simulation</strong> in weapons and mechanics, <strong>historical accuracy</strong> in battles, and <strong>expansive maps</strong> leaving room for large-scale <strong>infantry and vehicle combat</strong> alike. </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In this new version of Easy Red, we wrote everything from scratch to reach a quality of game mechanics and optimization to manage and graphical design that looks appealing yet also runs well on lower-end machines. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fronts of War</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Easy Red 2 vanilla, you will be taken to  the European, African and Pacific fronts of the war. On the European front, you will be taken to the shores of <strong>Anzio, Italy</strong>- working your way towards the bombed peaks of <strong>Monte Cassino</strong>. You will also be taken to <strong>Kos</strong>- the Greek island invaded by the Germans in 1943. In the Pacific, you will go to <strong>Kwajalein</strong>- the Japanese-occupied island invaded by the United States Marine Corps in 1944. Finally with the Africa campaign you will fight in the tropical biomes of Tunisia. More theaters are available with very cheap expansion packs.<br>Considering all base game and DLC campaigns, the game contains <strong>over 100 missions.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you can view in the changelogs <u>here</u>, during most of 2021, 2022 and 2023, Easy Red 2 received at least an update a week, usually more.

For example, while the main objective of the greater team may be to conquer a specific area, a sub-objective could be requesting a tank to clear its way from an anti-tank gun that has been sighted, or getting your squad to take out that anti-tank gun yourself. This allows the gameplay to play out slightly differently each time depending on how everything plays out. </p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1324780/extras/squad_orders.gif?t=1737800535\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Vehicles</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">War machines changed warfare forever, and the second world war proved that unequivocally.
