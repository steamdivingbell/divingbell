And possibly quite brilliant, too. I\u2019ve never played anything like it, to be honest. It\u2019s at once an obsessively complex deep dive into maritime history, but set in a strange fantasy world, and a weirdo RPG about being a pirate. There\u2019s worker placement activities. There\u2019s dialogue segments. There are resource management elements. Ship-to-ship combat involves a (fucking astonishing) typing game, and then a sort of side scrolling beat \u2019em up bit? A huge element of the game revolves around managing your relationship with the ship\u2019s captain, and choosing how often to contradict their orders. There\u2019s eerie, awful, brilliant music. It occasionally reminded me of Dwarf Fortress. What I\u2019m saying is, there\u2019s no way of summarising A Pirate Quartermaster in a couple of paragraphs. It was like a game made in a parallel universe with entirely different ideas about what a game should be like, and I\u2019ve rarely encountered something with such a hit rate of entirely original mechanics. The demo only let me dip a toe into this odd and salt-stained world, so it\u2019s hard to say whether the full game is likely to be entirely engrossing, or a barely-playable mess. Either way though, and I don\u2019t say this lightly, it\u2019s some kind of masterpiece.
