{"about_the_game":"<strong>What is Bodyscope?</strong><br><br>Bodyscope is not merely a game; however, it offers an interactive experience akin to one. It serves as a professional tool suitable for use by both experts and novices, facilitating the visualization of CT and MRI images in Virtual Reality. Each CT or MRI study comprises numerous 2D scans, which are utilized to construct 3D models in Virtual Reality. The complexity of the construction process increases with the number of scans in the study.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The purpose of Bodyscope is to:</h2><br>Generate realistic 3D models from real MRI and CT/PET images in VR, enabling easy comprehension of radiology data even without advanced spatial vision.<br>Enhance understanding of MRI or CT/PET by allowing users to take an active role in learning through interaction with 3D models of real studies, rather than solely exploring cross-sectional or rendered images.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">With Bodyscope, users can:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Scale models to explore specific body parts in detail;<br></li><li>Apply a set of presets, distinct for CT and MRI images, to visualize specific tissues by density;<br></li><li>Cut pieces of VR models with special tools;<br></li><li>Take measurements of any element;<br></li><li>Enable additional lighting features to highlight elements of the interest;<br></li><li>Slice the model at any angle to remove interfering structures.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Collaborate with friends or colleagues</h2>Bodyscope has evolved beyond a technology generating hyper-realistic 3D patient data from CTs and MRIs enhancing situational awareness and spatial orientation for medical students and professionals.
