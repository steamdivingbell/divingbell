{"about_the_game":"Taking the form of wacky shenanigans and a first-person experience of a bad trip, Californium pays homage to sci-fi legend Philip K.

Will you find what\u2019s behind the simulacra ?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBerkeley, 1967. Experience the perils of coming down off acid, a post-breakup bout of depression, and the anguish of a dying career: Welcome to the life of Elvin Green, a science fiction writer in deep distress. Get ready for a sensory trip that will derail your sense of reality and replace it with powerful hallucinations. You spend your time and money on drugs and cheap alcohol, and are plagued by insomnia and struggles with blank page syndrome. Vague memories of your wife Thea and your editor Don bleed into each other. Everything you thought was real starts to crumble.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt would be so simple to give in to the promises of alternate realities, each one more attractive than the next\u2026 Will you let these ever-present voices take control of your mind? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCalifornium plunges you into a psychedelic world, leaving you searching for glitches in the matrix.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDarjeeling, Nova Production and ARTE France are proud to present this downright love letter to the world of Philip K. Dick. Experience counterintuitive art direction by Olivier Bonhomme (Homo Machina), an exhilarating soundtrack by Xavier Thiry, and an incredible performance by actor Paul Bandey in the part of the mysterious Theta.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Berkeley","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/402060/af8da2a8b11d154de6b3c85872c647c59a1aac91.jpg"},{"name":"California","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/402060/8ef398ac05b0c947769cdd6522a6488a6fa5dfb0.jpg"},{"name":"Mars","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/402060/634bbaba2c4eba2c24c32319b2ac83c0db3e81b9.jpg"},{"name":"Chaos","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/402060/78b696608144559a0ee155abdb0a8bcf075b99e6.jpg"},{"name":"Who are you Elvin Green ?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/402060/1cd2a1fe10a4d6f8b37ca7fdf6841acb2c90e0c5.jpg"},{"name":"Happy February 12th!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/402060/a4c201499bf7f36f4d75ec2eadce55cb1f8dc2b3.jpg"},{"name":"The exegesis","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/402060/f750ddf2ea6884d747a3ac5205c1b84711986ac8.jpg"},{"name":"Characters","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/402060/bb927117b2c1a16f4c23c148cdad433ce1eb6e07.jpg"}],"total":8},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/402060/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727787771","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/402060/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1727787771","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/402060/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727787771","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/402060/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727787771","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Taking the form of wacky shenanigans and a first-person experience of a bad trip, Californium pays homage to sci-fi legend Philip K.
