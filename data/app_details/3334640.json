{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> <strong>It's About Time</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Play as <strong>William Roger</strong>, a university student with a promising future. It's 1994, you awake after a terrible nightmare. You're late for school! With lack of sleep and nutrition, you &quot;<strong>accidentally</strong>&quot; activate the professors \u201c<strong>Camera</strong>\u201d and get sucked into the past.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Lost and alone in this strange place with your wits and no knowledge of where to go next, uncover the many mysteries of why you are here and at all costs, find your way back home before time runs out.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>THINGS SEEM A LITTLE ODD</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Why does everything look a little off? Why are there weird <strong>artifacts</strong> scattered around? And why do I have so much sand in my shoe?</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Up against the clock so to speak. The <strong>countdown</strong> on the <strong>Camera</strong> has started.

Gather more and more independence and discover your own self as well as love, friendship and loss as you venture forward through time.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>OH NO! MY BOOK!</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The pages from your trusty book, <strong>The Time Travelers Book of Questions (with no real answers)</strong>, have been scattered around all of time.
