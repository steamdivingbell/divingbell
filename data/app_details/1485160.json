{"about_the_game":"Black Noise is a classic dark adventure game set in a world of whimsical insanity and surrealism. You play as a dying girl named Emily. She knows when she will die. She is losing control of her flesh, drifting farther and farther from the present, slowly being getting stuck in the past. Her soul, stuck in the future, is waiting for her on the day of her death. Emily must discard of her increasingly useless body, take back her soul, and leave her world so that she may be birthed anew into a life where she will not die.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><br>    <ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Stay awake long enough to find a safe place to sleep before you are too tired to go on any further.<br>    </li><li>Steal the lifeless corpses of creatures and wear them to wield their strengths and weaknesses. <br>    </li><li>Conduct rituals and spells to manipulate the world to your whim.<br>    </li><li>Manage your waning mental health before you lose sight of what is real and what isn't.<br>    </li><li>Fend off or flee from wicked terrors.<br>    </li><li>Make friends and interact with those who don't want to hurt you.<br>    </li><li>Vast replayability with multiple endings and bonus content for completing the game.<br>    </li><li>Nostalgic and beautiful replication of early 2000s graphics.<br>    </li><li>Full controller and keyboard/mouse support so you can play however you choose.<br></li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1485160/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1666214754","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1485160/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1666214754","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1485160/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1666214754","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1485160/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1666214754","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent violence and general mature content."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Black Noise is a classic dark adventure game set in a world of whimsical insanity and surrealism.
