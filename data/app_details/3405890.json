The gameplay balances all of these mechanics in a one-of-a-kind package, tailored directly to how you project yourself onto the main character. Control with WASD, or arrow keys, ENTER, and ESCAPE. You will not need a mouse, though some mouse inputs have a similar effect as your intended keybinds would. Birdworld features instances of horror, tragedy, and nudity. Nudity may be toggled, but not entirely removed, through an item that is obtained before the first instance. Battles are encountered through overworld interactions, not random chance in the wild. You have access to several actions during your turn and can recruit other characters to help you wail on monsters more efficiently. Birdworld is in no way meant to be erotic through its themes of nudity, but is meant to strengthen its absurdity and increasingly harrowing tale. Several endings and routes are available to discover, and only several attempts at beating the game will reward you with different outcomes. Does it really matter?
