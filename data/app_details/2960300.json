{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is an independent horror puzzle game developed by me. It uses a first-person perspective and combines rules and strange stories to solve puzzles and explore, ensuring survival while finding the final truth. The game has multiple endings. The game has an automatic save function at key nodes, and there is no need to save manually. Players can return to the latest save point by &quot;Continue the game&quot;, or manually read a certain automatically saved save. The game time is about 1 hour (depending on the time it takes to solve the puzzle).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game currently only supports keyboard operation, WASD movement, and the mouse is used for interaction and perspective conversion. Long press the middle mouse button to zoom in and focus. Left shift runs, left ctrl crouches, and there are 3 number keys available above: 1. Weapons 2. Lighting 3. Photographing. ESC opens the system settings.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game as a whole draws on the settings of rule-based strange stories, and has a SAN value system. The SAN value represents the degree of mental erosion of the protagonist, but the lower the SAN value, the closer to the truth.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">To increase the sense of immersion, the game enables head bobbing when walking by default. <strong>If you feel dizzy from 3D, you can turn off the head bobbing option in the settings page.</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>The default language of the game is Simplified Chinese. You need to manually switch your language in the game settings page. Currently, it supports five languages: Simplified Chinese, English, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.</strong></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Except for Chinese, the texts in other languages \u200b\u200bare generated by Google Translate, so many places may not be perfect.
