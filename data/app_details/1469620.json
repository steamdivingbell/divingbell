{"about_the_game":"This collection includes 8 ancient games from the early days of the internet. Each game has been updated with quality-of-life features, such as difficulty and accessibility options.

There's plenty of upgrades to unlock - <strong>and this version adds 4 new playable characters.</strong> This game can be played with either a mouse or keyboard.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Adventure Story</h2>Jump and fight your way through 27 action-packed levels to rescue your cat and girlfriend. Along the way you'll level up, and collect new equipment and spells. This platformer can be played with either a keyboard or a controller. <strong>New levels, bosses, and abilities have been added!</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Epic Battle Fantasy 1</h2>The game that started off the Epic Battle Fantasy series of turn-based RPGs!

It features some very violent animations! <strong>This version has 4 difficulty settings and a new soundtrack.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Kitten Game</h2>Slaughter hundreds of cats in this clicker game, featuring whacky scenarios and pointless violence. <strong>The difficulty has been balanced, and an auto-clicker feature has been added.</strong> Wrist injuries are no longer part of the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mecha Dress Up Game</h2>Build your own killer robot from hundreds of parts. You can take screenshots and share your creations with the community! <strong>Now with better controls, color-picking functionality, and a new soundtrack.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cat Cafe</h2>You run a cafe for cats, and must serve them drinks as fast as possible! This is a very simple game with not much depth to it.
