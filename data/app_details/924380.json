{"about_the_game":"WoodZone is a unique opportunity to become an entrepreneurial lumberjack. Imagine that you have a company that grows in front of your eyes or you go up the ladder in another corporation to eventually become the boss in it. The player has a lot of &quot;sandbox rakes and blades&quot; that open up new possibilities. Lighting in the sawmill can be built on the principle of &quot;put and work&quot;, but a more demanding player can develop them using logic gates and cables. For example, it can be lit when entering the building, the place for wood is full or there are no raw materials. The game provides, among others, conveyors, computers, cameras, sensors, logic gates, cabling, vehicles, robots, construction parts and much, much more! This allows you to create excellent mechanisms that automate work: wood sorter, a machine that checks the quality of wood, production efficiency meter, automatic feeder and so on.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/924380/extras/WZ_bannerSteam_Economy2.png?t=1726695602\" /><br><br>The development of the economy changes dynamically depending on the behavior of the players. The price of wood is influenced by factors such as the type, size, and quality of wood, the level of processing or even production technology. An important factor in the demand for wood is also the season of the year. The player is able to set up his own company, which he can run alone or with friends.

The task of the corporation's owner is to expand the fleet and infrastructure, increase revenues, employ more employees, create strategies, ensure the work of others and generally work in favor of the company's development.<br><br>Wood has a long way to go before it is sold.
