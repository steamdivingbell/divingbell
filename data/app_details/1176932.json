Included are eight brand-new scenarios and a new map (26AM). It features fluid, impulse-based turns, squad-level actions, and individual heroics. The scenarios span the entire length of the war, starting with the first American counterattacks in the Gap and desperate efforts to slow down the Soviet juggernaut. We see Soviet Separate Air battalions landing to clear the way for armored spearheads and vicious ambushes against columns of Soviet vehicles. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1176932/extras/Red_Gauntlet_Break2.jpg?t=1640938126\" /><br>There are armored formations clashing outside of Frankfurt.
