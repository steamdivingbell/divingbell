{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In a world steeped in shadows, two factions have battled for centuries, shaping the fate of humanity from the shadows. On one side stands the Legion, a coalition of warriors dedicated to preserving the light and fighting the darkness. Opposing them are the Watchers, an insidious group whose malevolent influence stretches back to World War II, when they manipulated events and figures like Hitler to destabilize nations and weave themselves into the fabric of power.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Elijah Stone, the central figure in this epic conflict, has been honed into a weapon by the Legion. Trained in advanced military tactics and weaponry, he embodies the hopes of his faction. Yet, unbeknownst to him, a dark counterpart exists on the other side of a veil that separates their world from a twisted reflection of it, where chaos reigns.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Watchers have seized control of a covert military research facility in international waters, believing it to be the thinnest point of the veil\u2014their key to unleashing dark forces upon the world. Their sinister ritual requires Elijah's blood, which they intend to use to tear open the portal. This momentous event occurs only once every hundred years, making Elijah's capture a critical objective for the Watchers.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As the clock ticks down to the ritual, Elijah is thrust into a solo mission, tasked with infiltrating the heavily guarded facility. He must execute a strategic assault that, while seemingly a mere pinprick in the grand scheme, targets the very heart of the Watchers' plans. Each step brings him closer to the truth about his dark counterpart and the horror that awaits on the other side of the veil.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Elijah's journey is not just about survival; it\u2019s a race against time to thwart an ancient evil from being unleashed. The stakes are high, and the horrors he faces inside the facility will test not only his skills but his very essence. As he delves deeper into enemy territory, he must confront not just the Watchers but the darkness within himself, grappling with the knowledge that the line between good and evil is often blurred. In the end, Elijah must find the strength to overcome both external and internal demons, ensuring that the veil remains intact and the world is shielded from the abyss.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2362620/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736444716","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2362620/page.bg.jpg?t=1736444716","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2362620/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736444716","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2362620/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736444716","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"mild gore from bullet and knife wounds ,undead with body parts and organs exposed"},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In a world steeped in shadows, two factions have battled for centuries, shaping the fate of humanity from the shadows.
