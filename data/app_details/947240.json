{"about_the_game":"The Dunhuang Grottoes have preserved Chinese art for over 1600 years. Nowadays, the opening hours of the Dunhuang Grottoes are restricted and some areas are even prohibited from public to protect the heritage. To allow more people to experience the beauty of the Dunhuang Grottoes, National Taiwan University and Academia Sinica have worked together with Dunhuang Academy to produce this VR content. When virtually exploring Mogao Cave 61 in this VR content, the viewer can see the digital restoration of the deteriorated murals and the ruined statues. For example, the Manjusri statue in Mogao Cave 61 has already lost, but can now be digitally reconstructed and re-appeared vividly in the virtual cave. Also, the viewer can see animations on the walls, which illustrate the stories behind the murals, such as \u201cMount Wutai\u201d on the west wall and &quot;Hua Yan Jing Bian&quot; on the northern wall.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/947240/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1545885266","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/947240/page.bg.jpg?t=1545885266","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/947240/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1545885266","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/947240/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1545885266","categories":[{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Dunhuang Grottoes have preserved Chinese art for over 1600 years.
