{"about_the_game":"You just emerged from the depths of the colossal machine, only to find that its vastness far exceeds your wildest imagination. The metallic walls tower over you, casting long shadows that shift ominously as you explore your surroundings. As you take in the intricate machinery around you, you encounter an older gummy bear who carries an air of familiarity, as if he holds secrets from your past or knowledge of the world you\u2019ve just entered.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, time is not on your side. You quickly realize that enemies lurk in the shadows, relentlessly tracking your every move. With their menacing presence looming closer, you must act swiftly and decisively. Scattered throughout the environment are hidden collectibles that can aid you in your quest for survival. Each item you find could provide crucial advantages in your battles ahead.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe furnaces scattered throughout the machine offer a glimmer of hope. Use them strategically to melt down robotic adversaries, transforming them into resources that you can harness to empower yourself. But the true challenge lies in confronting the gummy bear enemies that you must consume to grow stronger. Each encounter will test your agility and cunning as you navigate the dangers that surround you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you progress, the tension mounts, culminating in an epic boss fight that will determine your fate. Will you harness the knowledge from the older gummy bear and the items you\u2019ve collected to emerge victorious, or will you fall to the relentless foes that pursue you? In this treacherous world, every choice matters, and survival is just the beginning of your journey.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2890730/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736628563","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2890730/page.bg.jpg?t=1736628563","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2890730/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736628563","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2890730/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736628563","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You just emerged from the depths of the colossal machine, only to find that its vastness far exceeds your wildest imagination.
