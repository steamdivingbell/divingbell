However, all chessmen/chessboard skins will also be complete freely available to be downloaded from our website and can be &quot;side-loaded&quot; using the available feature of loading custom models to Chessality. These won't be shown to your opponent (if they are using VR) but are fully available to you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Feature requests</h2>Any cool ideas or integration requests? Tell us! We are very open to ideas!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Will a non-VR version be available?</h2>As of right now, there is no plan. Although there is code implemented for debugging without using a VR headset, one of this project's goals is to bring emphasis to OTB chess and add a meaningful and replayable VR game to your library. We don't want to downplay the VR in this game by offering a non-VR option. Furthermore, there are already several very well accomplished 2D options of the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Release date information</h2>Originally planned for December 2020, but now the plan is around <strong>may-august 2021</strong>. We feel very safe about these range dates to release the game as actually, the gameplay is quite very well polished, and most original features for release are ready. However, further advertisement, artwork, and environmental polishment seem in order before release. The actual feature list is much longer than described, and the planned feature list is even much longer. Due to the almost pure focus of the client, server, integration of third-party services, game mechanics, and aesthetics development, almost nothing has been done on artwork and advertisement until now.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Want to help?</h2>We would gladly accept any free help you can offer!
