{"about_the_game":"Dive straight into Jupiter's atmosphere and take down vast flying fortresses from within in fast-paced, arcade flight combat. Losing your plane is just a setback - return with an upgraded replacement and take back lost territory in Nova Squadron's roguelite campaign.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE BEST THE 23RD CENTURY HAS TO OFFER</h2>Equip yourself and your AI wingmen with a range of high-tech weapons from missiles to lasers and lightning guns. Complete missions to obtain powerful parts that boost your squadron's capabilities, but be careful! If you're shot down, your parts and upgrades will be destroyed. Earn renown in the air force to secure new aircraft and weapons to sortie with, or research improvements to the base models of your favourite planes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ONE SQUADRON AGAINST AN ARMY</h2>Sortie in a fighter to intercept bombers and interplanetary missiles, or load up your bomber with cluster bombs and railguns to dismantle flying fortresses. Team up with the allied fleet to launch a combined assault on deadly superweapons and the swarms of drones protecting them. The stronger your foes, the stronger your allies - no matter the difficulty of the mission, they'll always have your back.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CUSTOMISE THE MAYHEM</h2>Tweak every component of the game's difficulty individually to fine-tune your roguelite experience. Want the greatest challenge the game can offer? Turn the individual parameters up past the hardest difficulty setting. New to flight controls? Use the Simplified control scheme and unmap controls to have the game automate them for you.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1826830/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732957429","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1826830/page.bg.jpg?t=1732957429","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1826830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732957429","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1826830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732957429","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Captions available","id":13}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":2174020,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Dive straight into Jupiter's atmosphere and take down vast flying fortresses from within in fast-paced, arcade flight combat.
