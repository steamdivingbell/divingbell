{"about_the_game":"Journey across the Indian Ocean, uncover the secrets of the Drunken God, and become a legendary pirate captain.

Four acts worth of hand-crafted levels are waiting for you to plunder. Not that you'll remember any of it from all that drinking.<br></li><li>Live the pirate's life: Drink the finest rum instead of those weird-colored potions and elixirs. Boost morale by playing your music instruments. Gamble your gold away in a game of Liar's Dice. Dominate the waves in naval combat. You may also hunt legendary beasts if you can solve their mysteries.<br></li><li>ARPG? I say YARRRPG! Looting is a pirate's profession. There are 33 hat fashions, 30 weapon types, 15 species of pets and plenty more to collect. Every weapon can have up to 2 Spell Runes with their own level-ups, modifying their attacks in wild ways.

The core game loop is that of a hectic top-down shooter, but melee and spellcaster builds are also viable. Note that movement is with the keyboard, since you need the mouse for aiming. The game is also using an active reload system. <br>WARNING: gamepad support has been discontinued!<br></li><li>Done with the story?
