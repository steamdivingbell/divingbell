{"about_the_game":"Reggie just wanted to live a normal life. To knit sweaters, go to the park, feed the ducks, and spend time with his boyfriend. Unfortunately for him, he is not supposed to be here. Nobody knows quite how he managed to escape from Hell, but now that the god of his world has finally tracked him down, his world is about to be turned upside down. He is not alone, however. And what better allies to have than a group of anarchist ducks who build anti-god superweapons? As Reggie, you must track down your avian comrades across dimensions, kill their oppressors, and take their weapons. And when it's all over, take the fight to god himself.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Features</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Go fast: using all your movement tricks, build up insane speeds and launch yourself across the map<br></li><li>Do trick shots: every weapon has a primary and secondary fire, and at least one combo you can do with another weapon.<br></li><li>Explore: every level has secrets with ducks to rescue and bring back to their home dimension. <br></li><li>Take on levels in any order: Each dimension can be accessed in whatever order you wish, and in between normal levels, you can visit the ducks you've rescued in the hub world.<br></li><li>Tell me how you really feel: If a level sucked, tell it right to its face!
