{"about_the_game":"<strong>Play the melody by punching the lyrics and stars flying at you to the beat of the music!</strong><br>*The lyrics and songs are all in Japanese.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About the Game</h2>VR RHYTHM ACTION SEIYA is not your average rhythm game where you just keep beat with the song -- it's a virtual reality music game where you can actually play the melody.<br>Punching the flying stars coming out of the screen will play a note from an instrument, and lyric stars will sing the words.<br>The game can even help you exercise since your score is based on how hard you punch.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2>- No confusing or complex controls like all the buttons on the Oculus Touch or Vive controllers, just punch and play.<br>- 25 songs to play in total -- from EDM to pop rock.We plan to add songs in as time goes on with free updates!<br>- Play on a stage just like an actual venue with wonderful light shows to make you feel like you\u2019re really there!<br>- A music game where you play the melody with your own two hands, rather than just keep the beat to the music.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/757100/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1527229093","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/757100/page.bg.jpg?t=1527229093","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/757100/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1527229093","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/757100/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1527229093","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked
