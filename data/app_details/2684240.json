{"about_the_game":"About the Demo<br />\r\nYou start the game as a tiny bacterium in its most basic form, with low health and energy, poor eyesight, and an inability to distinguish food from toxic waste. Life is harsh, and you'll die more than a couple of times. Such is the condition of prehistoric Earth, where survival time is really short. But the game forces you to learn from your mistakes. You'll soon realize that choosing the right evolution skill at the start of the game is crucial. You'll discover what is food and what is not. You'll learn how different areas affect your temperature and, in turn, your health and energy levels. You'll identify which organisms are harmless and which might kill you for food. You'll understand the importance of staying inside an oxygen bubble to &quot;suck in&quot; air to replenish your energy, rather than simply colliding with it. In essence, Symbio is a game about exploration, discovery, and observation. You can, of course, speedrun the game by simply eating and reproducing your way to higher evolution, but you would miss out on discovering organisms and observing their unique behaviors. Side note: All organisms in the game are based on real-life species and mimic their behavior, eg. motion, feeding style, reproductive behavior, etc.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame Description<br />\r\nImmerse yourself in a microscopic world teeming with life, with multitudes of organisms, big and small, each species trying to survive in the harsh environment of prehistoric Earth. This is a world undergoing constant evolution, whether you are there or not. A world where size often matters, and bigger cells often have an advantage over smaller ones (but not always). It's a cell-eat-cell world where each species becomes part of a larger food chain. From the simplest Prokaryotes to more complex Eukaryotes and Multicellular organisms, Symbio allows you to evolve beyond your current state. All you need to do is survive. And if you fail, make sure you have enough progeny to propagate your species and continue your survival.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame Features<br />\r\n1. Engage with a multitude of different species (currently at 106 and growing) based on real-life organisms, including Paramecium, Coleps, Nostoc, Rotifer, Stentor, and Tardigrades (ring any bells?), among others.<br />\r\n2. A game that allows you to explore and learn, for instance, what is food and what isn't, what is safe and what is not. <br />\r\n3. Discover and form symbiotic relationships with other species.<br />\r\n4. Be part of an intricate food chain where one species eats another, and gets eaten by others.<br />\r\n5. Characters evolve from single cell to higher and complex forms, with multiple branches of evolution (plant-based, herbivore, carnivore, omnivore, etc) available for selection.<br />\r\n6. Eat, breed and poop (yes, you can do that too) like a real life organism. Just as one's food can be another's poison, one's poop can be another's breakfast.<br />\r\n7. Almost all organisms experience aging and so will yours. So, before dying, make sure you have enough progenies to carry on your game.<br />\r\n8. Be an apex predator or relinquish yourself to barrel scrapping bottom feeder, the choice is yours.<br />\r\n9. The game is developed, designed and created wholly by a solo developer.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2684240/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725499531","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2684240/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1725499531","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2684240/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725499531","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2684240/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725499531","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3024060,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"About the Demo<br />\r\nYou start the game as a tiny bacterium in its most basic form, with low health and energy, poor eyesight, and an inability to distinguish food from toxic waste.
