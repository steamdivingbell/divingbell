{"about_the_game":"Billy is a Florbz and the favourite pet of Space Princess Leila. He is a happy little critter as he gets snacks regularly and the occasional tummy rub to ensure he feels like he is in Paradise. But one day he woke up and his food bowl was empty.... no snacks.... and no tummy rubbing anymore! Why? After a daunting 6 hours it hit him (Florbz are not known for their quick wit and intelligence) and the huge writing on the wall saying &quot;WE HAVE KIDNAPPED THE PRINCESS&quot; also might have given it away, who knows?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBilly sets out to rescue his meal ticket from certain doom as the Aliens who kidnapped Princess Leila have an appetite for planetary royalty. In classic pixel art 2D platform action Billy has to use the built in Bubble breath every Florbz has to neutralise the enemies and boss monsters and turn them into delicious snacks. He can jump from platform to platform but needs to dodge projectiles and avoid physical contact with his foes or he'll lose a life. The Princess will spur him on after each level Billy completes (&quot;Good boy, roll over...&quot;) and hopefully he will reach her in time before dinner is served.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- 2D Pixel Art <br />\r\n- Classic Arcade Style Gameplay you will remember and love<br />\r\n- 100% Family Friendly Fun<br />\r\n- Many enemies and boss monsters to defeat","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2224570/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1688684748","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2224570/page.bg.jpg?t=1688684748","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2224570/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1688684748","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2224570/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1688684748","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Billy is a Florbz and the favourite pet of Space Princess Leila.
