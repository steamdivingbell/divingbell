{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Work as a brave volunteer collecting various resources from within the inner workings of a massive building called The Monolith, which rests in the middle of the ocean. Your job is to keep civilization running on the surface. Each day you will descend into The Monolith with the simple task of collecting things such as food, metal scrap, and unique artifacts. Experience the wildlife that resides within, from procedurally animated abominations to robots with guns, each creature is unique. Use your daily budget to buy equipment, or travel between The Monolith's layers. Each layer has a unique story to tell.   </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3151700/extras/workTogether.png?t=1731340550\" />Work together to ensure survival. Teamwork is the <i>only way</i> to survive the dangers that roam within. Your team members can and will be taken away from you in the blink of an eye if you aren't careful.

Always assume the worst, and use every tool at your disposal. A team without a plan will be quickly killed, as the dangers waiting below are relentless and won't hesitate to rip you apart.
