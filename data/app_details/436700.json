The game is easy to learn, but hard to master.<br><br>To win the game, you must gather resources, build an army, and outsmart your enemy(-ies)... and a little luck every now-and-then doesn\u2019t hurt either. The game is played on a hexagonal board and features three types of units, each with their own specific attributes and bonuses: infantry, armour, and artillery. These units are then further affected by the varying terrain on the board itself. The game offers a total of 21 terrain types, a mix of which is randomly generated on the board, though there are some pre-set epic maps. Mountains, forests, rivers, roads... all these determine the ease or struggle of movement and combat. Different strategies will emerge with unique terrain layouts, giving each multiplayer game a fresh feel for endless strategy.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/436700/extras/em_terrain.png?t=1453288575\" /><br><br><strong>Retaliation: EM is a game of trade-offs</strong>, players must learn to balance between seizing opportunities and defending against threats: Do I raid the enemy\u2019s supply lines and leave my base vulnerable?
