{"about_the_game":"Dino V. Xeno is a casual, full length, straight to the point, yet deeply crafted, and exquisitely fun tower defense game made to keep lovers of the genre happy. Take on hordes of alien invaders using the full force of your dinosaur army. With 10 fully upgradable dinosaurs at your disposal, plus 14 additional &quot;special&quot; towers and a slew of power-ups that can be found randomly on each level, each time you play can be vastly different. Both good planning and RNG play a role in making this a unique yet pure tower defense experience. DVX is designed to keep you entertained, feeling good, with just the right bit of challenge without overcomplicating things.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDino V. Xeno features 51 levels, with both a normal mode for casual players and a hard mode for people who are tower defense buffs who love to learn game mechanics and challenge themselves. Not including the game's Endless Mode, the campaign will take anywhere from twelve to eighteen hours to beat completely (but probably more).","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2255980/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1722772262","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2255980/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1722772262","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2255980/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1722772262","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2255980/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1722772262","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Dino V.
