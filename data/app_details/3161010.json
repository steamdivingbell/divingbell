{"about_the_game":"The Waiting Room - An Existential Simulation<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe waiting room is a perfect metaphor for life--<br />\r\nThrust from the mysterious black into the white only for the first thing you ever do - is to choose your destiny.

That's not to introduce a chaos theory into the mix, not even random. As someone might be behind the curtains, pulling the strings, we'll never truly observe it. And even amonst the pseudo-prophetic, pseudo-fatalist, pseudo-chaotic and pseudo-random entry into this room. without seeing behing the curtain - we seem to do okay on our own. We follow the unwritten rules, for the most part. Take our ticket, pick a seat (or it picks you) sit down, and wait. Wait for a very long time. &quot;If you're lucky&quot;, they'll say. &quot;If you're lucky you'll wait a very long time. Because for as much as you can't wait to get behind those doors and for as much as you might think you know what's back there, you don't. No one does. Enjoy the wait... oh, and notice the little things on the way...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOr it's just a silly little game about nothing. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPS - If you don't touch the controls for two minutes the game restarts.
