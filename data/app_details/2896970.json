Instead, it offers a quiet reflection and contemplation on the meaning of life. The developers aim to provide players with an experience similar to visiting an &quot;installation art&quot; exhibit. In the space of meditation, players are encouraged to feel emptiness, loneliness, time, life, death, confusion, and hesitation. In a tranquil and relaxed state, engage in dialogue with your inner self, ponder the meaning of life, and understand the true essence of liberation and redemption. If this game can offer even a slight consolation to your noisy heart or a gentle touch to your weary soul, then it has fulfilled its primary intention.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2896970/extras/rain.gif?t=1719131077\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Choices Between Life and Death</h2>In the game, you can choose to either sow seeds of grass or listen to tombstones, each symbolizing different approaches to life's events.
