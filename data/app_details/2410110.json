{"about_the_game":"Timeshift is a puzzle-platformer all about using physics and time travel to your advantage. You can create a saved position, and at any point warp back to it, carrying over any current momentum. This combined with the ability to rotate in any direction leads to a completely unique take on the 2D platformer genre. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou play as Quinn and find yourself in a strange place called the Rift, a canyon that none have returned from. Will you be able to make in through alive?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTimeshift features 6 levels, each with 20 secret coins to find. Try to find them all!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"World 1 Complete!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2410110/fcd0fbcbef0448d2d14db5564951a82c2b8ab9bc.jpg"},{"name":"All World 1 Coins!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2410110/44df9bde7de14dd730bf9eb0831cb42fe5d480fe.jpg"},{"name":"World 2 Complete!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2410110/332281a3ca7736dee8bfad6f3683ae52d9f60024.jpg"},{"name":"All World 2 Coins!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2410110/e85046c138adaf6dfb78904ff6cfba40b7bd0298.jpg"},{"name":"World 3 Complete!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2410110/49f118e790a83ad62339e0baeeb2e99d1150d47f.jpg"},{"name":"All World 3 Coins!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2410110/f3d989caa5e0677aa52cf66f021186ff0ab6461d.jpg"},{"name":"World 4 Complete!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2410110/178192195d3f428665c55c97fd9ce3035443e7f4.jpg"},{"name":"All World 4 Coins!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2410110/c439695d72c48c626e526babce0bac803cf05705.jpg"},{"name":"World 5 Complete!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2410110/a12bb40d2d04638cc21ae46176b9ec471803ecce.jpg"},{"name":"All World 5 Coins!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2410110/2103dae7c556e32a454dde3c9dc2f1f9ef33a1e4.jpg"}],"total":12},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2410110/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1707195611","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2410110/page.bg.jpg?t=1707195611","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2410110/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1707195611","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2410110/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1707195611","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Timeshift is a puzzle-platformer all about using physics and time travel to your advantage.
