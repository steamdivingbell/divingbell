{"about_the_game":"<strong>It's Saturday, 1992. Probably late evening, perhaps 6 or so. You are a little kid, sitting on your bed, wrapped in a blanket with your &quot;Game Kid&quot; handheld device (not backlit) and play your favorite games while your mother brings you some hot cocoa. You don't know it yet but this is the best life will ever be.</strong><br><br>This feeling, the feeling of playing those handheld games back in the day, this is what Pixel Pileup Party is all about. This game collection includes four new &quot;Game Kid&quot; styled games in one package, so that you can feel like a child again.
