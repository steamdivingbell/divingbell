{"about_the_game":"Welcome to Canopy, a captivating non-violent exploration crafting game set in the heart of the rainforest. Gather your friends and embark on an unforgettable cooperative adventure, where camaraderie is key, and teamwork is essential. Traverse the dense foliage, overcome challenging obstacles, and unravel the mysteries that lie within.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Canopy, combat takes a backseat as you delve into a realm of intrigue and discovery. Traverse the forest, encountering thick underbrush, treacherous cliffs, winding gorges, and serene lakes that hinder your progress. You'll need to overcome these obstacles by forging your own path through the wilderness. Cut through stubborn underbrush, build sturdy rafts to cross lakes, and strategically fell trees to create bridges. Work together to move heavy obstacles, lend a helping hand, and tighten ropes. Install climbing ropes and even construct a network of zip lines to traverse the vast expanse of the forest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe forest holds many secrets, waiting to be discovered. Follow crude treasure maps, decipher enigmatic notes, and spot intriguing locations from high vantage points. Orient yourself by climbing towering trees and spotting unique landmarks. Beware, for there is no map to guide you. Rely on your intuition and the whispers of the forest to uncover hidden wonders and unravel the truth behind legends.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Canopy, the focus lies not on building elaborate bases, but rather on constructing trails to pave your way. Gather resources and craft essential tools to blaze a path through the wilderness. From knives and machetes to hatchets and axes, equip yourself to overcome nature's challenges. Create planks, wheels, axles, nails, and an abundance of ropes. Building trails becomes your lifeline, enabling faster traversal and unlocking new areas to explore.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrepare to uncover the mysteries that lie within the forest's depths. Tales of a lost valley, legends of a forbidden cave, the remains of a hidden dinosaur skeleton, and whispers of extraterrestrial encounters. The forest guards its secrets fiercely. Will you have the courage to unearth the truth? Brace yourself for unexpected surprises and immerse yourself in a world teeming with unanswered questions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExperience the overwhelming curiosity as you yearn to uncover the forest's hidden secrets. Relish in triumphant moments as you finally reach that abandoned camp you glimpsed from afar. Brace yourself for surprising twists and turns that deepen the mystery. Find solace and relaxation in the company of friends, progressing at your own pace. Feel the distress of being lost, only to be rescued and reassured by your loyal companions. Above all, be in awe of nature's wonders, which serve as a constant reminder of the beauty that surrounds you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEmbrace the call of the wild, gather your friends, and embark on an unforgettable journey into the heart of Canopy. Will you unveil the mysteries of the forest, or will its secrets remain forever hidden? The choice is yours.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2477250/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733797110","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2477250/page.bg.jpg?t=1733797110","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2477250/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733797110","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2477250/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733797110","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Captions available","id":13}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Welcome to Canopy, a captivating non-violent exploration crafting game set in the heart of the rainforest.
