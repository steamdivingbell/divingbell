However, when compared to other popular mainstream entries like Cytus, Osu, or even Geometry Dash, it is pretty &quot;stale&quot;. I suggest trying it and adopt a &quot;wait-n-see approach&quot;, hence why I am recommending this game for everybody.\u201d<br>7/10 \u2013 FreddyFish<br><br>\u201cProject Rhombus is a pretty simple arcade game in which the goal is to press buttons in order to keep up with the beat of the song playing in the background.
