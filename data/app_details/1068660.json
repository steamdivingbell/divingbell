It includes <strong>+50 pre-made editable maps</strong> to kickstart your imagination, and almost <strong>10,000 3D assets</strong> to create whatever you might think of \u2013 from buildings to vehicles, furniture, items or characters, for all kinds of settings (fantasy, sci-fi, Lovecraftian horror\u2026). It also includes an <strong>avatar editor,</strong> so you can customize your character or NPCs.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1068660/extras/gif_2.gif?t=1739446078\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In this demo, you will also find a simplified version of the <strong>gameplay module, which allows you to play tabletop RPG online</strong> with your friends. It includes very basic D&amp;D-like rules: you\u2019ll be able to use Basic Attacks, Special Attacks, over 20 skills (like Hide, Spot, and many others), as well as 3 spells: fireball, lightning bolt, and cone of cold. These basic rules have been created with <strong>Criteria, our custom-made scripting language that will allow you to implement any rules</strong> so Multiverse Designer can automatize them for you.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The demo includes HP and initiative tracking too, as well as <strong>full character sheet editing. It comes with two ready-to-play encounters:</strong> one against a wyvern, and another against humanoid monsters.\u00a0 However, if you don\u2019t mind doing all the bookkeeping and rules-tracking yourself, and just want Multiverse Designer as a 3D tabletop, you\u2019ll be able to use any map created with the tool to play online with your friends.
