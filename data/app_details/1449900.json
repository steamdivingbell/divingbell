A revocable living trust, unlike a will, offers a fast, private, probate-free way to transfer one\u2019s property after death. Although a living trust is not a complete substitute for a will (it doesn\u2019t allow you to name a guardian for a child, for example), it is definitely a more efficient way to transfer property at death, especially large-ticket items such as a house.

For example, bills must be paid, bank deposits must be made, and someone must handle insurance and benefits paperwork. In most cases, a durable power of attorney for finances is the best way to take care of tasks like these.
