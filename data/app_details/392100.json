Adam wrote the dialogue, filled in the background art with life and detail, did the other portion of character animations and generally spit-shined things. The game has been in on-and-off development and various states of release for years, but we're proud to say this is the best version yet.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Batter Up!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/392100/69d3eed749f6bb28fe00271c868679a701692a80.jpg"},{"name":"The Impaler","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/392100/c68b3b6726816bbb2340a6059437f7d4c5863594.jpg"},{"name":"Bitter Sweet","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/392100/4de0ee5a1639387cccd015fb4e1d4d34cf7e95c1.jpg"},{"name":"Beat the Devs","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/392100/3077fd1d2eefc98fc4c0563a07eebfb1f8f3e692.jpg"},{"name":"Relax","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/392100/a4f6a2a29fe5b1573b875dda626556087e5627a4.jpg"},{"name":"Joe Asshole","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/392100/9ef0d0b3aff7abb23b77402063217bce506302a8.jpg"},{"name":"Horse Power","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/392100/589ddf9f6ceeaedaf0b89b1065904daa29e80881.jpg"},{"name":"In the Gutter","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/392100/7d6c84eca8026f97f5de3b3037db246444d78247.jpg"},{"name":"Super Beast","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/392100/29a12540802985b3bf9d4af2b3eab14d9c09dbaa.jpg"},{"name":"Umbrella Strike","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/392100/5bee89b29e69784b0a39dd2758520c22e79577ce.jpg"}],"total":21},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/392100/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1599828836","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/392100/page.bg.jpg?t=1599828836","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/392100/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1599828836","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/392100/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1599828836","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Fatal Theory is nostalgic beat-em-up action with a fresh twist of ENDLESS AERIAL RAVE COMBOS and a killer illustrated story.
