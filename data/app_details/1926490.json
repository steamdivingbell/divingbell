On his journey, John is taken by God to a village and discovers that many people are in need of his help. In this spiritual battle, John will need to face obstacles and enemies who want to keep these people in the prison of the works of the flesh.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo win and see lives set free, he will use the armor of God, the knowledge of the Word gained during his walk, prayer, and the power of the Holy Spirit to face the obstacles of this spiritual battle.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nStanding firm, girded with the belt of truth, wearing the breastplate of righteousness, and having his feet shod with the readiness of the gospel of peace, young John will continue his journey in preaching the message of deliverance. Using the shield of faith to defend himself against the incessant attacks of the enemy, the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, he will fight the good fight and keep his faith until the end of his journey.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1926490/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1655244384","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1926490/page.bg.jpg?t=1655244384","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1926490/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1655244384","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1926490/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1655244384","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to the John Christian 2 game installation. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nJohn Christian 2 is a third-person action game with challenging, spiritual battles of good against evil soldiers and masters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story tells of the heroism of a young man, who after receiving the armor of God, begins his mission to proclaim the gospel to every creature.
