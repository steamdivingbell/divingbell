{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In <i>A Taste of History</i>, you are a detective invited to a 1920s dinner party hosted by Harry Houdini. Using his mysterious talents, Houdini has gathered guests from 12 distinct historical periods: Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, the Crusades, the Renaissance, the Age of Exploration, the Reformation, the American Revolutionary War, the Industrial Revolution, the American Civil War, the Wild West, World War I, and World War II. Among them is a thief who has stolen the Golden Pen, a magical artifact capable of rewriting history. Your task is to interrogate the suspects, analyze their alibis, and identify the culprit before the pen\u2019s power is misused.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each of the 120 historical figures is meticulously researched and brought to life in a striking animated claymation style. From George Washington and Marie Curie to Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo, every character reflects their real-world views, personalities, and historical context. Interactions are period-accurate, meaning figures from the same era can engage in dynamic, thought-provoking conversations. Imagine Leonardo da Vinci exchanging ideas with Galileo on the nature of the cosmos, or Joseph Stalin debating Eleanor Roosevelt on civil rights. These encounters are not only entertaining but also deeply educational, offering players a chance to learn about history through the lens of its most influential figures.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Based on the <i>Histories of Adventure</i> historical fiction short stories series, the game expands on the same 12 time periods, blending narrative depth with interactive gameplay. As you question suspects and piece together clues, you\u2019ll uncover fascinating details about their lives, achievements, and worldviews. The game is designed to make history engaging and accessible, particularly for middle school to high school students, while offering enough depth to captivate adult players.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>A Taste of History</i> is more than a detective game\u2014it\u2019s a journey through time.
