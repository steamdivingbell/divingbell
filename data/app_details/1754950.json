{"about_the_game":"Set in a distant, utopian future, Sentinel Attack begins with the first day on the job with the rookie, Justin. His primary task is the elimination of asteroids and debris to prevent harm to satellites, space stations, and Earth's population. Flying solo in a spacecraft with enough firepower to split an asteroid with the best view imaginable. Another team member named Erica patrols the region around Mars in a similar craft. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, Justin's first day on the job turns into a tragedy that will lead him into an out-of-this-world mystery filled with hostility.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSentinel, the space station that orbits Saturn, is broadcasting a distress with references to a power failure and missing people. The broadcast is significantly delayed due to the distance, and the current state is unknown.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJustin and Erica are called to investigate, with their ships being the most agile and speedy crafts available. Meanwhile, Earth prepares transport ships to catch up with engineers and medical staff. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSentinel Attack will have you play as both Justin and Erica in horizontal shooter and metroidvania stages as you battle in space and explore the many levels of the station.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe visuals are styled like the classic 16-bit era. The game also has an original full-length music soundtrack composed within the capabilities of the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSentinel Attack is currently in development and will be available by Spring 2023.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1754950/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1653761486","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1754950/page.bg.jpg?t=1653761486","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1754950/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1653761486","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1754950/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1653761486","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Set in a distant, utopian future, Sentinel Attack begins with the first day on the job with the rookie, Justin.
