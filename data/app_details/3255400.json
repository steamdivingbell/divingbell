{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is a meditation based on 9 kinds of awareness called Water, Mountain, Fire, Wind, Earth, Lake, Thunder, Heaven, and Low. It is a movement meditation, so there is a movement and posture associated with each Zone. There is also a boundary response, and a color associated with each Zone. There is a poem associated with each zone. The zones come from the Chinese Ba Gua (8 Figures) plus a zone called Low (the Low Zone is lower energy). This is kind of philosophical but is basically like Yoga, Tai Chi, or Qigong.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3255400/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728670449","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3255400/page.bg.jpg?t=1728670449","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3255400/af3ebbfe75e5e2661d19507690f60e2a326c4013/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728670449","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3255400/af3ebbfe75e5e2661d19507690f60e2a326c4013/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728670449","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is a meditation based on 9 kinds of awareness called Water, Mountain, Fire, Wind, Earth, Lake, Thunder, Heaven, and Low.
