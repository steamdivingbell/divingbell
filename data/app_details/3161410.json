Your goal is clear: defeat all the monsters and unmask the dark figure behind the necromancer\u2019s alias. To defeat him, you will need to collect all the Necrocat\u2019s amulets that hold fragments of his dark soul. The amulets collected after each conquest will bring more abilities and strength to Twilight, allowing him to return stronger to the battlefield each time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get Stronger!</h2><br>Collect all the amulets you find and upgrade them to gain more power! It may not be possible to face all challenges empty-handed, but as you conquer more amulets and use them against the necromancer\u2019s armies, the more vulnerable the Necrocat becomes, and the closer you get to facing him!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3161410/extras/gameplay.gif?t=1738195322\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Main Mechanics</h2><br>In grids of cards of varying sizes, you can play casually by simply selecting the direction you want to move to collect an item or engage in a battle with a monster. As monsters are defeated, more powerful monsters appear, and more rewards are given upon defeating them. Each region of the game will have a number of amulets that are acquired by reaching soul fragment goals collected after defeating each monster. Whenever you reach a goal that you had previously achieved, instead of earning the same amulet, you will receive corrupted souls, which will be used to further enhance the power of the amulets.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Play Strategically!</h2><br>Each region or map will have different quantities of enemies and items, as well as different sizes and shapes of battlefields. Some items will be more useful in smaller or larger fields, and each type of map will require a unique strategy if you want to overcome your limits and truly defeat the Necrocat.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3161410/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738195322","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3161410/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1738195322","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3161410/ce3ee484c57124663e3c479fc4053e7b2664cf1a/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738195322","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3161410/ce3ee484c57124663e3c479fc4053e7b2664cf1a/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738195322","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3245430,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Help defeat the dreaded Necrocat by adding the game to your Wishlist!<br><br> <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3161410/extras/twilight.gif?t=1738195322\" /><br><br>Necrocat is a card roguelike with simple mechanics but grand strategies.
