{"about_the_game":"Rogue Snow is a top-down shooter with light survival and crafting elements.  Six months have passed since the Everwinter began.  The USA is a near empty wasteland coated in snow.  An army of living snowmen known as the Droves roam the land stalking anything with a temperature.  Douglas, a young boy who's been on his own for a month, joins up with a camp of survivors who believe that the equator may still be a safe haven from these monsters and climate.  They head south using a snow treader, and as the camp's sole scavenger, it's up to Douglas to provide for the camp and keep them safe.  But a faction of bandits holds the south with a tight grip, and their leader has other plans for Douglas' group. <br><br><strong>Singleplayer Story:</strong> A freak accident has left you as the sole scavenger for a group of survivors trying to reach the equator.  Your camp will provide you safety and the opportunity to craft much needed supplies, but every day has a mission for you to do to ensure the camp makes it farther south.<br><br><strong>Drove Mode:</strong> Go solo, or bring a friend as you try to survive against 20 waves of snowmen.  Scavenge by day, they'll come for you at night.<br><br><strong>VS Mode:</strong> One player controls a scavenger, gathering weapons and supplies to survive.  The other controls a snow sculptor, building an army of snowmen to command.  Their goals are the same: destroy the other player.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1234560/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1601364067","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1234560/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1601364067","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1234560/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1601364067","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1234560/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1601364067","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Rogue Snow is a top-down shooter with light survival and crafting elements.
