{"about_the_game":"Fill out more of your game\u2019s soundtrack with the spectacular tracks of Classic Fantasy Music Pack Vol 3! Murray Atkinson is back with another pack of music, this time with 13 BGMs ranging from angelic tunes that turns a forest pond into a mystical center of power to headbanging rock when your heroes face off against a monstrous boss! Seek out adventure to the strong drumbeats of \u2018Soaring Skies\u2019, explore mysterious locals to the creeping strings of \u2018Spiralling Mysteries\u2019, and wander familiar hometowns to \u2018Daydreaming\u2019s peaceful piano. Battle normal foes while encouraging tunes bounce around, and make sure your players know it\u2019s time to get serious when the music shifts to the racing electric guitars of the boss theme.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd if those tracks aren\u2019t classic enough for you, this pack also includes some famous orchestral classical pieces remade to fit into your game! Have your heroes compete in a duel of wits while violins strum the recognizable tune of \u2018Carmen Habanera\u2019, or use it to set the mood during a noble\u2019s grand party. Or create a cutscene where words aren\u2019t needed with the haunting piano of \u2018Gymnopedie No 1\u2019 playing as a beloved party member is laid to rest. And if you really like the vibe of familiar songs in your games you might also like Classical Favorites, an entire pack of famous orchestrated classical pieces!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you\u2019ve been wanting some classical-inspired tracks for certain cutscenes or just love Murray\u2019s musical melodies, pick up Classic Fantasy Music Pack Vol 3 today! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nContents:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* 11 original royalty free songs<br />\r\n* 2 Bonus popular classical songs (both in the public domain)<br />\r\n* m4a and ogg file formats included<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTerms of Use:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack is for use in RPG Maker Series or the engine of your choice.<br />\r\nOK to be used in Commercial projects<br />\r\nContents can be edited<br />\r\nOK for use in games with gore<br />\r\nOK for use in adult-rated games<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSonglist:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBattle Theme - United Front<br />\r\nBoss Battle - The Champions<br />\r\nDaydreaming<br />\r\nEntangled Delusions<br />\r\nManor Cathedral<br />\r\nPleasant Valley<br />\r\nSad Story<br />\r\nSoaring Skies<br />\r\nSpiralling Mysteries<br />\r\nThe Bogwarthius Columns<br />\r\nThe Invitation<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBonus 2 Popular Orchestral Classics:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCarmen Habanera (Bizet)<br />\r\nGymnopedie No 1 (Satie)","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2574130/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1694102747","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2574130/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1694102747","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2574130/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1694102747","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2574130/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1694102747","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Fill out more of your game\u2019s soundtrack with the spectacular tracks of Classic Fantasy Music Pack Vol 3!
