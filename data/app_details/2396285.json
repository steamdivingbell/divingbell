{"about_the_game":"The E-flite EC-1500 Twin is a groundbreaking aircraft that offers a unique flight experience for a wide range of pilots! This multi-motor model carries echoes of full-scale civil and military cargo transport aircraft but has an incredible range of capabilities and options no other airplane can match. Featuring 3S and 4S compatible power systems with custom 5-blade counter-rotating props, the EC-1500's flight envelope encompasses everything from slow and scale-like to sport flying and even aggressive 3D aerobatic capabilities! You can fly from paved, grass, and dirt surfaces; from snow with the included optional-use skis; or from water using the optional float set (sold separately). It also includes factory-installed LED lights, a functional cargo door, and a fully painted finish you can customize with the included Ohio Air National Guard, Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Marines, Navy, and other markings. It's also been upgraded with Smart electronics to offer more capabilities than ever before, including differential thrust, motor reversing, and real-time telemetry data!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis model is equipped with Horizon Hobby and Spektrum exclusive AS3X (Artificial Stabilization \u2013 3-aXis) and optional-use SAFE (Sensor Assisted Flight Envelope) Select technologies, and when SAFE Select is turned on using the mode switch (B on the Spektrum InterLink DX controller) it offers:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPitch and Bank Angle Limits<br />\r\nThese envelope limits keep the airplane from rolling or pitching upside down.  They also prevent excessive climb or dive angles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAutomatic Self-Leveling<br />\r\nThe airplane instantly returns to and holds level flight when the sticks are released and in the center position.  It\u2019s also helpful for keeping the wings level during takeoffs and landings.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396285/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1699908382","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396285/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1699908382","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396285/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1699908382","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396285/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1699908382","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The E-flite EC-1500 Twin is a groundbreaking aircraft that offers a unique flight experience for a wide range of pilots!
