The network was broken up into many different lines, and the S1 traverses the rails of the former Oltern-Luzern railway, which dates back to 1856. Today the line is important as ever, serving as a commuter corridor linking together the towns within the canton of Luzern. <br><br>It\u2019s your job to take control of the varied passenger services on this route. Take in the sights of Lake Sempach, Reuss and Kleine Emme Rivers, and weave through towns and industrial estates on both stopping S1 and Regional Express services between Luzern and Sursee. <br><br>Climb aboard the modern and sleek SBB RABe 523, this 4-car EMU was built to fulfil local and regional operations throughout Switzerland, and it is used extensively throughout the route, making good use of its rapid acceleration, comfortable riding and the state-of-the-art ETCS in-cab signalling system. <br><br>Choose how you want to play; drive trains, ride around as a passenger, complete the route tasks, or simply pick a vantage point and watch the action unfold.
