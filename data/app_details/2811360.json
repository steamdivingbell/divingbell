{"about_the_game":"You are an employee in charge of server computers for the government. One day, you discover that an anonymous organization is attempting to hack into government server computers. Not only are they fast, but their hacks are sophisticated. You're in danger of losing a lot of information to them in the blink of an eye, and you need to stop them quickly if you want to survive this crisis.<br />\r\nThis is a hardcore puzzle genre that can be played simply by using WASD or the arrow keys, enter, and space bar. There are 12 hacking puzzles and 11 dot-connection puzzles to solve. Various objects are placed in the map, including rotating obstacles, opening and closing obstacles, and keys. Maneuver the green circle to complete the hack without touching the obstacles. Each time you solve one hacking puzzle, you must also solve a connect-the-dots puzzle. Finish the hack safely without touching the red obstacles.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2811360/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727437220","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2811360/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1727437220","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2811360/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727437220","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2811360/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727437220","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You are an employee in charge of server computers for the government.
