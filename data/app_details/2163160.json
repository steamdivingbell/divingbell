{"about_the_game":"<strong>OVRLRD</strong> is a solo-developer passion project - an attempt to build a true VR mech simulator inspired by the classics, with a single-player campaign and fully-featured mission editor.<br><br>Inspired by games like VTOL VR, Steel Battalion and MechWarrior 3, OVRLRD puts you in a fully-simulated cockpit, controlling a complex war machine.
