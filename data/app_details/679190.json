{"about_the_game":"The Hunting God is a short walking simulator in which you play as Nodens the hunting god and listen to what he has been through accompanied by a white wolf named Draiochta.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is a relaxing and atmospheric experience with two choices at the end.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;My name is Nodens, and I am the god of hunting on my isles. One day when I was traveling in the Forest of Banagher, I caught a glimpse of some nearby deer. However, they were not the only beings that caught my attention. A white wolf was nearing our mutual prey when a few mortals entered my canvas.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNodens' journey will take you from Forest of Banagher to the Mountain of Bhollain. You will come across some statues which unravel various poetic and very short stories.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith a nice story written by Simon Kolbe Strange and Stephanie Muscari, The Hunting God will make you have a relaxing experience for approximately an hour.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSave progression: The game saves your progression at the beginning of each chapter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPS: The core aspect of this game is the atmosphere. It is recommended for those who mostly seek to experience the mood.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Breasal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/679190/87a2592da1b2bdb23979a1b0588aea71e728e822.jpg"},{"name":"Dagda","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/679190/fec1c83a59db685a0c010d4fc473c70365ef440d.jpg"},{"name":"A Young Girl","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/679190/57f9891a1766406930205392f1ae4f09c6f80300.jpg"},{"name":"Macha","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/679190/b17a63a822363c9e4e6c53a3f176397aed23efc4.jpg"},{"name":"Finegas","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/679190/1678cb65ebfc79108c929bac815574b7ffcebd90.jpg"},{"name":"C\u00fa","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/679190/d10f5d6ac1600ea4339af9de010e07abb86c62a4.jpg"}],"total":6},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/679190/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728894821","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/679190/page.bg.jpg?t=1728894821","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/679190/837d48929b708a0d04ac7fe2508e13219a4f6fd5/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728894821","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/679190/837d48929b708a0d04ac7fe2508e13219a4f6fd5/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728894821","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Hunting God is a short walking simulator in which you play as Nodens the hunting god and listen to what he has been through accompanied by a white wolf named Draiochta.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is a relaxing and atmospheric experience with two choices at the end.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;My name is Nodens, and I am the god of hunting on my isles.
