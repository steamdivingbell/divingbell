{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Welcome to the Intelligent Countertop Association! </h2>You are a Toaster. You have been tasked with eliminating targets by expertly maneuvering toasters into their bathtubs. Use your power cord to slow down time, grapple and swing around physics-based environments to execute a Toastercide, all while navigating as fast as possible.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Navigate with just two simple controls</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2777760/extras/Swinging_GIF.gif?t=1732301183\" /><br>1. If you shoot your power cord at a powered object, you will be pulled towards it at great speed. <br>2. If you shoot your power cord at an unpowered object, the cord will act as a rope, allowing you to change your momentum while moving. <br><br>Using both your grapple and swinging cables effectively is key to maneuvering around the mission environment. Even with just these two mechanics, movement in Toastercide can become very complex which requires learning several advanced maneuvers. <br><br>Oh also, you can slow down time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore a variety of environments.</h2>Toastercide's missions are set in a variety of settings including, but not limited to, a college dorm room, a 3-bedroom suburban home, Santa's workshop, and the city of Dallas Texas in 1963. Be sure to avoid any patrolling goons, and pesky hazards like water, bullets, or, you know, the ground. Believe it or not, but people are scared of moving appliances, so be sure to avoid them as best as possible.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unlock and use special toast abilities!</h2>Unlock and use special toast abilities by collecting toast during missions and ejecting them. Cool mechanics arise depending on which toast ability you choose, allowing for complex synergies and time saving techniques. Abilities include invincibility, dashing, teleportation, burning projectile toast and the toast swap ability. See what works best for you!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Test your skills by going as fast as possible!</h2>Toastercide has been designed with speedrunning in mind. Learn the game's advanced techniques and see if you can beat your previous times and win all three stars!
