{"about_the_game":"&quot;Pathfinder 2 RPG - Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-16: Escape from Oppara<br> <br> A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 3-6. <br> In the city of Oppara, the Pathfinder Society has been investigating a recent crime spree that targeted the assets and allies of Grand Princess Eutropia, Taldor's new monarch who came to power following the War for the Crown. The Society has learned of the group responsible for these crimes, but it has more work to do if it's going to untangle the web of deception and get to the heart of the treasonous conspiracy. Gloriana Morilla, a trusted ally and former Pathfinder leader, has concocted a plan to draw out the Society's enemies. For her plan to work, she's going to need agents who are willing to take some risks, as there's no telling what sinister forces might be responsible for the recent crimes in Oppara. <br> The plan starts like this: first, try to flee the city... but make sure they see you doing it! <br> Escape from Oppara is part of the ongoing Taldor metaplot arc in the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries. It is the second and final scenario in the arc, which began with Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-11: No Time for Treason. While playing the previous scenario enhances the narrative of this two-part story arc, it is not required. <br> Written by Brent Bowser <br> <br><strong> Scenario tags:</strong> Metaplot (Shattered Sanctuaries) <br>  This product is not a PDF or accessible outside of Fantasy Grounds.
