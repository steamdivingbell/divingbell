{"about_the_game":"Shadows of Forbidden Gods is a Lovecraftian strategy game, where you play as a dark god intent on destroying humanity. You initially play as a set of agents, each with unique abilities, and infiltrate, assassinate, raid and enshadow the human nations. Wide ranges of strategies are open to you, from causing interpersonal conflicts between heroes to altering the climate across entire nations to cause mass famines to rising a Dark Empire under the command of your Dark Monarch, to starting nightmarish plagues to simply eradicating entire regions under volcanic devastation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis demo covers the first 200 turns of the game, giving you a good feel for how the game will play, as you begin to establish your cult and begin your work. The heroes and rulers of the world will react to your actions, attempting to undo your actions or even directly attacking your agents if you fail to maintain a low profile. Dynamic AI behaviours allow the AI to react to your actions in a deliberate fashion, levelling up to better cure disease if you employ plagues, or as diplomats if you are causing international unrest. Manage your agents wisely to defeat humanity before it can truly realise the threat which it faces.","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1755230/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1667169157","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1755230/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1667169157","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Shadows of Forbidden Gods is a Lovecraftian strategy game, where you play as a dark god intent on destroying humanity.
