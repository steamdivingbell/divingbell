{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Virtual Towers Online is an unofficial free-to-play realistic, to-scale replica of the Alton Towers theme park created in the Unreal engine. It is designed to be as close as possible using architectural plans and thousands of photo references.

This is an ongoing work-in-progress game so many features will change over time and get added or removed. There is a key shown on the maps in the game that shows which rides are available to ride and what kind of operation mode they have, for example, &quot;Nemesis&quot; is fully automatic so players can ride it without interacting with it, or can take complete control to operate it, whereas &quot;Ripsaw&quot; has only a manual control mode and whilst can be ridden, has no auto mode.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There are likely to be bugs within the builds despite our best attempts at trying to remove any possibility of any issues you may experience however being such a small team, things get missed.
