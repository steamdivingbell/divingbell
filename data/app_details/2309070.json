{"about_the_game":"<strong>Welcome to The Monke Games.</strong><br><br>In this colorful wacky Virtual Reality game, you are able to take the perspective of a &quot;monke&quot;. Similar to a monkey, however, this creature has no legs. You must use your hands to traverse your environments, and reign dominance amongst others through the fun of multiple different game modes. These game modes will help you advance in this beautiful, low-poly world.<br><br><strong>Available Game Modes:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Infection: One monke from your current lobby will be electrocuted, oh no! If that monke happens to be you, you must electrocute all other monkes to win. Otherwise, you better start running! Be the last one standing.<br><br></li><li> Casual: Need a break? Socialize and have fun in the Casual game mode. Nothing to see here!</li></ul><br>While The Monke Games can be fun with the current game modes, many game modes aren't released yet, which we would like to present. These are modes such as...<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Horror: With multiple maps to choose from, select a group of monke buddies to dive deep into the true horrors of The Monke Games. Meet unknown creatures, that may in fact just swallow you whole if you get too close! Stay safe as you traverse through creepy environments to escape and complete your tasks. Oh, and try not to be too loud, they can hear you...<br><br></li><li> Racing: Hop in your monke kart and get rolling on the road! In this fast-pace game mode, you will attempt to gain distance on your opponents using a vehicle of your choice! Complete all laps first, and you may win a Grand Prix!<br><br></li><li> Battle: No more messing around, we are in war! Gun class types are given to you for you to choose. Once you have selected, try and shoot any monke on sight! Of course, the monkes wouldn't actually hurt each other, they are peaceful and instead would like to use toy guns.</li></ul><br>Presented are the modes coming in the near future.<br><br>Stick around in this silly little monke world, and perhaps you will make some friends, some enemies, and some new memories.<br><br><strong>Welcome to The Monke Games.</strong>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2309070/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1675792791","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2309070/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1675792791","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2309070/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1675792791","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2309070/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1675792791","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"VR Supported","id":53}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Welcome to The Monke Games.</strong><br><br>In this colorful wacky Virtual Reality game, you are able to take the perspective of a &quot;monke&quot;.
