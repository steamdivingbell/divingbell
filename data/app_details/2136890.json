{"about_the_game":"The Lonely People is a game about a gifted hacker <strong>Alan Wells</strong> who is always looking for meaning in his life but never really seems to find any and along the way loses his mind because of all the people he killed in his way because of his pursuit to find meaning. The story intends to show how a young sane man can easily break under pressure and become a killing menace. We really tried making the story as realistic as possible and when the game comes out hopefully you could see the effort we put into writing this great character, here is a quote from a key moment in the main story of the game: &quot;<i>When I told the crew about the heist they were all aboard, Josh wanted money, max wanted fame and I wanted revenge, the three desires of man.</i>&quot;. We hope you enjoyed this quick peek behind the story of The Lonely People. Now let's move on to the actual game the game is an action open world game where you can hack, steal, and kill. You can move around the world with your weapons and kill NPCs, steal cars and drive around running people over, catch a wanted level and shoot some cops, complete the main storyline, and so on.<br><br>Thank you for reading and have a GOOD day.<br><br>- RealMad Productions","achievements":{"total":0},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2136890?t=1700423393","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2136890?t=1700423393","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2136890/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1700423393","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2136890/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1700423393","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,3,5,4],"notes":"When Spawning into the game a cutscene might play with sexual content such as a blowjob from a hooker or the player thinking about committing suicide.\r\n\r\nBy shooting NPCs you would see blood and gore on their bodies.\r\n\r\nGuns are a big part of the game and are with you most of the time.\r\n\r\nViolence happens in this game by shooting NPCs and police officers or using your RPG to destroy cars.\r\n\r\nDeath usually happens when killing an NPC or a police officer.\r\n\r\n"},"demos":[{"appid":2136900,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"The Lonely People is a game about a gifted hacker <strong>Alan Wells</strong> who is always looking for meaning in his life but never really seems to find any and along the way loses his mind because of all the people he killed in his way because of his pursuit to find meaning.
