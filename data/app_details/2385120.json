{"about_the_game":"Step into a world where the remnants of humanity struggle to survive against a new race of hybrids that rule the food chain. The cause of the mutations that led to the downfall of modern society remains a mystery - whether it was the result of nature, a scientific experiment, or even extraterrestrial intervention is unknown. As society struggled to cope with the aftermath, tensions escalated and culminated in a violent war between humans and hybrids. In the end, the hybrids emerged victorious, but the victory came at a great cost - humanity was pushed to the brink of extinction.<br><br>Now, in a post-apocalyptic world where the hybrids reign supreme, players must survive in a harsh and unforgiving environment. Explore a vast, open world filled with danger at every turn. Build shelters, scavenge for resources, craft tools and weapons to defend yourself against the many threats that lie ahead.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Mecanics</h2><br>In addition to the immersive sci-fi environment, the game includes core survival mechanics such as hunger, health, energy, stamina, crafting, and cooking. Players must maintain their bodies by eating, resting, and managing their health to avoid negative effects on their abilities. Neglecting their basic needs can result in lowered stats like Strength or reduced max stamina. The game features different status effects such as poison, bleeding, or fatigue, each with unique side effects, including continues slow health loss, increased susceptibility to cold, hallucinations, low stamina,blurred vision, and on extreme cases occasional blackouts.<br><br><strong>Psychological effects:</strong> The psychological effects such as paranoia, sleep deprivation, or hallucinations, will affect the player's mental health and add a unique element to the survival gameplay. These effects will make the player's mental health just as important as their physical health, creating a more nuanced and immersive gameplay experience.<br><br><strong>Dynamic Ecosystem:</strong> The dynamic ecosystem means that the player's actions can affect the balance of the environment. For example, overhunting predators could lead to an overpopulation of prey animals, which could then lead to food shortages for the player. If you overhunt prey the predators become more hostile and no longer respect patterns such as night creatures will be spotted during day and creatures that would normally live underground are now roaming the cities hunting for food. This system adds a layer of complexity to the gameplay, as players will need to think about the consequences of their actions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Discover Crafting Recipes:</h2>In this game, crafting (Includes cooking) recipes are not handed to you on a platter. You must actively search for books and blueprints scattered throughout the world. These blueprints contain essential knowledge and skills to create advanced items and tools. There is no leveling system to unlock specific recipes. You must rely on your exploration and scavenging skills to gather the necessary resources and discover these blueprints. So, get ready to put on your detective hat and explore the world to uncover the secrets of crafting.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hybrid or Human(In Dev Progress)</h2>Play as a hybrid humanoid and experience the world in a unique way. Hybrids have increased stamina and strength, allowing them to carry more items, but they also get hungry more often. However, playing as a hybrid comes with disadvantages. Some cities and outposts are off-limits to hybrids, and certain gear, such as helmets, are only available for humans. Hybrids have horns or long ears that do not fit in helmets, but humans may benefit from night vision or heat vision provided by the helmets.<br><br>As a hybrid, your senses and abilities are different from those of a human. You can see and hear things that humans can't, but you may struggle with certain tasks that humans find easy. With every decision you make, you will need to weigh the pros and cons of playing as a hybrid, and choose the path that works best for you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Inspirations</h2><br>The game draws inspiration from a variety of sources, both in terms of story and gameplay. The narrative is driven by the concept of interspecies mutations, which has resulted in the emergence of terrifying hybrid creatures. In terms of gameplay, the focus is on immersion and hardcore survival mechanics. The game features minimalistic menus and user interfaces that allow players to remain fully engaged with the game world.  <br><br>Overall, the game aims to provide a unique and immersive experience for players, drawing on various sources for inspiration to create a compelling and challenging survival game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2385120/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1686241236","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2385120/page.bg.jpg?t=1686241236","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2385120/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1686241236","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2385120/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1686241236","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Game does contain some mild nudity, gore and violence.
