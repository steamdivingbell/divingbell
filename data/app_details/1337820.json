{"about_the_game":"Emergence is an awe-inspiring VR open-world art experience, visualising patterns of human behaviour and exploring the individual and the collective.

As your pace and directions influence others as both individuals and as a whole, you essentially become the choreographer of the crowd.<br><br>The crowd\u2019s movements are programmed to simulate intelligent behaviours (including avoidance, following and mimicry), reflecting the seemingly endless ways that humans act in group settings. Viewed from above, these movements create mesmerising patterns against the landscape. A shaft of light beckons you \u2013 each time you reach the light, this landscape shifts, along with its soundtrack, gravity, atmosphere and mode of movement.<br><br>Emergence doesn\u2019t dictate a goal. There\u2019s no fixed succession of tasks that lead you to \u2018completing\u2019 the game. The experience instead is a powerful challenge to the player\u2019s perception. Are you a leader inspiring a devoted following, or a defenceless figure overwhelmed by the encroaching horde?
