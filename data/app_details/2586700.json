Can you engineer your path to survival, turning the remnants of a war-torn world into tools of hope, or will the challenges crush your aspirations? The journey of resilience and invention awaits, where the genius of your mind will carve the path to your very existence.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2586700/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1721475709","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2586700/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1721475709","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2586700/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1721475709","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2586700/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1721475709","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2586700/extras/fight.gif?t=1721475709\" /><br><br>Embark on an epic journey of bravery and mystery in &quot;Son of Killwa,&quot; an enthralling adventure game that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
