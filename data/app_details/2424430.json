{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Shadow of the Demon Lord Monstrous Pack 3 - The Faerie and the Genie</h2>  A collection of four Monstrous Pages based on the themes of faerie and genie. This pack consists of the following Shadow of the Demon Lord products: <br> <br> <strong> Denizens of Filth</strong> <br> <br> The cities and towns of R?l are islands of civilization that provide a refuge from the horrors in the uninhabited parts of the land. Behind their walls and barred gates, citizens feel safe from what lurks outside. Content in their homes, few of them realize that the tunnels and sewers under their feet teem with sinister creatures and foul abominations that wallow in the filth, looking for the right moment to snatch a fresh meal. <br> One such terror is the creature that most people call the filth goblin. This offshoot of the goblin race thrives and multiplies in the fetid sewers, privies, and waterways that flow beneath the largest towns and cities. Their primary form of sustenance is humanoid waste--the warmer and fresher the better. Few citizens sitting down to do their bodily business realize that something sinister might lurk mere feet or inches away. <br> <br> <strong> Genius Loci</strong> <br> <br> Genius Loci examines the origins of the genies, their significant role in the creation of reality and the multiverse, and their present, deplorable state. Like all entries into the Monstrous Pages series, the aim of this supplement is to add depth and character to iconic creatures from Shadow of the Demon Lord to help you develop them more fully part of your game. Genius Loci contains detailed background information on the genie, such as the origins and the history of the genies, details on genies worshiped as gods, and incarnation forms. <br> <br> <strong> Malicious Mischief</strong> <br> <br> Scholars point those curious about the faeries and their ilk to old tomes whose parchment pages hold ancient stories and legends, but the best source of knowledge is the folklore hiding in plain sight. The weary midwife who mops away the tears after losing another beautiful babe to the Goblin King, the portly farmer who scratches his head in wonder over his singing swine, and the stable-boy who keeps an iron nail over his heart lest the pooka get him again--such commoners brim with tales, gossip, and first-hand accounts of the Fair Folk, for they're the most likely to run across such beings in their day-to-day lives. As outlandish and strange as their customs might be, a traveler would always do well to listen and learn, for the faeries are a tricksy breed, filled with malicious mischief. <br> In Malicious Mischief, three new darkly humorous faeries join the ranks of the fey folk in this installment of Monstrous Pages. You'll find everything you need to know to introduce welterkin, menhyads, and perookas into your games. <br> <br> <strong> Wee Folk</strong> <br> <br> Faeries come in all shapes and sizes, with dispositions that cover the spectrum from friendly to malicious. Best known are the dreaded hags nursing their spite and bitterness in seclusion, the magnificent lords and ladies of the hidden kingdoms, and cruel harpies and dreaded sirens who lure people to their dooms, but their ranks also include a raft of lesser beings of wildly varied form and capability. These minor faeries, sometimes called wee folk, might lend aid to mortals, performing chores and easing suffering in exchange for small gifts and favors. Others are as cruel and malicious as the wickedest devil, and take special pleasure in tormenting the hated mortals on the edges of settled lands. Who can know the minds of these immortals and the whys and hows behind what they do? <br> Wee Folk examines an assortment of minor faeries found in the hidden kingdoms and the mortal world to shed light on their strangeness, danger, and unpredictability. This supplement also revisits several faeries described in Shadow and other sourcebooks. <br> <br> <strong> Combat encounter maps included: None</strong> <br> <br> This pack features the following: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li> Over 50 NPC entries, included such iconoclastic monsters as the jack-o'-lantern, the leprechaun, and the salamander <br> </li><li> 12 new genie forms from blood genies to pitch genies <br> </li><li> The most foulest of faeries, the filth goblin <br> </li><li> Astonishing artwork by Ivan Dixon! </li></ul>&quot;","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2424430/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1684244298","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2424430/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1684244298","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2424430/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1684244298","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2424430/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1684244298","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Shadow of the Demon Lord Monstrous Pack 3 - The Faerie and the Genie</h2>  A collection of four Monstrous Pages based on the themes of faerie and genie.
