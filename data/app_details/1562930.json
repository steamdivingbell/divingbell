{"about_the_game":"A sudden catastrophe has led life on Earth to the verge of extinction. The Professor, the only survivor, spent years performing research in an underground laboratory trying to recreate life to no avail. The resources he needs to do this can only be harvested outdoors, where he himself cannot go. He therefore created an android to help him: you. Plants are the only living things left in this world where human civilization is no more. It is cruel, but beautiful. The Professor and the android embark on a quest to bring animals back to the planet.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1562930/extras/Biome_Explore.gif?t=1728639520\" /><br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EXPLORE A STUNNING PIXEL-ART WORLD</h2></strong><br>Experience the highly emotive journey of an android created to bring back life, and change desolate wastelands into lush, populated habitats.
