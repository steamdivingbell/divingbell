{"about_the_game":"An army of monsters, demons, and undead sweeps the land.  Armed with only an old sword, crossbow, and A LOT of fireworks, you're forced into a struggle to survive.  Waves of unique and dangerous enemies advance on your home, intent on killing you.  Hone your skills, upgrade your equipment, and push back.  Take the fight to them, destroy their leaders, and break the horde.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSeveral uniquely dangerous enemy types swarm you in droves.  By pushing back against the horde, you earn upgrades to spend how you enjoy.  Will you upgrade the crossbow and pierce through armies of the undead?  Will you specialize in the sword and cut down legions of monsters?  Will you improve your fireworks and obliterate clusters of demons?  Whether you focus on one ability, or spread your upgrades out for a well rounded character, you can play how you want in each level.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3 visually distinct locations await, each with their own unique waves, and each with it's own unique boss battle.  Survive on your farm as the horde attacks you at your home, trek through snowy wasteland in the direction of the invaders, and raid the palace of the fiend who rules over the horde.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce you've completed the game, an Endless mode awaits.  With automatically generated waves, try and push as far as you can.  Can you make 100?  200?  Each stage will separately track your highest wave.  Additionally, you can read the journal of the player character.  Kill counts and little nuggets of the world can be found inside, allowing you to keep track of how many of each enemy you've killed.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Nyoom","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1739480/4ebebb964f4ca736e3249fddb0730efaa8f4fc35.jpg"},{"name":"Dead Army Dead","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1739480/547b74c2ab742ac69c0b7f0b68f5dc10b8fc54d5.jpg"},{"name":"No Fly Zone","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1739480/45036ec4fdfe61655a8abf3402db90911f1dfc39.jpg"},{"name":"Scrap Heap","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1739480/a780fc48394a86ae606bf94d61209e15af476f9e.jpg"},{"name":"Who's Laughing Now?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1739480/51c47ce9b31bb7046fea01e51d426c3a2b09e35f.jpg"},{"name":"No Safe Distance","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1739480/deaee987ab2dc3cfbd750cb421c65a353a652f17.jpg"},{"name":"The Best Goblin, is a Dead Goblin","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1739480/1281b4e2a4534127be2b07d570d55730dd7c316d.jpg"},{"name":"Anticonservationist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1739480/a4e3678c7867ecb26136762b79a083a29be432ee.jpg"},{"name":"Wolfsbane","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1739480/2aa256e431a0caff2235c8f92d0f1d1dc77ceb85.jpg"},{"name":"Back to the Earth","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1739480/f7f0d3b1323ed3f4ce3d8a6c7f6325d758d53371.jpg"}],"total":37},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1739480/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1643613067","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1739480/page.bg.jpg?t=1643613067","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1739480/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1643613067","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1739480/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1643613067","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"An army of monsters, demons, and undead sweeps the land.
