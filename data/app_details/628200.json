{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/628200/extras/GET_RICH.png?t=1731764038\" /><br>Congrats on your new job! Welcome to the first-person world of a mid-level stockbroker, as you begin your very first day at the trading firm FERIOS. You\u2019ve probably wanted this job since you were six, right? Well, so have a lot of people\u2026 so you'll have to fight for it and prove that you're the top dog for the job!<br><br>Just remember: profit is all that matters, the rules don\u2019t apply if you\u2019re a winner, and only losers feel guilty for the pain, loss and poverty that are the unfortunate but unavoidable by-product of the critical and important work we do here.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/628200/extras/Drama_2.gif?t=1731764038\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/628200/extras/BUY_SELL_SHORT.png?t=1731764038\" /><br>It\u2019s simple: your job is to make money for FERIOS.  Buy the stocks going up, sell before they go down. Short the ones that are going to fall (or the ones you\u2019re going to make fall). The more money you make, the bigger your commission. And you want that commission, don't you? Well don\u2019t worry, the rewards are limitless, if you\u2019re hungry enough.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/628200/extras/One_of_you_is_th_wrong_person.gif?t=1731764038\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/628200/extras/MANIPULATE_THE_MARKET.png?t=1731764038\" /><br>If you\u2019re really smart, you\u2019ll find ways to influence the market to your advantage. Think you can lobby an influential group to affect the market? Do it. Get an opportunity to acquire majority shares to move the needle? Take it.  Drive down the currency of a foreign country to improve the margins of the companies that import their products? Why not? The only consequences that matter are the ones that impact our bottom line.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/628200/extras/Workin.gif?t=1731764038\" /><br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/628200/extras/INSIDER_TRADING.png?t=1731764038\" /><br>Every Joe Schmo has access to the regular news. If you want to get ahead of the spikes and crashes you\u2019ll need to find the inside line from more, shall we say, \u201cexclusive\u201d sources. And definitely don\u2019t let those rumors of a financial investigation get you down.

So in the spirit of togetherness you better meet your daily profit targets and beat your coworkers\u2019 results if you want to keep your job.
