Featuring steep gradients, stunning scenery and the iconic \u201cKrokodil\u201d, embark on a nostalgic adventure between Germany &amp; Austria!<br><br>Also known as the Karwendelbahn, the Mittenwaldbahn traverses the Alps between Bavaria, Germany, and Tyrol, Austria. Talks of a mountain railway went back as far as the 1880s, although no trains would turn a wheel over the pass until 1912. The line was planned to be electrified from the start, to make tackling the route much easier.<br><br>Even with electric traction, traversing a mountain range is no small feat for a standard gauge railway. The Mittenwaldbahn features many tunnels and iconic bridges, with incredible ruling gradients as steep as 3.8%.
