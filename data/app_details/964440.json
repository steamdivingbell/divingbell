{"about_the_game":"Adam Smithson does his best to exist in his tiny apartment, alone, high above Century City. His only companion is a bonsai tree, which he dutifully cares for\u2014perhaps only to pass the time. Time seems to have no beginning or end. But like everything else in the city, his plants require blood to survive. So Adam is forced to find a regular supply on the dark streets below. An elevator lowers Adam into the shadowy nightmare of the city, where the hunt begins. In a place where blood is currency, and the only way out is down, Adam must survive and thrive the best he can while confronting others with the same goal in mind.<br><br>A unique hardcore extraction experience, Hell is Others allows you to progress your character through customizable items you obtain for your apartment.
