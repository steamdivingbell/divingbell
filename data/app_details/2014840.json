Face your fears, press on against the darkness and stare back at the abyss.<br><br>Cathedral of Sorrow is an experimental horror game starring Magnus Bruun (Assassin's Creed: Valhalla). Combining frantic first-person gameplay and immersive storytelling with procedural level generation and sophisticated machine learning, the Cathedral scars your mind and breaks your heart using real artificial intelligence and machine learning to profile your fears and adapt the game to break you.<br><br>Immerse yourself in a story of algorithmic cruelty, and how the systems we design to help us turn into jailers. Seek out those trapped in the nightmare with you to learn the truth of what happened to you. And should you fail, the Cathedral will embrace you once more, eager to surprise and terrify you in new and malicious ways.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">AN EVOLVING NIGHTMARE</h2>The baleful spirits haunting the Cathedral are hellbent on tormenting you.

With every reset, the abyssal labyrinth of the Cathedral procedurally twists, turns, and deepens as the AI director of the game gets to know you. Traverse a boundless palette of danger-filled corridors, ranging from the gothic and grotesque to the infernal and impossible. No playthrough is the same.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A MIRROR DARKLY</h2>Witness gripping scenes of emotional devastation and human frailty, as a cast of depthful and intriguing characters are brought to life by masterful performers, including Magnus Bruun (Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla.)
