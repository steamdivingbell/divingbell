{"about_the_game":"Play the <strong>hardcore</strong> mode of this insane, innovative, addictive puzzler - if you dare! Inside each revealed hexagon is a number - that refers to how many of the adjacent tiles are the same colour. For example, a &quot;6&quot; would mean that every surrounding tile was the same colour as that hexagon. There is a wild twist: you can swap any two revealed tiles of different colors! This demo has endless replayability and gives a great taste of what Jubilane is all about.","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1978160/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1650582433","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1978160/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1650582433","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Play the <strong>hardcore</strong> mode of this insane, innovative, addictive puzzler - if you dare!
