{"about_the_game":"A 2D maze puzzle game with the feel of a runner. The two characters are alternately controlled, where the objective is to open the correct doors of the dungeon to get to the exit as quickly as possible before everything collapses. The look is reminiscent of classic video games with more minimalist touch of pixel art. There are 60 levels until the end of the game, and after each stage, a score is shown based on the time taken and items collected.<br />\r\nThe game will also have an area to check the general ranking and ranking by stage of all steam players.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1336680/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1704883385","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1336680/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1704883385","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1336680/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1704883385","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1336680/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1704883385","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"A 2D maze puzzle game with the feel of a runner.
