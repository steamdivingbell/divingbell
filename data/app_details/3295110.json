{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">LEVEL37 is an exploration game. The protagonist takes the elevator and accidentally enters LEVEL 37.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The main thing about LEVEL 37 is to look around and listen to the sounds. It has nothing to do with winning or losing. You can say that this is like an art gallery, walk around and feel the atmosphere. There are no monsters chasing you or suddenly jumping at you in the game. There are very few things to solve, almost just a few mazes. Sometimes the game will challenge your navigation skills. But most of the time you are just exploring.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Note: The game may be depressing. LEVEL 37 exploits people's fear of getting lost, dark and small spaces.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There is no loud background music in this game. Instead, the game uses sound to make you feel immersive. The sound and echo will change depending on the room you are in. Walking in water slows you down. All of this makes the game feel more real and creates a tense atmosphere.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There is no absolute story, no characters to meet, but through exploration you can probably imagine what it was like to be here before. As you explore further and advance, you begin to notice that the game world around you changes, as if these places have appeared in your dreams, and each place has its own mystery.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3295110/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731741129","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3295110/page.bg.jpg?t=1731741129","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3295110/4f7b8ac40d96701696dc48376347d76e83a1616f/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731741129","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3295110/4f7b8ac40d96701696dc48376347d76e83a1616f/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731741129","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">LEVEL37 is an exploration game.
