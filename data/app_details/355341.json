{"about_the_game":"The Piper PA-34 Seneca was first flown in 1969. Initially designed as a twin engine version of the Cherokee Six, the Seneca is normally used for personal and business transportation, boasting a range of approximately 725 nautical miles. <br> <br>The 200T variant of the Seneca was introduced in 1974, and included an engine upgrade to turbocharged six cylinder Continental TSIO-360E or EB engines. The ailerons were enlarged, and a rudder anti-servo tab was also added. <br> <br>The Carenado version of the Piper PA-34-200T Seneca II provides a detailed flight deck with fully functional gauges, making it ideal for advanced simmers as well as fledgling pilots. The sound effects have been sourced from an actual PA-34. Also featured are animated rudder, flap, and aileron movements, removable engine cowls, and fully functional cargo doors.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>IFR certification <br></li><li>Original HQ digital stereo sounds (44100 HZ) recorded from the original aircraft<br></li><li>Animated parts include doors, sun visor, vibrating antenna and vibrating static wicks<br></li><li>3D modelled pilot and cockpit area<br></li><li>Details include chocks, cowl plugs and baggage area<br></li><li>Realistic light effects on gauges<br></li><li>Nightlight effects on panel<br></li><li>Built-in zoom gauges<br></li><li>Separate switches for instruments lights and dome light</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/355341/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1537254814","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/355341/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1537254814","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/355341/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1537254814","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/355341/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1537254814","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Piper PA-34 Seneca was first flown in 1969.
