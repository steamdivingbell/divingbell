When activated, the warp effect stops time and transmits the ZanFighter almost instantaneously to the designated coordinates. <br>  Warp transmission utilizes multiple dimensions, allowing the ZanFighter to pass through any type of physical matter, including enemy bullets and obstacles. At the same time, it inflicts slicing damage upon any enemies that lie in the path of the warp.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/564040/extras/zangeki-_l.png?t=1736842811\" /><br><br><i><strong>Dimensional Shockwave</strong></i><br>This area-effect attack inflicts damage upon any enemies present at the warp destination upon completion of the warp.
