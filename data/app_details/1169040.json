The infinite procedurally generated world of Necesse is full of mysteries to uncover as you grow your settlement and lead expeditions against pirate kings, dragons, and fallen wizards alike. Will you spend your days crawling through dungeons, searching for treasures and raw materials with which to craft your equipment? Or will you answer the call to adventure, traversing the seas and seeking out great foes to test your prowess? Recruit settlers with particular skills and work alongside them to mine a wide variety of ores, craft gear tailored to your preferred playstyle, and establish a flourishing village. <br><br>Play singleplayer or co-op - or establish a dedicated server with hundreds of other players.

Will you and your friends establish separate competing colonies, or will you pool your resources and divide roles to build a giant settlement together?
