{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Welcome to Lowpoly Tower Defense!</h2><br>In this game, you have to manage resources and towers to prevent the enemies from reaching their goal. You'll be battling LowPoly SciFi enemies in a desert! But be aware: Resources are quickly depleted! You need to ensure a steady supply. Moreover, your opponents will increase with each round! Utilize the interim periods to construct towers, organize resources, and fortify chokepoints with towers.<br><br>This game is designed as a supplementary activity for an instructional course and is developed without any commercial intentions. If you wish to recreate this game for your personal use, please contact the publisher!<br><br>Now, enjoy building and best of luck!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Best regards, Holger</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Instructions</h2><br>Welcome! After the game has started, simply click on Desert Fight in the Main Menu. Now you can move using WASD. First, you should build resource ships (click on the building directly in front of you). The ships will then fly to the silos and collect resources on their own. You can unlock additional silos - just click on them. Make sure you have enough resources to unlock a silo. Use the resources to build towers on the platforms, which will automatically attack the enemies. The towers have a limited range - try it out. Try to catch all enemies and pay attention to their paths. If you let too many enemies escape, you lose. The enemies appear at the top left in three different locations and then move down to the three caves on the bottom right. There are a maximum of 15 rounds! Good luck!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2786490/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1712914650","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2786490/page.bg.jpg?t=1712914650","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2786490/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1712914650","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2786490/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1712914650","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Welcome to Lowpoly Tower Defense!</h2><br>In this game, you have to manage resources and towers to prevent the enemies from reaching their goal.
