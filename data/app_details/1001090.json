{"about_the_game":"This DLC does not give you anything. This is a donation, and 100% of the money will be put back into this game, or into the other projects I am working on. I do not believe in IAP's for skins, extra tracks, &quot;play time&quot; and other such petty things. This is why my game is a one-time purchase and why I have this &quot;DLC&quot;. I will be working to make this game have more variety. Specifically; more vehicles, environments, more events during gameplay, and more supported platforms including mobile. From there, profits will be put towards new games I hope you will all look forward to. Thank you all for your support, thank you!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1001090/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1544805120","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1001090/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1544805120","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1001090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1544805120","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1001090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1544805120","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This DLC does not give you anything.
