{"about_the_game":"The &quot;Sergeant&quot; is the reliable leader who allowed the protagonist of &quot;Earth Defense Force 5&quot; to reach his full potential. This allows you to play as an EDF5 Ranger that uses the Sergeant's colors. Furthermore, he comes equipped with a certain weapon that comes to mind when you think of the Sergeant. Now you can lead both your team and the planet to safety as if you were the Sergeant himself. Just be aware that the actual Sergeant character does not appear in the game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1596650/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1622099151","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1596650/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1622099151","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1596650/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1622099151","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1596650/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1622099151","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The &quot;Sergeant&quot; is the reliable leader who allowed the protagonist of &quot;Earth Defense Force 5&quot; to reach his full potential.
