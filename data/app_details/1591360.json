If you've followed me on socials, you've seen the announcement of the winning entries.  In case you didn't see the who entered, checkout the twitter post here:<br><br>They all were great and showed a lot of great styles. You can also find them in the third option of the updated Episode 0.<br><br>Secondly, thanks to some outside feedback and some help along the way, I made many needed fixes to the Episode 1 DLC as well! To see the new content, you need to start a new save from Ep 0.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ALSO</h2><br>I've decided to get some crowdfunding for this project with <strong>IndieGoGo</strong>! <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1591360/extras/Ep1TitlePosterIGG.jpg?t=1680730925\" /><br><br>It's a big step forward for the project as a whole and something would really help grease the tracks of the development train.
