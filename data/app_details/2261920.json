{"about_the_game":"Find the Whales is a free-to-play educational game for all ages about ocean conservation. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers travel to simulated places on the globe to find whales, fish, and other marine animals. They also do simulated conservation quests to help the animals. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe locations featured are Hawaii and the Mesoamerican Reef. In this 2D side-scroller, players walk, snorkel, and SCUBA dive to find crabs, whales, fish, dolphins and other animals.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nQuests include planting mangrove seedlings, stopping illegal fishing, slowing down speeding boats, cleaning polluted water, farming seaweed and listening for whales with a hydrophone.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers collect points for finding species. They can also take photos to store in the simulated photo album. Points are used to purchase quest-related tools in the simulated stores at each location. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers also collect information cards. The more times they find the same species, the more information is added to these cards - text, photos and videos about these species.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2261920?t=1673543543","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2261920/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1673543543","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2261920/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1673543543","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2261920/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1673543543","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Find the Whales is a free-to-play educational game for all ages about ocean conservation. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers travel to simulated places on the globe to find whales, fish, and other marine animals.
