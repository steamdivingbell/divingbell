{"about_the_game":"<strong>In the cosmic strategy game &quot;Dark Era&quot;</strong>, humanity faces the ultimate test of endurance in a universe on the brink of eternal darkness. Set in a time 10^40 years after the birth of the universe, where black holes and dying neutron stars dominate the cosmos, you must lead the remnants of civilization to salvation. Stationed at a frontier outpost orbiting a supermassive black hole, your mission is to not just survive but to thrive and initiate the rebirth of the universe.<br><i>Just remember, in the vast expanse of space, hope is as crucial as air.</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build and Upgrade Your Cosmic Bastion:</h2>Everything in your outpost is under your control, from advanced research stations to essential life-support systems.
