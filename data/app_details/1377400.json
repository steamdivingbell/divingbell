Establishing a peaceful alliance between aliens and humans will be a difficult task, and Trey is far from the ideal candidate to represent the human race. Trey has grown up entirely in human-centric surroundings and has never ventured beyond our territories. Unfortunately, he also has absolutely no training in diplomacy.

To do this, emissaries will journey across the universe as a peace legation to the homeworlds of each alien race, then convince their leaders to send a representative to join the Interstellar Union.
