{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>8 Ball is back!</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">And this time, your mission is to rescue the balls that got stuck in Snookyland. To do this, you need to face enemies, free them from their cages and collect golden tokens to unlock new levels. Each ball has a specific text that is displayed as soon as you rescue it, and when you return to the table, the rescued balls will be running free to celebrate freedom. When you complete the levels you unlock a painting, which will decorate the games room. Furthermore, if you collect all the golden chips and redeem all the balls, the table and game room will have a premium look.</p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"BALL 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3300260/702b2e61c6ced8e81b6aa5e220ab740a0f12f0ad.jpg"},{"name":"BALL 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3300260/c30ceb0e860030efb91eb64e9a04eb086b1a451e.jpg"},{"name":"BALL 3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3300260/9eb91df9af2f85344515a32602f68e269e382103.jpg"},{"name":"BALL 4","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3300260/89360163daa14e54b3d56c4558ddf7ee4fecd757.jpg"},{"name":"BALL 5","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3300260/1863ad78e47329a8503c0235a6c20e930baf572e.jpg"},{"name":"BALL 6","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3300260/c6f66edcf215ed5f946f95ec1797e985a3ec57b3.jpg"},{"name":"BALL 7","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3300260/28951d3a2f72a2f676a2f217776b423889dd4cc9.jpg"},{"name":"BALL 9","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3300260/2510555d764efb62d1bce839c4397b4e37531bfa.jpg"},{"name":"BALL 10","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3300260/a47b4ddd3401b65b285d62a8b9c1530f80328ce5.jpg"},{"name":"BALL 11","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3300260/5185e609df24b3b3cd5aeff5b22d6a0cc65da163.jpg"}],"total":21},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3300260/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735741064","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3300260/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1735741064","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3300260/36c6df90481e8fd61c621709ec0a87520fa9e065/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735741064","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3300260/36c6df90481e8fd61c621709ec0a87520fa9e065/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735741064","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>8 Ball is back!</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">And this time, your mission is to rescue the balls that got stuck in Snookyland.
