{"about_the_game":"<strong>She's angry </strong>at you for messing with her curvy figure! Now do something useful: help her wipe out humanity. Dive into Angry Mother Earth, a strategy game where you combine powers and use various tactics in a fully simulated world to end humanity. A game experience that's truly one of a kind.<br><br><strong>Easy to Learn, Hard to Master!</strong> You use abilities like tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes, and more to eliminate humanity before they end you with pollution. However, mastering the game is an entirely different challenge! While you might unleash a tornado to destroy industrial districts that damages you and affects your health bar, you must proceed with caution. The tornado could destroy trees in its path, which mitigate the damage you sustain over time. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2580160/extras/New_Test_2.gif?t=1730972811\" />  <br><br><strong>In &quot;Angry Mother Earth,&quot; </strong>you face the agony of choice on how to destroy humanity.
