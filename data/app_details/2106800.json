{"about_the_game":"Showcase four stunning new prehistoric species in your parks with Jurassic World Evolution 2: Late Cretaceous Pack. Inspired by the fascinating Late Cretaceous period, this pack includes four captivating species that roamed the land, sea and air over 65 million years ago, from soaring, stealthy hunters of the skies to one of the largest dinosaurs ever discovered.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">This pack features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Barbaridactylus, a flying hunter that lived towards the end of the Late Cretaceous era. With its magnificent head crest, Barbaridactylus will make a distinctive addition to your park. This species takes its name from the Barbary Coast of North Africa, near to where it was discovered.<br></li><li>Alamosaurus, an armoured titan and one of the largest dinosaurs ever discovered, with shinbones taller than an adult human. Sporting large spines running down its shoulders, back and tail, Alamosaurus is a behemoth of an herbivore, presenting a serious challenge to potential predators.<br></li><li>Australovenator, a fast and agile medium-sized carnivore that occupied Australia around 95 million years ago. Characterised by a lightweight frame, extremely sharp teeth, and flexible arms used for grabbing, Australovenator was perfectly built for stalking and running down prey. <br></li><li>Styxosaurus, a marine species that ruled the Late Cretaceous waves. Its streamlined shape combined with sizable fins produces deadly undersea swiftness, making Styxosaurus one of the most efficient predators of its time. Try modifying its genome with diverse bioluminescent pattern colours.</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2106800/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1663236313","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2106800/page.bg.jpg?t=1663236313","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2106800/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1663236313","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2106800/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1663236313","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Showcase four stunning new prehistoric species in your parks with Jurassic World Evolution 2: Late Cretaceous Pack.
