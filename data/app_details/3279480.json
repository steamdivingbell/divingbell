{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Have you ever considered playing Chess and Tetris simultaneously? Guess what? My strange brain did for years; I don't know why. But I finally took the time to create this game. And that's how chess 'n' blocks was born.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game is designed to be straightforward. Two players engage in a fast-paced chess match, known as blitz mode. You both have 5 minutes to play all your moves. When it's your turn, a timer decreases until you make your move. If this timer reaches 0, you lose. Simple right?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">But that's not all. Once the first move is done, Tetris pieces start falling! And if you lose at Tetris or chess, you lose, too!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">But I also wanted to connect both games; how? That's the funny part: if you take a piece at chess, a line spawns at the bottom of your opponent's Tetris, making it harder for them. But what if it's not your turn at chess? Then try to break three lines on your Tetris to add two to your opponent's one! Or make a Tetris by breaking 4 of them and adding three lines this time!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Quite simple, right? Focusing on both games is not easy at all! But it's the spice!</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3279480/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731278017","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3279480/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1731278017","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3279480/19fa9282ce4a80ccc1eca4a308402eaaae937b77/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731278017","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3279480/19fa9282ce4a80ccc1eca4a308402eaaae937b77/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731278017","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Have you ever considered playing Chess and Tetris simultaneously?
