There are four types of enemy aircraft, no attack mode, autonomous attack mode, attacking player mode, and special attack mode. Each enemy plane is divided into several enemy planes. For example, there are three enemy planes in attack mode. They only fire one bullet and two bullets, and fire several bullets. The same is true of firing at players. Special attacking enemy bullets will not damage the fighter, but after the fighter is hit, it will have the attributes of rollover control and slowdown. There will also be agencies in the scene. The power grid, portal and missiles will appear in different periods. The portal will allow the fighter to teleport diagonally. The power grid will explode when it touches the war. The missile will have a laser warning before launch.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"The Shield","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1212320/16a970720dc0e8755b386e3fb61b251b098c41f3.jpg"},{"name":"The Boom","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1212320/4c6f11b48b4ea14303001f510ae711e2ef13ad5b.jpg"},{"name":"The Wingman","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1212320/b6e92c61f66c93cea00fd1fc8ce1acf389c45635.jpg"},{"name":"Emm....A bug?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1212320/b2f1ca4e256dabcc0be5c2484b2474a7c81a175a.jpg"},{"name":"Ok, Let`s go!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1212320/8847aefba0b7ab208d0ad72b40fdfe77d7116797.jpg"},{"name":"Interesting!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1212320/06350f1c1d6f10533ef29fdbabd9e9544437efda.jpg"},{"name":"Nice!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1212320/f8eac0d8c3e5b45d25681237fc960981020cfcd1.jpg"},{"name":"Awesome!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1212320/4373cbfeb92865666ad6cfd37a3d9690a3a21b17.jpg"},{"name":"Amazing!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1212320/d41fd303056e40cf75cb4e4bc84463e6e35cbbe9.jpg"},{"name":"Wow!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1212320/9cb411e6255ce454965de417dfce416b90de59cd.jpg"}],"total":17},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1212320/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1597826497","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1212320/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1597826497","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1212320/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1597826497","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1212320/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1597826497","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">en....I can speak English a little, so, sorry for my English.</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">what Kind Of Game Is This?</h2>This is a casual game, the player has five fighters to choose, Each fighter has exclusive perk.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">what Are the Fighters?</h2>There are five fighters, Fire, Shield, Boom, Wingman, Bug.
