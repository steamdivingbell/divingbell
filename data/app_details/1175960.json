{"about_the_game":"<strong>Last Joy</strong> is a hand painted story-driven RPG with a unique combat system. The setting of the game represents the Early Middle Ages period, magic is in charge of all spheres of life and people in this world are immortal. They do not grow old and die of their own free will. <br><br>The game takes place in the city of Last Joy, located at the entrance to the afterworld. People go there to dissipate the last money they have and end their lives. The city atmosphere is pretty dark and grim. Gangs, brothels, taverns, almost absolute anarchy.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1175960/extras/Bedroom.gif?t=1571983359\" /><br><br>While developing the game we have been inspired by the depth of classic RPG worlds.
