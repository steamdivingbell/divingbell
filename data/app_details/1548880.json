{"about_the_game":"Breakout Force is a culmination of quirky block-breaking games greatly inspired by Nights into Dreams and like-minded games from the 90s. Rack up points, maximize chains all before the timer runs out. The game will put your tactical and twitch reflex skills to the test, all in strobing Arcady style. Breakout Force contains two primary modules, &quot;Armadillo Rush&quot; and &quot;Flash n Dash.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Armadillo Rush module is a fast-paced sss... pinball / like platformer.  Roll, jump or walk through nonstop cacti pandemonium. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith Flash n Dash, everything is lava. Did you enjoy that X O puzzle from Undertale? We made a whole game of it! The objective is to run over all blue squares, which in turn makes red squares and inhibits the player from backtracking. However, the player also holds a unique warping gambit, allowing for pure Awesomeness to incur.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1548880/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1675972148","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1548880/page.bg.jpg?t=1675972148","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1548880/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1675972148","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1548880/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1675972148","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Breakout Force is a culmination of quirky block-breaking games greatly inspired by Nights into Dreams and like-minded games from the 90s.
