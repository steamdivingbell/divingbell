Players need to fill the squares on the matrix to solve the puzzle. Players need to complete the puzzles of each layer to restore the original face of the 3D object, just like slowly carving a stone into a work of art. The game is easy to get started, and people get into it. The size of the puzzle matrix is relatively small at the beginning, and it will become larger and larger in the later stage. The difficulty is first easy and then difficult, so that you have a process of getting started. <br>In the later continuous update plan,The game has prepared 100+ levels and a level editor.
