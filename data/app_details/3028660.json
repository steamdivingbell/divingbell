{"about_the_game":"<strong>RERODENT is a PSX styled story horror game with a dark forest setting about cultists and rats.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">RERODENT</h2>You play as Jimmy, an average struggling guy who lost contact with his family a couple of years ago who suddenly gets a call from his uncle Vic, who, out of nowhere, asks him if he could clean up his house for 100 bucks. This simple job that he gave you will put you in a state of constant fear and paranoia. As you arrive at the house, you notice that it's not a house... it's a mansion. Try not to get eaten by the horrors that lie within the mansion as you try to figure out what is actually going on beneath the surface. Why would he call you to clean up the house, why is the house wrecked and what are the rats?
