{"about_the_game":"Linklight is a relaxing minimalist puzzle game in which you satisfyingly rotate objects to form elegant branching connections to power lightbulbs. With Linklight, you can take a break from the world around you; immersing yourself in the ambience while you rack your brain.  Though it may be simple on the surface, Linklight can offer immense challenges to those who seek them; precision will be needed as you navigate your way through endless labyrinthine puzzles.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1066490/extras/Gameplay_Divider.png?t=1655491505\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1066490/extras/linklight_intro_power.gif?t=1655491505\" /><br><br>In Linklight you are greeted with a colorful tranquil space in disarray.
