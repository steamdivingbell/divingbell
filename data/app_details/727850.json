{"about_the_game":"<strong>ELDERBORN</strong> is a Metal Action Fantasy Slasher with br\u00fctal FPP melee combat and souls-like/RPG character progression. In the times of legend,  the barbarian tribes need a new dark messiah. The player becomes a merciless slayer who will uncover ancient secrets in the city of doom, and forge their own destiny. This ambitious indie game, five years in the making, combines old-school single-player feel, a classic heroic story, and modern level of skill-based challenge. All this and more creates an action-packed, lore-filled, engaging adventure that will last 8-10 hours in a single play-through.
