{"about_the_game":"Explore and salvage the remains of life on a long-ruined distant planet! With local sprout helpers in tow, make tracks and find tree-snacks as you witness a sprawling ecosystem of flora and fauna. Leave no obstacle standing, no creature unstudied, and no mystery unsolved! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Distant Planet is an in-development game that fuses aspects of RTS, exploration, and action-adventure games. Command an army of creatures called sprouts to explore, fight off, and study dangerous wildlife\u2013 all with the additional goal of reuniting your crew and repairing your stranded ship, currently stalled in orbit. Work with your sprouts to carry back enemies you\u2019ve defeated, and convert the once-hostile creatures into miniature units of your own to command, suited to the environment around them! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nProgress the story by dedicating each day to different tasks: spend the day bringing back metals and food to ensure your survivability and get a step closer to reuniting your crew, or spend the day growing your squadron of sprouts to take on tasks with extra oomph!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStrategically deploy your sprouts to explore the planet\u2019s various surface areas \u2013 open for you to freely traverse in any order! Collect Data cubes to unlock new locations, populated with many new creatures to encounter and, as a result, more sprout types to discover.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat secrets are to be found on the planet? What will you uncover? Will you save your crew? And will you make some new friends along the way?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3125350/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1721955190","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3125350/page.bg.jpg?t=1721955190","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3125350/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1721955190","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3125350/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1721955190","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Explore and salvage the remains of life on a long-ruined distant planet!
