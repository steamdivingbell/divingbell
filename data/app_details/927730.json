{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>WINDOWS 10/11 ONLY!</strong></h2><br>We see the wallpapers on our screen every day.

When you have the night and the wallpaper in the place where you live it will also be the night. You can also manually set the rate of the day and night changes.<br><br>The land is built of high-quality 16K textures on which you can see details like lakes or rivers and at night we will see the night lights of roads and cities.

This will cause the wallpaper will not drill down on the CPU and video card.

The wallpaper will be automatically fitted to your multi-screens. The menu is draggable so now you can place it where do you want. For the best experience, you can set earth position on one side to keep the earth at only one screen.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><u>How to Turn Off This Wallpaper?:</u></h2></h2>To turn off this project you can select &quot;Close the app&quot; button inside the menu. Also, you can run &quot;Game Mode&quot; and use &quot;X&quot; in the right top corner.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>How Do Interactive Wallpapers Work?</strong></h2>Interactive wallpaper works just like a normal game, but it is displayed under icons and windows of the Windows system. The wallpaper is active all the time so that you always have a unique view. Unlike standard &quot;flat&quot; wallpapers, this one will always be something else. A 3D environment posed for interaction, which allows you to influence its appearance.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Can I Play Games With This Wallpaper?</strong></h2>Of course! To reduce almost to 0 using the processor and graphics card at any time you can &quot;pause&quot; the wallpaper and return to it when you finish playing. Also recommended when working on larger projects or renderings. Unfortunately, at the present moment, it is not possible to automate this process.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Consumption Of Pc Resources</strong></h2></h2>As it is a 3D application it must take its own. We have this in mind and therefore maintaining low demand is our priority. 3D Earth Time Lapse PC also appears on mobile devices (Android) and works great on medium range phones. The wallpaper also has graphics settings so you can limit some effects. Just like in games, you can set options for your PC hardware.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Why Earth?</strong></h2></h2>The idea came up years ago when I watched recordings from the ISS International Space Station. The views are amazing but I missed one ... freedom of flight control. The graphics engine allows more, for example, interactive countries. And that's how the project was made ...;)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Do the Project Will Be Developed</strong></h2></h2>Of course, we still have ideas and sometimes users themselves share their ideas with us that we will try to add in the amendments. Unfortunately, we are very limited by the use of PC resources so we can not implement all ideas. For example, we could use texture 64k! (sic!) but the project would take almost 4GB when it's just a &quot;wallpaper&quot; ;d<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Support</strong></h2></h2>We are a tiny team that wants to create interactive applications that diversify well-known Windows wallpapers. We try to make each project unique, bringing something new to your screen. Every support is valuable to us.
