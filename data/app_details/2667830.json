{"about_the_game":"<strong>Hello, World... of Gen AI NPCs!</strong><br><br>Have you ever wanted to watch the daily lives of your favorite characters forever?<br>Welcome to Ememe Town!<br><br>Here, thanks to generative AI technology, NPCs (Non-Player Characters) engage in autonomous conversations, create schedules, establish relationships with other NPCs, and lead their everyday lives as they please. You can create new AI-NPCs in this town, set their personalities, and occasionally intervene in their actions, creating a reality drama akin to the Truman Show.<br><br>Through this Early Access version, we want to build this world together with all of you.<br>Ememe is a small team. To tackle the vast potential of AI-NPC simulation, we need brains (probably) with six digits or more. By thoroughly listening to player feedback and suggestions, we aim to make Ememe and the AI characters living there beloved by all of you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Generating NPC Life</h2>According to the personality of the NPC, AI automatically generates their daily schedule. Oversleeping, missing meals, running to school, having silly conversations with friends, coming back, staying up late on social media, and going to sleep... AI generates the daily life of your favorite character.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dialogue-to-Motion AI</h2>NPC conversations are generated in real-time by LLM. And animations too! With our proprietary technology, the AI predicts and outputs appropriate facial expressions and body animations from over 1,000 motion data types based on conversations and schedules. Without complicated development techniques, your character will lively laugh, dance, and automatically output 3D animations.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Conversation and Intervention</h2>You can freely converse with AI characters yourself! By taking on the &quot;inner voice&quot; of the NPC or role-playing as &quot;other NPCs,&quot; you can influence NPC behavior. Encourage skipping school or whisper negative comments about a boyfriend... Now, let's see what the NPCs will do! (Pranks on AI should be moderate)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">3D Model Upload</h2>Upload your favorite 3D character model*! Summon it to the town as an AI NPC. NPCs can have freely set personalities. Let's recreate the appearance and personality of your favorite character!<br>*Supported file format for motion generation: VRM (compatible with AI-generated facial animation and body animation)","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2667830/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729477752","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2667830/page.bg.jpg?t=1729477752","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2667830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729477752","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2667830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729477752","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Hello, World... of Gen AI NPCs!</strong><br><br>Have you ever wanted to watch the daily lives of your favorite characters forever?<br>Welcome to Ememe Town!<br><br>Here, thanks to generative AI technology, NPCs (Non-Player Characters) engage in autonomous conversations, create schedules, establish relationships with other NPCs, and lead their everyday lives as they please.
