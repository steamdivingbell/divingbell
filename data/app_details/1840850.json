Starting simply, you'll soon learn how to use each of the <strong>16 different bonus powers</strong> to manipulate the interactions between the <strong>30 different types</strong> of block. Things slowly get very complicated, especially given that <strong>every level wraps</strong> the top and bottom, left and right of the screen.
