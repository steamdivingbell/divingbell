{"about_the_game":"Perform backflips, break opponent parts, fire guns with explosive ammo, and exploit physics to win the round. It's a skill-based game that rewards spatial coordination and lightning-fast reflexes. There are no list of combos to learn, no special hidden combination of buttons to make the show. You can get ready to challenge an experimented player from the first round. Easy to learn, hard to master.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>THE PUNCHES</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2137350/extras/punch_break_2.gif?t=1729707034\" /><br>Move toward your opponent and throw deadly punches using the right joystick combined with bumpers. The bumpers are for which arm you want to use: left, right, or both. The arms will simply follow the direction of your joystick, giving you an infinite range of actions. All melee damages are based on velocity, including kicks and headbutts. Your arms have guard position by default, and they block health damage.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>THE STAMINA</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2137350/extras/jump_in.gif?t=1729707034\" /><br>The robot you control is an active ragdoll. It stands and moves by forces. The stamina controls how much force your robot has. Full stamina means maximum force to move and attack. When you take damage, you lose stamina, reducing your force. If your stamina approaches zero, your robot just crumples flat on the ground. Stamina will recover automatically unless your health also drops to zero, definitively ending the fight for you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>THE WEAPONS</strong> </h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2137350/extras/lasersword_throw.gif?t=1729707034\" /><br>Weapons can spawn in arenas. Grab them by simply pressing on the second range of bumpers. These bumpers are also for which arm you want to use: left, right, or both. The weapons will then come at you with an invisible force. Once you are equipped, simply use the punches rules to attack with the weapon: swing your arm with the right joystick while pressing the left or right bumper. If you are equipped with a gun in the right hand, then just press the right bumper to fire and use the joystick to aim.<br><br><strong>All Available weapons:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Laser Gun (pew pew pew)<br></li><li>Blast Gun (load then big pew)<br></li><li>Laser Cutter<br></li><li>Laser Sword (god weapon)<br></li><li>Sword<br></li><li>Flail One Head (a big brutal ball attached to a chain)<br></li><li>Flail Two Heads<br></li><li>Flail Three Heads<br></li><li>Lash (a spectacular whip where each link deals damage)<br></li><li>Shield (can bounce gun fires)<br></li><li>Nunchaku</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>THE ARENAS</strong> </h2><strong>Battles unfold in four arenas, each featuring a ring-out zone where players can't linger:</strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2137350/extras/arenas.gif?t=1729707034\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Hot World: players will melt in lava.<br></li><li>Old World: players will be compacted in a giant press.
