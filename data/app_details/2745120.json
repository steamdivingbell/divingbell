{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Reclaim Humanity at Any Cost</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In <i>Scythe Machine</i>, you are a Reaper once human, now bound to an eternal punishment: harvesting souls for the unseen forces that uphold existence. Longing for respite, you consume soul for yourself and edge the universe toward collapse. This is no quest for redemption\u2014only a grasp for the humanity that you have long since forgotten.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A Semi-Cooperative Struggle</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Work together to survive the fiends that haunt this dying world, yet beware\u2014the bonds you form with other Reapers will fray. Betray too soon, and all may be lost to the monstrous tide. But wait too long, and your so-called allies may strike first. Cooperation and treachery are woven into every moment, and only the cunning will endure.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>PvPvE Chaos Unleashed</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Battle vicious fiends and outwit your fellow Reapers in fast-paced, action-packed combat. Collect powerful upgrades to amplify your strength, adapt to shifting alliances, and master the art of striking when the moment is right. Your choices ripple through every encounter, shaping the balance between survival and annihilation.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Will You Consume the World?</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The soul-hunger drives you forward, an endless craving that defies reason and balance alike. Every soul you devour pulls the universe closer to collapse, feeding your desperation at the expense of existence itself. In <i>Scythe Machine</i>, your defiance is not righteous\u2014it is greed, pure and unrelenting. The cosmos will crumble, and it will be by your hand.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2745120/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732685148","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2745120/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1732685148","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2745120/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732685148","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2745120/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732685148","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Reclaim Humanity at Any Cost</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In <i>Scythe Machine</i>, you are a Reaper once human, now bound to an eternal punishment: harvesting souls for the unseen forces that uphold existence.
