{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Wartorn</strong> is a single-player, squad-based, roguelite campaign experience where players play as Yara and Elani, sisters who have been driven from their home and must traverse the wartorn Isles of Talaur to reach the safety of Beynun, their ancestral fortress. Harness the elements in fierce real-time battles while upgrading a crew of fantasy creatures as you search for your family.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Systemic Elemental System</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Wartorn features a systemic, emergent gameplay system using the elements of fire, water, tar, plant, and lightning. Strategically choose your squads to master the elements and environment against hordes of enemies. Water extinguishes fire, tar amplifies fire, electricity crackles across the ranks in wet conditions, and water can heal plant-based units.
