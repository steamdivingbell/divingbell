Their mission is to find and defuse a bomb, a task that unfolds in the midst of a dark world where they must also uncover their identities and pasts. The train journey they embark on to find the bomb is far from an ordinary trip; every moment holds new dangers and mysteries. The eerie events they encounter on the train and at the stations greatly intensify the mission's challenges. Along the way, their meeting with the conductor becomes inevitable.
