Should they gather resources, construct buildings or perhaps train to become soldiers?<br></li><li><strong>Unit Alchemy</strong> - Peasants may become soldiers. Soldiers may then become specialists in various disciplines or study and acquire new combat abilities.<br></li><li><strong>Immersive Combat</strong> - All units have unique animations for all occasions, the fights are fluid and enjoyable to observe.<br></li><li><strong>Retreat</strong> - Attempting to save as many of your units as possible is an important strategy. After a minute of rest, your units will be almost as good as new, ready to attack again. <br></li><li><strong>Running and Walking</strong> - Running offers players a number of choices: should they slowly sneak through the forest and save their stamina for special attacks, or should they run in and try to catch enemies off guard?<br></li><li><strong>Strategic Surroundings</strong> - Fire consumes buildings if not extinguished, birds will give away enemy positions if startled, wild animals attack lone wanderers and boulders can be pushed to deal devastating damage.<br></li><li><strong>Battle Gears</strong> - Unit abilities that were designed to give units versatility they wouldn't otherwise have. Each clan acquires its Battle Gears by different means.<br></li><li><strong>Yin and Yang</strong> - By awarding Yin and Yang points based on performance in battle, the game incentivizes players to actually get out there and fight.<br></li><li><strong>Zen Masters</strong> - Each clan has its share of heroic figures known as Zen Masters, their powers vary as widely as the heroes they stem from. Strongly connected to their particular alignment, Zen Masters benefit from the presence of Yin or Yang.<br></li><li><strong>Forest</strong> - Forests are not obstacles, but rather terrain to be used. Troops can enter the forest and will be largely invisible to their opponents. Care must be taken when moving through the woods - move too quickly, and birds scatter from the trees, alerting enemy players to movement. <br></li><li><strong>Line of Sight</strong> - Gaining control of the high ground and forests is an important strategy, as shroud wouldn't allow players to effectively strategize. <br></li><li><strong>Weather</strong> - Rain slows the advance of all units, extinguishes building fires and helps rice regrow faster. Snow slows the rice growth and unit movement down.</li></ul></p><br><h1>Steam Greenlight</h1><p>This game has been Greenlit by the Community back in 2014.
