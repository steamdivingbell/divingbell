You appear to be alone, your fear and isolation paralyzing you, until you hear the mocking voice of your own death shaming you into making your escape. Together, you and your death must work together to take advantage of each others' unique abilities by swapping who is in control of your form and overcoming the prison's ethereal labyrinthine obstacles.
