{"about_the_game":"Note: Project Screwed is designed to be played with Xbox controllers! Attempting to play it on keyboard or other gamepads will work but is not supported. <br><br>In this stressful 4-player couch coop game you take on the dangerous task of mining for the most rare material in the galaxy; Rareium. To accomplish this task, you will have to work together with your friends to try to survive the waves of enemies wanting to destroy your base as you try to manage both time and resources in order to meet all the requirements of the base.<br><br>The game takes place in a not so distant galaxy where you play as an elite taskforce sent by the government of Badville on a mission to secure as much Rareium as possible in order to have enough materials to penetrate Goodvilles planet-spanning shield during next years &quot;throw rocks at Goodville&quot; festival.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Defend Your Base </h2>Defend your base against waves of angry enemies that seek to destroy your base and disrupt your Rareium acquiring efforts. Use the Cannons to shoot apart any of the multitude of different threats on the hostile alien planets you visit throughout your playthrough. You can also utilize the cannons shield to deflect against enemy attacks, if you manage to aim it in time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Work Together... Or Don't </h2>Work together with up to 3 other friends or foes locally to defend and manage all of your bases needs. Man the cannons, refill the ammo storage, fix broken machines, repair the dome, operate the miner and more. Although you all technically are on the same team, that doesn't mean that there isn't any room for screwing over your friends as the chaos ensues.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Upgrade Your Base... Through Gambling?  </h2> As the rounds continue you and your friends will be able to upgrade the different components of your base such that it can withstand the multitude of stronger and stronger waves that will be thrown at you as time progresses. The only downside is that you will have to sacrifice some of your hard earned progress by buying &quot;upgrade boxes&quot;. Each box contains three different upgrades that you and your friends will have to decide which one to pick in order to better your odds of surviving and earning more Rareium so you can gamble even more (I swear this is a totally necessary gameplay mechanic and not just an excuse for us to add gambling into our game).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Progress Through a Vibrant And Distinct Galaxy </h2>Journey though a beautifully realized galaxy with unique and original planetary designs as you tear the planets apart and ruin complex and fragile ecosystems in your search for more Rareium to throw at your neighbours. Each of the 30+ planet portrayed with stunning 2D pixel art.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unique Level Mechanics </h2>Throughout the games 30+ levels you will have to play around different level mechanics like portals that teleports you across the level, doors that can only be opened one at a time, jumping pads that launch you high into the sky, tubes that transport you around and much more.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About Lonely Oni Interactive</h2> Lonely Oni Interactive is a small indie studio from Norway with 5 young developers with little to no funding and an aspirations of one day working in the games industry.
