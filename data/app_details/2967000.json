{"about_the_game":"Loki, the god of trickery, is up to his grandest scheme yet and to see it to fruition, Baldr, the god of wisdom and light, must be out of the way. Slain by Loki, Baldr is cast to the underworld. Loki uses this opportunity to his advantage to introduce intoxicating technology to the Aesir and dwarves, which the dwarves embed into the world causing an imbalance. Reborn by Hel, Baldr must restore balance to the world and regain godhood. Over Light Reforged, the player travels between four of the realms of Norse mythology. These include Helheim, the home of the dead; Asgard, the home of the Aesir; Vanaheim, the home of the Vanir; and Svartalfheim, the home of the Dwarves. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Realms:<br />\r\nVanaheim - realm of the Vanir and nature \u2013 is the last stand between Ivaldi and his goal of technological takeover. As such, it\u2019s the most naturalistic and least steampunk in visual design. <br />\r\nAsgard - Asgard  is more technologically advanced than Vanaheim. The Asgard arena is a sacred battleground, but small glimpses of technology can be seen around the outer rim of the arena.<br />\r\nSvartalfheim is home of the Dwarves and ruled by the Sons of Ivaldi. The city is the most corrupted realm, void of any lush nature. The water and sky are stained red from use of the magic cores. Roads, sidewalks, and large buildings are dirtied by the smog that persists through the city. Located in the city are three cores that power the city.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThroughout the game, the player has multiple combat mechanics at their disposal for fighting different enemies throughout the levels: a dash, a melee attack, projectile weapons, the Prismatic Light Meter, and special actions. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nUse The Elements To Fight:<br />\r\n As you fight you increase your Prismatic Light Meter. Prismatic Light allows you to use the elements to the advantage. There are three elements that can be chosen from. Fire, Ice, and Wind. Each of these elements has three tiers. Each elements offer a variety of offensive and defensive capabilities. You can get burn damage on your enemy over time, freeze them in place, or blow away large groups of enemies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHack N Slash Your Way Through:<br />\r\nLight Reforged focuses on hacking and slashing your enemies. Use fluid combat to strategically dodge enemies and gain the advantage on your foes. Challenge bosses and a variety of enemies throughout the realm that require you to think before you jump. If you feel overwhelmed, use your cannon to clear waves of enemies. Use your dash to mow through hordes and slash enemies as they try to surround you.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2967000/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1718318018","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2967000/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1718318018","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2967000/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718318018","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2967000/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718318018","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Loki, the god of trickery, is up to his grandest scheme yet and to see it to fruition, Baldr, the god of wisdom and light, must be out of the way.
