(Really Artistically Talented) Room can be summarized by our group motto: \u201cNo think. Wing it.\u201d As a collective, we work in collaboration to create animations, digital art, and video game projects. Our most recent game, titled Malyshka, displays the combined effort of about fifteen individuals who created all of the assets, story, dialogue, music, and programming. We are students, but we create as professionals. We have been able to foster a community full of diversity, inclusion, and creativity through our shared work and learning. Also, our grind doesn\u2019t end when we leave the studio, everyone who is involved is constantly working hard to see our visions through to the end. At our core, the R.A.T. Room operates as a single unit. No one person is responsible for the work, we are a community co-op that is passionate about art and creativity.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"ENDING","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1684440/f462d1de9b1307200f2763be0204a13ce4b84ce7.jpg"},{"name":"ABANDON","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1684440/7538e9141911740de79335869a802fe9e76082ae.jpg"},{"name":"CLEANED","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1684440/e227a5e00086de8afd5c09ef9529db53031ad695.jpg"},{"name":"TINKER","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1684440/f08a89947123fa1a93f49ac6e916c3420eeab32f.jpg"},{"name":"SAFE","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1684440/2a7a5981b230467692980f9d5a37875d2f356375.jpg"}],"total":5},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1684440/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1704245918","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1684440/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1704245918","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1684440/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1704245918","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1684440/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1704245918","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Captions available","id":13}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Explore the village to your heart's content and meet its inhabitants: from kindly priests to eccentric toy collectors, the community is full of endearing characters to help you on your journey.
