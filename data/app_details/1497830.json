Thank you for checking out my game Apsis. Recently I've have been learning to make games, and Apsis will be my first release on Steam!<strong> Apsis is an arcade score-chaser, where the only goals are to constantly beat your previous score and unlocking new ships</strong>. It's a pretty fun way to waste an evening if i do say so myself, but I'd love to hear what you think about it (yes, YOU in-particular)! Please contact me on my Website or via Twitter if you find any bugs, anything you find misleading/incorrect about this store page, or just wanted to say hi!<br><br>Thanks for taking the time to read this, I hope you enjoy Apsis!<br><i>Will B.
