Most of the interactive violence takes the form of Mad Max-style vehicular combat, also depicted in pixel graphics.\r\n\r\nThe game explores themes of community and oppression, including the oppression of sexual minorities. It contains references to sex, drugs, and alcohol, primarily conveyed through text. While the game features suggestive visuals, it does not include explicit depictions of sexual acts.\r\n\r\nThe game's language includes occasional swearing and crude expressions. It also explores themes of criminality, allowing the player to engage in actions considered crimes within the game's world. However, the game places a strong emphasis on the ethical implications of the player's choices."},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Trucker 2056</strong>, a narrative trading RPG featuring a point-and-click driven plot and card-based combat.
