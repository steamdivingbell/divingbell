{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">You wake up with no memory. Your day is starting off great!</h2>Nepenthe is a hand-drawn RPG with a terrible sense of humor.

Meet some very polite monsters, and battle both them and your sense of self-dignity in epic bullet-hell fight scenes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Definitely not a potato in a trench coat</h2>Sporting a childish hand-drawn art style, Nepenthe is sure to either make you love it at first glance, or throw your computer away.

This can get quite annoying if you need to share a computer with someone else. Trust me. Almost every monster can be spared, for added challenge and less violence.
