{"about_the_game":"Chromis the day Isla fell. It was a wonderfully warm day on Isla, the people were enjoying the nice weather after the stormy season. No one expected what would happen next. The sky flashed red and the ground trembled, next a stampede of wild animals came running from the forest. However, they did not look normal. They started attacking the people, ramming them and biting them. The confused king watched as people ran to their homes, this was completely unlike the animals on Isla. They have all been friendly, after having a wild boar run past the Royal Gate the King saw that the eyes of the boar were not normal. At the same time, the people who were bitten began to change...into something indescribable. They armed themselves when they touched the weapon the weapon even changed. They started to attack people, some would use their weapons others would look to turn more people into the infected. Seeing this the king commanded the Royal Gates to be open and began to fill the area with the people of Isla. The people of Isla were forced to arm themselves and defend their island. The fight lasted days before there was a break and the infected retreated. The people took this time to rest, prepare and wait. They knew this was not over. The king demanded that only the most skilled will join the command to fight the infected. He created the arena where people will be tested. Those in the top 100 will join the Royal Command. This would keep a continuing cycle of young, determined, and skilled fighters The end is near, for who is yet to be determined.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features:</h2><br><strong>The Dungeon:</strong> Select a proxy to control, and make your way through the arenas clearing it of all the horrid creatures.
