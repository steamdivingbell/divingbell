A simple disappearance threatens to become a massacre as a hidden menace long slumbering prepares to burst forth in the midst of this rustic revel. Will your heroes be able to thwart this menace, or will they become a part of the Feasting at Lanterngeist?</i><br><br>Designed by Greg A. Vaughan with the Legendary Games Design Team of Neil Spicer, Clinton Boomer, Jason Nelson, and Clark Peterson.
