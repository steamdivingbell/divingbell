{"about_the_game":"Shoot and blast your way through mysterious mazes in Maze Blaze, a roguelike action shooter that\u2019s intense both in color and gameplay. The goal is simple - enter the maze and gun down anything that stands between you and the exit. Your objective may always be the same but everything else is endlessly changing.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2114360/extras/MazeBlaze_Gif_2.gif?t=1701864322\" /><br><br>Each maze is a procedurally generated level where the enemies, items, and the maze\u2019s layout itself is random. Not a single corner you turn will be the same as the last time you entered. Progressively tougher robots will try to take you out once you enter their proximity so you better be ready to shoot first and ask questions later. Modifiers scattered around each maze will augment your abilities and shots. Each pick-up presents a unique choice that\u2019ll define your play style.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2114360/extras/MazeBlaze_Gif_1.gif?t=1701864322\" /><br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><br><strong>An Endless Maze of Possibilities</strong> - The gameplay is simple but the depth can be as complex as you want.
