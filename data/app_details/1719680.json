{"about_the_game":"Songs Of Armageddopolis is a point'n'click detective game. In a world where magic and technology go hand in hand, and people disappear without a trace every day, you will play the role of a young psionic named Glaz, who is doing an internship at a detective bureau. The bosses don't like you. You think that the reason for this antipathy is the form of your head: it is too round. But that is not the point. The point is: you stink of death and defeat. Why are you even here? Well, there were some reasons, probably, but now they are of no significance. This city has secrets and you must reveal them. To become the best detective. To plunge your enemies into dust.
