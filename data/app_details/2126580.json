When it detects a change in frequency that is very different from the current rolling average, targets are spawned. The frequency channels (e.g. 0-87 Hz for a bass channel) and the sensitivity for each channel can be fine-tuned in the settings menu.<br><br>When you provide the game with a song file, it analyzes a separate audio track from the one you actually hear. This offset allows the game to account for reaction time. Here's a short breakdown, using 0.25 seconds for reaction time:<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2126580/extras/BeatShotTiming.png?t=1709232787\" /><br><br>The idea is to destroy the target at the <i>bright green</i> color.
