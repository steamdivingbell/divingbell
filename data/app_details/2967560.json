{"about_the_game":"Barako and his crew are a group of benevolent pirates who fight fist to fist against a variety of enemies, going on adventures and giving their treasure to the poor. But one day, they find a 10 year old boy hidden among their latest plunder...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAre you ready to go on a high seas adventure? Join Barako and his crew as they fight against rival pirate crews, monsters, hunt for buried treasure and sail the seas in an exciting pirate themed adventure!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPassive skill system<br />\r\nEach crew member has their own set of unique skills which only they can use outside of combat.  For example, Barako can lift heavy objects, Vincenzo can jump a long distance and play musical instruments, Cedric can heal NPCs and can detect useable herbs, just to name a few!  Just choose which character you want to use by placing them at the head of the party!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCombat isn't just mashing attack!  <br />\r\nThe player is encouraged to use a variety of skills due to cooldowns and each attack having unique properties and status effects attached to them!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTools aplenty! <br />\r\nDig for buried treasure with a shovel, bust open locked doors with a crowbar, light dungeons and set fires with a lantern, and fish for aquatic life with a fishing rod. Items won't be automatically used either, you have to use your brain and use them manually!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTrauma Points<br />\r\nAlso features the trauma point system.  The more TP a character accumulates by getting hit, the more damage they will take. Can only make TP go down by resting at an inn or at certain save points.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGameplay Trailer Credits<br />\r\nBattle Music - Let's Go Do Pirate Stuff (Instrumental) by Voltz Supreme<br />\r\nVictory Music - Monkey Island Band (Looping) by Eric Matyas","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2967560?t=1722521068","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2967560?t=1722521068","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2967560/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1722521068","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2967560/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1722521068","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"This game contains sexual references, drug use, coarse language and mild violence."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Barako and his crew are a group of benevolent pirates who fight fist to fist against a variety of enemies, going on adventures and giving their treasure to the poor.
