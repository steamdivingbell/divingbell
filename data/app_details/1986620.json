You get points by destroying other shapes, where the shape corresponds to what they do (the triangles shoot lasers). The more points you have, the more difficult the game becomes and when you die, you try again from the beginning. You destroy shapes by grappling them and flinging them at walls or other hard objects.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Something about a student and a master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1986620/1aed0560076c8c0dc179c07362db7ef580b05142.jpg"},{"name":"Deadly momentum","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1986620/a071919e6d641fe6b15ec13d709784908d6599c0.jpg"},{"name":"Just bob and weave","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1986620/43e55c6afb60108caef5ab05ca06c3949cccd9f9.jpg"},{"name":"It was crate to meet you!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1986620/a57e9fd10b4540f65aaf2f86108b39bf6f6a6464.jpg"},{"name":"Almost there","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1986620/0123b4d193699e91ca35db5d4d3c9e0566297d8e.jpg"},{"name":"Untouchable","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1986620/fc5740f86393a43a3746a1b9595c5791edfda815.jpg"},{"name":"Combo","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1986620/b225f988742a0b2a65e908c79de7642293a27e68.jpg"}],"total":7},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1986620?t=1654091600","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1986620/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1654091600","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1986620/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1654091600","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1986620/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1654091600","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Beat My Highscore, I Dare You.</strong><br><br>But like, this shit ramps up <i>quick</i>.
