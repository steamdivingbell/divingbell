Play as Trixx, a treasure hunting rogue equipped with a transforming bow, and fight through a procedurally generated world of floating islands filled with dangerous creatures and powerful titans.<br><br>Utilise your transforming bow that can swap between long and shortbow on the fly to give you different strategies to battle. Shoot, dodge and blast your way through enemy encampments with the shortbow or play from a distance and utilise armour piercing charge shots from your longbow.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Battle Ferocious Titans</strong></h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1886080/extras/FerociousTitans_A.gif?t=1708531337\" /><br><br>Set in a beautiful world of floating islands inspired by an East-Asia fantasy style, The Fractured Sky is a dangerous place where people can succumb to their fears. Four Titans guard different realms throughout the world each with their own unique identity. Different realms will offer unique enemies, bosses and a host of unique artefacts.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Exciting Artefacts with Powerful Effects</strong></h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1886080/extras/PowerupsGif_A.gif?t=1708531337\" /><br><br>With multiple unique regions, a huge variety of artefacts, exciting modifiers and untold secrets - Tetraphobia is brimming with rouge-like details that will keep every run feeling fresh and unique.
