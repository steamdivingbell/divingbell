{"about_the_game":"<strong>Bombabomb!</strong>, a game inspired by old pre-installed minigames, which came with some operating systems.<br>If you miss games like these old classics, here is one for you to enjoy, even if it isn't preinstalled with your OS! ;)<br><br><strong>How it's working:</strong><br>Well, basically you just have to explode matching colored bombs with a click. There is really not more to it.<br>But the real difficulty isn't to play... The main goal is to get rid of ALL bombs!<br><br><strong>Win the challenge:</strong><br>Although you can force end the game at every point, the intended goal is to have zero bombs left on the playfield.<br>So even having just three bombs left is pretty good, having only one bomb left is mind boggling... So try to get the best outcome possible and let every bomb explode!<br><br><strong>Current Development State / Story behind the game:</strong><br>I made this game from scratch with zero PC-Game-Development experience and I guess we all can see this, but I made this game just as a hobby and in the first place as a gift for my father, who played a game just like this on our first PC around 2005. I had to exchange all textures and sounds / music with self-made or CC licensed ones, because in my first build, which I obviously won't ever publish, I used the sounds and textures of a well known Survival-Sandbox game made in 2009 where everything is blocky... ^^<br>So if I find bugs and / or have some new ideas for content, I will update the game!<br><br><strong>Upcoming Content &amp; Updates:</strong><br>I already have some Ideas, what I could add to the game, like different difficulties, new Textures which maybe could include the Steam-Workshop for everybody to make their own textures, and maybe also a few other game-modes and for the SteamDeck controller support. Any controller-support at all would be nice for a start tbh, but this are all future plans which will take much time, so don't expect fast development! :D<br>I also want to have Steam-Achievements, but before I learn how to implement them, I maybe should know what achievements I want to add to begin with...<br><br><strong>One thing left to say:</strong><br>If you buy this game: Thank you for supporting a hobby of mine and I hope that you will have fun playing my game, whenever you have one or two minutes to spare! Special Thanks to Dave, D1cki, EzBeard, Draveax, Crank, Magonius and obviously my dad!
