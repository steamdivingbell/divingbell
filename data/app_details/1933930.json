{"about_the_game":"Take the position of a representative of an ancient civilization. Become a farmer, who is only making his baby steps but is hungry for greatness.  The mission is remarkably ambitious: feed hordes of people, weasel your way into the ruler's good graces, and change the bags of flour into gold-filled ones.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn front of you are vast acres of space, left for you to manage: wild, thickly wooded lands that need copious amounts of work and time before a single edible plant appears. You begin with grubbing up. At your disposal are a hatchet and a machete, as well as cattle, which can help you with knocking down the biggest of trees. The obtained resources will be used to construct farm buildings. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour fate, success or failure, lies largely in your livestock. Take care of your animals, feed them, and water them, and they will repay you with hard work at every step of your journey.  Make no mistake, Ancient Farm there is plenty to do.  Besides already mentioned grubbing up and cultivating the land for farming, you will have to plow fields, sow seeds, collect the harvest, process grain into flour, dig ditches that lead water to fields, and relentlessly take care of farming infrastructure. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd it\u2019s still a little taste of what the game has to offer. Build your reputation step by step, work hard and the harvest will be fruitful. Take ancient farming into the future with Ancient Farm.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1933930/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1712756089","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1933930/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1712756089","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1933930/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1712756089","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1933930/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1712756089","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Take the position of a representative of an ancient civilization.
