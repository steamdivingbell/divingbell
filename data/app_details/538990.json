Or you can cheat if you got enough money, you can always buy the nail directly from a ship.<br><br></li><li> Products expiration: Just like in real life, in this game every product expires. Some food items expire sooner than others. <br><br></li><li> Thirst: People need to drink water to survive. One of the challenges of the game is to keep their thirst quenched. (In real life we can only survive 3 days without water)<br><br></li><li> Measurements: Be ready to gather 300KG of wood, and some nails to build a shack. Can you guess how much is needed for a brick house?<br><br></li><li> Horse Carriages: As the game has real measurements people can carry only so much. That's when horse-drawn carriages come into place. They carry a lot more, as a result, your economy gets boosted. A person in their best years might carry around 15KG, wheelbarrows closer to 60KG, but the smaller cart can carry 240KG.<br><br></li><li> Usage of goods: Crates, barrels, wheelbarrows, carts, tools, cloth, crockery, furniture and utensils are all needed to do the traditional activities of a town. As these goods get used, they diminish, as a result, a person won't carry anything if there are no crates. Keep an eye on that ;)<br><br></li><li> Happiness: People's happiness is influenced by various factors. Food variety, religion satisfaction, access to leisure, house comfort and education level. Also if a person has utensils, crockery and cloth will influence their happiness.<br><br></li><li> Port reputation: You can perform traditional trade activities such as importing and exporting any product. This indicator identifies how often ships come to your port.<br><br></li><li> Pirate threat: Pirates are around. This indicator identifies the risks of suffering a pirate attack. If it happens is game over. You can decrease this by constructing military buildings.<br><br></li><li> Buildings: Over 50 different buildings to construct.<br><br></li><li> Products: Over 80 different products.</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/538990/extras/620x125_big_storage.png?t=1678824439\" /><br><br><strong>Coming Soon:</strong><br>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Ambassador","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/538990/244c7cf02c4dddfe079c00c4345ae963149af3f8.jpg"},{"name":"Official","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/538990/a18dbdf3fdbeae65bd4d2a1da35950f7bc2db324.jpg"},{"name":"Prefect","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/538990/dd0605d4201bfa82ca4da68323e992bfba48471e.jpg"},{"name":"Governor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/538990/80c22a95cefc899decf17c7b00e014f8e56f5284.jpg"},{"name":"Prime Minister","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/538990/e046422879dd90539865b41d099caa2b3c6a3532.jpg"},{"name":"Stevedore","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/538990/274db7f9dca8adc92dc94197a4bb1d0c0b500763.jpg"},{"name":"Docker","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/538990/e07ddc7d10e42446a1895d6a6b9bd9271f728273.jpg"},{"name":"Port Official","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/538990/bddc2893870c17686a28de3753013666251391c0.jpg"},{"name":"Port Chief","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/538990/93f0ea742396e6cb05f7e0e86f1f71dbc06e9482.jpg"},{"name":"Builder","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/538990/be735704e73107cc731f70b3d98cb9160b042686.jpg"}],"total":43},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/538990/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1678824439","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/538990/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1678824439","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/538990/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1678824439","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/538990/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1678824439","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Add SugarWinds to your Wishlist</strong><br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/538990/extras/WishList_and_Follow.gif?t=1678824439\" /><br><br><strong>SugarMill</strong> is a sandbox village building game.
