Each turret and yourself have the option of 3 main cores, Hellraiser, Saboteur, and Overdriver. Each are focused on a differing game plan. Hellraiser is all about dealing more damage and using brute force to destroy the trees. The Saboteur core slows, stuns and in other ways hinders the trees to give the turret battalion a better chance to take them out. Overdriver is geared towards helping your other turrets deal more damage and stay at the top of their game.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2671460/extras/BogHagShowcase.gif?t=1722466468\" /><br>The enemy trees aren't pushovers though!
