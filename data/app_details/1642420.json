In this 2D sidescrolling strategy/resource management game, excavate and traverse your underground mine shafts to retrieve gold! Go into the mines and extract as much gold as you can. Setup your operation and reinvest your earnings into better gear and equipment to mine more gold and win the game! This line of work not only separates the gold from the dirt, but the pups from the dogs. With danger lurking in these ancient grounds, hungry Dinos awaken, searching for prey and loot. The wise miner doesn\u2019t fear the Dino but sees it\u2019s flesh and bones as a potential fuel source for their operations. Gold mining is a treasure hunt, so open your miner\u2019s map, test some dirt, and find that stash of gold!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1642420/extras/Steam_About_Become_a_Golden.gif?t=1666996290\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>YOUR TASK</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Pan Dirt </li><li>Mine Gold</li><li>Smelt Coins</li><li>Make Rent</li></ul><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1642420/extras/Animated_Transport.png?t=1666996290\" /><br>Dogs like to move it.
