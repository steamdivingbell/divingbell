{"about_the_game":"The year is 1981. Seven years since some strange disease ripped through the city of Sennenmoor, a quarantine cutting it off from the world.

One day he was just gone.<br>Three weeks since the letter. Written in shaking hand, though undeniably his. Still the smell of him hanging a little on the paper, still the letters slanting more as they went on, rushed and desperate. <br>Two weeks since you took a job as a research scientist in a dead and broken city, for you knew where the letter came from, though you didn't know how, nor how he'd gotten back. The city of his birth, the city he often said he wanted to go back to, one day, to stay, to live out your lives there.<br>Two hour since you took a military train southbound from Glasgow towards Sennenmoor. A letter in your breast pocket. On it, written in scrawled hand, the words;<br><i>We're going home, Elias.</i><br><br><i>Now You Would Destroy The Earth</i> is a top-down psychological horror narrative adventure about a man seeking answers from a lover he thought long gone, across the backdrop of a city torn apart by a strange disease. With multiple endings, paths and secrets to find, converse and navigate your way through the broken streets of Sennenmoor to find the truth about the man you once loved, and the nature of the disease itself.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2199890/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731675691","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2199890/page.bg.jpg?t=1731675691","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2199890/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731675691","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2199890/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731675691","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"This game contains sudden and intense depictions of violence, and the frequent depiction of the deformation of the human body.
