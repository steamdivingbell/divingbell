Be wary you don't take on too much or death could find you before you're able to pay it off. Blast your way through waves of enemies to collect items to outfit your ship and Space Bucks for upgrades. Choose systems to warp to based on their difficulty and interest rates to maximize how you're able to enhance your ship and pay off your debt.
