{"about_the_game":"This is a digital version of an epic board Game, Tank Chess.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTank Chess is a strategic game played on 16x16 or 20x20 square board which as a main objective has the destruction of the opponent\u2019s Command Tank or a sneaky escape of your own Command Tank. The way to achieve this is by meticulously planning and executing the maneuvers of the rest of your forces composed of Light, Medium and Heavy Tanks, Tank Destroyers and Heavy Mortars.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game incorporates some masterful strategic planning and decision making similar to the game of chess, but the nature of the long range engagements along with the firepower and the armour protection are the factors that have to be acknowledged in order to create a winning strategy and to achieve the ultimate goal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the most important game features is the existence of the obstacles on the board that prevent shooting across the board and provide opportunities for some clever tactical maneuvers. Also, the destroyed vehicles remain on the board at all times, which makes you consider every move very carefully, in order to avoid creating new cover that your enemy can exploit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe number of different, fully engaging game mechanics ensures the replayability of this game: you will constantly be presented with a new challenge that will keep you on the edge of your seat!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Eliminate Light Tanks - Tactician","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2936350/542d56f7deda2daaf953b5dad019c7c8e7e3c633.jpg"},{"name":"Eliminate Light Tanks - Strategist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2936350/eb523814ff655dc70bf00bde87ca03720439f9b6.jpg"},{"name":"Eliminate Light Tanks - Mastermind","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2936350/978ec544ea858432271ba14aa809b0fedf27b98e.jpg"},{"name":"Eliminate Medium Tanks - Tactician","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2936350/72530a7c6d4cba38deee44284453f87a1bfd4e1b.jpg"},{"name":"Eliminate Medium Tanks - Strategist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2936350/7153b430fb060412458befa8441db615b3c41c62.jpg"},{"name":"Eliminate Medium Tanks - Mastermind","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2936350/2ed1424b35afa1908dd76aa4df9a453bf800887d.jpg"},{"name":"Eliminate Heavy Tanks - Tactician","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2936350/763bae36cbb763fd4ee75c356b2bf243e1ea79cd.jpg"},{"name":"Eliminate Heavy Tanks - Strategist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2936350/8564cdd5009ff6be20efb8c00f65827c670a3b95.jpg"},{"name":"Eliminate Heavy Tanks - Mastermind","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2936350/59144b2d8385db9fa3637a56eb637cf113456dea.jpg"},{"name":"Eliminate Heavy Mortars - Tactician","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2936350/4265b22cc8b9355746087fad2780ba2e1301e993.jpg"}],"total":30},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2936350?t=1729758250","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2936350/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1729758250","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2936350/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729758250","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2936350/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729758250","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2955730,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"This is a digital version of an epic board Game, Tank Chess.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTank Chess is a strategic game played on 16x16 or 20x20 square board which as a main objective has the destruction of the opponent\u2019s Command Tank or a sneaky escape of your own Command Tank.
