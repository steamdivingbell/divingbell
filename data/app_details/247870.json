{"about_the_game":"Redshirt is the comedy sci-fi sim about social networking aboard a space station, starring the station's most ambitious low-ranking peon: you! Navigate the professional and interpersonal politics of the ubiquitous &quot;Spacebook&quot; to curry favor among friends and colleagues. As intense intergalactic conflict rages around you, it's up to you to accrue those all-important &quot;likes&quot; on your status updates! Whether you're looking for love, opportunities for promotion, or even a chance to play Zero-G golf with the captain, you can schmooze your way through social circles and claw your way up the career ladder. Perhaps you too can finally achieve the dream of an off-station transfer, or even the Redshirt's opportunity of a lifetime: being sent on an away-mission!<br><br><i>&quot;Redshirt\u2019s take on science fiction clich\u00e9s is amusing, telling short stories in the form of status updates and messages, but the activity of playing the game is rather intense, even though it\u2019s a turn-based life management sim. As if accidentally snubbing friends and causing heartbreak wasn\u2019t enough, a short while into your misadventure, a disturbing message arrives. A calamity is coming. The station is doomed.
