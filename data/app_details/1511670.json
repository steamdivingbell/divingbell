{"about_the_game":"Enter The Backrooms is a survival horror game that takes place in an infinite maze of rooms known as The Backrooms. Throughout the game, The Backrooms gnaws away at your sanity, resulting in unexplainable sights, sounds, and experiences. In order to survive, you must meditate to regain your sanity before you succumb to the psychological effects of The Backrooms. As you wander the endless expanse of humming lights, stained carpet, and old wallpaper, you can find paths to new levels, evade corrupted entities, and empower yourself with artifacts.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1511670/extras/levelBanner.png?t=1666458135\" /><br><br>Enter The Backrooms has <strong>34 Main Levels</strong>, along with <strong>20 Secret Levels</strong> to stumble across. These levels take place in various settings, ranging from claustrophobic tunnels to infinite cities. On each level, you can encounter areas with distinct properties known as Sub-Levels. There are <strong>over 100 Sub-Levels</strong> to find within the Main Levels. Levels also contain small structures that reward you for exploring.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1511670/extras/entityBanner.png?t=1666458135\" /><br><br>You are never alone in Enter The Backrooms. There are <strong>over a dozen different entities</strong> that you can encounter, and they get more malicious the deeper you go. Most of these entities are hostile, corrupted beasts that will drain you both physically and mentally. However, not everything in The Backrooms is out to get you.

Enter The Backrooms promises players an unforgettably surreal experience that no other game provides. That being said, this game is <u>NOT</u> for players who want gorgeous visuals, heavy story elements, or a particularly polished package.
