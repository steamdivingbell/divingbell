{"about_the_game":"You are a Selenaut, an astronaut specialized in the space exploration of moons and planetoids. Your mission is to travel to different moons to rescue their inhabitants from an attack by the droid army.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the help of a radar, we have to locate the Selenites, 6 small colored aliens, capture them, and bring them to the ship in the chromatic order that is randomly generated at the beginning of the game and shown on a tablet, avoiding their abduction by the droids while fighting against drones, robots, turrets, and UFOs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe protagonist moves around the moon searching for the small Selenite characters, either casually or using a radar activated by pressing a button. When near a Selenite, pressing a suction button allows the protagonist to capture and carry it. To take it to the ship and release it, the Selenite's color must match the active color displayed on the tablet on the screen. To successfully complete the game, this process must be repeated 6 times.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDrones near a Selenite can capture them and take them to their mothership using a tractor beam. The only way to interrupt this is to destroy the drone, but if this is not done quickly, the Selenite will be lost and the game cannot be completed, although it can continue until there are no more Selenites left on the moon.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2979680/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1718229939","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2979680/page.bg.jpg?t=1718229939","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2979680/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718229939","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2979680/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718229939","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You are a Selenaut, an astronaut specialized in the space exploration of moons and planetoids.
