The higher the score multiplier, the more access you have to your suits abilities, and thus the stronger you are. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This new suit also comes fully kitted with advanced movement abilities like dashing, heel skating, and even rail grinding and these will be critical in gaining the upper hand on your enemies. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As if the sudden disappearance of residents in the cbc54 quadrant wasn't enough, there now seems to be some other life forms slowly appearing in multiple places throughout the quadrant. Since the super soldier responsible for cbc54 also seems to be MIA, you are sent in to investigate what's going on and, if need be, to put a stop to whatever it is the only way you know how to. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Embark on an enthralling and exciting adventure to uncover what's really going on in this sinister place. An adventure that takes you further than the walls of the city that houses you. An adventure filled with big guns and even bigger monsters.
