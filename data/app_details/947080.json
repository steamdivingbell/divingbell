You'll find that your old theater festival, the John Q. Public Festival, has fallen upon hard times (but honestly, when has it not?). It's not easy being Lake Tahoe's second-best Shakespeare festival. It falls to you to write a new future for the festival, as well as either mend or break your relations with the people that you left behind.<br><br>Or at least that's the story you're trying to tell. You ARE a writer, but the &quot;hometown&quot; is a play you wrote long ago and the &quot;mean old world&quot;.... well, no, that's the mean old world. That's not a stand-in for anything. <br><br>As Joe Papp's author, you find yourself with the ability to change the story that you are in, making choices between multiple characters that ultimately dictate how the story progresses.
