{"about_the_game":"With its unmistakable lines and exhilarating performance, the Ultimate biplane \u2014 in full-scale and in RC model form \u2014 has given pilots everywhere respect for the aerobatic capabilities of an airplane with two wings.  Gordon Price built and flew the first 10 Dash &quot;Ultimate&quot; design in the mid 1980s and flew the 10-300 in the 1988 World Aerobatic Championships.  E-flite\u00ae debuted the Ultimate2 in 2015, earning praise from RC pilots worldwide for its solid aerobatic performance and 3D capabilities.  With the Ultimate 3D, E-flite\u00ae has updated and upgraded that proven airframe to modern-day standards.  Its new power system offers better 3S performance and BALLISTIC power with a 4S battery.  Higher-torque and higher-speed metal-geared servos keep you firmly in control with the extra power.  It's also equipped with a 60-amp Spektrum\u2122 Avian\u2122 Smart ESC, and the BNF\u00ae Basic version is equipped with an AR637TA receiver that offers full-range telemetry including real-time battery voltage, current, temperature and more \u2013 along with motor reversing for special ground handling and other capabilities \u2013 when using compatible transmitters.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nThis model is equipped with Horizon Hobby and Spektrum exclusive AS3X (Artificial Stabilization \u2013 3-aXis) and optional-use SAFE (Sensor Assisted Flight Envelope) Select technologies, and when SAFE Select is turned on using the mode switch (B on the Spektrum InterLink DX controller) it offers: <br />\r\n <br />\r\nPitch and Bank Angle Limits <br />\r\nThese envelope limits keep the airplane from rolling or pitching upside down.
