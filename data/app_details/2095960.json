{"about_the_game":"Beihnn wants nothing more than to live a quiet, uneventful life in a cabin in the forest. Alas, adventure calls! Take control of Beihnn and attempt to discover the origin of the force that poisons the land in this NES 2D side-scrolling MetroidVania platformer.

Fight nine unique bosses. Talk to other characters for hints.<br><br>Isostasy began its life as an indie NES game. This is the PC version. It is essentially identical to the NES version, but also includes the ability to save game data to a file in your documents folder automatically upon viewing your password (to continue a saved game, select Password on the title screen, and if you have a valid save file the password will auto-populate, then press Start or Enter), and configure settings such as controller input (press Select or the D key while the game is paused to view Settings). If you would like to access the NES rom file, it is included in the files for the game. After installing it, navigate to the directory in which it is installed. Find IsostasyVer2.2.nes and <i>copy</i> it to your desired directory for play on an emulator or flash cart (do not <i>move</i> it, be sure to leave the original file in place).<br><br>Isostasy is designed to be played with a monitor refresh rate of at least 60 Hz. Playing with a refresh rate below 60 Hz may result in a sub-optimal experience. If audio or video issues are encountered, please check your monitor's refresh rate and increase it if necessary. Also note that in a multiple monitor setup, the refresh rate of all monitors may be limited by that of the slowest monitor, depending on your hardware. Try turning off or disconnecting the slower monitor and see if that resolves any issues.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2095960?t=1726425675","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2095960?t=1726425675","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2095960/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726425675","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2095960/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726425675","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2120980,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<h1>Version 2.2.3 Released!</h1><p>Version 2.2.3 contains the same core NES ROM as version 2.2 (so there are no changes to the actual game), there are only a few updates to the game's emulation wrapper:<br>1. Audio is now much less glitchy when played on a monitor with a refresh rate lower than 60Hz (although it is still recommended to play on a monitor with a refresh rate of at least 60Hz for the optimal gameplay experience).<br>2. When the game window is clicked and dragged or resized, audio will no longer lag behind video.<br>3. The Escape, Pause/Break, and Home keys (which are mapped to Exit, Reset, and Controller Reset respectively) must now be held down for about 1.5 seconds before they will have an effect. This helps prevent the game from accidentally being reset if one of those keys is inadvertently tapped during gameplay.<br>4. Older Direct Input controllers are now supported. This will allow the use of many legacy NES-style USB accessories.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Beihnn wants nothing more than to live a quiet, uneventful life in a cabin in the forest.
