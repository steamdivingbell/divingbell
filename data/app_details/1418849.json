{"about_the_game":"Experience classic railroading moving heavy coal and manifest freight through the heart of Virginia's coalfields with Train Sim World 2: Clinchfield Railroad.<br><br>Fabulous and famous: The Clinchfield Railroad was one of America\u2019s most extraordinary railroads. Often called \u201cThe Rio Grande of the East\u201d for its spectacular scenery and challenging mountain railroading, the Clinchfield (which is now CSX\u2019s Kingsport Subdivision) was both an extraordinary coal hauler and a busy and vital bridge line for manifest freight traffic, providing a link between the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio on its north end and the Seaboard Coast Line in the south.<br><br>It\u2019s your job to take charge of the heavy coal and manifest freight services through the rugged Appalachian Mountains. Load coal from one of several mines in peaks of Virginia, and explore not only the main line, but the various local branches, each with its own challenges and character.<br><br>Take control of the instantly recognisable EMD F7 diesel locomotive, dressed in the vibrant and coal dust-coated Clinchfield Railroad livery. Step into the cab of the A unit, while the B unit offers additional horsepower for the heaviest of freight duties. Alternatively, get a taste of something then-new, the EMD SD40, before its more recent upgrades to become the loco that exists today.<br><br>Choose how you want to play; operate trains, ride around as a conductor, complete the route tasks, or simply pick a vantage point and watch the action unfold. Create your own experiences with the Scenario Planner and Livery Designer. Whatever you choose to do, there's lots to see and experience in Train Sim World 2: Clinchfield Railroad.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>37-mile route between Elkhorn City, Kentucky and Dante, Virginia<br></li><li>Also includes the 5-mile Haysi branch, 14-mile Fremont branch, 2-mile McClure spur and 6-mile Nora spur<br></li><li>Multiple coal loading facilities included throughout the route<br></li><li>Includes the CRR F7A &amp; B and SD40 diesel locomotives<br></li><li>Includes 70t and 100t coal hoppers, Box and Refrigerated cars and a caboose in CRR livery<br></li><li>Highly detailed, feature-rich, driving cabs with accurate true-to-life performance and handling<br></li><li>Journey Mode featuring over 24 hours of activities for you to master<br></li><li>Accessible Training Modules and 5 detailed and engaging scenarios<br></li><li>Extensive 24-hour Timetable<br></li><li>A selection of Route Tasks to complete<br></li><li>Livery Designer and Scenario Planner compatible<br></li><li>Powered by Dovetail Games\u2019 proprietary SimuGraph\u00ae vehicle dynamics engine and Unreal Engine 4\u00ae technology<br></li><li>Download Size: 2.9GB</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1418849/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1704475784","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1418849/page.bg.jpg?t=1704475784","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1418849/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1704475784","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1418849/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1704475784","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Experience classic railroading moving heavy coal and manifest freight through the heart of Virginia's coalfields with Train Sim World 2: Clinchfield Railroad.<br><br>Fabulous and famous: The Clinchfield Railroad was one of America\u2019s most extraordinary railroads.
