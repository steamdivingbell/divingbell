Be careful not to overexert your engines or else they might catch on fire. Make good use of physics and rain destruction upon your enemies.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1275590/extras/600.gif?t=1727095826\" /><br>Take pleasure in exploring a vast and interesting world filled with adventure. Launch a full-scale invasion and conquer entire islands. Delve into the world of a single-player campaign and onto an arena filled with enemies.

Learn the extent of your creations\u2019 capabilities and face increasing challenges. Figure out your enemies\u2019 battle plan and spot the weaknesses of their vessels. Fight alongside allies or solo.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Features</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Advanced destruction simulation, vehicles can be cut in half.<br></li><li>Projectiles with their own ballistics, penetration, and ricochet mechanics.<br></li><li>Simulation of aerodynamics, buoyancy, fires, and flooding.<br></li><li>Vehicles constructed from many different materials, paintable armors with various levels of thickness.<br></li><li>Vehicles with various ranges of visibility and detection radii.<br></li><li>Creative mode where you can build any vehicle you want.<br></li><li>Integrated Steam workshop to share your creativity.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Destruction</strong></h2>The most important part of any ship is its core block, there can be only one of this type and its destruction will annihilate the whole vehicle. Every block must have a connection to the core. Each element has its own hit points, level of fire resistance, ability to resist impact and explosion. Some of them can also be flooded or lose their lift power. Every destroyed element has an impact on a vessel's combat capabilities - strategic block placement can improve your vehicle\u2019s survivability and efficiency.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Weapons</strong></h2>Each weapon is a separate object with its own logic and physics systems. Before shooting, a weapon checks if it doesn\u2019t don't hit or collide with its own vehicle. Weapons types include many variants of artillery, missile launchers, machine guns, flamethrowers, torpedo launchers, bombs, depth charges, and crazy close combat weapons. One of the unique weapons is a harpoon that can grab and pull enemies or pull its own vehicle to the ground.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Physics</strong></h2>The shape and size of the vehicles' hull affects their air and water drag. Vessels with an angled, aerodynamic hull are faster than those that look like a brick. Some blocks generate buoyancy or lift, center of which should be balanced with the center of mass. Water has realistic wave simulation, there is also wind that can be used by sails.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Mechanics</strong></h2>The game has realistic gun ballistics and armor penetration mechanics; angled surfaces offer better protection from projectiles and can cause them to ricochet. Most blocks can be made using different materials that have different weights and other properties. Enemy vehicles can behave differently, depending on what weapons they have installed and what their goals are.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Diesel Efficiency","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1275590/38bd462c1fa3ca19f350e199e247acd40cf7a331.jpg"},{"name":"I can see their tanks from here!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1275590/43ab1d6fd170d375f1df0409775a1ad7a623e034.jpg"},{"name":"Crushing Depth","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1275590/98fa449a16d3363d45aef0cab6e59829c6888d61.jpg"},{"name":"Dream big, build bigger","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1275590/4c352cfc355ae4ad6c16ebaeae18fbf63fa24592.jpg"},{"name":"Making a name for yourself","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1275590/a9e9cb1970673b756d0fa8f0ddeeff86385a9cc7.jpg"},{"name":"Rule the seas","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1275590/8107da9a92d036f2819e02846863bb24a7ce608b.jpg"},{"name":"Conqueror","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1275590/1e1baea5760516eb572e90e48ec24896f845a436.jpg"},{"name":"Cut through the waves","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1275590/5bba061195e00c77ce19b5c2cd132e216761a09e.jpg"},{"name":"I just want to watch the trees fall","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1275590/9f154140ef20986c721a2af0f792a4e91133c942.jpg"},{"name":"Leaving a trail of fire","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1275590/bf3bea7f5c483bb35314577688bcbc4f4c7f44c0.jpg"}],"total":11},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1275590/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727095826","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1275590/page.bg.jpg?t=1727095826","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1275590/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727095826","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1275590/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727095826","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Dieselpunk Wars: Prologue is a free version of an epic vehicle building game.</strong><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1275590/extras/104b2.gif?t=1727095826\" /><br>Build magnificent machines from over 140 unique elements.
