{"about_the_game":"The game named Penalty is a 2D adventure RPG, with unique gameplay mechanics, FBF animations, and beautiful sound and visual effects. The story of the game revolves around the world having rejected goodness to such an extent and lacked respect for both the gods and each other, that the gods have subjected the entire world to a massive punishment. They cursed both the existing and future generations, making them unable to rest in peace. Death has been completely abolished, meaning even if the body &quot;dies,&quot; it immediately rises again, as the underworld serves as a gathering place from which one can emerge at any time. However, the underworld is terribly cold, and those who dwell there suffer greatly. Moreover, if one manages to return to the surface, it is populated by monsters, curses, and dreadfully contagious diseases. Your only chance is to reach the monolith. Your task is simple: to touch the monolith, and then you can ascend to heaven. But don't think it will be easy. In the past 400 years, no one has been able to even approach the island, as it is teeming with spirits, demons, and colossal Leviathans, many times larger than the great cargo ships.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2853710/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1709922257","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2853710/page.bg.jpg?t=1709922257","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2853710/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1709922257","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2853710/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1709922257","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"The game named Penalty is a 2D adventure RPG, with unique gameplay mechanics, FBF animations, and beautiful sound and visual effects.
