The character banter was awesome, the story is just out there sometimes, and I can see myself replaying this game more than once...because it's quite possible to miss a lot of things this game has to offer on the first playthrough.\u201d<br>7.4/10 \u2013 EndlessXGaming<br><br>\u201cI\u2019ll give this game 4 out of 5 stars. This game was really, really funny, and really, really entertaining. The characters were lovable, and all and all, I just had a great time playing it. It was not in The Tokyo Dome nor was Misawa in it, so I can only give this game four stars, though.\u201d<br>4/5 Stars \u2013 ScheLPs<br><br>\u201cRunning time around ten hours, the game really doesn\u2019t overstay its welcome, so it\u2019s a really good pick up and play game. As well, if you just wanna play it from start to finish in one go, you\u2019re very welcome to do so. You don\u2019t need that much grinding...So, yeah, pick up and give it a try. Albino Hunter\u2014it\u2019s right now on Steam so you can get it. \u2026The selling point that got me into the game: it\u2019s not expensive. \u2026 And honestly, for the price it had, it\u2019s very well worth it\u2026[T]his is a game I would have loved to be able to play twenty years ago, when I was a little kid, and I would have loved to play something like this on the Super Nintendo. You know, it\u2019s games like these that I say, twenty years ago [if] this would have come out for the Super Nintendo, it would have been so famous. It would have been comparable to a Final Fantasy because\u2026back in the day, not many games were too long\u2026[A] ten hour RPG is just, honestly, the sweet point for me.\u201d<br>10/10 \u2013 ARMR Studios<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/355520/ss_01a19d1bdd79abc254a6cad1e7f68dc1a91bffc3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1724991341","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/355520/ss_01a19d1bdd79abc254a6cad1e7f68dc1a91bffc3.600x338.jpg?t=1724991341"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/355520/ss_9deb036c3aa8905d26e7f423f3c561cc72314691.1920x1080.jpg?t=1724991341","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/355520/ss_9deb036c3aa8905d26e7f423f3c561cc72314691.600x338.jpg?t=1724991341"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/355520/ss_87f1c0d2c87860c6158013ffcce916d379b24565.1920x1080.jpg?t=1724991341","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/355520/ss_87f1c0d2c87860c6158013ffcce916d379b24565.600x338.jpg?t=1724991341"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/355520/ss_864903cfb6b944b9d8b282c38d3cad76be4d800a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1724991341","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/355520/ss_864903cfb6b944b9d8b282c38d3cad76be4d800a.600x338.jpg?t=1724991341"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/355520/ss_c14b22b4ad4f682290e444212f59585c1bc171e5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1724991341","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/355520/ss_c14b22b4ad4f682290e444212f59585c1bc171e5.600x338.jpg?t=1724991341"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/355520/ss_6bf9561cfea438823b3779e5f454eafcedf278e3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1724991341","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/355520/ss_6bf9561cfea438823b3779e5f454eafcedf278e3.600x338.jpg?t=1724991341"}],"short_description":"Kalymn Nox is the Albino Hunter; even his pretentious and slightly racist title can keep him from waking up broke after a night of drinking.","steam_appid":355520,"support_info":{"email":"","url":"https://twitter.com/CherryCoStudios"},"supported_languages":"English","type":"game","website":null}
