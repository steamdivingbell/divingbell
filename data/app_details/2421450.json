{"about_the_game":"Explore what the backrooms have to offer in this infinitely expansive realm of space with or without friends by your side. Each level has different entities with logs on the way left by past explorers who documented their findings. Some may be classified so you will have to decipher it.<br><br><strong>MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT</strong><br>Currently, we have a story mode that is both single-player and Co-op as well as a VS mode. Jump into a random and survive for as long as you can in our arcade mode, or jump into the story in our VS mode and try to survive against your friends. Careful though, as you are not the only ones here and <i>they</i> can hear your movements.<br><br><strong>VR SUPPORT</strong><br><i><strong>NOTE</strong></i> VR support is unfinished and may be unstable causing game crashes or other problems within your game. We are working hard to fix this soon. With VR support you can see the entities as if they are life-sized, you can feel the fear as if it's real, and you can scare your friends for all eternity as there isn't a known ending to the backrooms. Tons of fun for those stingy friend groups. Been tearing friends apart since day 1 <i>not responsible for loss of friendships</i><br><br><strong>ENDLESS LEVELS</strong><br>With each level are multiple exits that lead you away from reality(or closer if you're lucky). Will you risk it all? Or will you stay in the safe zones for as long as you can? careful. Nobody knows if those zones are really &quot;safe&quot; :)<br><br><strong>ENTITIES</strong><br>With so many entities, some you may encounter and not know they are in the game. Not all entities are playable. But all playable entities are active. Each entity is unique in its own way with special abilities that it has gained based on its habitat. Remember, if you can go between levels. So can they.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2421450/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1711663192","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2421450/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1711663192","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2421450/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1711663192","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2421450/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1711663192","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Acts of violence, blood, and some gore are present.
