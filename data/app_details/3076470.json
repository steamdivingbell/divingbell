{"about_the_game":"&quot;Pathfinder Society Scenario #5-07: Sewer Dragon Crisis<br> <br>  <br> A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for 1st- through 4th-level characters. <br> Drandle Dreng's unmasking as the member of the Decemvirate known as Sapphire has left the Sewer Dragons in a sort of limbo, with one of their strongest political allies largely stripped of influence. Chief Yiddlepode still believes that these agreements with outsiders is the best way to keep the Sewer Dragons strong, but, while that was an easy case to make before their territory was devastated, doubts have arisen among other members of the tribe in the ensuing years. Trapmaster Tok especially has begun to blame the Pathfinder for their misfortune. He has issued a challenge to Yiddlepode for the leadership of the Sewer Dragons, and she has turned again to the Pathfinders. The conflict brewing beneath the streets of Absalom threatens to destabilize the whole city. The PCs need to prove to the beleaguered kobold allies that the best way foward is together. <br> Written by Genevieve Olejnik <br> <br> Scenario tags : Faction (Radiant Oath) <br> <br>  This product is not a PDF or accessible outside of Fantasy Grounds.
