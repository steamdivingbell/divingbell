For example, Dragon Draft. This is a unique game mode inspired by the popular Autochess genre.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can bring your heroes into the game, and other players will bring theirs. These heroes are added to the standard selection of heroes in Dragon Draft, ensuring that no two games are alike.

You get to assemble another deck of heroes, and fight bosses. There are small, medium, and big bosses for you to face. Each requires a different amount of effort and brings a different reward. You can become the ultimate boss-killer, if you have a strong deck. Or a helper - if you\u2019re still building up your own might. The other players will help you gain strength during the siege.

Global battles between clans. We have these, as well! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can assemble your clan, conquer the King of the Realm\u2019s castle, and show who is the strongest clan on the server.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can also capture the Monster Lair, and defend it against other clans. You get to claim all the rewards and the chance to fight the monsters in the lair single-handedly.
