{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Deck Building With a Twist</h2><strong>Randomized turn order, no shuffling, and multiple win and loss conditions make this a deck building experience like no other!</strong><br><br><i>\u201cThis is not the end of the world. That already happened. This is what is left: us, gravehold, and the Nameless. For generations we have taken refuge in an ancient and haunted place. It has taken our mages an aeon to hone their craft, but they are ready... and they are lethal. The breaches, the very conduits through which the Nameless travel, have become our weapon.\u201d</i><br>-Yaleesa Rhykk, Gravehold survivor<br><br>The situation is bleak. The final city - <strong>Gravehold</strong> - needs the power of the breach mages to hold back the Nameless. Join the fight, and maybe\u2026 just maybe, Gravehold will live to see another dawn.<br><br><strong>Aeon\u2019s End</strong> is a deck-building game where you create a team of up to 4 mages who will fight cooperatively to defeat whichever Nameless nemesis has come through the breach today. You begin with a starting deck of 10 cards, 5 in hand. Each turn you play <strong>gems</strong> to gain <strong>aether</strong>, which is used to buy new gems and <strong>relics</strong>, learn new <strong>spells</strong>, and increase your casting potential by opening additional <strong>breaches</strong>. You can also play relics to give yourself or your allies a boost. Then <strong>prep</strong> spells to your opened or focused breaches to be ready to <strong>cast</strong> them on your subsequent turns. <br><br>What makes Aeon\u2019s End unique is how it uses <strong>randomness</strong>. Unlike other deck building games, players do not shuffle their deck when it runs out. The order in which you discard is preserved so plan your discards carefully to set yourself up for subsequent turns.<br><br>Instead, randomness in Aeon\u2019s End comes in the order of turns. At the start of each round, the <strong>turn order deck</strong> is shuffled to determine the order of play. Will the nemesis go twice in a row, pushing back the mages\u2019 defense? Will the mages get 4 turns in a row to set up for the coming onslaught? It can be hard to know what\u2019s coming next when you are deep in the melee!<br><br>Finally, there\u2019s the city of <strong>Gravehold</strong>. The breach mages of Aeon\u2019s End are not just fighting for their own survival, but the survival of all of humanity, and the Nameless know it. If Gravehold is ever reduced to 0 life, the mages have lost and humanity is but a memory.
