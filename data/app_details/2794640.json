Set in a charming underground village, devoid of light, you are the last bastion between your townsfolk and the encroaching hoards of mutated fauna. As night falls, your duty is to defend your people, by any means necessary. Will you rely on your &quot;trained&quot; soldiers, or will you unleash your god-like strength to turn the buildings, objects, and even citizens into projectiles to hurl at the oncoming threats?<br><br>Delve further into the depths of this chasm to gather resources from the flora which can further fortify your defenses. You'll encounter five unique enemy types in the demo, culminating in an epic boss battle!
