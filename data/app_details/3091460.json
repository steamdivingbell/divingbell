{"about_the_game":"The Raptured is a narrative-driven videogame experience that is fictitiously set after the Cold War and immerses the audience in misconstrued reality. Two novice journalists meet together to investigate a hefty tip from someone anonymous, but little do they know, they are stumbling into illegal testing grounds for drug and chemical testing in a low-income neighbourhood from a private drug and chemical PMC organisation. Fletcher, the main character, is inadvertently exposed to an unknown chemical agent and hallucinates violent apparitions that he believes are real. But he finds out the truth too late in the end.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe player progresses by venturing through a linear world, driven by the main objective. They must be careful, as they are not alone in the world. There are apparitions that stalk the player like zombies while the player is progressing. You may be able to fight back by finding weapons, but when you get stronger, your enemies do too. There is a gallery of apparitions that vary in difficulty, and it is determined by how far you progress in the game, meaning the game gets harder and scarier as you continue.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe musical mood for this game harbours feelings of unnaturality, decrepitness, and eeriness. We strived to produce a stale but gripping musical score that compliments the timeline and setting of the game and enhances the feelings of the player when they are confronted with an emotional moment. Music is also aimed at inheriting the same style as the 1990s while also not damaging immersion.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3091460?t=1720869177","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3091460?t=1720869177","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3091460/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1720869177","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3091460/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1720869177","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Gun violence against subhuman beings with blood. no gibbing, excessive gore, dismemberment, etc.\r\n\r\nPhysical violence against the main character.
