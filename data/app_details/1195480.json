{"about_the_game":"There\u2019s not much of a precedent for music about settlers on Mars discovering a portal to hell, so it must have seemed like quite a unique task for Mick Gordon as he set out to compose original music for Doom.

The world evoked through these tracks is a horrifying projection\u2014one that we should never hope to experience.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1195480?t=1581558348","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1195480?t=1581558348","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1195480/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1581558348","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1195480/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1581558348","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"There\u2019s not much of a precedent for music about settlers on Mars discovering a portal to hell, so it must have seemed like quite a unique task for Mick Gordon as he set out to compose original music for Doom.
