The choice is yours.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>POWER UNLIMITED</strong></h2>Destroying fiends is not only a need for survival, but also a mean to grow more powerful. Gaining experience, your spells will gain potency. Persevere and grant them a surprise. A single meteor was clearly enough, but what about three ?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>DEATH ?
