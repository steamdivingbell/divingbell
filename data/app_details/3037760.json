{"about_the_game":"Thanks to everyone who tried and experienced the game, which will be released in July 2024<br />\r\nSuggestions about the game can be sent to gamesupport@gklgame.email<br />\r\nThank you all very much!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe name of the game &quot;Lizard Learning&quot; is taken from the Chinese idiom &quot;\u897f\u5b66\u4e1c\u6e10&quot;, which refers to the historical process of the spread of Western academic ideas to China from the late Ming Dynasty to modern times. The game is partly inspired by the setting of &quot;Tenjin&quot; in &quot;Silver Souls&quot;, and partly by the excellent imagination of foreign people. The story takes place in a fantasy world called Evelia, where the peace-loving natives, the elves, and the predators from beyond the sky, the lizardmen, have fought a battle to the death. Fortunately, the invaders failed to thwart the elves' indomitable struggle; unfortunately, the elves were not strong enough to drive the invaders out of their homeland once and for all. Players will take on the role of a headmaster of an interstellar exchange academy, seizing a bizarre but rare period of strategic opportunity and struggling to balance the forces and currents of thought in a treacherous situation. Players can accept the guidance of the Lizardmen's advanced civilisation; they can walk on thin ice and seek the path of peace, growing the power of the elves while dancing with the wolves; or they can tear down this false illusion and thwart the Lizardmen's plots to rekindle the flames of war.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3037760/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1718039559","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3037760/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1718039559","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3037760/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718039559","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3037760/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718039559","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Thanks to everyone who tried and experienced the game, which will be released in July 2024<br />\r\nSuggestions about the game can be sent to gamesupport@gklgame.email<br />\r\nThank you all very much!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe name of the game &quot;Lizard Learning&quot; is taken from the Chinese idiom &quot;\u897f\u5b66\u4e1c\u6e10&quot;, which refers to the historical process of the spread of Western academic ideas to China from the late Ming Dynasty to modern times.
