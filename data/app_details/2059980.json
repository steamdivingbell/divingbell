{"about_the_game":"<i>Oriental Immortal</i> is a 3D open world multiplayer sword and fairy game with sandbox elements. A classic rendition of the cultivation world is created based on popular web novel, the classical work Shan Hai Jing (Classic of Mountains and Seas), and numerous other renowned fairy-themed novels. This is a world where you can brew alchemical pills, forge artifacts, draw magical arrays, dominate beasts, draw runes, generate magical recipes, build your own mansion, and get tantric with a loved one to ascend together.<br>You start off as a weak mortal, and will learn to master these gameplay elements as you ascend and end your incarnation by ascending to immortality.<br><br>Game summary:<br>Fellow taoists, welcome to the world of <i>Oriental Immortal</i>. As one of the many practitioners in this world, you must be aware that this place offers you more than one path to ascension.<br>Join an orthodox monastery and perform deeds that alleviate mortal suffering to eventually become a beloved and heroic immortal.<br>You can also start a hermitage and live free in the wilderness to ascend as an unfettered immortal.<br>Or, you can embark on the path of taming vicious eldritch energy, cultivating your inner Tao by slaying opponents, and ascending as an ashura of battle.<br><br><strong>Orthodox Ascension based on Popular Works</strong><br>The ascension system of <i>Oriental Immortal</i> is based upon those described in popular cultivation novels. We ensured that every ascension-related skill are accurately recreated in the game. These include alchemy, crafting, arrays, spirit beasts, runes, magical recipes, mansions, tantric training, farming, animal raising, arcadias, and Kalpa trials designed to give taoists an immersive experience of immortal ascension.<br><br><strong>Explore a Vast Open World</strong><br>Taoists can experience ascension-related events in villages and towns, seek supernatural artifacts at strange rifts, or hunt vicious beasts to acquire their essence. You will be facing tons of options to attain your very own ascension.<br><br><strong>Mortality versus Immortality</strong><br>To differentiate the experience of mortals and the ascended immortals, taoists walking the path of ascension will still experience real-life problems and even succumb to starvation, sickness, injuries, or other mortal ailments.<br>Those who manage to survive the trials of ascension will find their bodies to be greatly enhanced and experience growing immunity to mortal diseases and longer lifespans. With less mortal needs to cater to, they can better focus on taoist training and achieve immortality!<br><br><strong>Freedom and Magical Battles</strong><br>Battles between aspirants do not simply involve two taoists hurling spells at each other and see who deals more damage. Instead, taoists would be able to draw upon everything in their arsenal and attack each other from the heavens or the underground with an unending chain of devastating eldritch magic. Everything you do in your path of ascension will give you a slight edge during deadly battles against hostile aspirants. We hope every taoist can enjoy the combat system we have designed in <i>Oriental Immortal</i>.<br><br><strong>Friendships that Last</strong><br><i>Oriental Immortal</i> lets taoists play with their friends and take the path of ascension together.
