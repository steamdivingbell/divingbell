{"about_the_game":"In a twisted world best described as \u201da miniature cardboard city turned into a malicious science experiment\u201d, you find yourself captured against your will by an oddly charming but mysterious YouTuber that goes by the name &quot;<strong>Sven</strong>&quot; in the deadly city of Kartong. Your life now depends on mediocre office supply-weapons and your every move is being filmed for his YouTube enjoyment - a truly odd experience, all wrapped up in challenging stealth/FPS gameplay.
