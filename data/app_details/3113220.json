{"about_the_game":"After working on the soundtrack for Curse of the Dead Gods\u00a9, Antoine Duch\u00eane takes you on an auditory journey that combines classical and Celtic folk music.<br />\r\nPlaying his favourite instrument, the cello, and accompanied by allies on the bagpipes, flute and more exotic instruments such as the oud and Algerian mandola, this soundtrack is our musical hero's most intimate and epic score. Melodic and stirring, punctuated by rousing percussion, the music of Ravenswatch perfectly reflects the game's unique blend of dark fantasy, tales and legends. A strong theme with Breton sounds ties it all together, while melodies from elsewhere recall heroes' adventures from the castle of Avalon to the oases of One Thousand and One Nights.<br />\r\nDon't be caught daydreaming and beating along in time; there are Master Nightmares to slay!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3113220/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727366764","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3113220/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1727366764","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3113220/3e67f777c81350ba31f4302512e7f2528b1a814c/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727366764","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3113220/3e67f777c81350ba31f4302512e7f2528b1a814c/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727366764","categories":[{"description":"Additional High-Quality Audio","id":50}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"After working on the soundtrack for Curse of the Dead Gods\u00a9, Antoine Duch\u00eane takes you on an auditory journey that combines classical and Celtic folk music.<br />\r\nPlaying his favourite instrument, the cello, and accompanied by allies on the bagpipes, flute and more exotic instruments such as the oud and Algerian mandola, this soundtrack is our musical hero's most intimate and epic score.
