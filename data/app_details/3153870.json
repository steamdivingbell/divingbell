{"about_the_game":"In this game you will face a set of enemies - inhabitants of the Wealdfall - on your journey to gather nutrients for your squirrel avatar.

Those however shall not be all the adversities you will have to overcome. Lands of the Wealdfall do not allow for a simple stroll. Your chances of survival shall also be thwarted by environmental hazards such as water reservoirs (since, as we all know, characters in platformer games usually can not swim) or low flying rocks (no comment, you'll have to see it).
