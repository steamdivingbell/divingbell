No track is ever the same!<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">RUN!</h2></strong>Run through the factory in two game modes. In programmed game mode your robot has an instruction compiler and executes the movements in sequence. Plan your movements using the available instructions, creating a movement programming sequence. Real time mode allows you to choose the instruction you want your robot to execute right away, but stay tuned as instructions have a cooldown time before they can be used again. Both modes can be played at normal, fast and super-fast speeds.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1218020/extras/Hole.gif?t=1617844481\" /><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GOAL AND SECRETS!</h2></strong>Use the items distributed in the track to assist you during races.
