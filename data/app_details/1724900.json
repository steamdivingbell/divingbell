Stay overnight, though, and you might be horrified to reveal the true nature of their sacred rituals. The world of Midwint\u00e4r is gruesome and dark but also funny.<br><br>Sun / Moon Gameplay Cycle Midwint\u00e4r features a 3-minute day-night cycle that changes your abilities.

You can use this against villagers - hide the firewood to lure the lumberjack into the night, kill him near the chapel to incriminate the priest, and later spread rumours on seeing him covered in blood.
