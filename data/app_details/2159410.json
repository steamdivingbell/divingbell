{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Shadow of the Demon Lord Adventure Pack 3</h2>  <br>  Four Shadow of the Demon Lord adventures for Master level characters <br> <br> <br>  <br> <strong> Heart of Winter (Master)</strong> The lands of the Empire languish in the grip of false winter as screaming blasts of cold come pouring out from a tear in the fabric of reality, causing temperatures to plunge, violent storms to blanket the ground under ice and snow, and banks of chilling fog to creep and crawl across the landscape. With this strangeness comes monsters, hideous and cruel, eager to feast on the confused and terrified people suffering from the chaos created by the unnatural weather. These are dark times indeed, and the people demand answers from their lords and masters. What does this weird weather portend? Who or what is behind it? Is the end of all things truly at hand? In this adventure, a group of master characters set out to answer these questions, venturing into the Heart of Winter, where they discover the source of the troubles and, with mettle, can confront it to restore the seasons to their proper order. Combat encounter maps included: Ruins of the Weaver <br> <strong> The Giant's Tribute(Master)</strong> For ten years the people of the village of Rowanrest lived in the shadow of a giant, a lazy brute named Roog Muttonfist. Regular tributes of livestock and beer were a small price to pay to keep the huge lout from knocking down houses or eating people, and the farmers of Rowanrest had enough to spare. But something went terribly wrong with this month's offering. Last night Roog came down to Rowanrest and demanded people instead of sheep--and the terrified villagers know that the giant might destroy the whole town and kill everyone if they refuse him. Combat encounter maps included: none <br> <strong> The Man Who Fell to Urth (Master)</strong> A strange blue giant appears and by dawn he's surrounded by a score of dour, salamander warriors. What does this giant want? What is his connection to the salamanders? What does all this portend? When demons start appearing and cultists crawl out of the woodwork, the answers seem clear. Or do they? Combat encounter maps included: none <br> <strong> The Last Train to Darksville (Master)</strong> A rail caravan from Devil's Breach to Darksville has failed to show up for three days running, and no one in Devil's Breach can figure out why. It's up to the player characters to investigate what's keeping the trains from running on time as they ride what may well be the last train to Darksville. This adventure is designed for master characters. Lower-level characters had best not apply.
