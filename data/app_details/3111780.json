{"about_the_game":"Welcome to the B.B.S.S., a top of the line research space station that is studying a planet before its inevitable collapse into the near by black hole. During one of their trips to the planet, they come across an unknown entity which they bring onboard as a research specimen. In their keycard secured lab, everything is going fine until the entity breaks free, leaving the station without a crew. As you awake from cryogenic sleep, you find yourself alone. With no friends/crew mates around, just a tape recorder and flashlight to assist, you must avoid the unknown entity and reach the escape pod before you drift into the black hole. The station is in emergency power mode so, you must power each level to access the elevators. Can you escape with the help of your friends\u2019 tapes or will you be consumed by this entity?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDive into this space station and use a variety of mechanics at your disposal to keep yourself alive. Balance your sanity and oxygen while hiding within the light. Try not to make too much noise and bring attention to yourself. This game hosts two game modes, a free-play as well as story mode that allows you to progress. There are also a number of collectables hidden throughout the levels for you to find! Can you find them all?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3111780/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726039724","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3111780/page.bg.jpg?t=1726039724","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3111780/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726039724","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3111780/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726039724","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to the B.B.S.S., a top of the line research space station that is studying a planet before its inevitable collapse into the near by black hole.
