Failure in the Roguelike game is perfectly normal, so don't worry too much about it.

The faster you kill monsters, the faster you level up.<br></li><li>2. Spells and artifacts need to be centrally upgraded, and quickly increasing the level of the same spell or artifact can make them more powerful.<br></li><li>3. Please choose a reasonable key button for spell.<br></li><li>4. It is not necessary to learn attack spell in all 6 spell slots, learning one or two Support spell may lead to better survival.<br></li><li>5. Talents have little impact on artifacts. But they can make a qualitative change in spell!<br></li><li>6. Don't rush to pick up items, wait until you need them. They won't disappear. <br></li><li>7. Don't be afraid of BOSS, it's here to give gifts! ^_^<br></li><li>8. If you have any questions during the game, please read the FAQ and the Tutorial first.<br></li><li>9. Pay attention to the types of enemies, Guards can limit your movement!<br></li><li>10. Mana is very important in this game. If you like to use spell, &quot;Mana Regeneration&quot; and &quot;Spell Mana Cost&quot; are great enhancements to buy. If you like to use artifacts, &quot;Max Mana&quot; is more valuable to you.<br></li><li>11. Luck is very important in Roguelike game , both on your own part and within the parameters of the game.<br></li><li>12. If you're an unlucky person like me. Then I suggest that you can plan your game well first in a run. Fill up one kind skill slots first, then you won't randomize unwanted skills of that kind.</li></ul><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2508890/extras/\u7b80\u4ecb\u6807\u989851.png?t=1733974201\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2508890/extras/\u89d2\u8272\u7b80\u4ecb\u827e\u5e0c\u2014\u2014\u82f1.png?t=1733974201\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2508890/extras/\u89d2\u8272\u7b80\u4ecb\u838e\u8389\u2014\u2014\u82f1.png?t=1733974201\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2508890/extras/\u89d2\u8272\u7b80\u4ecb\u52b3\u62c9\u2014\u2014\u82f1.png?t=1733974201\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2508890/extras/\u89d2\u8272\u7b80\u4ecb\u5b89\u5409\u62c9\u2014\u2014\u82f1.png?t=1733974201\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2508890/extras/\u89d2\u8272\u7b80\u4ecb\u9732\u897f\u2014\u2014\u82f1.png?t=1733974201\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2508890/extras/\u89d2\u8272\u7b80\u4ecb\u5e0c\u6735\u4e3d\u2014\u2014\u82f1.png?t=1733974201\" /><br>There is no plot within the game.

This game has no real adult content, only Nudity (No nipples or pussy). If you want to buy adult game, then it may not be able to meet your needs.

If your monitor is not 16:9, it is recommended to use &quot;Window Mode&quot; to play the game (especially with long fish screen). If the image is mismatched, I apologize to you, it is that I do not have the money to buy advanced monitors for game testing.<br></li><li>3. This game is based on the principle of &quot;good steel is used to the edge&quot;, the funds are basically invested in the characters (character drawing, CG and animation frames), so the skills effect, icons and sound effects in the game are all from the Assets Store.  If you are very resistant to these common assets, the game is difficult to meet your needs.<br></li><li>4. This game is a VS like game with sexy girls, if you want to play a light, can see some sexy girls in VS like game, then you can try this game. If you want an S-class VS like game like Brotato, this game is difficult to meet your needs.<br></li><li>5. Some game design of this game is different from other VS like, please read the tutorial. If you prefer fully automatic combat, you can turn on the &quot;Auto Cast Spell&quot; and &quot;Auto Aim&quot; functions in the Settings.<br></li><li>6. The game is a little difficult in the novice phase, but after understanding the game designs and some skills' ability, you can easily kill all enemies (about two or three Run).<br></li><li>7. If you feel it is easy to die using Icy, you can try to use Sally (take the artifact route bulid), Sister is very hard to die. ^_^<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">8.

I'm not going to brag about being able to form thousands of combinations like other games do, that's just mathematical permutations and combinations that have no real meaning. But I can say that this game can combine at least 5 mainstream builds and more than a dozen unique builds. It's fine if you want berserk mage or unbreakable mage, it depends on your knowledge and preference of skills.</h2><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2508890/extras/\u5feb\u901f\u8d5a\u94b1.gif?t=1733974201\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2508890/extras/\u6210\u5c31\u7b80\u5355\u2014\u2014\u82f1.png?t=1733974201\" /><br>Earn money quickly to power-up &amp; Unlock skills quickly!<br>If you survive long enough, you'll get many money. There are even builds within the game that specialize in earn money. Achievement completion conditions are easy and you can unlock many skills very quickly.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2508890/extras/\u5956\u52b1.png?t=1733974201\" /><br>There's no penalty for failure and a reward for winning! Failure in the Roguelike game is perfectly normal, so don't worry too much about it. But with a victory in this game, each character will unlock CG as your reward! ^_^<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2508890/extras/\u7b80\u4ecb\u6807\u989841.png?t=1733974201\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>1. The faster you kill monsters, the faster you level up.<br></li><li>2. Spells and artifacts need to be centrally upgraded, and quickly increasing the level of the same spell or artifact can make them more powerful.<br></li><li>3. Please choose a reasonable key button for spell.<br></li><li>4. It is not necessary to learn attack spell in all 6 spell slots, learning one or two Support spell may lead to better survival.<br></li><li>5. Talents have little impact on artifacts. But they can make a qualitative change in spell!<br></li><li>6. Don't rush to pick up items, wait until you need them. They won't disappear. <br></li><li>7. Don't be afraid of BOSS, it's here to give gifts! ^_^<br></li><li>8. If you have any questions during the game, please read the FAQ and the Tutorial first.<br></li><li>9. Pay attention to the types of enemies, Guards can limit your movement!<br></li><li>10. Mana is very important in this game. If you like to use spell, &quot;Mana Regeneration&quot; and &quot;Spell Mana Cost&quot; are great enhancements to buy. If you like to use artifacts, &quot;Max Mana&quot; is more valuable to you.<br></li><li>11. Luck is very important in Roguelike game , both on your own part and within the parameters of the game.<br></li><li>12. If you're an unlucky person like me. Then I suggest that you can plan your game well first in a run. Fill up one kind skill slots first, then you won't randomize unwanted skills of that kind.</li></ul><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2508890/extras/\u7b80\u4ecb\u6807\u989851.png?t=1733974201\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2508890/extras/\u89d2\u8272\u7b80\u4ecb\u827e\u5e0c\u2014\u2014\u82f1.png?t=1733974201\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2508890/extras/\u89d2\u8272\u7b80\u4ecb\u838e\u8389\u2014\u2014\u82f1.png?t=1733974201\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2508890/extras/\u89d2\u8272\u7b80\u4ecb\u52b3\u62c9\u2014\u2014\u82f1.png?t=1733974201\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2508890/extras/\u89d2\u8272\u7b80\u4ecb\u5b89\u5409\u62c9\u2014\u2014\u82f1.png?t=1733974201\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2508890/extras/\u89d2\u8272\u7b80\u4ecb\u9732\u897f\u2014\u2014\u82f1.png?t=1733974201\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2508890/extras/\u89d2\u8272\u7b80\u4ecb\u5e0c\u6735\u4e3d\u2014\u2014\u82f1.png?t=1733974201\" /><br>There is no plot within the game.
