{"about_the_game":"This game is created with the concept of a 'non-scary horror game.'<br>Dimly lit rooms, a large scythe, fleeing humans... Yes, it's certainly an unsettling and eerie world. However, the only 'fear' is yourself. The targets to be collected won\u2019t attack you, nor will they have anywhere to hide. Enjoy the sensation of being the powerful one to the fullest! <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Normal Mode</h2> In dimly lit rooms, search for escapees, wield your scythe, and use special abilities to slow down their movements and collect them.<br>There are 13 levels of difficulty. With each level up, more rooms will be unlocked, the number of humans to collect will increase, and their running speed will gradually rise. There is no time limit, so you can play the game at your own pace. <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">1 Minute Mode</h2> This is a mode where you try to collect as many souls as possible within a 1-minute time limit. Unlike Normal Mode, your special ability changes to one that increases your own movement speed.<br>The number of souls is unlimited! No quotas! Enjoy the exhilaration of swift movement.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3270800/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730236039","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3270800/page.bg.jpg?t=1730236039","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3270800/26da48a626a41765f801a66032f59400a1db6011/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730236039","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3270800/26da48a626a41765f801a66032f59400a1db6011/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730236039","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"This game is created with the concept of a 'non-scary horror game.'<br>Dimly lit rooms, a large scythe, fleeing humans...
