Fera Knight's world is full of people to befriend, items to discover, and Fera to capture; you\u2019d need more than turn-based mastery to experience all of which Fera Knight has to offer!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Enjoy a Fast-Paced Capture System</h2>Fera are captured in the overworld using a fast-paced capture system. Avoid contact and attacks from wild Fera with clutch manoeuvres; collect and use a selection of skills; and aim and shoot at wild Fera to capture them. An added bonus is that your primary Fera will also gain experience points for every wild Fera that you defeat in the overworld!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Form Your Own Team</h2>Assemble a team of up to four unique Fera, but pay close attention to each Fera\u2019s element and more importantly its role. There are three elements (earth, light, and dark) and three roles (damage, tank, and support) to choose from, so form your team wisely.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fight to the Death</h2>Revisit the one-on-one turn-based combat style, but with a much heavier emphasis on switching Fera in and out at just the right moments. Switch in your tank Fera to soak up damage and stun your enemy, before switching to your damage dealer to perform the killing blow! Watch out, however: in the world of Fera Knight, when a Fera is defeated in battle, it is considered dead for good.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Feel at Home in a Living, Breathing Town</h2>Life outside the town walls can be gruelling. Fortunately, the townsfolk of Reinstade are a friendly, charming bunch \u2014 well, some of them are. With over 15 townsfolk to meet, 5 bachelorettes to court, and weekly festivals to enjoy, the town of Reinstade is sure to rally your Fera well enough for the next fight.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Become a Fera Master</h2>Customize your Fera to fit <i>your </i>play-style. Augments can be equipped to grant your Fera stat boosts, allow them to use certain skills, or enhance their abilities. And if you so wish, you can also visit the Mondsruhe Sanctum to see whether your Fera is eligible for transcendence.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1852030/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1646849607","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1852030/page.bg.jpg?t=1646849607","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1852030/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1646849607","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1852030/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1646849607","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1852030/extras/WishlistCTADescription.png?t=1646849607\" /><br><br>The country of Edeltor has become grim.
