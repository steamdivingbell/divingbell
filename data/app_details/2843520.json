{"about_the_game":"Red Rampant is a narrative-driven action-adventure game set during the Scottish Wars of Independence and Robert the Bruce\u2019s wrestle for the Scottish crown. The default outcome of our narrative is crushing annihilation for the fledgling Scottish rebellion, but through the enigmatic Rewind Drug, gifted by the shrouded figure of The Alchemist, players can literally reverse defeat and steal victory. With the ability to travel back in time through their memories of previous gameplay and begin again, players use knowledge gained from past mistakes and hindsight of future events to rewrite the history books.<br />\r\nRed Rampant respects history in telling this story but it also embraces the mythological wrappings of Robert the Bruce\u2019s iconic underdog tale. Players will explore a grounded, war-torn Scotland but also discover moments of the fantastical\u2026 if they have the curiosity to look. Navigating this war-weary Scotland, players will face a guerrilla campaign against the medieval world\u2019s greatest military force amid sharpening knives in every shifting shadow as Bruce\u2019s ego makes enemies in every corner of the country.<br />\r\nCurrently in early access, with the next phase of production looking to visual and animation overhaul alongside implementation of the combat system. However, through this very early offering, we hope players enjoy such an evocative period of Scottish history being brought to life and exploring our splitting timeline. Some choices made promising hope and others the blackest doom. How would you write Scotland\u2019s history?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2843520/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1721983954","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2843520/page.bg.jpg?t=1721983954","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2843520/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1721983954","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2843520/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1721983954","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Red Rampant is a narrative-driven action-adventure game set during the Scottish Wars of Independence and Robert the Bruce\u2019s wrestle for the Scottish crown.
