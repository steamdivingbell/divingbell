This served as my inspiration and what the soundtrack aims to express. Whether you're anxious because of a dangerous situation or feeling joyous due to life saving comforts, I immersed myself in those feelings before crafting each track. Besides giving me new experiences and helping me grow professionally, I personally really enjoyed this style of composition. It was a pleasure creating the musical journey the player will experience in this wonderful game!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2693010/extras/VOLUME-ONE616.jpg?t=1718577680\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2693010/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1718577680","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2693010/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1718577680","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2693010/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718577680","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2693010/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718577680","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Original soundtrack from the <strong>\u2635 HIRAETH</strong> game by our Portugal composer Jo\u00e3o \u201cDrake\u201d Paulo.<br><br>The soundtrack includes the game's theme songs, background music, and promotional tracks.
