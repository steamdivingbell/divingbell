{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Defend the Roman Empire from the relentless barbarian hordes in this thrilling tower defense game. Strategically place your defenses, command powerful Roman legions, and hold the line against waves of enemies. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Can you protect the empire from destruction?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is a tower defence game built on more realistic graphics and in 3D. In this game you will be playing as the romans in iconic historical battles (the maps will be based on historical sites and places). You will get the classic tower defence experience with a little more focus on the historical aspect of the matchups. In the early access version you will be playing as the romans vs the barbarians, with the ability to utilize different towers to defend the path to your base. In the future there will also be a barracks added with roman soliders that will fight the barbarians on the way to your base.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is a game made by 1 developer and 1 artist. This is my first time ever trying to make a standalone game so everything will not be perfect. I hope you can still enjoy the game and please give feedback for anything you encounter or wish to see added to the game. I ask for your patience with me as i am only 1 person and not very experienced in the game development world. Hope you enjoy our game!</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3454040/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737741978","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3454040/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1737741978","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3454040/fcbeba7ca79b24e0773c3ff100221d54bf6e97a0/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737741978","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3454040/fcbeba7ca79b24e0773c3ff100221d54bf6e97a0/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737741978","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Defend the Roman Empire from the relentless barbarian hordes in this thrilling tower defense game.
