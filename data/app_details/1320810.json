Our approach is designed to allow you to get to know the characters in your party along with strategic combat in full 3D environments. We encourage party interaction through our campfire scenes and storybook sequences that pay homage to the original tabletop game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><u>Features</u></strong></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Strategic Turn-Based Tactical Combat<br></li><li>Full 3D Battlefields<br></li><li>Character-Driven Story<br></li><li>Storybook Choose Your Own Adventure Sequences<br></li><li>Death Matters, Each Ally You Lose Will Change Your Story<br></li><li>Unique Full-Color Artstyle<br></li><li>Based On An Original Tabletop RPG </li></ul><br>We're currently expecting to launch the game in the Summer of 2021.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><u>Gameplay</u></strong></h2><strong>Externus: Path of the Solari </strong>features classic turn-based gameplay.

Was it fate that a character died? Was it a punishment from the gods or just a mistake caused by an error in tactics? Death will be permanent in Externus, how will you react?

Fate plays a large role in our world as the balance between order and chaos is constantly shifting. We find ourselves in a time where two Gods have been slain by a powerful unknown enemy.

Osmund is part of an order known as the Soldat Solari, a tradition he intends to pass down to his sons, that is tasked with keeping balance and order throughout the world of Externus. Our story begins as we follow the Steele family and their companions on their way toward the town of Zyais when they run into unexpected trouble from a mysterious group known as The Monotheists. This group of zealots is led by a man named Gabriel who has a history with Osmund and the Soldat Solari. Was it fate that brought them together on this day? Was it the will of the gods? With Gabriel in the picture and rumors swirling of a larger threat, known only as The Abomination, the Steele family will have a lot of roadblocks in their way as they try to keep the balance of the world from shifting into chaos. Will your choices balance things or plunge them further into chaos? What does Fate have in store for you and your companions? Death matters in the world of Externus and losing an ally can change the story.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><u>About Winterborn</u></strong></h2><strong>Winterborn</strong> was formed by Kent Gambill in November of 2018 to make a tactical role-playing game set in a world he created over 15 years ago as a tabletop game.
