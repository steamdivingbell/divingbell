A significant number of these weapons fell into enemy hands, and towards the end of the war, they were actively used by Volkssturm armed units. Due to its compactness and light weight, the MP-719(r)  was ideal for sabotage operations. The weapon was known for its reliability and ease of use, which was especially important in conditions with limited maintenance capabilities. The MP-719(r)  was used in various sabotage actions, such as ambushes on retreating columns and patrols of Allied forces. The submachine gun uses 7.62mm rounds and is equipped with a 35-round magazine. It fires in full-auto mode.
