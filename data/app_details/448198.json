{"about_the_game":"Coal country railroading! The Baltimore &amp; Ohio Kingwood Branch for Train Simulator brings to life classic early 1960s Appalachian railroading.<br><br>From the talented team that created the acclaimed Virtual New Haven Springfield Line, the B&amp;O Kingwood Branch route delivers the extraordinary challenges of operating heavy diesel-powered coal trains over steep grades, tight curves, and rugged switchbacks. <br><br> Set in the northeast corner of West Virginia, this route is based upon the authentic West Virginia Northern Railroad, but is semi-fictional in that it is re-created as a Baltimore &amp; Ohio branch line operation. The route includes a 10-mile roller coaster line between Kingwood and an interchange with the Baltimore &amp; Ohio main line at Tunnelton and a 7-mile run to a large coal seam at Birds Creek. And along the way, numerous additional rugged spurs fan out up the wooded mountain valleys to wherever coal is produced.<br><br>The B&amp;O Kingwood Branch route serves 14 mines including a mix of traditional underground and surface pit mines, as well as truck transfer sites for offline customers. Loads move from the mine tipples to the interchange yard at Tunnelton on the Mountain Sub main line of the B&amp;O. Empties arrive at Tunnelton and are stored along the line and at Kingwood for delivery to customers. The route also includes a variety of non-mining lineside customers and features captivating branch-line passenger services<br><br>The Baltimore &amp; Ohio Kingwood Branch route features a superb selection of locomotives, freight, and passenger equipment authentic to the 1960s-operating period. The locomotive is the versatile Electro-Motive GP9 in both B&amp;O\u2019s original livery and 1960s-era \u201cCapitol\u201d scheme. A traditional heavyweight 65-foot coach in B&amp;O livery provides passenger service, and the route provides an extraordinary variety of freight equipment, including B&amp;O class I-5, I-5D, and I-12 cabooses; 36-, 40-, and 50-foot boxcars in multiple liveries (including B&amp;O, Chesapeake &amp; Ohio, and Western Maryland); a B&amp;O flatcar; B&amp;O 52- and 65-foot gondolas; 55-ton and 70-ton coal hoppers in multiple variations and liveries; a tank car, B&amp;O Airslide covered hopper; and wood- and steel refrigerator cars! <br><br>The Baltimore &amp; Ohio Kingwood Branch will put you right to work with 13 highly authentic and challenging career scenarios that include freight, switching, and passenger duties as well as training runs on this rugged line.
