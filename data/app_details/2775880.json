{"about_the_game":"When using a sniper rifle, you eliminate enemies at long distances, although sometimes you have to fight at close range, then you can use a short weapon.<br />\r\nThe action takes place in an open world, in a desert area filled with numerous buildings that the player can use to hide or attack.<br />\r\nThe game consists of 15 missions in which the player's task is to eliminate a specific person or several depending on the mission.<br />\r\nCompleted missions can be repeated in any order.<br />\r\nThe target is also a moving car or a building that needs to be blown up.<br />\r\nThe notebook contains maps, mission description, information on how to find the target, and a calculator that helps you properly set the telescope, taking into account the distance to the target, wind strength and direction.<br />\r\nIn the game, we look from a third-person view from behind. The view changes to first-person FPS when we observe the area through a building window or through a telescope.<br />\r\nLooking through the telescope, we can turn on the image from the camera tracking the bullet's flight in real time, which is useful at long distances when the bullet's flight lasts several seconds and the target is less visible.<br />\r\nThe bullet's flight is reproduced in accordance with reality, taking into account gravity, side wind and decreasing speed with distance.<br />\r\nIt happens that shots are fired at a distance of over 2 km, the game area is approximately 3x3 km, it is a desert with four built-up districts.<br />\r\nGenerally, our opponent is a group of bandits who want to take control of the newly created city, the player's task is to eliminate them from the occupied area.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2775880/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1711131900","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2775880/page.bg.jpg?t=1711131900","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2775880/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1711131900","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2775880/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1711131900","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Killing with a firearm"},"detailed_description":"When using a sniper rifle, you eliminate enemies at long distances, although sometimes you have to fight at close range, then you can use a short weapon.<br />\r\nThe action takes place in an open world, in a desert area filled with numerous buildings that the player can use to hide or attack.<br />\r\nThe game consists of 15 missions in which the player's task is to eliminate a specific person or several depending on the mission.<br />\r\nCompleted missions can be repeated in any order.<br />\r\nThe target is also a moving car or a building that needs to be blown up.<br />\r\nThe notebook contains maps, mission description, information on how to find the target, and a calculator that helps you properly set the telescope, taking into account the distance to the target, wind strength and direction.<br />\r\nIn the game, we look from a third-person view from behind.
