{"about_the_game":"About Hearthkeeper Demo<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHeartheeper is the story of a small group of beings attempting to survive the cruel fates of a fantastical world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Survival -<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHearthkeeper is essentially a colony survival game, where your characters require food and water, shelter from extreme temperatures and to not get stabbed or eaten. Food can be grown by sowing fields or harvesting wild fruits and vegetables, hunting the various game animals that roam about the place, or fishing. Most foods are perishable though, so they will rot if not stored at the right temperature or in some other way preserved. Water comes from rain, which varies in frequency and intensity depending on where you are in the world (Deserts - no rain, Jungle - lots of rain), and water also flows into the world from natural springs. Temperature fluctuates from day to night and also increases as the year approaches summer and decreases into winter. Depending on where you are in the world, temperature can be little more than a nuisance or it can be quite deadly. Characters can wear clothing to improve their ability to survive in extreme conditions, and rooms can be heated using a variety of temperature influencing objects, like the Hearth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Game Controls -<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHearthkeeper is both a management/base builder game, where the player (you) can lay out plans of what work they would like to see done and then sit back, put their feet up and watch their team of simpletons go at it, but it's also a platformer, as the player has the option of directly controlling one of their characters, which is useful when you want to explore and also during some battles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Battles -<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf only life was as simple as growing enough turnips, storing enough water and collecting enough fuel, right? But sadly, as we all know from experience, inevitably you are going to have to fend off a bat at some point, or perhaps a wolf, or a skeleton, and when that day comes, you'd better hope you prepared. &quot;But how?&quot;, i hear you think. Well, by getting your hands on a weapon, by making protective clothing, by learning some sort of skill that helps somehow, maybe having a healer in your group will help, at least less of your characters will end up with brain damage. Other things you can do include building defensive structures like palisade walls and even just digging a massive hole, that's got to help right? I mean, it's a 2-D world!","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2620270?t=1712995784","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2620270?t=1712995784","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2620270/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1712995784","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2620270/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1712995784","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"About Hearthkeeper Demo<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHeartheeper is the story of a small group of beings attempting to survive the cruel fates of a fantastical world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Survival -<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHearthkeeper is essentially a colony survival game, where your characters require food and water, shelter from extreme temperatures and to not get stabbed or eaten.
