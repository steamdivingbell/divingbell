{"about_the_game":"In the great city of Serenus, there stands an ancient ludus, where brave gladiators train and prepare for battle. You have been chosen as the guardian of this ludus, responsible for managing the training, equipping, strategizing, and buying armor and weapons of each fighter. Your goal is to create the ultimate gladiator, who will bring glory to Serenus in the arena. <br>You will use all your skills to ensure your gladiators are the best they can be. You will train them in combat techniques, forge armor and weapons, scout for new recruits, and manage the performance of your gladiators in the arena. You will also need to periodically visit the market to buy armor and weapons, hire workers, recruit new gladiators, and keep the ludus well-maintained. <br>As you progress further into the game, you will be able to unlock special abilities and upgrade your gladiators. You will also be able to fight against other gladiators as the player character. With every win, you will gain prestige and rewards that you can use to improve your gladiators further. You will take on harder and tougher opponents while also competing against other ludus owners in tournaments. <br>With a careful balance of strategy and management, you will eventually become the master of a powerful gladiator team that will surge through the Serenus arenas and bring glory to your ludus. The fate of the great city of Serenus lies in your hands!<br><br>CRIXUS is a single-player hack-and-slash game AND Ludus manager with base-building elements.<br>This game bears the name of Crixus, a Gallic gladiator and military leader, but it is not about his life.
