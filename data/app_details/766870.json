The .22LR\u2019s low recoil and superb design makes this rifle a perfect starting point for people learning the basics of shooting.<br><br><strong>Small Game Hunting: </strong><br>In addition to it\u2019s low recoil, this semi-automatic rifle allows you to fire multiple small rounds, making it a great choice for rabbit hunting and target practice. Perfect for Jackrabbits and other small game, the Virant is not used to hunt larger animals. <br><br><strong>Sight Compatibility:</strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/766870/extras/virant_sights.png?t=1732105156\" /><br>By default you can use the Virant\u2019s iron sight: However, for improved aiming at a distance this rifle supports multiple scope attachments: Red Dot Sight, 1-4x24mm Rifle Scope, 4-8x42mm Rifle Scope, and 8-16x50mm Rifle Scope.<br><br><strong>Klasika and Express: </strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/766870/extras/virant_variations.png?t=1732105156\" /><br>The Virant .22LR Semi-Automatic Rifle comes in two different different color variations: Klasika and Express.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Crosspoint CB-165:</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/766870/extras/crosspoint_model.png?t=1732105156\" /><br>With 165 foot-pounds of draw weight, this precision-crafted crossbow sports enough power to take down even the largest game animals. With a beautiful woven carbon fiber barrel, a built-in rope-cocking device, and a 4-arrow quiver, the Crosspoint CB-165 is ideal for short-range hunting.<br><br><strong>Hawken 1-5X30 Crossbow Scope:</strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/766870/extras/crosspoint_sights.png?t=1732105156\" /><br>This premium scope is designed for crossbows shooting 300 feet per second or faster. With three duplex crosshairs and variable zoom settings up to 5x, this is the perfect crossbow scope for any situation.<br><br><strong>Range and Power:</strong><br>The Crosspoint CB-165 Crossbow is more powerful and offers greater range than any other bow currently in the store. However, as with everything in hunting, it\u2019s a trade-off. This crossbow is rather large and heavy, requiring significant space in your backpack. Additionally, reloading the crossbow is slower than most other weapons so make sure you make each shot count!<br><br><strong>Classic, Arctic, Dark Star &amp; Warden: </strong> <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/766870/extras/crosspoint_variations.png?t=1732105156\" /><br>The Crosspoint CB-165 comes in four different different color variations; Classic, Arctic, Dark Star and Warden.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Houyi Recurve Bow:</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/766870/extras/recurve_model.png?t=1732105156\" /><br>In Chinese mythology, when 10 suns rose from Earth and turned the world into a barren wasteland, the archer Houy shot down 9 of the 10 suns, leaving only the last one. This bow takes its name from that myth. Based on the designs of traditional Chinese Qing recurve bows, the Houyi Recurve Bow has ample penetration power and can take down medium game at short ranges.<br><br><strong>Spook fewer animals in your surroundings:</strong><br>This recurve bow gives you an unparalleled advantage compared to rifles, handguns, shotguns or even crossbows. When taking a shot, the longbow is much quieter and will spook a smaller number of animals within a limited radius. But as always, this  is a trade-off; although the longbow is currently the quietest weapon in the game, it offers limited range compared to many other weapons. <br><br><strong>Hidden Dragon, Moonlight, Snakeskin and Default: </strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/766870/extras/recurve_variations.png?t=1732105156\" /><br>The Houyi Recurve Bow comes in four different different color variations: Default, Hidden Dragon, Moonlight and Snakeskin.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/766870/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732105156","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/766870/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1732105156","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/766870/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732105156","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/766870/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732105156","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/766870/extras/Weapons_description.png?t=1732105156\" /><br>The wardens Connie, Doc and Alena have received a shipment with brand new weapons -  the Virant .22LR Semi-Automatic Rifle, the Crosspoint CB-165 and the Houyi Recurve Bow.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Virant .22LR Semi-Automatic Rifle:</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/766870/extras/virant_model.png?t=1732105156\" /><br>Developed by Slovenian gunsmiths, the Virant is the go-to rifle for varmint control and target shooting.
