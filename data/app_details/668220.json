{"about_the_game":"Breadwinner is best described as an arcade wave sorter. You read that right - loaves of bread will pass you by on conveyor belts, and it is up to you to put them in the correct spot. It sounds simple, until you realize that the bread is coming from <i>multiple directions</i> at a <i>ridiculous pace</i>. If you want to keep up, you're gonna have to do your best - and even that may not be enough! <br><br>At its core, Breadwinner is an arcade game that takes a simple idea - in this case, sorting bread - and cranks it up to 11. Just sorting it isn't enough? How about if the bread is <strong>shot out of a freaking cannon</strong>? Or if you have to precisely throw the bread into a bin 15 feet away? Or if time moves only when you do?
