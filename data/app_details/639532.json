Under these conditions, the Thunder turret provided some assurance that the new tanks would be able to survive. The Thunder turret can be used to strike a group of enemies at once using explosive shells. The quick recharge rate ensures that you will achieve a quick and decisive victory.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Viking</h2>This hull was created during a war that was reaching a stalemate. A tank was needed that could break through the stagnating situation on the front, where winning tactics were needed. This hull is the &quot;universal tactical unit&quot;,  representing the second generation of &quot;X&quot; Tanks. It is tool that can be used to successfully achieve all tasks on the battlefield. For a long time the Viking formed the basis for bonds between elite professional tank operators.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Note!</h2>You can purchase only 1 Pack per 1 Tanki X account. Refund is not available if you purchase 2 different packs, which include the same weapons, hulls, and skins or you already have the items from the pack!
