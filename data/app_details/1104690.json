{"about_the_game":"Hard to be a King ( Realm Guardian ) is a voxel strategy game.<br>You will play a role in a fantasy world and become a lord, rule the land, and protect your people. Assign tasks to everyone. Gathering, hunting, farming, keep your people stay away from starving. Crafting, constructing, build a stronghold to resist the dead army.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Terrain</h2>The terrain of Realm Guardian is voxel based. One kind of cube correspond to one kind of resource. You can DIG a cube to collect its resource ( miner ), or consume resource to BUILD a new cube ( builder ).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Environment</h2>Deer will eat plants when they are hungry. If there are no plants to eat, they will starve and die. So do wolves. As the bottom of the food chain, Plants will keep growing in a slow rate. Of course if men kill all the wolves and protect deer, all the plants would be ate, and deer finally die for starving. Besides, water is another problem. Wolves from different packs may fight for the only water source. ( Don't worry, human beings won't fell thirsty because the author didn't finish this function :P ). Just like the true nature, sun raise up and fall down every day ( Seasons are in planning ). Deer are more active in daytime.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The King</h2>The king won't do most of works. All he has to do are rebalancing resources, assigning works ect. The King can talk to one to assign task for him. Of course it will break their current work ( The author feel unhappy when he worked in a game company, he interrupted by designers very often )<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Realm</h2>Flag banner to claim regin. Flag more banners to enlarge the realm. Most of works ( e.g. mining, building ) can only do in realm. Banners would also support population limit.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Peasants</h2>Peasants would sleep when they are sleepy ( If free bed exists ). Peasant who lack of sleep will get low work efficiency.
