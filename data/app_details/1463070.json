Although most of the cat army is made up of unqualified grunts clinging to the impossible dream of obtaining a full-time job with benefits, there are also some skilled and bloodthirsty fighters among their ranks who will stop at nothing to fulfill their duty. However, these cats aren't the only ones with a bachelor's degree in kicking butt - the local resistance continues to stand in the way of the army's plans for world domination.  Team up with a cast of unusual characters who make up the resistance and help them take down the cats once and for all - but don't forget about your own story and goals along the way.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Hidden power","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1463070/6fb2fb51e29b2da2b481daa12f6b8542f169bc58.jpg"},{"name":"Chatty mouth","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1463070/5037c7774b7271a12caf1331929becb67c2ebc36.jpg"},{"name":"Smells like burnt here","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1463070/7373a63d18cfe06cc048f623d153b6c7c68fa4d0.jpg"},{"name":"Where am I?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1463070/bc3a491e815d1cd7f34329869fe1267ec540a304.jpg"},{"name":"Not even a scratch","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1463070/2b6d69da4cf942f80539b47a15c705fce704bafb.jpg"}],"total":5},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463070/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1633056691","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463070/page.bg.jpg?t=1633056691","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463070/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1633056691","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463070/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1633056691","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463070/extras/DumDumDinos-logo-small.png?t=1633056691\" /><br>Follow the wacky adventures of Tyson, Carol, and Edwina, three dinosaur friends who somehow crash-land on strange world and encounter an evil cat army that wants to capture them and take over the land. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463070/extras/DumDumDinos_features.png?t=1633056691\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Enlist quirky characters with unique abilities to join your team and help you take down the cats.<br></li><li>Command your team in battle while managing multiple battlefields simultaneously.<br></li><li>Realize your spiritual potential by unlocking game-changing powers.<br></li><li>Scout out the mysterious land and make choices that impact the story and gameplay.<br></li><li>Learn more about the local conflict and get to know each member of your ragtag team of misfits.</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463070/extras/DumDumDinos_theworld.png?t=1633056691\" /><br>Dum Dum Dinos is set in Mogelis, a fictional world occupied by an opposing and semi-competent cat army.
