{"about_the_game":"Electron Flux is a Rogue-Lite tower defense game that challenges players to make strategic, adaptive decisions  about how they focus research, place towers, manage resources, and adapt their strategy on each play-through to rebuff the advances of waves of enemies from destroying their circuit! Each play-through features procedurally generated towers for the player to place with different shot patterns, range, damage, and abilities! Players choose which towers to research and upgrade during each play-through, decisions which could mean the difference between passing your class, or turning in a smoldering husk for your final project! Place your towers strategically on your circuit board, because procedurally generated waves of bugs have come to destroy your hard work!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll towers and enemies are rendered in hand-crafted, isometric, vaporwave pixel-art style! The towers and enemies also emit detailed video effects from particles being blown off of them to arcs of chain lightning! Blast and relax to Electron Flux\u2019s midi-inspired original score and handcrafted sound effects!","achievements":{"total":0},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2143660/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1704863461","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2143660/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1704863461","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2143660/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1704863461","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2143660/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1704863461","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Electron Flux is a Rogue-Lite tower defense game that challenges players to make strategic, adaptive decisions  about how they focus research, place towers, manage resources, and adapt their strategy on each play-through to rebuff the advances of waves of enemies from destroying their circuit!
