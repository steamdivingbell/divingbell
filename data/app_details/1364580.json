{"about_the_game":"Nyanroo is a new platform game that pays homage to the 16-bit era.<br>Chosen by a magic cloth you must face a gang of evil dogs trying to conquer the world. <br>Gather different abilities with the help of the Power Yarns scattered through the world to slash and pounce your way through 14 stages and 7 amazing bosses.<br><br><br><strong>STORY</strong><br><br>A long time ago, the world was consumed by evil. To put an end to that, the gods themselves created a living magic cloth designed to give power to the one who wears it, the cloth searched for a warrior with a good heart, and with him they banished evil. With time... the legends gave birth to what we call today as superheroes! <br><br>But this story starts when the supervillain Iron Face and his pet dog Barkrow are about to defeat the current hero, Tornado Ted.  <br><br>Seeing his imminent defeat Ted decides to sacrifice himself in order to defeat Iron Face.<br>Barkrow survives the attack, and swears revenge! Meanwhile, the living cloth chooses Nyanroo as the new hero! <br><br>Now, as Barkrow gathers together the most powerful dogs to aid him,  Nyanroo must fight back and stop them from taking over the world!<br><br><strong>MUSIC</strong><br><br>The soundtrack to Nyanroo was composed by The Super Marcato Bros. They are the brotherly duo of Karl &amp; Will Brueggemann. The sound of Nyanroo was inspired by many beloved, groovy Genesis-era soundtracks, with some fresh elements mixed in as well.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1364580/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1702723439","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1364580/page.bg.jpg?t=1702723439","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1364580/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1702723439","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1364580/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1702723439","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":1366620,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Nyanroo is a new platform game that pays homage to the 16-bit era.<br>Chosen by a magic cloth you must face a gang of evil dogs trying to conquer the world. <br>Gather different abilities with the help of the Power Yarns scattered through the world to slash and pounce your way through 14 stages and 7 amazing bosses.<br><br><br><strong>STORY</strong><br><br>A long time ago, the world was consumed by evil.
