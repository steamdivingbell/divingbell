{"about_the_game":"Take on the role of the American Colonists, and fight for territorial control over North America. A gripping real-time campaign awaits you on a detailed 3d map where you can build your army and navy, construct military infrastructure, and fully command your armies on a regimental level. If you want even more action you can fully zoom-in and fight massive battles on a battalion level.<br><br>Fight in real-time on the global map with regiments and naval squadrons. Move your General to gain tactical control of the situation in a minimal way. The presence of the General makes it possible to control the troops or ships directly on the map, actively use maneuvers, cut supply routes, utilize different types of terrain, and flank with cavalry. The battles can be fought with more detail and full tactical control by zooming-in further on the map.<br><br><strong>MASSIVE BATTLES</strong><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1901910/extras/massive.png?t=1734702004\" /><br>If you choose to fight battles with full tactical control, the regiments become divided into smaller battalions allowing you the command of hundreds of units in real-time, creating a dazzling and realistic combat experience of the historical period.
