{"about_the_game":"<strong>\u2022 It was but a myth...</strong><br><br>There was once a myth of mysterious vanishings. Travelers, citizens, soldiers, anybody. They would disappear for days, only to return maddened, telling eerie tales of a terrifying place where everything was made of steel. A place so vast, the mere sight of it could drive a person insane. These people would keep vanishing and reappearing, ever more demented, gaining powers that defied reality, up until they disappeared permanently, never to be seen again.<br><br>Was it another dimension? A flaw in the fabric of space-time? The mind of a god?<br><br>It was but a myth, until it happened to you... Will you be able to escape the Temple of Steel?<br><br><br><strong>\u2022 Clinging to your last bit of sanity...</strong><br><br>The Temple of Steel's gameplay is inspired of timeless classics in the horror game genre. It is a first person horror survival game where you must find your way out of a nightmare while evading your enemies at all costs, as you cannot fight them back.<br><br>The game offers an alternative to a health bar: the sanity bar. As you become exposed to the Temple of Steel and its aberrations, your sanity will keep dropping until you succumb to insanity, effectively dying. In order to avoid this, you must find ways to recover your mental health, which the game will guide you through early on. However, you may also need to lose some of your sanity in order to progress through certain areas... <br><br><br><strong>\u2022 Choices matter...</strong><br><br>You are Ayaz Ak\u00e7ai, a warlord who has just barely survived a war. Suffering from a deep need for revenge, from the pain inflicted upon you in the past, you are not only struggling with this cosmic abomination, but also your very own demons. In this game, the choices you make will alter the outcome of the story. Will you be able to turn your life around?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2233970/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1670856843","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2233970/page.bg.jpg?t=1670856843","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2233970/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1670856843","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2233970/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1670856843","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>\u2022 It was but a myth...</strong><br><br>There was once a myth of mysterious vanishings.
