{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1958120/extras/railwalkers_580x60.png?t=1652841665\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Back Story</h2><br>Set in the not so distant future, you have been tasked with protecting a secret government mining operation. Its deep-earth drilling has disturbed previously unknown families of intelligent insects. Threatened by your machinery being too close to their nests, swarms of these insects are fixated on destroying your infrastructure.<br><br>Historically, effective control of these swarms has only been possible with the use of Rail Walkers. These semi-autonomous turret based weapons contain sophisticated electronics enabling them to intelligently target and destroy thousands of attack insects.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2><br>The single objective is to protect your Base and infrastructure from the insects by using Rail Walker technology.<br><br>You will start with a single Type 1 Level 1 Rail Walker positioned on a small length of rail-track in the middle of your mining area. This track will need to be extended, allowing your Rail Walker to reach further into other areas of your operation. By using switching tracks your Rail Walker can easily be moved from location to location.<br><br>Rail Walkers are controlled manually via the Remote Operations Hub. You will issue commands to the Rail Walker to stop, start, recharge, patrol, reload and so on. You will also operate the rail switching tracks, changing the path your Rail Walker will follow.<br><br>The insects attack in waves, with each wave most likely being more difficult than the previous. Defeating these wave attacks will earn you funding to upgrade your Rail Walker or to even purchase more Rail Walkers. Each upgrade brings faster movement, increased battery life, better firepower and so on.<br><br>Rail Walkers is somewhat relaxed in that wave attacks don't begin until you initiate them, and only when you're good and ready. This means you have plenty of time to devise your strategy with regard to rail layout, Rail Walker deployment and Rail Walker positioning. Once a wave begins though the atmosphere becomes..er...a little less relaxed...<br><br>Construct your rail-tracks thoughtfully and apply strategy and care when deploying your Rail Walkers...good luck with your struggles...<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1958120/extras/keyfeatures_580x60.png?t=1652841665\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Rail construction with track pieces including straights, curves and switching rails<br></li><li>Remote rail-mounted turret control including commands to move, stop, reverse, patrol, repair, reload, recharge, upgrade and return to Base<br></li><li>8 different Rail Walker types<br></li><li>4 upgradable chassis types for each Rail Walker<br></li><li>4 upgradable motor types for each Rail Walker<br></li><li>40 swarm waves to conquer<br></li><li>10 different insect swarm types and behaviours<br></li><li>8 pieces of infrastructure to strategically protect<br></li><li>Invest funds from &quot;scrap organic matter&quot; into faster more sophisticated Rail Walkers<br></li><li>Central control of all Rail Walker functions via the Remote Operations Hub<br></li><li>Rail path and switching preview to assist with Rail Walker directions<br></li><li>Automatic range and targeting sensors<br></li><li>Automatic collision detection and emergency braking on the rail network<br></li><li>Steam Achievements (37) to track your progress and cleverness</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1958120/extras/operationshub_580x60.png?t=1652841665\" /><br><br>Management and control of your Rail Walkers is performed via the Remote Operations Hub.
