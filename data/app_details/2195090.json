{"about_the_game":"You arrive for your first day of work at Cuppy\u2019s! A new ice cream parlor that seemed to have popped up overnight. You work the closing shift, so you will be serving the last few customers as the day winds down and also completing any closing shift tasks before clocking out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou will be able to meet all kinds of great characters as they come by for that sweet, sweet treat that only Cuppy\u2019s Ice Cream can meet! They will be able to choose their favorite flavor, toppings, and what it all goes in, and it\u2019s up to you to scoop it up with a smile!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOut of supplies? No worries! Check the back of Cuppy\u2019s for extra ice cream, cones, strawberries, and more! Some items can just be placed back on the display tray, while others need a little preparation (Hey! Those fruits aren\u2019t going to chop themselves!). The main display table can only hold so much, however, so you will have to keep track of when you start running low.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the one employee for this shift, you will be responsible for serving all the customers this evening at this simple, almost crude looking ice cream parlor on this dark, isolated road. You will primarily be walking around, serving customers, chopping fruits, restocking your inventory, and helping out a customer or two with some problems they may have.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, as the days go by, you start to notice something is\u2026 a little off with this particular ice cream parlor. Strange occurrences have been\u2026 occurring\u2026 more and more frequently ever since Cuppy\u2019s arrived. Things start to glitch in and out of existence. What mysteries lie beneath this otherwise pleasant looking ice cream parlor?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is currently single-player and has a low-res aesthetic. Everyone loves ice cream!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2195090/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1669840144","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2195090/page.bg.jpg?t=1669840144","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2195090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1669840144","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2195090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1669840144","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You arrive for your first day of work at Cuppy\u2019s!
