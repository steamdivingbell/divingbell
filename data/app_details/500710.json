This game should be renamed as Wild Bears Online.\u201d<br>105 Hours Played \u2013 SuperFeeder (user review)<br><br>\u201cThere is nothing more fulfilling than watching your character grow, your knowledge increase and even more importanly watching your small piece of land develop into a massive holding complete with Castle. Yes...you will eventually be able to build your own Castle.\u201d<br>835 Hours Played \u2013 Vanyel (user review)<br><br>\u201cI haven't seen such a detailed crafting system. To make leather armor you need to do so many steps like drying a raw hide on a drying rack, soaking it in water, soak it again with lime liquor to make it supple, to get the lime liquor you need to melt limestone in a kiln/forge then craft the lime with clay and water, take the supple hide and use a bird dropping liquor or animal brains liquor to make it a soft supple hide, use tanning liquor and finally get a leather piece then you can make into leather stripes to use for leather armor. As you can see that is going to take a lot of harvesting of resources alone and then the depth to each thing is incredible, and that was only one example, making bronze ingots and stuff is also just as immersive.\u201d<br>132 Hours Played \u2013 Artychoke (user review)<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/500710/ss_527882df388dbc74a175290b4c30b88f6a2d46ee.1920x1080.jpg?t=1726738739","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/500710/ss_527882df388dbc74a175290b4c30b88f6a2d46ee.600x338.jpg?t=1726738739"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/500710/ss_d9a72a87480f4faf1f62f4bb7a567f39599487c7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1726738739","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/500710/ss_d9a72a87480f4faf1f62f4bb7a567f39599487c7.600x338.jpg?t=1726738739"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/500710/ss_71163d046cf3a7864a075a887716ef2277692280.1920x1080.jpg?t=1726738739","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/500710/ss_71163d046cf3a7864a075a887716ef2277692280.600x338.jpg?t=1726738739"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/500710/ss_24ee677886e2b6d7f4026a965203ef2326132b73.1920x1080.jpg?t=1726738739","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/500710/ss_24ee677886e2b6d7f4026a965203ef2326132b73.600x338.jpg?t=1726738739"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/500710/ss_795bb0d75bafc31f6ea72ee6df5195f2c659ea09.1920x1080.jpg?t=1726738739","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/500710/ss_795bb0d75bafc31f6ea72ee6df5195f2c659ea09.600x338.jpg?t=1726738739"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/500710/ss_8a27af7d3c025b7579405d6f25ee2338512e1d5b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1726738739","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/500710/ss_8a27af7d3c025b7579405d6f25ee2338512e1d5b.600x338.jpg?t=1726738739"}],"short_description":"Wild Terra Online is a sandbox RPG, in a completely player-controlled medieval world.
