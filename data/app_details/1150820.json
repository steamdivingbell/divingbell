{"about_the_game":"Delphyq is a real-time tactics game, one that puts you in the role of a mastermind in command of an elite group of combatants known as the Operatives. Every move, every decision, every action, and reaction you make will influence and decide the outcome of each encounter you will face along the way. <br><br>One thing that separates Delphyq from the rest of the strategy and tactics crowd is the way it simulates real combat. Delphyq is not a turn-based game; despite it having a pause mechanic, combat is still handled in real-time. The game\u2019s waypoints, look direction and dynamic cover systems open doors for intense, strategic, and memorable encounters. Advanced functions such as <i>GoCodes</i> and Operative skills provide access to deeper tactical maneuvers to deal with the game\u2019s extremely intelligent utility-based AI enemies. <br><br>Each AI unit functions in conjunction with its environment; depending on the situation, it will also try to coordinate with other AI in the field and will attempt to flank the Operatives and/or engage them through the use of cover.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1150820/extras/01.gif?t=1679886007\" /><br><br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1150820/extras/Headers_keyfeatures_0925.png?t=1679886007\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>REAL TACTICS IN REAL TIME:</strong> In Delphyq, combat does not happen in turns.
