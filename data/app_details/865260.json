{"about_the_game":"<strong>Get in touch with the yet unknown parts of Rashytil! So far you've only heard about Minwe and Armelisse, but now you can get into a proper fight with them and... tell them off in a nasty letter. </strong><br><br>Paragons and Pajamas brings two new factions to the diplomatic table. That means two new playable heroes (well, three in fact...), new personal bonds, and more voice acting! <br><br>Quinn is a royal bodyguard form Armelisse and she's not afraid to bring the pain on her enemies. As a melee specialist, she can not only dish out terrible damage but also withstand blows that would make a lesser warrior yield. <br><br>Yusuf, however, is possessed by an evil djinn - which is a perfectly ordinary thing, so please don't stare.
