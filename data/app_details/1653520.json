Whether you're seeking exploration, a speed-run, or a low-item challenge, Project Delta will adapt, offering an authentic and personalized Metroidvania experience. Retaining the classic's foundational elements, we've forged a unique path, creating a captivating, replayable, and modern Metroidvania experience. Venture into Project Delta's dynamic universe, a reverent nod to the past, an exciting adventure in the present.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Regarding Keyboard Support</h2>It is not recommend playing on keyboard. There are some aspects which are kind of nice, but controlling is very clunky. If you are going to play on keyboard it is recommended going into the control options (pause &gt; options &gt; control options) and setting Run and Sanguki Blast to toggle. This will make using those mechanics easier on keyboard.<br><br><br>Please note as well.
