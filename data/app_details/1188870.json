{"about_the_game":"Earthbreakers is a team-based PvP multiplayer game which combines the most enjoyable elements of FPS and RTS! You and your team battle for territory and harvest rare resources, while building and customizing your team\u2019s base. Choose an infantry combat class, defend your base and supply lines, construct and pilot powerful military vehicles, and ultimately annihilate the enemy's HQ!<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1188870/extras/Earthbreakers_BuildYourBaseHeader.jpg?t=1649993526\" /><br><br>Earthbreakers uses a team purchase system to build an RTS-style base. Each building unlocks new infantry classes, vehicles or upgrades depending on the structure built. Do you build a factory to unlock new, more powerful vehicles, or do you build walls to aid in base defense? The choice is yours! Bases consist of six primary buildings, wall defenses and a selection of defensive turrets.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1188870/extras/Earthbreakers_GatherYourResources.jpg?t=1649993526\" /><br><br>The resource, Vilothyte, is the lifeblood of a base; you use it to purchase new structures, higher ranking infantry classes and vehicles. Resources are collected by a harvester and returned to a refinery. Protect those harvesters to ensure success!<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1188870/extras/Earthbreakers_ChooseYourWeapons.jpg?t=1649993526\" /><br><br>The world of Earthbreakers is a harsh place that requires guts\u2026and a big gun! Multiple infantry classes are available, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Higher ranking classes must be (just like an RTS) unlocked by building one or more structures. Play as a Soldier to fight on the front lines! Play as a Technician to repair vehicles and keep your fellow teammates alive! Or play as a Firefly to burn enemies from a distance!<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1188870/extras/Earthbreakers_DriveInStyle02.jpg?t=1649993526\" /><br><br>A good soldier can be even better when driving a tank. Multiple vehicles add the firepower needed to destroy base structures. Drive the Pulse Tank to destroy enemy harvesters and turrets! Use the Atlas APC to get your troops to the battlefield unscathed. Or pilot the Tiamat Artillery system and lay waste from a distance!<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1188870/extras/Earthbreakers_WelcomeToEarth01.jpg?t=1649993526\" /><br><br>Earthbreakers race to collect Vilothyte wherever it is exposed!
