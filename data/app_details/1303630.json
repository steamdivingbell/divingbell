{"about_the_game":"Rachael Savage is a game about hunting down various killers in search of mystical medallions. These medallions help open up a gate to find the Infinkey, which gives a user whatever they desire. But it won't be easy, as there's always bad guys on the loose! You're also searching for Sadrix, who has the final medallion and is after the Infinikey. What will he wish for if he gets to it first?<br><br>This game is an action platformer where you play as a bounty hunter named Rachael. She can turn invisible and sneak past enemies, or even use it to her advantage to take them out without them even knowing. She wields a sword to slash through the bad guys and also finds other items along the way. She's free to explore the town and talk to the people there, taking bounties along the way in the form of sidequests.
