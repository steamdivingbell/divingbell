Is about your own survival.  Is about the choices you make. Is about how you live!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are no random encounters or mind breaking puzzles. Having good reflexes and playing it smart(along with a bit of luck) is your only way of surviving.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame has 5 different endings.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGAME PLAY: You have to travel from place to place avoiding different kind of creatures. You are a normal human, not suited to fight against the hordes of evil roaming everywhere. Your only chance is to avoid them. Run fast and outsmart them. Who knows, maybe you can even save some lives in the process. If you care about it of course. The choice is yours. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRemember: It just takes a mistake and a second to die...","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/696050/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1504032906","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/696050/page.bg.jpg?t=1504032906","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/696050/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1504032906","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/696050/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1504032906","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Eternal Night has arrived.
