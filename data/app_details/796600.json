{"about_the_game":"In a world where over fishing, coral bleaching and walls have stripped the world's oceans of 99% of marine life, one lone fish makes it his sole mission to swim through the spike ball and wall infested waters to attempt to find another fish to breed with to keep his population going. In 'DON'T touch the walls', you play as this fish, swimming left and right, dodging terrifying obstacles. But what's that in the distance? Danger lurks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpectacular graphics. Addictive gameplay. No music. One sound effect. A game truly made for this platform.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Scammed","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/796600/7ad1246a8f27f8e9d96861f8e42b6005596f148c.jpg"},{"name":"Respectful","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/796600/92c6a1aec0129d75f9dbaa059a67664b23a9369f.jpg"},{"name":"xD","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/796600/58ea1c835ef41feec866de2c1ff588aa4188ec96.jpg"},{"name":"The Next Step In Human Evolution","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/796600/8fe7865d7e35b87cc879100abd4465943d8469f2.jpg"},{"name":"Get A Life, Kid","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/796600/61181878605f1ae36b35cfe62cb4c94b6658a535.jpg"},{"name":"Really?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/796600/7cd5c8ee53e5594ac263d2c6507da6e813a926f2.jpg"},{"name":"Understandable","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/796600/115e1631a0d708989ccba56a249eb647475fecaf.jpg"},{"name":"Come Back motboy8","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/796600/ca87e9ffde71c220a54d3788dcd6ab3713baf2eb.jpg"}],"total":8},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/796600?t=1519674074","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/796600?t=1519674074","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/796600/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1519674074","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/796600/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1519674074","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In a world where over fishing, coral bleaching and walls have stripped the world's oceans of 99% of marine life, one lone fish makes it his sole mission to swim through the spike ball and wall infested waters to attempt to find another fish to breed with to keep his population going.
