{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Overview:</h2>In &quot;Planet Valley&quot;, you are thrust into an unknown and challenging world, an alien planet that is anything but welcoming. Here, each day is a struggle for survival, each decision is critical, and each resource is precious.<br><br><br>You command a colony of astronauts, each depending on your leadership to survive and thrive in this hostile environment. The planet is a grid enigma, each grid a parcel of raw land, rich in resources and possibilities. But exploration and expansion come at a cost. Energy is limited and only renews with each day's dawn. Every action, whether collecting carbon from a forest or building a new structure, consumes this precious energy. How will you spend it? Which tasks are a priority and which can wait? These are the decisions you must make as the colony's leader.<br><br><br>But resource gathering and structure building are only half the challenge. This planet is not uninhabited. With each cycle of days, hordes of aliens attack your colony. You need to build defenses, position towers, and organize troops to protect your base. Defeat is not an option. Each victory not only ensures the survival of your colony but also provides valuable science, allowing you to evolve your buildings and further strengthen your colony.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Design:</h2><br>&quot;Planet Valley&quot; is a strategy game that puts the focus on decision-making and planning. The minimalist design serves to highlight the game's complexity, where each grid can be the difference between prosperity and disaster. Each day, you are challenged to expand your colony, optimize resource production, and strengthen your defenses, all while managing a limited amount of energy.<br><br><br>But the colony has its own challenges and dangers. The creatures that inhabit this planet are not mere obstacles, but mysterious and unpredictable adversaries. They attack in hordes, each requiring a specific strategy and a specific structure to be defeated. And among them lurks a leader, an even greater threat that attacks when least expected. Each encounter with this leader is a test of your strategic skills and your ability to adapt and overcome.<br><br>The design of &quot;Planet Valley&quot; is a delicate balance between construction and defense, between expansion and survival. Every decision you make, every structure you build, every day that passes, shapes the fate of your colony on this hostile planet.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features:</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Intuitive Control:</h2>The game is entirely controlled with mouse clicks, without the need to use other buttons.
