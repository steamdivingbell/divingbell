With its pixel art style, it sets itself apart from other visual novels. With all of these aspects taken into account, I would say it\u2019s more than worth your time.\u201d<br>Game Luster<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s a unique and in many ways innovative game, especially for its genre. It reminds me the the good old days during which almost every PC game was a breath of fresh air, treating us with new gameplay ideas. It successfully plays with its inspirations, its dialogues feel natural and the developer made a great job portraying people with disabilities.\u201d<br>Kocham Gry Otome (Polish)<br><br>\u201c(...) the villagers in Windy Meadow are realistically unremarkable. We\u2019re not overwhelmed with stories about their quirks, difficult past or curses they have to struggle with for generations. There\u2019s a good chance that the majority of them are decent people who spend their lives working, not even for praise or status, but rather because they don\u2019t have another option. The banality of their existence may sometimes be painful, but also makes us sympathetic. We just accept their difficult (and occasionally unpleasant) personalities.\u201d<br>4/5 \u2013 Polygamia<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/875660/ss_88a79a15522b82f672502bd4855b2e96d0592542.1920x1080.jpg?t=1728905753","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/875660/ss_88a79a15522b82f672502bd4855b2e96d0592542.600x338.jpg?t=1728905753"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/875660/ss_6a81eb004b585603f43ecb4679c7772dae8e8495.1920x1080.jpg?t=1728905753","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/875660/ss_6a81eb004b585603f43ecb4679c7772dae8e8495.600x338.jpg?t=1728905753"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/875660/ss_88b88fe3872b2ab39e12b4808ca2e7ff92bcf8ca.1920x1080.jpg?t=1728905753","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/875660/ss_88b88fe3872b2ab39e12b4808ca2e7ff92bcf8ca.600x338.jpg?t=1728905753"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/875660/ss_e270cf3ca08ea9d121a17253e4294f4d800cb87a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1728905753","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/875660/ss_e270cf3ca08ea9d121a17253e4294f4d800cb87a.600x338.jpg?t=1728905753"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/875660/ss_b5bb724844716ba4232c93c76019e649ff06a76c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1728905753","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/875660/ss_b5bb724844716ba4232c93c76019e649ff06a76c.600x338.jpg?t=1728905753"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/875660/ss_897d09e0ad33d2c1820e69f2411ddbd27b71f1b6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1728905753","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/875660/ss_897d09e0ad33d2c1820e69f2411ddbd27b71f1b6.600x338.jpg?t=1728905753"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/875660/ss_2e394f2e35e0141288b50cbea48c046b02b6eb06.1920x1080.jpg?t=1728905753","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/875660/ss_2e394f2e35e0141288b50cbea48c046b02b6eb06.600x338.jpg?t=1728905753"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/875660/ss_674240162d07ac5971a1b8b24b69f5c37a36a8cc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1728905753","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/875660/ss_674240162d07ac5971a1b8b24b69f5c37a36a8cc.600x338.jpg?t=1728905753"},{"id":8,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/875660/ss_20bb95d5c483d3bb76433a113c8338055af6312f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1728905753","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/875660/ss_20bb95d5c483d3bb76433a113c8338055af6312f.600x338.jpg?t=1728905753"},{"id":9,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/875660/ss_e6378c4a395990df56cf1cdc8d31214c031b59cf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1728905753","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/875660/ss_e6378c4a395990df56cf1cdc8d31214c031b59cf.600x338.jpg?t=1728905753"}],"short_description":"A slice-of-life interactive story about choosing your path and living in a community.
