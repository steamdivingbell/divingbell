{"about_the_game":"We here at Ence Gaming present our first of many games we hope to bring to you, so why not kick it back to old school? Using the RPG Maker MV engine we made a turn based single-player roleplaying experience. We decided to use a mixture of stock images and custom imagines to make this game. Each boss was custom created to fit in the dungeons scattered across the in-game world. With the main boss created to have the big bad evil feel to it you find at the end of many major stories. Now as far as the music goes, we made sure almost all the music is custom created to fit each realm perfectly. The game itself features turn based combat as well, and focuses on strategy to get through some of the puzzle like mechanics you will find in the varied dungeons. However, we are not done with Elemental Echoes, and plan on releasing free downloadable content for the near future. Without further ado, please join Tyra, a War-Axe Wielding Spellslinging Half-Elf and her friends in the RPG world you grew up and fell in love with.<br><br><strong>Small description of story.</strong><br><br>Follow the story of Tyra, a War-Axe Wielding Spellslinging Half-Elf and her friends to discover the dark past of magic and the mysterious history of her parents.  <br><br><strong>What to Expect?</strong><br><br>All future DLC will be free for this game and introduce a continuation of the main story as well as introduce new party members for replay-ability of the main story and on.

One thing that we could really use is constructive feedback for our future games. Thus we want to hear what you liked about the story, and what you did not like. We will never find the perfect balance between fighting and story, but we do want to try. Thus we will be taking a small break from Elemental Echoes to allow for our writer to have time in crafting more lore about the world and better DLC. <br><br>With that being said, we do have plans on making Elemental Echoes two in Unity.
