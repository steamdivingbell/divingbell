{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Figgy Puddin' Steals Christmas</h2>  <br>  <br> <strong> From Jeff Stevens Games</strong> <br>  <br> <br> <br> Figgy Puddin' Steals Christmas is a short adventure for three to six characters, and optimized for 2nd level characters. We also include Scaling Suggestions, allowing you to run this adventure for lower- or higher-level characters. We anticipate a run-time of 2- to 4-hours. There's a bit of roleplay in this adventure, which may extend the playtime. <br>  <br> <br> <strong> Adventure Background</strong> <br> <br> A traveling jester known as Figgy Puddin' and her Coal Smudge Gang have stolen Christmas presents and now hold them for ransom. While safe and secure in her lair, she awaits either a payment of an outrageous ransom, or a crew of heroes to claim the presents after they navigate her not-so-festive lair. <br>  <br> <br> <strong> What's the Adventure?</strong> <br> <br> After you introduce the hook, the adventure occurs in Figgy Puddin's lair - a refurbished kobold bunker consisting of eight rooms. As the characters explore the linear dungeon, they encounter new creatures, complete challenges, and are tested about their Christmas knowledge. However, the final confrontation with the naughty Figgy Puddin' could make for a very Unhappy and Unmerry Christmas for our heroes, the children of Thistleton, and their parents. <br>  <br> <br> <strong> Who Is Figgy Puddin'?</strong> <br> <br> Figgy Puddin' was once a happy jester who loved Christmas. For years she traveled the realm, bringing fun and festive cheer to villages and children while preparing the way for Santa. However, times have become tough, and entertainment doesn't always pay as well as one would like. As Figgy prepares for retirement, she's learned she doesn't have enough gold to last. During this time, she's also decided that Santa doesn't know who she is, let alone appreciate the work she puts in every year. <br> Using her savings, extortion, blackmail, and other nefarious means, she's convinced several mechanical geniuses and arcane specialists to help her refurbish her underground bunker with wondrous effects, creatures, and tests. <br> To fund her retirement, she's taken extreme measures to make some quick gold -- holding Christmas presents for ransom. &quot;","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3392270/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733841092","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3392270/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1733841092","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3392270/7be964d7b4f3e464dc791074d0236aabc4afef88/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733841092","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3392270/7be964d7b4f3e464dc791074d0236aabc4afef88/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733841092","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Figgy Puddin' Steals Christmas</h2>  <br>  <br> <strong> From Jeff Stevens Games</strong> <br>  <br> <br> <br> Figgy Puddin' Steals Christmas is a short adventure for three to six characters, and optimized for 2nd level characters.
