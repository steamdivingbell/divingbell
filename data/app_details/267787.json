{"about_the_game":"<i>\u201cThe Nether Realm, where the most terrible beasts of fairy tales and nightmares live, once threatened to swallow up the world of men. Legends say that thousands of years ago, a mighty wizard sealed the Nether Realm in a great golden box. But now, the box has been opened. The denizens of the Nether Realm are free to cross into this world and plunge those brave few who seek the Crown of Command into a living nightmare!\u201d</i><br><br>The Nether Realm holds some of the hardest enemies you\u2019ll yet face on your adventures through Talisman.

Special abilities and effects that apply to Adventure Cards also apply to Nether Cards, but only after they have been drawn and placed onto the board.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/267787/extras/TDE_NetherRealm_Banner02_Endings.png?t=1594894987\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Gauntlet</h2>Claiming the Crown of Command has never been harder. A horde of Nether Realm Enemies line the path to the Valley of Fire and must be defeated before you can move forward. As you defeat an Enemy and move forward they\u2019ll be replaced by another, so don\u2019t expect someone else to clear the path for you. If you decide to retreat you won't have to encounter any of the Enemies on your way back to the Plain of Peril but you\u2019ll be admitting defeat. The first person to clear the path and defeat the two Enemies on the Crown of Command wins the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Hunt</h2>The hunt is never easy but it\u2019s always rewarding. The first person to defeat four Enemies from the Nether Deck and reach the Crown of Command wins.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Pandora\u2019s Box</h2>You\u2019ll need to ensure you\u2019ve gained enough Lives, Strength and Craft before you or another player reaches the Crown of Command. Once a player reaches the Crown, they\u2019ll unleash hell as they open Pandora\u2019s Box. Drawing 6 Nether Cards, plus 6 more Nether Cards per player in the game, you'll need to get ready for a long battle. The player on the Crown of Command will use their Nether Deck against other players until either all other players have been killed or the Nether Deck is exhausted and all other players win.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/267787/extras/TDE_NetherRealm_Banner03_Expansion.png?t=1594894987\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>3 Alternative Ending<br></li><li>36 Nether cards</li></ul><br><i>\u201cCan you survive the Nether Realm?\u201d</i>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/267787/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1594894987","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/267787/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1594894987","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/267787/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1594894987","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/267787/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1594894987","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<i>\u201cThe Nether Realm, where the most terrible beasts of fairy tales and nightmares live, once threatened to swallow up the world of men.
