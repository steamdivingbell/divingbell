{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1649570/extras/summon4.gif?t=1712066164\" /><br><br>Raise the dead to protect yourself from angry villagers: a necessary act of skeletal self defense. Yes, this zombie used to be your grandma, but whose fault is that? Tragically, the undead are also quite stupid. Use mushy imprecise commands to order your new boney friends around. If they stand in the right spots maybe they will at least munch a brain or two? Rip souls out of your enemies in a pixelated minimalist sort of way, raising them again as a small contingency of ghosts free to smash through an array of cottages and scare the remaining townsfolk. Give in to carefree destructive impulses on both the campaign and survival mode. <br><br>Don't think about it too hard. Just gather randomized, powerful, stackable items to grow your army. Throw fireballs at that church, what's the harm? With a few tweaks here and there, suddenly your slow little necromancer that dies in one hit is an overpowered tornado chucking maniac. Yet it can all end in an instant where one or two well placed arrows will send you strait back to hell. Luckily, at least the shopping is good there. If the sensibilities of retro gaming difficulty are lost on you, play on &quot;weenie&quot; mode for infinite continues! Now you can bask in the alluring musk of a dirty black sorcerer cloak without the effort! As you cast another lightning bolt just ask yourself, &quot;Why is everyone so angry?&quot; All you wanted were some new boney friends..<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1649570/extras/colorswap.gif?t=1712066164\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Swap colors - you may be a corpse, but you still have style!<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1649570/extras/Digger.gif?t=1712066164\" /><br></li><li>Control large amounts of undead.
