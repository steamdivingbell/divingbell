{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Under Construction</h2>StreamPad is in its beginning stages. A lot of hardwork and dedication is being put into it, as of right now it\u2019s basic functions are working. Because of the nature of StreamPad, we have decided to release it under Steam\u2019s Early Access program. This will allow users to use StreamPad and give any feedback on what could potentially make the application better. With dedication, diligence and some support, we\u2019ll be able to create an application that can keep evolving to a point where Streamer\u2019s can use it as a reliable tool in their streams.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Streaming Focus</h2>This application works similar to a real soundpad or soundboard.
