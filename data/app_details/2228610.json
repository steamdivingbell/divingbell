{"about_the_game":"Give your devout men some voices with NPC Male Priests Vol. 1! TK.Projects is here with even more Japanese voice clips, this time focusing on 12 different characters that you could run into in and around the town\u2019s church or hospital. And with 10 SEs each, you\u2019re sure to find a voice that will fit the scene. Have the son of a healer laugh happily as he runs between pews, older men grumble about a recent monster attack outside the building, a suspicious man laugh to himself in the shadows, and more with this SE pack!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith a spread of ages covered in these voices, you\u2019ll be able to find something that works no matter your character. Give your fatherly priest a voice that sounds appropriately middle-aged and kind, while your handsome healer\u2019s voice is pleasant when he laughs. Let your heroes listen in to an elderly man scolding a teen boy for falling asleep on the job, and discover a new clue to help solve the town\u2019s mystery when the boy sighs and tries to explain himself. Or have an eerie moan wake your heroes up from a nap, only to discover that they\u2019ve been kidnapped!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdding these SEs to your engine of choice is simple since each track comes in multiple file formats, so what are you waiting for?
