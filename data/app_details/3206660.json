These can be:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Visual: Displaced, appeared, or disappeared objects, faulty lights, changes in the room's layout.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Auditory: Strange noises, unusual silence, sounds that shouldn\u2019t be present.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Interactions: Objects that react unexpectedly when you interact with them.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When an anomaly is suspected, you must use your phone to take a photo of it and report it to your boss.
