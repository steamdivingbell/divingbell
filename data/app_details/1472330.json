{"about_the_game":"Originally released in 1985 by Ocean Software, N.O.M.A.D. pushed the boundaries of what the 8-bit computers of the day could achieve with both their graphics and their gameplay. This remastered version by Purple Viking is faithful to the original, offering retro fans and casual gamers alike a chance to experience the same thrill as the first generation of players had back in the day. This modern version also includes a new inertia-based system which can be selected in the settings menu.
