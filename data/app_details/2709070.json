Your task is not only to face the challenges of this corrupted world but also to uncover what transpired in this dark corner, once home to a prosperous civilization.<br><br>Engage in intense combat in chaotic, uncontrollable landscapes, where reality distortion challenges your vertical and horizontal thinking. Armed with both past and present technology, explore these surreal environments, unraveling secrets hidden in the shadows.<br><br>Voidwalker harnesses the power of the Quake engine to deliver an immersive, action-packed gaming experience.
