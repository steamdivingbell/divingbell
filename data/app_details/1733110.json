In those forgotten places, nature is wild and legends are more real and vivid than one may think. Experience the challenges of different seasons and climates in a world, where every animal and every plant tries to find their place in nature, while you lead your villagers. How much will you share with nature? Will you strive for balance or even enforce the extinction of certain animals? Follow the old paths\u2026 or find your own.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Find Balance (Or Not)</h2><strong>Humans share the same space and resources with nature, and they influence each other.</strong> While in the beginning the influence of the humans is insignificant, it gets more and more important when the city - and its needs - grow.
