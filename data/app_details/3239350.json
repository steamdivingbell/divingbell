{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">It is with great pleasure that I present to you Another Head! The first game by <strong>Looting Dreams</strong>, created by <strong>Eric Sorrentino</strong> (yours truly).

The story can take wildly different directions and tones depending on your choices.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">No missions, live the story as the protagonist</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Don\u2019t expect senseless quests or triggers! The story progresses according to your decisions, whether you like it or not.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Feeling lost? Don\u2019t worry\u2014you can always consult the thoughts swirling around in Tom\u2019s mind. Draw inspiration from his needs and ideas to navigate the game and make important decisions.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Meaningful dialogues</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Interactions with people are key, so never miss a chance to chat with your neighbors. The choices you make during dialogues will always have weight.

You might feel a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as you assemble sandwiches and watch your bank account grow, but I promise it will be a fresh experience in its own way.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Developed in Italy, with love</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">I\u2019ve always wanted to bring my ideas to life\u2014since I was a kid, playing in the backyard with friends, crafting role-playing games, or sketching countless concepts that never saw the light of day.
