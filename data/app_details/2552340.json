However, in the case of the Apple App Store, the User must directly apply for a refund to the Apple App Store.<br>\u2467 If a minor makes a payment without the consent of a legal representative, the minor or the legal representative can cancel the payment. However, cancellation may be restricted if the payment for the paid service by the minor falls within the scope permitted by the legal representative or if it is due to the minor's deception. The determination of whether the contracting party of the content purchase agreement is a minor is based on the mobile device used for payment, payment executor information, payment method account holder, etc. The Company may request the submission of documents proving minority and legal representation to verify the validity of the cancellation.<br>\u2468 If a User requests a refund, the Company may request additional documents for self-verification after confirming the purchase history. The User must submit the requested documents to the Company via methods such as FAX, and the refund will generally be processed to the account of the device owner (including mobile phones). However, in cases where it is difficult for the User to verify their identity or confirm the account of the device owner, such as in the case of a minor, if a legal representative requests a refund on behalf of the minor, additional proof may be requested. If the legal representative is confirmed, the refund can be processed to the legal representative's account.<br>\u2469 The Company shall make its best efforts to complete the refund as promptly as possible, starting from the day it receives the documents specified in the preceding clause from the user.<br><br>Article 19 - [Termination of Contract and Suspension of Service Use, etc.]<br>\u2460 Users may terminate the service agreement at any time by withdrawing from membership if they do not wish to use the service.

Additionally, any fees already paid for content purchases, data usage fees, monthly subscription service fees, etc., cannot be refunded.<br><br>Article 20 - [Damages]<br>\u2460 If a User violates the provisions of these Terms of Use, resulting in damages to the Company, the User who breached these terms is responsible for compensating the Company for all losses incurred.<br>\u2461 If a User engages in illegal activities or violates these Terms of Use while using the service, leading to the Company facing claims for damages or legal actions from third parties other than the user, the User must indemnify and hold the Company harmless at their own responsibility and expense. In cases where the Company is not indemnified, the User is responsible for compensating the Company for all losses incurred as a result.<br><br>Article 21 - [Disclaimers]<br>\u2460 The Company shall not be liable for any damages arising from matters related to the free-provided services. However, exceptions apply in cases of intentional or gross negligence on the part of the Company.<br>\u2461 The Company shall not be liable for the interruption of services, usage difficulties, or contract termination due to the user's own fault.

[Notice to Users]<br>\u2460 The Company may, when necessary, notify the User through means such as the User's email address, electronic memo, in-game messaging, text messages (MMS/SMS), or other similar methods.<br>\u2461 If the Company notifies all Users, it may do so by posting the notice within the game service for at least 7 days or by presenting it through pop-up screens or similar means, thereby surpassing the notification mentioned in the first paragraph.<br><br>Article 24 - [Jurisdiction]<br>\u2460 Disputes arising between the Company and the User regarding service use must be resolved amicably through mutual agreement between the parties.","linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"></ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"></ul>"},"movies":[{"highlight":true,"id":256996637,"mp4":{"480":"http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/256996637/movie480.mp4?t=1706259637","max":"http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/256996637/movie_max.mp4?t=1706259637"},"name":"Tempest Teaser Movie","thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/256996637/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1706259637","webm":{"480":"http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/256996637/movie480_vp9.webm?t=1706259637","max":"http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/256996637/movie_max_vp9.webm?t=1706259637"}}],"name":"TEMPEST : Tower of Probatio","package_groups":[],"pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 x64<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i5-4670K | AMD FX-8350<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 8 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Nvidia GeForce GTX 650 / AMD Radeon HD HD 6950<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 10<br></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 4 GB available space</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 x64<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i7-6700K | AMD Ryzen 5 1500X<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 16 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Nvidia GeForce GTX 660 / AMD Radeon HD 7970<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 10<br></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 4 GB available space</li></ul>"},"platforms":{"linux":false,"mac":false,"windows":true},"publishers":["New Normal Soft Inc."],"ratings":{"dejus":{"banned":"0","descriptors":"Viol\u00eancia","rating":"10","rating_generated":"1","required_age":"10","use_age_gate":"0"},"steam_germany":{"banned":"0","descriptors":"Gewalt","rating":"12","rating_generated":"1","required_age":"12","use_age_gate":"0"}},"release_date":{"coming_soon":false,"date":"27 Feb, 2024"},"required_age":0,"screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2552340/ss_1262fb738f75949ca463d68fa7366aee13600afe.1920x1080.jpg?t=1712022634","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2552340/ss_1262fb738f75949ca463d68fa7366aee13600afe.600x338.jpg?t=1712022634"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2552340/ss_c444616239d191ce2b0d7ecb44fe34972178d273.1920x1080.jpg?t=1712022634","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2552340/ss_c444616239d191ce2b0d7ecb44fe34972178d273.600x338.jpg?t=1712022634"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2552340/ss_4e0331fea43b53d1637bf93a1d6909c6aad059aa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1712022634","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2552340/ss_4e0331fea43b53d1637bf93a1d6909c6aad059aa.600x338.jpg?t=1712022634"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2552340/ss_032295ab86d61d77f3eaaeef5490f0d41d2426ad.1920x1080.jpg?t=1712022634","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2552340/ss_032295ab86d61d77f3eaaeef5490f0d41d2426ad.600x338.jpg?t=1712022634"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2552340/ss_e6877b8cdc754410d3e7457160d5aba4c11f3e6d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1712022634","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2552340/ss_e6877b8cdc754410d3e7457160d5aba4c11f3e6d.600x338.jpg?t=1712022634"}],"short_description":"Dive into 'Tempest: Tower of Probatio', a groundbreaking CCG that revolutionizes strategic card battle with its unique ban-pick phase.
