{"about_the_game":"You can now travel through \u00d6stert\u00f6rn on new types of Motorbikes! It\u2019s faster. It\u2019s louder. It\u2019s more exciting! The motorbikes will get you places quicker, but they\u2019ll need fuel to drive. Plan your travel strategically so you won't run out of gasoline unexpectedly, and be sure to check out abandoned cars and gas stations and find jerry cans to fuel up. Or craft the fuel by yourself! You can ride on 3 different models. Each of them has their own strengths and weaknesses:<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2144761/extras/GIF_1-Dirt-Bike.gif?t=1733994361\" /><br><br><strong>Dirt Bike</strong>: Lets you go offroad!
