{"about_the_game":"Solo Reflection! is the independent and very unique brick breaker game that was originally created as a DLC to the Prison Ball: Full Blown! breakout/pong combo game!  It's available now as a completely separate game to offer the most versatility.  <br><br>In Solo ReflectioN!, you'll need to make your balls really count for something! Keep them reflected away from the two sides as they will be instantly destroyed by lightning should they try to pass through! You however can pass through from side to side and you'll often need to if you want to keep your balls in action and also collect all the coins being released from the bricks you break.<br><br>You'll control prison inmate Andy Simms in a relentless action brick breaker where risk vs reward is always part of the game!<br><br>Broken bricks from your reflected ball will release copper, silver, and gold coins that can be collected and saved up until the time is right to deposit them in your own personal bank.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1589340/extras/sr1.png?t=1687275598\" /><br><br>To get your bank, you'll need to accumulate at least 10 copper (or 1 silver) and press the space bar (or your A button on your controller). You kneel down and blow a &quot;bank bubble&quot; as seen below and be charged 10% of all your coins. This takes time and finding the right time where you won't lose a ball is part of the frantic fun!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1589340/extras/sr2.png?t=1687275598\" /><br><br>Once the bank bubble has been blown, it will float around the screen several times before finally choose one of the four corners to land on! When the bank bursts out of the bubble, you're free to simply go stand on it and wait for the green deposit bar to fill to successfully transfer your collection coins into score points at the top of the screen.
