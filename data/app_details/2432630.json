You wake up in Diyu, the realm of the dead, where you meet Lord Yama, the king of hell. He recruits you as the leader of Unit 7, an anti-terrorist organization that fights against demons and other threats in the capital city of Youdu and beyond. You will have to use your skills and tactics to survive and complete your missions. You will also have to manage your team of misfits, each with their own personality and backstory. You can bond with them during free time events, learn more about them, and influence their behavior and loyalty. Your choices will matter and change the game in subtle or major ways. You will also face Lord Zepar, a powerful and mysterious enemy who has a sinister plan for Diyu. Will you be able to stop him and find a way back to the living world? Will you discover the truth behind the apocalypse and your destiny? Will you find love or betrayal in the underworld? The choice is yours in Mythical Agent, the strategy role-playing game that has 12 main endings! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2432630/extras/free_time.gif?t=1730257591\" />Explore the lives and personalities of your companions. In this game, you fight in a variety of missions that will test your tactical skills and strategic thinking. But the action doesn't end there. After each mission, you can also enjoy some free time with the characters you have met and befriended along the way. You can hang out with them and chat with them. You can learn more about their backgrounds, motivations, secrets, and dreams. You can also influence how they view you and how they behave in future missions. Your choices will also affect how the random NPCs in the game world react to you and your team. Will they respect you, fear you, love you, or hate you?
