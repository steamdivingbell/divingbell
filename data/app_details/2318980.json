{"about_the_game":"<strong>Periculum</strong> is a casual (turn-based and real-time) strategy game in which you conquer hexagonal tiles and build your empire on them. Gather resources (such as Gold, Wood, Stone, and Fish), construct buildings, and erect walls to strengthen your empire. Choose from different game modes and engage in epic battles against bots or challenge your friends to see who comes out on top. With an extensive range of options (similar to a sandbox), the possibilities are endless. Take your strategy to the next level by creating your own maps in the in-game level editor. The game is easy to learn, but with customizable settings, it can also offer a challenging experience.
