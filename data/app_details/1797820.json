{"about_the_game":"<strong>The Overthrow</strong> is an RPG slasher game with one life, with hardcore arena battles, a special leveling tree and a system of procedurally generated enemies. In the game you have to be one of the recruits of the squad to overthrow the government. The world of the game is inhabited by robots with humanoid AI, despite the development of intelligence, most of the population is humiliated by the dictatorial power. <br><br>The squad in which you are a member was formed by an ancient robot-sage. Together, the members of the squad organized a shelter and an illegal arena. Meet your allies, learn their stories and contribute to the common cause by becoming the main freedom fighter. <br><br>A dystopian game with a deep story awaits you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> The arena is the only way out. </h2> <br>Fight in the arena among robots like you. Earn money and reputation, upgrade weapons and other equipment. Train your skills and become an invincible master of the arena to gain strength to overthrow the power.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Each start is unique. </h2> <br>All items and enemies are procedurally generated. Create a unique robot with a unique upgrade tree and equipment. Each of your enemies consists of the same unique parts, just like you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Non-linear RPG leveling. </h2> <br>The game does not have a prepared linear passive skill tree. Each player creates his own tree himself. With the help of high-tech chips, you can make the tree any way you like. Each chip, like everything else in the game, is unique and its properties are procedurally generated.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Fight like there's no tomorrow. </h2> <br>Each battle in the arena may be the last for your character. Death is forever. However, death is not the only outcome. You and your enemies may lose any limb during the fight. Agree, fighting with a two-handed sword without one hand or without hands at all is not very convenient, right? <br><br>Learn from your mistakes. After death do not give up, and create a new more perfect warrior. And when you reach the heights, go to the cemetery to pay respect those who gave you the opportunity to go further.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> You are not the chosen invincible hero. </h2> <br>Your robot is no better than the rest of the arena warriors. After some fights you will understand your enemies have the same equipment as you. Your biggest advantage is skilled hands and good reaction.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Enemies remember everything. </h2> <br>In <strong>The Overthrow</strong> enemies are not just lines of computer code. Every one of the enemies has their own character and memory. When you make a sworn enemy, do not think he will sit still and wait until you challenge him again. All enemies try to develop and get new strengths or weaknesses. Enemies can improve their AI chip, which will positively affect their reactions and analysis of your behavior during the battle. Damaging an enemy chip or earning a mental injury can make your opponent a little dumb and lower the level of his AI chip.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1797820/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1672643064","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1797820/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1672643064","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1797820/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1672643064","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1797820/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1672643064","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>The Overthrow</strong> is an RPG slasher game with one life, with hardcore arena battles, a special leveling tree and a system of procedurally generated enemies.
