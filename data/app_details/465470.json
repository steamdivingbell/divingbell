{"about_the_game":"This is the demo of the unreleased game Vertigo. It is coming summer 2016.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVertigo is a first person story-based shooter for the HTC Vive. Explore the sprawling underground facilities of Planck International Energy Solutions' Quantum Reactor, filled with dark secrets, adorable drones, and parallel universes. You find yourself in the bowels of this machine after being whisked away from your home, and, armed with only the tools and weapons you can find, you must make your way to the surface, and the truth. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe HTC Vive allows for an unmatched sense of scale in large environments compared to other games, and Vertigo lives up to its name by sending you through awe-inspiring caverns, over unimaginably deep drops, and through fantastic machines the size of skyscrapers. However, you're not a tourist in the quantum reactor. The automatic systems will treat you like a contaminant, and many strange beings take refuge in its unknown depths.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou're armed with some classic weapons like sword, shield, and recoil-less laser pistol, but also a Space-time Manipulator. The Manipulator allows you to teleport around large levels, and slow down time to give yourself a fighting edge.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/465470/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1461938440","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/465470/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1461938440","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/465470/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1461938440","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/465470/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1461938440","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This is the demo of the unreleased game Vertigo.
