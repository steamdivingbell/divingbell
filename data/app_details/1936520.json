However, the door slammed behind him, then the Doctor, talking over his in house PA system, reveled his evil plan because that is what evil doctors do. He told Jim that in the basement of the mansion, he had created a world conquering robot that he will release shortly, to conquer the world Jim surmised. The doctor continued saying that Jim would not see it because his home security robots would kill him before he could get to it. But nothing has kept Jim from a good story, not even killer robots, or the doctor's bleak interior deign.
