{"about_the_game":"NOTES FROM THE SOLO DEVELOPER:<br>Please enjoy this virtual stressball for FREE while we keep going through this pandemic.

This project was inspired by one of the many stupid situations that resulted in the initial lockdown back in March. Most notably, the toilet paper hoarding (which already feels like ages ago). It's dumb, it's over the top and it's FUN.
