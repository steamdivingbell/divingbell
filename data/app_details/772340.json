{"about_the_game":"Saddle up and defend the town of Willow Creek from nefarious outlaws and city slickers! It all starts when a rancher's daughter goes missing, and it ends at the showdown at Willow Creek, where greed, lust, science and Mother Nature will face off at high noon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShowdown at Willow Creek is an interactive western mystery novel where your choices control the story. The game is entirely text-based--without graphics or sound effects--but powered by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGamble, seduce, brawl, or shoot your way through Willow Creek, where gunslingers make the laws, and everybody has secrets. Will you romance the gambler or the soiled dove (or both)? Will you side with the scientists bringing electricity to the Old West, or with a tribe of native American Utes? Will you unravel the conspiracy that threatens to tear the town apart, or will you light the fuse to blow it all sky high?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/772340/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734037532","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/772340/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1734037532","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/772340/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734037532","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/772340/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734037532","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":772350,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Saddle up and defend the town of Willow Creek from nefarious outlaws and city slickers!
