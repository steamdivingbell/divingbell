My aim for this year is to carry over my Ph.D. research about procedurally generated nature into my game.

With each race against 39 other players, you gain experience and credits, for which you can buy various upgrades for your vehicle or unlock newer vehicles. You start with machines from the 1900s. Can you get to the very top and ride on modern machinery?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3273670/extras/3.jpg?t=1731530558\" /><br>Controls are simplified enough to give you still the passion of riding but not too complex to take you hours to learn. It mainly focuses on providing players with the best enjoyment from racing fights. The game's core is short, dynamic races with a high action density. The feeling from the ride is very reminiscent of older games; do not expect a hardcore simulator. On the other hand, it's not a mario kart racing game - there are physics, and you need to keep that in mind.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3273670/extras/4.jpg?t=1731530558\" /><br>- 80 sidecars from 120 years of history<br>- 50 real and custom tracks<br>- 1000+ various vehicle setups<br>- 30+ vehicle patterns, each customizable<br>- 10 different biomes<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3273670/extras/5.jpg?t=1731530558\" /><br>Using a simple yet rich customization system, you can customize your vehicle and rider as much as you want.
