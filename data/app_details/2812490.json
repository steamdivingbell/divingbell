{"about_the_game":"Description: Hunter Beat is an exhilarating virtual reality game designed specifically for people who want to escape from everyday worries, shift to positive emotions, and enhance their concentration. Participants immerse themselves in the game, where they shoot at dynamic &quot;targets&quot; and score points. The success of the gameplay depends on several factors: accuracy, agility, reaction speed, sense of rhythm, and the ability to see more broadly, not just in front of oneself.<br />\r\nHunter Beat features a variety of engaging levels with different levels of difficulty. The game offers a wide selection of music tracks, which also influence the pace of gameplay. Hitting the target in rhythm/beat allows the player to earn additional points.<br />\r\nKey features of the game include:<br />\r\nDynamic tasks that require quick reaction and precise movements. It enhances attention concentration. Shooting with both hands contributes to reloading.<br />\r\nLevels of varying difficulty that present challenges for new achievements and stimulate the player's attentiveness.<br />\r\nUniversality - suitable for adults and children alike.<br />\r\nHunter Beat is the perfect way to escape from the gray routine, engage in something exciting, and at the same time, develop attentiveness and improve emotional state in a gaming format.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Hunter Beat, players encounter arcade-style action elements, the main one being shooting cartoon ducks. On a successful hit, the ducks explode, displaying exaggerated animation effects, including the appearance of exaggerated bones and cartoon-style blood. These scenes are intended for comic effect and are designed to be non-realistic. They are not intended to suppress or glorify military force or brutality. However, we understand that this stylistic approach may be taken in different ways, and we caution that some of the participants in the response scenes may be conspicuous or unexpected.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Lock and load","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2812490/e6fe3f4c3a305b539cdb12b09c59e337e51b22ce.jpg"},{"name":"SUPER","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2812490/b869be873e313d64fdbb8fdc9e46c763d7508614.jpg"},{"name":"Awesome","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2812490/9dba4682aab1a101545ef5446556da0a4c7f91c5.jpg"}],"total":3},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2812490/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1715602321","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2812490/page.bg.jpg?t=1715602321","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2812490/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1715602321","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2812490/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1715602321","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"In Hunter beat, players will encounter arcade action elements, the main one being shooting cartoon ducks.
