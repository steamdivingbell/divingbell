{"about_the_game":"&quot;Pathfinder 2 RPG - Sky King's Tomb AP 3: Heavy is the Crown<br> <br> For all his epic deeds, the first high king earned countless enemies, and word of his tomb's rediscovery has gathered an eclectic army of dwarves' ancient enemies. To preserve the tomb and save a dwarven city, the adventurers must infiltrate, splinter, and sabotage the gathering legion. Only in this chaos can the adventurers catch up to their rival at the tomb itself. The question isn't just whether they can prevail, but whether their victory makes them worthy of the tomb's greatest secrets. <br> <br> Heavy is the Crown is a Pathfinder adventure for four 8th-level characters, concluding the Sky King's Tomb Adventure Path, a three-part monthly campaign in which a group of adventurers travel deep underground to discover a legendary dwarven king's tomb, seek subterranean treasures, and heal millennia-old injustices--all while stopping an ambitious villain from weaponizing those same discoveries. This adventure also includes exciting ways to continue the campaign, an overview of the subterranean Darklands, a gazetteer of a lost dwarven homeland, and fearsome creatures that prowl the darkest caves. <br> This product is not a PDF or accessible outside of Fantasy Grounds.
