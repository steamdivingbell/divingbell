With new animations, an updated camera and 4K resolution, the world of the series takes on a whole new dimension.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">HD Music</h2>Thanks to the talented Philippe Vachey, the game's soundtrack instantly became cult. 30 years later, it deserves an HD version to re-enchant players.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Updated controls</h2>Analog controls offer more subtle control of Twinsen.
