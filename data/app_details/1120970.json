But if you decide to give this game a try, we hope you find fun in optimizing the performance of your deck as we did.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Found a job","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1120970/ff8506c4821fed3a00f9159d8f3d7efdca496e33.jpg"},{"name":"Freshman Keeper","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1120970/1f4678acb526bf8de81f19962542adc35c6041b5.jpg"},{"name":"Senior Keeper","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1120970/0a23fcad8a711df25554c9512a471903a1a6664e.jpg"},{"name":"Dream Keeper","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1120970/abe5d781896ded708dc2fa55f638e0cd91f4511a.jpg"},{"name":"Arena Newcomer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1120970/c3489725309547dc6ecc1f4de0100ea32c6ea243.jpg"},{"name":"Arena Expert","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1120970/511d0051020a1022a762125b9e54d139d9b8e08b.jpg"},{"name":"Arena Specialist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1120970/01fe7145650bb058e33e730a14bca3f25ab5bd0b.jpg"},{"name":"Surprise Mechanics!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1120970/3c770ea8531f79045477717fbe959a076817251a.jpg"},{"name":"Shining Card","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1120970/293c1b8fdedc83fd070a0ea2e9ac6072e4b6fc88.jpg"},{"name":"These guys are great!!!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1120970/bbfd876cc10f3df8319b247458ed429efe34df3d.jpg"}],"total":19},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1120970?t=1564535303","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1120970/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1564535303","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1120970/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1564535303","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1120970/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1564535303","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Dream Keeper is a survival game that combines top-down-shooters with deck building that plays in real-time.
