Players can view the state of the galaxy up to an hour in the future to prepare their strategies.<br><br><strong>3 Unique Races:</strong> It's War Year 35 and the emergent TEC, alien Vasari, and deviant Advent have been forced to adapt and evolve to survive.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>TEC:</strong> The inhabitants of this region of the galaxy, the TEC are humans who have joined together as the Trader Emergency Coalition to combat the alien Vasari empire. They rely heavily on trade to support their industrial base and augment resource income.<br></li><li> <strong>Vasari:</strong> Ten thousand years ago, the Vasari Empire once ruled over hundreds of planets and dozens of sentient species. Now on the run from an unknown enemy they use their mastery of phase space to conquer and acquire resources to continue their exodus.<br></li><li> <strong>Advent:</strong> A civilization of humans who were forcibly outcast by the Traders over a thousand years ago, the deviant Advent have returned with technologically amplified psionics and the power of the Unity - a devastating expression of their collective will.</li></ul><br>Each race features unique starting conditions, gameplay mechanics, units, abilities, items, and technologies.

Turrets with their own pitch and tracking speeds make firing solutions important in battles. Fully simulated missiles can be blocked by ships or destroyed by point defense.

Requested units are automatically queued from the optimal factory and rallied to the fleet.
