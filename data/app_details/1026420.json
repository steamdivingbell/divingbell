You start on the first day with a group of three insurgents whose first task is to get their weapons and get to the base camp safely. You participate in a tragic yet heroic chapter of the capital's history. Your job is to survive as long as possible. There is only one way to do this: by fighting with a weapon in hand.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>LEAD AND MANAGE YOUR TEAM</strong></h2><br>Make key decisions and lead soldiers through the 63 days of the Warsaw Uprising. Acquire weapons, ammunition and other resources needed for the survival of your comrades. Disarm enemy units, neutralise artillery and help the fighting Warsaw! In the new, expanded version of the project, you have the chance to experience missions based on the actual events of the Warsaw Uprising. In addition, photographs of figures, archival documents and posters directly related to the Uprising appear as part of the gameplay. The game is also supplemented with a comprehensive timeline showing key events day by day.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>DEVELOP SKILLS</strong></h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1026420/extras/02_flamer_small.gif?t=1734523174\" /><br><br>Defeat the enemy not only with strength but primarily with cleverness. Use the skills of your subordinates to gain an advantage over the enemy. Regularly sweep German hiding spots and armouries to procure weapons for the Uprising. Manage weapons and ammunition so that your heroes are properly equipped for clashes with the enemy. Promote the heroic insurgents as well, who will acquire \u2013 increasingly useful in clashes \u2013 skills over time and form an effective, cohesive team.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>EXPLORE THE CITY</strong></h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1026420/extras/03_map_small_(2).gif?t=1734523174\" /><br><br>Navigate your way around a detailed map of Warsaw in 1944. Sneak through alleys and secret passages, make your way through ruins and obstacles. Patrol streets cleared of the enemy and follow your command's orders while uncovering facts about your heroes' past. As a commander, decide when to step up to the fight and when to retreat. Warsaw's landscape changes with the passing of time, and the game reflects the degree of destruction of the city in the subsequent phases of fighting. The advantage of the occupying forces is growing every day and this battle cannot be won.
