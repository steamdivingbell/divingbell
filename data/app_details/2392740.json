{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cave Digger 2</h2><br><br><i>Start with a pickaxe in one hand and nothing in the other. Excavate the bedrock, reap the rewards of Mother Earth, and trade the mined valuables for new gadgets, travels, funky wild fashion, and more. Cave Digger 2 is a 1-4-player action-adventure game set in wildland valleys, where you discover old mines, nautical caves, and ruins of ancient civilizations inspired by Western, Dieselpunk and Lovecraftian themes. Explore the &quot;pristine&quot; lands, loot its riches, and unravel the mystery linked to a great explorer. As you go, it's best to keep a six-shooter nearby just in case.</i><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2392740/extras/coreloop_cd2flat.gif?t=1724333488\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tools and Progression</h2><br><br>Get thrown right away into the deep end by being stuck in the mines as your drill machine broke. With a single pickaxe, work your way to the surface camp where your journey can begin in earnest. Your goal is simply to mine and carry loot back to the surface the best you can for your mission assigners. With the surplus reward that you get, you can buy new things like upgrading your dependable pickaxe with a shinier look! (And faster digging rate.) Or buy dynamites that work on pretty much anything that needs to be worked on. Maybe you fancy a shovel that works for both digging and moving through the caves like a spider-miner. Whatever your preferred loadout, you will be ready to go deeper into the ever-shifting caves than any miner before or after you! (At least that's what Merchant Trading Company says when selling their gear to any miner, which they must be 100% right about, right?... Right.)<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2392740/extras/tools_cd2flat.gif?t=1724333488\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2><br><br>The valleys have their mysteries and they hide them well. Step by step the player follows the same path where a great explorer has once wandered. Who is this hardy explorer? Why did he come to these valleys? And where is he now? The answers to these and more lie in the depths of the valleys. The story has multiple endings, each revealing a different side of it. Find the scattered comic pages to a tale of greed, eldritch power, and secrets beyond space and time. Who the wanderer is and why he did what he did in the valleys become clear in the end, but is it really the end?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2392740/extras/combat_cd2flat.gif?t=1724333488\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Co-op Multiplayer</h2><br><br>Gather a party of up to 4 players.
