{"about_the_game":"EarthRoyale is a Map simulation Observer game where the game each turn / a few in game months time, chooses one of many events to edit the world map or add lore behind the countries

of any event happening or choose one of the pre made modes of it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach turn one of many things can happen:<br />\r\n<br />\r\ndivision: a random country gets divided by

country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTake coast / Islands: a country either takes the coast or islands of a neighboring country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPartition: a big country with above 200 provinces gets split up in different ways by the words major powers (anyone above 50 provinces) where the major powers gets parts for themselves, some areas gains independence within it and the rest being divided between

will prioritize it over all claimed coastal provinces.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndependence: Each Easter egg, province, culture, or previous country tag of any province within a random country has a chance of having all provinces with that tag within the country gain independence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNuke: A random province is selected and all provinces around it within 3 different sized circles will be

special unique name<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSplit: a country will either split into north and south country or west and east country, or if it's a union, it will make all member states independence as they where when joining the union and all provinces that wasn't a part of a member state will be divided between the former member states based on who is closest<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFlood: A random province will be turned into flooded or water, it will also make 1 to 2 closest provinces do the same over and over again for up to 15 provinces.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFire: a random province will have a fire start in it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHurricane: a hurricane is spawned a long a coast and moves randomly around, destroying all provinces in its path<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is also multiple types of

colored the same as the ocean, a darker blue and it will each turn loose it's flood level, the further away from where the flood started the lower flood level it starts with, when it hits 0 it will turn into unclaimed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFire: A province that is created by the fire event. it is colored a orange color and each turn moves to another province and lose some strength, or splits into
