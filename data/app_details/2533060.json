Traverse, hide, and fight your way through a seemingly unending onslaught of enemy RAMs. Use JJ\u2019s Gravity Gun and KAI\u2019s fists to stun and destroy enemies. <br><br>Each of the two player character has unique abilities that will need to be used together in order to defeat the unstoppable onslaught of RAM's robots. JJ is quite nimble and can jump around a flip levers to allow herself and KAI to navigate the city. JJ also uses her Gravity Gun, allowing her to pickup and move objects in the world, as well as immobilize RAMs themself! KAI on the other hand, although unable to jump, can break through destructible walls using his fists. KAI is also exceptional at destroying the enemy RAM's in just a few punches. JJ and KAI will need to work together to play to their strengths and help each others' weaknesses.<br><br>However, the forces of Santiago's city will stop at nothing to take KAI's core to power the city. Santiago has deployed many different types of RAM robots to stop JJ and KAI that can shoot, charge, and sometimes even fly to eliminate the duo. Defeat the many RAM enemies in your way and march to the Heart of the city, where you can face Santiago's himself in his Airship. Santiago will stop at nothing to ensure that KAI's core is back in control of the city.<br><br><i>Heart and Core</i> features several different traversable areas, each blending seamlessly into each other with no loading screens. Explore several different environments from the Junkyard to the City Center in addition to several unique enemy robots.
