{"about_the_game":"AstroPanic, a top-down 2D rogue-like game set in space. We are a lost ship in the depths of space, surviving wave after wave by passing through a wormhole to teleport to different galaxies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the classic mode of the game, you need to survive against enemies for 20 waves. After the 20th wave, the decision to continue is up to the player. Once the 20th wave is completed, new ships and the next level are unlocked. At the end of each wave, you are presented with four upgrade options, allowing you to enhance your ship by choosing the one you prefer. With the permanent points you earn, you can shape your gameplay style by making permanent upgrades in the main menu. Gameplay is quite straightforward; you control the ship with the &quot;wasd&quot; keys, and the ship automatically fires at the nearest enemy.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Welcome","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2677240/7d8fc1dff25c1df45cb85a778c3057e7e5a66369.jpg"},{"name":"First Wave","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2677240/af00d6a956712e3084287de888abfc384d986b37.jpg"},{"name":"Meteor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2677240/cb5e65169f2614a69170b19dcccf93a1a2f0eacc.jpg"},{"name":"Boss Slayer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2677240/7087168922f41efdfdf9451acf6640996d2e3ef7.jpg"},{"name":"Extra Life","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2677240/b085e15c07c597d92afc3c48e455be9faec76ff4.jpg"},{"name":"TURROSH","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2677240/db209172f3fccc218e4918719fef1968566cc267.jpg"},{"name":"SIVHVAS","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2677240/ad200db95d93c37c65995430ea4f3429491a6713.jpg"},{"name":"EXTRAKAIDER","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2677240/4728c23d6d5a7c9333d916c6d01ee66ebc83a390.jpg"},{"name":"KUMBET","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2677240/5719d93957d901b20c4e8b39fdbe98a211393792.jpg"},{"name":"AKIRRA","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2677240/51d58391a8bbe477450da9712d7bb0384fde79a5.jpg"}],"total":31},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2677240/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1706598138","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2677240/page.bg.jpg?t=1706598138","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2677240/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1706598138","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2677240/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1706598138","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"AstroPanic, a top-down 2D rogue-like game set in space.
