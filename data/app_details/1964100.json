{"about_the_game":"Suzhou classical gardens can be traced back to the Spring and Autumn Period, developed in the Jin and Tang Dynasties, prospered in the Song Dynasty, and flourished in the Ming and Qing Dynasties. The formation of this architectural form is a creation of human attachment to nature, pursuit of harmonious coexistence with nature, and beautification and improvement of their living environment in cities with dense population and lack of natural scenery. Enjoy a quiet time by making pottery in the garden.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis DLC includes a crafting scene and a pottery wheel. Once you purchase this pack, you can use them at no extra cost.<br />\r\nNote: At least version 0.9.9f of Master Of Pottery is required to run this DLC.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1964100/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1654815284","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1964100/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1654815284","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1964100/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1654815284","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1964100/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1654815284","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Suzhou classical gardens can be traced back to the Spring and Autumn Period, developed in the Jin and Tang Dynasties, prospered in the Song Dynasty, and flourished in the Ming and Qing Dynasties.
