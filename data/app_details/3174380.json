{"about_the_game":"Enter the world of electromobility and manage your own electric vehicle charging station! <br>During the gameplay of EV Station you have the opportunity to take on the role of an owner of an electric vehicle charging station. Your tasks are varied and challenging-from basic customer service to doing minor repairs in the workshop. This is no ordinary station - here every day brings new challenges, and you are responsible for the efficient operation of the entire business!  <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3174380/extras/GIFA_1.gif?t=1727269092\" /><br><br>Save and generate your own energy! Your station can be powered by renewable energy sources. Install solar modules to reduce the cost of running your station, and store excess energy in special energy storage facilities. When your business develops well enough, you can invest in better, but also other energy sources that will provide extra power. These solutions will make your station more self-sufficient and environmentally friendly!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3174380/extras/GIFA_3.gif?t=1727269092\" /><br><br>Running a station is also technically challenging. Sometimes chargers can break down, photovoltaic panels need regular cleaning-these are just some of the problems you have to solve. The better you take care of the technical condition of your station, the better your business functions.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3174380/extras/GIFA_4.gif?t=1727269092\" /><br><br>Station development is the key to success. Replace old solar panels with new, more efficient models to maximize energy production. Add a workshop to your station to perform more advanced vehicle repairs.
