{"about_the_game":"The stasis chamber hisses softly around you.  Artificial fluids built up inside your ears begin to retreat as the cryoplasm drains slowly.  Breathing comes naturally, at first. And then the tickle of a hundred nanites filtering your oxygen forces a cough or two of surprise.  Beneath new skin, a fresh infusion of blood pulses with the cadence of tribal drums.
