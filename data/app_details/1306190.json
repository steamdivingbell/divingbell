{"about_the_game":"DepowerBall is a competitive party platformer where the more you win, the more you lose. Compete against other players to feed the hungry dragon queen as you score points to win a set number of rounds. As players win rounds, losing players will vote to take away the one of the winner's powers, making it harder for them to win (putting the 'Depower' in 'DepowerBall').<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause players' skills diminish as a match rolls on, you need to adapt and change strategies round by round in order to win. In the end, only one player will survive and win the favour of the Dragon Queen. Will it be you?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe demo will give you a chance to experience the fast paced multiplayer gameplay that will be available in the full version!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay as one of four characters and compete against other players locally in The Pit!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay as many times as you want!
