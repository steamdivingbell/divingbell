{"about_the_game":"Control a cloud and let it rain on a floor of hexagonal panels. The goal of the game is to turn all panels to water within the time limit to advance to the next level. <br>There are many different types of panels and obstacles such as volcanos and enemies. <br><br>All the panels have an effect on their neighbouring panels so some strategy is needed to advance to the higher levels. <br>There is no upper limit to the levels, but if you rank top globally your Steam name will be shown as panels to all players and depending on the letters in your name it will influence the game of all players!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Influence the Game!</h2>Your rank will decide where your name is shown.
