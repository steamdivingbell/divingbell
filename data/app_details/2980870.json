{"about_the_game":"<strong>OVERVIEW:</strong><br><br>In a world of magic with a harsh class divide, you are a pariah for not having any innate magic power. But after years of training your body, swordsmanship, and other physical skills, you are still able to defeat those with naturally strong magic. Find a way to break down the classist prejudices in this society, burn this rotten world to the ground then rebuild it from the ashes by surviving fast-paced melee combat with weapons, combining active and passive skills, and combos. Your honed skills over time will help you defeat those with innate magic and even formidable monsters, and through this, you will gradually approach the secret of the class divide in this magical world.<br><br><strong>FEATURES</strong><br><br>- Fast-paced sidescrolling platforming challenges with puzzles to explore the game world.<br>- Fast-paced third-person perspective combat with stylish combos and skills.<br>- Various weapons.<br>- Alternative Ending.<br>- Storytelling through comic-book pages.<br><br><strong>STORY:</strong><br><br><strong>Elysianna Islands</strong><br>The Elysianna Islands are a place where magic is considered the most valuable asset. The<br>social classes here are also defined based on the magical energy that people possess.<br>At the top of this place is a king who is chosen through a magic power competition held in<br>the capital of Elysium, when the incumbent king is about to die. The king of this island is<br>believed to have to carry out the orders of the Creator - The Lord, the one who bestows<br>power to the people of the island.<br>In addition to Elysium, there are also 5 other small islands ruled by the royal army and<br>headed by the Magic Generals with extremely high magical powers. Each of these islands<br>represents one of the five elements of the five elements: Gold (Ironheart), Wood<br>(Greenheart), Water (Mare), Fire (Igneus), Earth (Terra).<br>However, there is one island that is considered to be abandoned - Island 13th. At this place,<br>the people enjoy very little magical energy, the land is barren and they are always in a state<br>of hunger. <br><br><strong>Light and Darkness, Rich and Poor, Physical and Magical</strong><br>The focus of the story in &quot;The Mage Slayer&quot; is the confrontation between the protagonist<br>Zero and the final boss Alexandre de Lux.<br>Zero is a person who is at the bottom of society according to the beliefs of the people of<br>Elysianna. Being born on Island 13 is already a misfortune, but worse is that he does not<br>have a single bit of magic in him. In the battle with the royal guards to protect the people of<br>Island 13, he accidentally used his psychic ability and discovered that in a very distant place<br>(Elysium), there was an enemy who was considered his nemesis and that person was trying<br>to track him down. For what reason is unclear. This person is completely opposite to Zero,<br>he possesses a huge sudden source of magical energy and has the ultimate power in<br>Elysianna.<br>He must find him. One part is because he does not want to be chased to death, another part<br>is because he wants to vent his anger for more than twenty years. Why is The Lord so<br>unfair? Why is there a person who has everything while he has nothing?<br>Alexandre de Lux is completely the opposite. Born in silk and satin and carrying an<br>unmatched source of magical power. He can control all types of magical elements and even<br>create his own element. That is the reason why he was able to become King of Elysianna<br>from a very young age. However, The Lord is a fair god because the one who has nothing is<br>not without strengths and the one who has everything definitely also has at least one<br>weakness. The weakness of Alexandre de Lux is his weak physical condition. Due to the<br>body's lack of resistance, he is always in a state of thinness, weakness like a drug addict. He<br>wants to catch Zero because he also knows about his existence through a prophecy. That he<br>is a person with extremely good physical condition, a healthy body, never been sick. He<br>must catch him to truly become invincible. <br><br><strong>The Fall of Elysianna</strong><br>There is a prophecy that says that when the balance in Elysianna is lost. At that time, those<br>who are lucky enough to have a large source of magical energy will forget the existence of<br>The Lord, claim themselves to be gods, and stand above even gods. And of course, they will<br>no longer be able to communicate with spiritual entities (this is the reason that Zero has the<br>ability to telepathy). They will find a way to reverse the laws of nature and create many<br>painful destinies. The weak will become weaker, while the strong will become stronger. The<br>society of Elysianna will become increasingly corrupt, the magic that was previously used to<br>create good things will now create poisonous things.<br>When that happens, The Lord will send down a black storm to sweep away all that poison.<br>That's right! This storm sweeps away everything, leaving only ashes. Only then can He<br>rebuild it from scratch to make it a good place again.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2980870/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735526635","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2980870/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1735526635","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2980870/acad0f0ed60030b7da174039df7d85fd7c8c0e1e/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735526635","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2980870/acad0f0ed60030b7da174039df7d85fd7c8c0e1e/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735526635","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"1.
