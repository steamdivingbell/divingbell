The title of the game is Packet Queen and just playing it increases one's technical abilities. Juno lightheartedly decides to give it a go, unaware that the game conceals an outrageous secret...!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDivide up the packets that appear one after another, and aim to get a higher score than your opponent.
