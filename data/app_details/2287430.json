{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Metropolis 1998 is a fresh take on simulation games from the 90s and 00s while applying modern-day features to the city builder genre. As the player, you will be able to see inside of your citizens homes, featuring two different camera modes: classic isometric and top down. Demand is no longer zone based, but driven by your citizens specific needs. As the mayor, you'll be able to set aside land and designate where specific businesses can open up their doors. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2287430/extras/steam_text.gif?t=1737999130\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game features:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> State of the art traffic simulation, capable of pathing around 100,000+ people/vehicles.
