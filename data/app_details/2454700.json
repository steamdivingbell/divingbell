You have complete control over your Kritter: you will need to juggle between your main weapon, heavy weapon, and constructions to protect M.Ark and attempt to escape this hostile planet. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>AN ADVENTURE IN THREE PHASES</strong></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A TIME TO DEFEND</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2454700/extras/Defense_GIF.gif?t=1738957137\" /> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">During a game, monsters will surge towards your spaceship in &quot;waves&quot;. Each time you survive a wave, you'll earn a reward to evolve your Kritter. Will you upgrade one of your attacks? Heal yourself? Opt for more resources? Each game is unique, and your choice will be crucial.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A TIME TO EXPLORE </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2454700/extras/burning_and_looting_small.gif?t=1738957137\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Between monster waves, you'll have a brief respite. This will be your chance to explore the surroundings in search of valuable resources needed to build defenses or improve your Kritter's statistics. However, beware, as this respite will be short-lived! Always keep an eye on the timer because when it reaches 0... Another wave will hit. Don't leave M.Ark defenseless.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A TIME TO PREPARE</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2454700/extras/Construction_GIF.gif?t=1738957137\" /> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">After exploration and defense, you'll have resources at hand. You can then decide how to spend them: Will you create deadly traps? Build upgrade modules? Construct destructive turrets around your spaceship to help fend off the next wave?</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CHOOSE YOUR GAMEPLAY</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your Kritter adapts to your playstyle! You can opt for different classes that drastically change the gameplay. Currently, the game features 3 classes: </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>The Defender</strong>: In this form, your Kritter fights in melee combat with a sword. It can leap into the air and crash down on groups of enemies. The Defender can also build a scarecrow to distract and lure monsters wherever desired. The Defender is sturdy and can construct solid stone walls. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>The Engineer</strong>: Your Kritter fights here at mid-range with a flamethrower. A true war machine, the Engineer also shoots sharp nuts around him. It can place turrets that automatically target your opponents. The Engineer is more fragile than its counterparts but more destructive. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>The Tracker</strong>: Your Kritter wields a sniper rifle here; the Tracker can take down targets from kilometers away. It also has a mortar shot for area damage and can place mines along its path to greet those foolish enough to follow. The Tracker creates barriers that its shots can pass through. Handy! </p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">AN OVERWHELMING THREAT </h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2454700/extras/Defeat_and_coming_back_stronger.gif?t=1738957137\" /></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Despite your efforts, it's highly likely that defeat will occur at some point. M.Ark will then rewind time, bringing you back to its cockpit, and everything will need to be done again... Well, almost everything! You'll be able to upgrade your Kritter or M.Ark between games using soul crystals! These major upgrades will make life easier for you: adding a shield around M.Ark, adding a radar to know where enemies are coming from, enhancing your strength, boosting your resources, increasing your life... The choices are numerous! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A STORY THAT UNFOLDS OVER TIME</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Kritter is a story of time. When you lose, you rewind time; when you play, you battle against time... The story itself unfolds within this temporal chaos. M.Ark is the narrator of the story... But M.Ark suffers from amnesia! With each defeat, with each return to its cockpit, the story will progress. It is through advancing that M.Ark will gradually remember the reason for our presence here. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DYING IS MORE FUN TOGETHER </h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2454700/extras/Multij-steam.gif?t=1738957137\" /></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Kritter is a demanding game that will require you to face death more than once...
