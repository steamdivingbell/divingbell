{"about_the_game":"<strong>Dorfs: Hammers for Hire</strong> is an arcade co-op game about a group of dwarven weaponcrafters and armorsmiths, traveling through the world to wherever the scent of war and gold takes them. Participating indirectly in various battles, the crew of the <strong>Dorfenwagen</strong> only has a limited time to deliver all the armaments that the soldiers request, putting them in a constant race against time and the unstoppable advance of the enemy.<br><br>But watch out, for the workshop is a battlefield of its own. Fires, wrong combinations, mid-air collisions, hopping fireballs, falling icicles and sticky mud, anything can go wrong... and at least half of those things are caused by your own friends.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Co-Op Campaign</h2><i>&quot;A small army has gathered under the command of a young baron, eager to reclaim the lands of their ancestors. As it stands, the baron has heard of us, and we\u2019ve accorded a <strong>handsome</strong> payment for our services throughout his campaign...&quot;</i><br><br>Up to four players can participate in a Campaign that takes them across 5 Regions and 30 hand-crafted levels as they make their way up the Iron Mountain, each with its own layout, challenges and hazards.<br>Help the landless baron to reach the Stronghold atop the mountain! Turn his rabble of untrained peasants into a fearsome company of warriors!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Arcade Modes</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Arcade Classic:</strong> Work together to clear <strong>10 more levels</strong> in any order of your choice. Why not throw an extra <strong>Hazard</strong> in there while you're at it?<br></li><li><strong>Versus Battle:</strong> What better way to stay sharp than some light competition? Hammer against your friends in this <strong>2v2 Versus mode</strong> in any of the <strong>5 arenas</strong> to fight in! Same level, same items, same challenges.

Yes!</h2><strong>Dorfs</strong> can be played with<strong> up to 4 local and online friends</strong> in any combination. Four friends in their own home across the globe? Sure! You and your friend are hanging out and want to include that one guy you met in a lobby 5 years ago? You can play together without a problem.<br><i>&quot;But what if I am a lonely dwarf or my friends aren't always available?&quot;</i> I hear you ask. Not a problem, either!
