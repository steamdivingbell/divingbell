In response to this threat, the government created two pioneering entities: <strong>SEGMED</strong> (Medical Security Brigade), an elite force designed to contain biological outbreaks, and <strong>SIT</strong> (Technological Innovation Secretariat), tasked with developing groundbreaking advancements to revolutionize quality of life.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Together, these institutions introduced a radical solution: <strong>NervoLink</strong>, a revolutionary biomedical implant designed to strengthen the human body against diseases, eradicate disabilities, and optimize health. This device, integrated directly into the nervous system, promised to transform humanity, turning bodies into biological fortresses.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">After a decade of research and testing, in 2031, the government of Chihuahua took the first step toward the future, mandating the use of NervoLink throughout Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. Although skepticism initially ran high, the positive results quickly won over the population. By the end of the year, every resident carried a NervoLink under their skin.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">But something went wrong.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Two years later, a massive meteorite crashes into the desert near Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. The collision unleashes a devastating shockwave, destroying electrical infrastructure and leaving the city in ruins. Fragments of the meteorite are scattered across the region, but the true catastrophe begins when the shockwave impacts the NervoLink implants.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">For most inhabitants, the implants suffer catastrophic failures, damaging their vital systems. Thousands are left paralyzed, unconscious, or dead. Yet some experience unpredictable mutations: their bodies react abnormally to the NervoLink\u2019s materials, transforming them into something else... something inhuman.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As if that weren\u2019t enough, the meteorite\u2019s impact generates a strange phenomenon known as <strong>Black Noise</strong>. This interference attacks the NervoLinks, distorting the users\u2019 senses and progressively damaging their bodies. Worse still, the Black Noise appears to take shape, stalking players in contaminated areas. Only those with a NervoLink can perceive this threat, and confronting it means facing unimaginable terror.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>MAKE YOUR WAY THROUGH THE THREATS THAT STAND IN YOUR PATH</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3370750/extras/BN_Gameplay.gif?t=1736369781\" /></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>A third-person action gameplay experience that will test your survival skills.</strong></p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>SOLVE PUZZLES TO ADVANCE IN YOUR JOURNEY</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3370750/extras/BN_Puzzle.png?t=1736369781\" /></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Put your mental abilities to the test to overcome the challenges blocking your progress.</strong></p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>ANTI-NOISE ARSENAL FOR ENEMIES MADE OF NOISE...</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3370750/extras/BN_AntiNoise.gif?t=1736369781\" /></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Common, conventional weapons won\u2019t work\u2014you\u2019ll need something more... specialized.</strong></p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>THE NOISE HAS A SHAPE\u2026 AND IT\u2019S COMING FOR YOU.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3370750/extras/NoiseMan.png?t=1736369781\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>In a collapsing world, haunted by monsters and stalked by the Black Noise, how far are you willing to go to survive?</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>ADULT CONTENT DESCRIPTION</strong><br>The developers describe their content as follows:<br>This game may contain content not appropriate for all ages or suitable for viewing at work: violent scenes, combat gameplay, and general mature content.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3370750/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736369781","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3370750/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1736369781","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3370750/5da497841a6c2e14697c883bcddabd0943fca09d/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736369781","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3370750/5da497841a6c2e14697c883bcddabd0943fca09d/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736369781","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3370750/extras/Portada_V1.png?t=1736369781\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the post-pandemic world of 2020, Mexico faced a harsh reality: the lack of preparation for a global biological crisis.
