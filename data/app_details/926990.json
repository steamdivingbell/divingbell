{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>NEW! The WOLFQUEST SAGA</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Now released as a free update! The WolfQuest Saga is &quot;the rest of the game,&quot; where pups continue to grow through the rest of the year and subsequent years, becoming yearlings when the next litter is born, and eventually dispersing. Time continues to progress through the years until your-wolf dies -- but then you can switch to play as your mate or offspring. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LIVE THE LIFE OF A WILD WOLF</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> You are a young gray wolf. Born in the Northern Range of Yellowstone National Park, you learned the ways of the wolf in your family pack. Now you are venturing out on your own \u2014 to explore, hunt, find a mate, establish territory, and raise your own family. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EMBARK ON A QUEST FOR SURVIVAL</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your quest begins on the slopes of Amethyst Mountain. Here you must test your hunting skills against elk, moose, and mule deer. Once you're a skilled hunter, you can seek out another wolf to become your mate.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Then, together, you venture to Slough Creek, cutting through the the mountains north of the Lamar Valley, to establish a territory and den site and raise a litter of pups. You must feed them, play with them, protect them from deadly competitors, and take them on a cross-country journey to a summer home. Can your little family pack succeed?</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EXPERIENCE YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Explore WolfQuest's realistic recreation of the Northern Range of Yellowstone National Park \u2014 &quot;the Serengeti of North America&quot; \u2014 where herds of elk and other ungulates roam the sagebrush steppe grasslands, alpine forests, and magnificent high ridges. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">But watch out for packs of stranger wolves, who patrol their territories and don't look kindly on intruders. The wilderness brims with other dangers as well \u2014 grizzly bears, cougars, and coyotes \u2014 who all vie with you for territory and food. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">REALISTIC ECOLOGY AND GAMEPLAY</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">WolfQuest: Anniversary Edition raises the bar for realistic and accurate eco-simulation gameplay:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Live the life of a wild wolf, year after year, watching your your pups grow up and disperse.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Herds of elk roam the land in realistic herds, along with moose, mule deer, beavers, and other prey.  </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Other wolf packs maintain and defend their territory against intruders -- like you. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Grizzlies, cougars, coyotes, and other predators challenge you over your kills -- and protect theirs. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Wolves communicate with each other using natural actions and vocalizations. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dynamic (family-friendly) courtship interactions allow you to choose a suitable mate.  </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Adorable wolf pups who play with each other and with your wolf and mate.  </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Vast wilderness maps (nearly 50 square kilometers) depict Yellowstone's Northern Range.  </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Innovative Age Perks system models the arc of life (and death) of a wild wolf. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Ironwolf mode (optional), live life on the edge: your first death is your last. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dynamic day/night, weather, and seasons immerse you in the wilderness. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Over 100 achievements, plus collectible objects.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MULTIPLAYER!</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Create a public game open to everyone or a private game for friends only.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Co-op multiplayer: Raise your pups together!</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Co-op mission: Claim and maintain territory against rival wolf packs.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">NOTE: Multiplayer does not yet have the new Saga quests, so it currently stops in summertime.
