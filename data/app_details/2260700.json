{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>&quot;Butchers Don't Surf!&quot; will take you on a wild and fun-filled adventure! In each match, you launch your character from a cannon and try to cover the longest distance possible in three electrifying rounds. Accumulate money, access the shop, and invest in new cannons, equipment, and weapons. Upgrade your inventory and take on the challenge of traveling around the world! Plus, unlock unique characters, achieve goals, complete challenging trials, and earn medals. Completing all missions and reaching 100% completion will be so addictive that you'll want to start all over again!</i></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><i>Premise</i></strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>A mysterious object from space is wreaking havoc wherever it passes. Ground vehicles start moving on their own, causing accidents and collisions on the roads. Planes, helicopters, and other aircraft also take on a life of their own, creating chaos. At the same time, wild animals invade cities and attack the population. On an isolated farm in the Alps, pigs gain intelligence and arm themselves. The farmer is overpowered. The pigs spot an enigmatic &quot;monolith&quot; floating in the sky and devise a bold plan to capture it. However, to reach it, they need to navigate the aerial chaos. They retrieve an old cannon and launch the farmer, a retired &quot;human cannonball,&quot; toward the object. Now, they train the man intensely to carry out crucial missions.</i></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><i>Gameplay</i></strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>At the beginning of the game, your only option is to launch the character using a catapult. In three attempts, try to reach the 500-meter mark. Afterward, go to the store and buy a trampoline to further increase your distance. In the next round, aim for 750 meters. Return to the store and purchase a fan to help you reach 1,000 meters. Dodge flying objects and summon gusts of wind to go farther. To defend yourself, acquire a firearm or a belt with capsules that fire disintegration rays, eliminating birds and planes along the way. You can also buy capsules that activate a magnetic field to collect coins during the journey. Later, acquire a cannon and challenge yourself to reach even greater distances.</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2260700/extras/Cannon.jpg?t=1734096218\" /></i></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><i>Medals</i></strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>After purchasing equipment from the barn, a cannon from the yard, or a firearm from the tent, new trials will be unlocked on the medals board.
