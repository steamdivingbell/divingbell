{"about_the_game":"NFT Simulator will give you a first-person view into the wonderful world of the Crypto Bro life. <br><br><strong>Gameplay</strong><br>Your gameplay revolves around minting new NFTs, then playing games to increase their value before you sell them off. The games represent different aspects of the NFT lifecycle, from the initial minting, hyping them up to bring in as many people as possible which increases the price, to the inevitable sell-off. <br><br><strong>Games</strong><br>There are many different games you'll be playing and a higher score in these games will turn into a higher boost in the price of whatever NFT set you were trying to boost. Beware though, if you fail the games and your hype goes too low other people may sell-off, and your NFT will be worthless! Here are some of the games:<br><br><strong>&quot;Hateors&quot;</strong><br>This is a classic meteor shooting game where you try to shoot as many Hater Meteors (Hateors) as possible because fewer haters = more hype for your NFT! <br><br><strong>Pump and Dump</strong><br>This is one of the absolute staples of NFTs, you pump the price as high as it can go and try to sell off before everyone else does, high risk and high reward await those who try to tame this beast! <br><br><strong>Report the Screenshots</strong><br>This game is about typing as fast as you can to report as many haters as you can, and shill the current NFT hype while doing so. The more haters you block, and the more you shill, the higher your value will go! <br><br><i><strong>***This is not legal, financial, or investing advice.
