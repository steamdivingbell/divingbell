{"about_the_game":"Become a millionaire by using your language knowledge. Invite your friends and family and practice your own native language or foreign ones!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMilliopoly's goal is to assess your knowledge.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCareer mode<br />\r\nGradually evolve by answering pre-established sets of questions ranging from basic to advanced levels, going through grammar, reading comprehension, culture, geography, and vocabulary. This is the best mode in which to start your journey through a new language. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRanked mode<br />\r\nPut your knowledge to the test, with limited time for questions, and demonstrate complete mastery of the languages you select. At the end of each round of questions, you will be ranked according to your performance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCustom mode<br />\r\nSelect which languages and which categories of each language you want to practice. Choose how many questions you want to answer and how much time you want to answer each question. As in ranked mode, questions will be shown randomly, between 8 and 20 per round. You will see your final result, points, and the coins you earn! More categories can be unlocked through the in-game shop (no real money needed)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSound check mode<br />\r\nPractice distinguishing minimal pairs such as the 'v' sound vs the 'b' sound or the French 'u' sound vs its 'eu' sound. Available for all languages, unlockable through the in-game shop (no real money needed). More options coming soon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCulture and Geography categories<br />\r\nNow you can practice and learn the cultural aspects and geography of the countries in which the languages available are spoken. Learn about flags, celebrities, idioms, sociolinguistic aspects, and even politics. Available for all languages, unlockable through the in-game shop (no real money needed).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLanguages available: English, Spanish, Portuguese and French.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nComing soon:<br />\r\nThe full version will have more languages (such as Italian), modes, and options. Local and online multiplayer modes are under development, and hopefully, the game will have them soon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe experience you might expect is to be able to practice a range of at least 10 languages, simultaneously or not, in different aspects (such as grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, the cultures of the countries in which they're spoken, listening comprehension, geography, linguistic variations and more), exploring basic, intermediate and advanced levels, clicking, typing, rearranging and maybe speaking.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is supposed to be fun to play with friends or family members interested in languages. It's meant for students in language institutes from around the world, teachers, translators, and anyone who wants to learn, practice, improve or simply have fun with their native language or foreign ones.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou should learn and/or practice the differences between Portuguese from Brazil and from Portugal (and from Angola, Mozambique, etc.), the multiple varieties of the Spanish language, the English language, and others that get to be added.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"A good start!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1822010/4f52eac113011ef139187559727e1ae643fe0dd4.jpg"},{"name":"Studying hard!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1822010/7e10d368287c3b9340c97f1ba9ae55bc7aa4656c.jpg"},{"name":"Language Nerd!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1822010/a5363aa43c11ab892a28115c3a2a560ec89e419c.jpg"},{"name":"\u00a1Arriba!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1822010/892bd20c28d932cf0ecea1bea35d30395b96dd1a.jpg"},{"name":"Su casa, mi casa","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1822010/7238a5c3ec9152d85dbe785ca615f18fdf1598de.jpg"},{"name":"Ol\u00e9, samba!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1822010/ce4386cc2fa685f98c2f950578787ef638a60da8.jpg"},{"name":"Muito prazer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1822010/153dfea539e95cca5c2a9d5e7f10c39fad79aa74.jpg"},{"name":"Bronze Medal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1822010/9a16003a031699f1e981cdecfb43d2f45f69d89c.jpg"},{"name":"Silver Medal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1822010/ce2f1f26f96c4db3a330dc92222b2f47dc58d839.jpg"},{"name":"Gold Medal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1822010/29ddf4601600603a581a85b68c6b0f433dfac981.jpg"}],"total":44},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1822010/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736786863","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1822010/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1736786863","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1822010/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736786863","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1822010/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736786863","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Become a millionaire by using your language knowledge.
