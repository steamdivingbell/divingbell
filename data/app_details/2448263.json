{"about_the_game":"It\u2019s time to roll out, with the help of the Battle Tank Pack Vol.1! Gee-kun-soft\u2019s latest vehicle battler pack focuses on armored tanks that are ready to charge forward and take on the enemy forces. 10 different tanks offer options for combat, defense, and reconnaissance so your players can prepare for any battlefield situation. Each tank comes with a battler and character sprite so you can use them in and out of battles. Face off against armored 8-wheeled vehicles to gain some important intel, and drive anti-aircraft tanks topped with missiles and satellite tanks around the map to stop the enemy from making their way into the hero\u2019s base. Fill your sci-fi games with high-tech tanks that shoot powerful blasts of lasers, and bring out the literal big guns with an enormous tank that travels on railroad tracks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso included are 10 background images to help set the scene. Introduce your players to a city with a view of the shining skyscrapers or the city\u2019s main bridge lit up in the middle of the night, and have an empty field behind your characters when they stop on the side of a dirt road after a particularly challenging battle. And if that wasn\u2019t enough, this pack also includes 83 bonus images of the tanks in action that are perfect for battle cut-ins and cutscenes, along with PSD files so you can tweak the tanks to perfectly fit your vision. So if you\u2019ve been needing some extra vehicles for your military story or just love tanks, pick up the Battle Tank Pack Vol.1 today!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures: <br />\r\n<br />\r\n* 10 tanks includes character sheets and battlers<br />\r\n* full res .psd files included (requires photoshop)<br />\r\n* 10 backgrounds in both 816x624 and 1000x740<br />\r\n* 83 bonus images of the tanks in action<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTerms of Use:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* This pack is for use in RPG Maker Series or the engine of your choice.<br />\r\n* OK to be used in Commercial projects<br />\r\n* Contents can be edited<br />\r\n* OK for use in games with gore<br />\r\n* OK for use in adult-rated games","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2448263/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1688056324","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2448263/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1688056324","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2448263/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1688056324","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2448263/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1688056324","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"It\u2019s time to roll out, with the help of the Battle Tank Pack Vol.1!
