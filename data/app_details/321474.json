With Bream over 19lb and Tench over 14lbs, Bergsee holds some amazing specimens.  <br><br>That\u2019s not all \u2013 Bergsee also contains a brand-new species of fish for you to attempt to catch \u2013 the Perch, including two boss Perch.  <br><br>Key Features of this venue include:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Stunning scenery in foothills of Austrian mountains<br></li><li>27 new boss fish and 12 new achievements<br></li><li>Our biggest Bream, Tench and Roach so far<br></li><li>New species - Perch</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/321474/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1529483583","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/321474/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1529483583","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/321474/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1529483583","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/321474/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1529483583","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Bergsee (Mountain Lake) is found in the foothills of the Austrian mountains where the scenery is as spectacular as the fishing.
