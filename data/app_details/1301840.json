{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><u>\u2022 Maggie the Magnet \u2022</u></h2><br>There's nothing Maggie loves more than scientific experiments! She's an animated magnet, capable of turning her magnetic powers on and off whenever she wants. Sensing the potential for scientific discoveries, she opened her own laboratory and now there's only one key component separating her from having fun and exploring her capabilities... She needs someone to oversee the experiments!
