{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Those who are about to die salute you! </h2>In Gladiators of Citadelum, you will manage a warrior training camp in ancient Rome. Choose the best candidates to train them in different disciplines based on real roman gladiators. Set their routines, buy food and equipment to improve their chances in the arena. Defeat your rivals in epic fights in the most iconic amphitheaters spread throughout the Roman Empire.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Endure the toughest training</h2>Every gladiator is unique. Buy only the best in the gladiator market, and train them in the fighting discipline that better suits their skills. You will want a strong candidate to become a heavy Murmillo, but perhaps you prefer the charismatic fighter that will earn you more denarii... if he survives.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Prepare to draw blood</h2>Improve their chances of victory with a good training routine and a healthy diet. A balanced menu in the mess hall can give them a fighting boost, but don't overlook the importance of a good quality gladius! Buy armor and weapons and keep their equipment in good shape to give them an extra edge in combat. Heal their wounds and they may live long enough to cover you with fame and riches.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Become a legend of Rome</h2>Your fighters will find glory or death in the arena. The people of Rome are thirsty for combat and gladiatorial games are scheduled regularly all across the Empire. Check the calendar and plan your training accordingly for the upcoming fights. The combat in Gladiators of Citadelum is class based, so you'll have to choose your roster wisely for each event. Once everything is set, gladiators will meet their destiny in intense battles, where only one shall be victorious. Will it be you?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3178820/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732267495","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3178820/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1732267495","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3178820/4f7bfebb84245b3c0f083d5a264945ad97462df7/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732267495","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3178820/4f7bfebb84245b3c0f083d5a264945ad97462df7/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732267495","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Those who are about to die salute you! </h2>In Gladiators of Citadelum, you will manage a warrior training camp in ancient Rome.
