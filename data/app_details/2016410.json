You\u2019ll come across a few enemies here and there, but I\u2019m sure that it\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t handle. <br><br>When you do come across a forest spirit, the curse will manifest itself and block you into an area. You won\u2019t be able to leave until you clear that encounter. Alternate between fighting at a distance, shooting feathers at your enemies while bobbing and weaving between their bullets, and piercing through multiple enemies with your dash. Your dash grants you invincibility! Outside of attacking, you can also use it to quickly and safely reposition yourself during an encounter.<br><br>As you gather forest spirits and bring them back to their tree, you\u2019ll grow stronger! Be careful, though, your enemies will rise to your challenge, getting tougher and tougher as the game goes on. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2016410/extras/Gamefeatures.png?t=1670242463\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Pleasant isometric graphics<br></li><li>Boppin\u2019 music<br></li><li>Silky smooth controls<br></li><li>Tough but fair gameplay</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2016410/extras/Aboutdevelopment.png?t=1670242463\" /><br><br>This game was developed as a student project at DigiPen Institute of Technology and was created for educational purposes only.
