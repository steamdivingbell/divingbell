In case that you run into problems follow this list:<br><br>1) Disconnect all the XBOX gamepads from all the PCs<br>2) Connect one by one the gamepads again (Every player should now have input)<br>3) Use the &quot;Play Couch&quot; mode.<br>4) There are some cases that player 2 can control multiple selections, don't worry about that. In the match every player should be able to control their ship.<br>5) Have fun!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/819940/extras/RumRamLogo600Wide.png?t=1616541472\" /><br>We could write lots of nice and carefully placed things about the lore and stuff.
