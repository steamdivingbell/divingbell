{"about_the_game":"<strong>Doubles Hard</strong> is a game inspired by a legendary production <strong>Boulder Dash</strong>, created by Peter Liepa and released by First Star Software in 1984. Unlike the original <strong>Doubles Hard</strong> game, diamonds are collected on a three-dimensional board. The player can move up, down, left, right, in and out. There is also 'grab' move. The use of the three-dimensional board has made it possible to design completely new levels that put the game on an even higher complexity level.<br><br>The two-dimensional version of <strong>Boulder Dash</strong> has been implemented in a huge number of ways and enjoyed well-deserved popularity.
