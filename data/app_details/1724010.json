{"about_the_game":"Inspired by traditional turn-based fantasy strategies and modern auto battlers, we created the fast-paced rogue-lite game about growing a massive army against ever-increasing hordes of enemies.

And you'll need more troops: depending on chosen difficulty level, the number of enemies increased dramatically. The rewards will also boost, though - you'll get more additional growth for your creatures in more difficult zones.<br><br>You can gain gold just by exploring a randomly generated adventure map or from gold mines. Spend gold to increase your troops' growth or improve attack for any troops you have now - or hope to have later.<br><br>You can gain mana just wandering or from mana pools. Mana increases the level of your leader and his unique trait.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Choose your leader</h2><br>Play for a Keeper who increases the health of your troops, an Assassin who makes enemies weaker, or a Necromancer who gains additional dark knights every time after defeating the enemy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Battle System</h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1724010/extras/5.gif?t=1721685978\" /><br><br>The player does not participate in battles but solves important tasks of placing troops and choosing their behavior before starting them. <br><br>As a player, you can decide:<br><br>- Which troops will participate in the next battle, and which ones will remain in reserve.<br><br>- How to split your troops.<br><br>- Where to deploy them.<br><br>- You can choose from two different behaviors for each division. For example, a fire mage can attack all the enemies or the random one with a higher power.
