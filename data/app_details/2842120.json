{"about_the_game":"March 18, 1920.<br />\r\nI've finally checked into my cabin. It's cozy and nice enough. It's a little bumpy, but I think it's something I can get used to. Before boarding, I called my mom in Stowe to tell her that I'm out of touch for the next week - we're going out to sea. My mom wished me a good rest, although her voice gave away a slight anxiety. That's okay, I'm sure this trip will be good for me, and Mom will be patient. It is time to go to bed, I am tired.<br />\r\nMarch 19, 1920.<br />\r\nI slept just fine! I haven't had such a good night's sleep in ages! In the morning I went to Sherry's house to visit. She's in the room next door. Our cabins are exactly the same. Sherry made me happy. She gave me a lovely music box. Except I think I lost the key somewhere in her stateroom. We'll look for it after breakfast. Oh, I think it's time for breakfast in the banquet room. I'm starving, I must hurry!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you progress, you'll need to find keys and open locked doors. Solve puzzles and find passages. A first-person game with elements of horror. Explore the ship and its cabins, collect batteries for your flashlight. Ability to use the camera Solve puzzles.
