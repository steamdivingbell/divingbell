{"about_the_game":"Truth Seekers is an immersive horror multiplayer cooperative shooter game that throws players into the heart of environments where urban legends and folklore monsters reside. Join forces with your friends to track down and confront the legendary Bigfoot, the elusive Stagwalker, and the ominous Roswell. Teamwork and strategy are key as you and your team navigate through dangerous encounters. Be careful as you decide whether to stick together or split up; the wrong choice could lead to the gruesome death of a hunter. To ensure smooth coordination, someone must take charge back at the RV, monitoring players' movements and surveillance cameras to call the shots and keep players informed of their surroundings.
