{"about_the_game":"Alex and her father live in a post-apocalyptic world where the majority of humanity has perished. The world has become a cold, snow-covered place where people communicate with each other at a distance through a system of ground antennas, which frequently malfunction. Our story begins when Alex sets out on a journey to restore the connection in several nearby antennas that have stopped working. This is necessary for safety reasons, but also to allow them to connect with the outside world.<br><br>Under The Snow is an action-adventure game where the player controls the character Alex in a third-person perspective as she embarks on a journey to repair the broken antennas. Along the way, she engages in conversations with her father via walkie-talkie about the events that led to the current state of the world. Occasionally, she must also sneak around to avoid dangerous security drones that protect the antennas from intruders.<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br>    <ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li>Explore the world from a third-person perspective, playing as Alex.<br>    </li><li>Repair the antennas to restore communication with home.<br>    </li><li>Engage in conversations with her father during the journey using a walkie-talkie.<br>    </li><li>Sneak around to evade security drones.<br>    </li><li>Unlock passages by solving simple environmental puzzles.<br>    </li><li>Solve the mystery of the malfunctioning antennas and the world she lives in.<br>    </li></ul><br><strong>Game World:</strong><br>    <ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li>Unique, snow-covered post-apocalyptic world.<br>    </li><li>Blend of narrative-driven adventure gameplay and world exploration.<br>    </li><li>Environmental puzzles that advance exploration and the storyline.<br>    </li><li>An incredible story based on a medieval Scandinavian ballad.<br>    </li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2358390/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732301588","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2358390/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1732301588","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2358390/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732301588","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2358390/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732301588","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Alex and her father live in a post-apocalyptic world where the majority of humanity has perished.
