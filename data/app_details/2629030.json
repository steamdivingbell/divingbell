{"about_the_game":"Automaton is a machine that answers a specific question without human intervention once it is turned on, such as: Whether a + b = c?<br><br>In this game, we will use the simplest automaton model, the Finite State Automaton, to cope with 80 challenges.

Also, you can read the following introduction.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Finite State Automaton</h2><br>Finite State Automaton (FSA) is the simplest automaton type. A finite state automaton consists of several states and transition rules. A transition rule describes when a state transits to another. So, it looks like a metro map. The clients of a finite state automaton are the character strings. It decides which strings are accepted and which strings are rejected. For example, an FSA can accept valid emails, phone numbers, etc. Now, let's dive into the first example:<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2629030/extras/1.jpg?t=1715963956\" /><br>It has two states: the left state &quot;1,&quot; and the right state &quot;2&quot;. &quot;1&quot; marked with the green color means the automaton starts here. &quot;2&quot; marked with the blue color means that the automaton accepts the input string only if it stops here and read all characters in the order of the string.
