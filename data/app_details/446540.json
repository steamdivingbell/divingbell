In Smash Up, players draft two faction decks from their choice of pirates, ninjas, robots, zombies, and more, and combine them to create an unstoppable deck!<br><br>Your goal is to conquer bases, while stopping your opponents from doing the same. Each faction has distinct abilities and ways of playing, meaning that Wizards and Robots will aim to conquer bases in a different way that Wizards and Ninjas would!<br><br>Can your alliance be the first to smash your way to 15 points and win the game?!<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/446540/extras/smashup_banners2.png?t=1670502597\" /><br><br><strong>Aliens</strong> love to mess with people and move things around. You may see your minions jumping back into your hand or the bases in play being replaced with a new one\u2026 After all it\u2019s not their planet they\u2019re messing with!<br><br><strong>Dinosaurs</strong> are huge. And have an enormous amount of power. Plus someone gave them lasers\u2026 Who gave them lasers?! They\u2019re not a force to be reckoned with! If you want powerful minions in your alliance, the dinosaurs are the way to go. <br><br><strong>Geeks</strong> are, well\u2026 Geeks! Slightly eccentric individuals with intellectual pursuits! They can also be thoughtful and tricky! You may also spot a couple of famous Geeks\u2019 in there, so keep your nerdy eyes peeled! <br><br>If you\u2019re sneaky and fast, the <strong>Ninjas</strong> faction is probably the right one for you. Without ever being seen, Ninjas are the ones who focus on destroying your opponents minions and can pull out sly and surprising moves! <br><br>Swashbuckle your way into every base on the board. <strong>Pirates</strong> aren\u2019t known for their pleasantries, and in Smash Up they\u2019re no different. If your opponent has a minion on a base, walk over there and tell that landlubber to walk the plank.<br><br>We all knew it was only a matter of time before the <strong>Robots</strong> learnt how to do things better than us\u2026 and they\u2019re looking to terminate! They\u2019ve learnt how to churn out highly specialized bots that can overwhelm your opponent quickly in a single turn! <br><br><strong>Tricksters</strong> steal things, hide things, swap things and who knows what else! The best thing though? They can stop your opponents things. Make your opponents regret doing things altogether!<br><br>Alakazam! <strong>Wizards</strong>, as you may expect, can conjure whatever they need. Drawing extra cards and playing them in the same turn is what makes these wizards the conjuring experts we all know and love. <br><br>They\u2019re coming to get you... <strong>Zombies</strong> just keep coming back! Discard piles mean nothing if you have the Zombies on your side, as nothing stops the undead!
