You are one of the brave souls who enlisted to be dropped into one such isolated city, fight off the zombies, and rescue as many survivors as you can find. Scavenge, craft, fight, and survive! <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1193340/extras/attack.gif?t=1727715822\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1193340/extras/Zelter_KeyFeatures_localization_En.jpg?t=1727715822\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Scavenge and build to survive</strong></h2>Going in guns blazing will just get you killed. Instead you must scavenge in the city and find resources to craft your own shelter. Work your way from stone spears to firearms. Hunt and forage to stave off thirst and hunger. Go from sitting huddled against the one campfire you built to standing behind barricades and automated turrets.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1193340/extras/scavenge.gif?t=1727715822\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Survive against the odds in Challenge Mode</strong></h2>Prove yourself the ultimate zombie apocalypse hero in Challenge Mode and survive six days of escalating threats! It will be no easy task - you'll need to think on your feet, be smart about your resources and keeping your shelter secure. This is an intense mode of play in which you rescue civilians and risk your life covering their escape. Survive until the evacuation chopper arrives and remember your success is measured in the lives you save. But what\u2019s that deafening roar?

Study their backgrounds and see if they are someone you\u2019d trust to have your back and you just might find you\u2019re no longer fighting alone. It\u2019s up to you to make sure they don\u2019t die of hunger, thirst, or zombie bites. Else you just might find them in the next wave of zombies who come for your flesh. Even the most helpful civilian risks eventually caving under pressure, so be ready to call in the chopper to take them to safety.
