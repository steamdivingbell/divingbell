That's Tooki's motto. Always taking on new recruits under her wing, Tooki brings the team to new heights. Just be careful when she invites you out to lunch; her bill is always enormous!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Coco:</h2> Coco is one tough nut to crack. Raised in a family of fifty noisy brothers, he enjoys a quiet evening alone on the beach with nothing but his thoughts and stamp collection. But get Coco talking about tropical furniture and he'll open right up!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gilly:</h2> There are plenty of fish in the sea, but none are quite as bubbly as Gilly! Born into royalty, she escaped her family's sandcastle to live out her dreams as a furniture mover. Well, that's what she tells everyone around the water cooler. Though the tale does sound a bit fishy...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Clawdius:</h2> This busy little administrator loves filling out paperwork and signing forms, but when there's boxes to move in a pinch, Clawdius will scuttle right to the forefront! You can find him at night naming all the constellations.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">So buckle up, slap on some sunscreen and sail on over to Packmore Island for Movers in Paradise!</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1464740/extras/All.png?t=1614247277\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1464740/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1614247277","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1464740/page.bg.jpg?t=1614247277","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1464740/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1614247277","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1464740/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1614247277","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play on Phone","id":41},{"description":"Remote Play on Tablet","id":42},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>Pack your bags and grab your Haul Pass-port!
