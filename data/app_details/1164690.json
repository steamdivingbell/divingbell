A fellowship of warriors. And only one true King.</strong><br>Wigmund is a story-driven RPG set up in a medieval fantasy world inspired by those cultures - Anglo-Saxon and Celtic - which also inspired J.R.R. Tolkien. Build your fellowship and explore an open-world, rich with outlaw camps, ruined castles, dangerous caverns and forgotten ruins. You are not limited by classes. Develop your knight in favor of speed, health, damage or preternatural abilities.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1164690/extras/1Exploration.gif?t=1709988884\" /><br><br><strong>Unique game-play for swordsmen</strong><br>Control Wigmund's sword with gestures, your mouse becoming an extension of his weapon. It is really different and it might take practice before you can master it. That is not all, getting out of trouble with dodges and rolls is also required! No boss fight can be a simple stand-still hack &amp; slash but an opportunity to prove your sword mastery.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1164690/extras/2Swords.gif?t=1709988884\" /><br><br>Move with WASD, attack once with a left click. Swipe the mouse to your left and your hero will slash to the left, swipe the mouse to your right and your hero will slash to the right.<br><br><strong>Archery</strong><br>The archery build offers the opportunity to engage enemies form a safe(r) distance. As you might expect, this is easier to learn and use than the way of the sword.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1164690/extras/2Bow.gif?t=1709988884\" /><br><br><strong>Professions</strong><br>We have included three professions: <i>Medicine</i>, <i>Crafting</i> and <i>Survival</i>. With <i>Medicine</i> one will be able to craft potions for healing and elixirs that will increase stats for a longer duration. Collecting herbs will play a crucial role in this profession. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1164690/extras/3Medicine.gif?t=1709988884\" /><br><br>With <i>Crafting</i> one can create some auxiliary armor pieces, item upgrades and jewels for enhancing items and weapons. Collecting animal hides and mining will be very important in crafting. And finally with <i>Survival</i> one will be able to fish, hunt and create different gastronomic experiences. And yes... with the proper dwarven fishing pole, one might even fish some treasure.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1164690/extras/4Fishing.gif?t=1709988884\" /><br><br><strong>Detailed equipment</strong><br>In addition to standard equipment items various other character equipment pieces were added, like tomes, knee-guards and arm-guards.
