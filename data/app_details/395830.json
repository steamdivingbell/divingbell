{"about_the_game":"<strong>STORY:</strong><br>As the player, you are \u201clow-fi\u201d, the street name given to those who cannot merge with the platform, a ubiquitous virtual reality simulation where most of the population now live their lives. You are a police officer and have been transferred to a particularly crime ridden section of city-block 303. The only inhabitants of note in your jurisdiction are other low-fi, and the human intelligence (or lower) artificial life forms who have remained among the citizens after the AI singularity.<br><br><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong><br>LOW-Fi is a new kind of experience designed specifically for VR. More akin to a holodeck program than a traditional game. The massive open world has a lot to do, but it's up to you as the player as to what you want to do. This is a completely non-linear world. You can patrol the skies handing out tickets, hang out in the arcade and play games, or try your luck at the casino. How earn and spend your credits is entirely up to you. <br><br>There are tons of upgrades to purchase, from weapon upgrades, to toys for your companions. We want you to roam the world and enjoy yourself the way you want to. We set the stage, but story is in your hands.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/395830/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730756930","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/395830/page.bg.jpg?t=1730756930","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/395830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730756930","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/395830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730756930","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Support","id":31}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>STORY:</strong><br>As the player, you are \u201clow-fi\u201d, the street name given to those who cannot merge with the platform, a ubiquitous virtual reality simulation where most of the population now live their lives.
