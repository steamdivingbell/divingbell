The only thing they agree on is this: your little group isn't going down easily.<br />\r\n\u2022 Gather a group of survivors and lead them to safety. These are common folk, and they can't fight \u2014 but they can help you survive as long as you do the same for them.<br />\r\n\u2022 Survive the calamity with the odds stacked against you. Learn to treasure every piece of equipment you can get, and use every quirk of the battlefield to your advantage.<br />\r\n\u2022 Learn the secrets of a long-forgotten demon lord, confront his terrifying followers, and glimpse his otherworldly domain.<br />\r\n\u2022 Import your victories into the main story.
