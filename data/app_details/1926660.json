{"about_the_game":"Outlander is a blocky platformer game that is fun for all ages.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou start on a dark planet without any tools or items.<br />\r\nAs you explore you gather materials and other objects and you build new or better things in the workshop.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can build a simple house with lights. Even electric lights that you connect via wires to a battery.<br />\r\nLights are very important in Outlander because the dark planet has lifeforms that can kill you instantly on contact! You only have one life, but don't worry, the Save button is only a click away. Remember to use it often. If you get killed it loads the last saved state.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce you completely explore the world it gives you the ability to move to another world. And then to another and another!<br />\r\nEach world has something unique and interesting so you'll never get bored.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd if you unlock all worlds we'll give you a Creative mode to unleash your creativity. It is still in experimental stage but it already is serious fun :)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOutlander is a very new project and will get better with FREQUENT UPDATES. We are determined to make it one of the best games.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHave fun!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1926660/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1694110699","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1926660/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1694110699","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1926660/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1694110699","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1926660/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1694110699","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Outlander is a blocky platformer game that is fun for all ages.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou start on a dark planet without any tools or items.<br />\r\nAs you explore you gather materials and other objects and you build new or better things in the workshop.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can build a simple house with lights.
