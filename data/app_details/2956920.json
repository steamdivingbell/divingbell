{"about_the_game":"Build cities of grungy concrete, rusting metal, and shining neon with the CyberCity Core Tiles pack! PVGames is back with a new CyberCity series, focusing on the bright neon and grimy technology you want when making a modern or cyberpunk world. This pack contains almost 6,500 tiles for you to play with, so get ready to build trash-filled alleyways, opulent apartments, bars filled with bottles and stages for bands, retro arcades, and streets lined with skyscrapers!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDesigned with parallax maps in mind, each tile comes in 8 directions so you can position things exactly how you want them to build your dream maps. Start with floor and wall panels to create your exterior streets (or use some of the included empty interiors for inside shops and houses) and then fill it with detailed 3D tiles to turn it into a busy marketplace where neon signs light up every square foot of space or a trashed side street with barrels filled with wood and broken bottles show that some people are calling that street home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack also includes 40 premade building exteriors so that you can easily add more shops and business fronts to your streets without needing to create each one from scratch. Add a record store next to the pizza shop that acts as your heroes\u2019 base of operations so there\u2019s a good reason for new music to always be playing, and line the more busy streets of the city with towering buildings covered in neon signs advertising anything and everything.
