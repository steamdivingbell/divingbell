{"about_the_game":"A mainstay of BR\u2019s locomotive fleet in the 1990s, the Class 90 was a replacement to BR\u2019s ageing fleet of electric locomotives, and is now available for Train Simulator in two liveries that are ideal for the Great Eastern Main Line London-Ipswich route.<br><br>In the days of British Rail, many high speed services across the UK rail network were operated by Class 90 electric locomotives, often in \u2018push-pull\u2019 formations with a Driving Van Trailer (DVT) and full consist of coaches. Following privatisation of the UK rail network, the fleet was transferred to private operators for both freight and passenger operations.<br><br>A total of 50 Class 90s were built by BREL Works in Crewe between 1987 and 1990 and were designed for a top operating speed of 110mph (180 km/h), operating from 25 kV AC overhead power and producing 5,000 bhp (3,700 kW). The models were also fitted with a Time Division Multiplier (TDM) to operate push-pull trains with a DVT, enabling fast turnaround of passenger services and removing the need for the leading locomotive to \u2018run round\u2019 its coaching stock.<br><br>After privatisation of BR in 1996, half of the Class 90 fleet were transferred to freight traffic, reclassified and modified to operate at a lower speed.
