{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> <br>  Mini-Dungeons Bundle #201-205 </h2>  Mini-Dungeons are short, setting-agnostic adventures for 5th Edition which can be easily inserted anywhere in your campaign. <br> This bundle contains five such adventures for use with Fantasy Grounds Unity (line of sight included). <br> MINI-DUNGEON #201: Patchwork's Pit <br> <br>  5 characters of level 1 <br> <br> The game seems harmless enough: the first team to collect three chickens from the bottom of a steep-walled pit is declared the winner. But Patchwork Mabel--the mysterious figure who runs the contest--is a night hag in disguise. And the peck of Mabel's &quot;chickens&quot; turns flesh to stone... <br> <br> Patchwork's Pit is an introductory adventure designed to start a new campaign. Characters who know each other prior to the adventure might be hired to track down a competitor who failed to return from Patchwork's Pit. Alternatively, the characters might meet for the first time at the pit. In this case, Mabel groups the characters into a team as the adventure begins. <br> MINI-DUNGEON #202: Explosive Bargains <br> <br>  3-5 characters of levels 2-3 <br> <br> The mines of Lord Sharby have been taken over by the kobold miners, and they are armed to the teeth with explosives! The party is hired to bring the kobolds back in line, and the aggressive leader of the miner insurrection is unlikely to back down. <br> But when the exploitative working conditions of the miners come to light, will the party improve the miner's lot? <br> Can they manage to get the kobolds to back down and choose a better leader? <br> Or will they side with the miners and defend them against Lord Sharby's teams of thugs? <br> Either way, <br> Explosive Bargains need to be made... <br> MINI-DUNGEON #203: Zur's Saltwater Smugglers <br> <br>  4 characters of level 1 <br> <br> There are rogues and scoundrels with a heart of gold; smugglers who try to help the downtrodden rise against tyranny, who ply their illicit trade for the greater good of all. <br> And then, there are people like Zur. <br> The notorious half-elf made a fortune smuggling dangerous goods into cities, but now it seems like he has taken on a job that may prove his undoing. <br> Tensions run high in his band of criminals after an escalation of his violent outbursts, and unbeknown to Zur, a ragtag band of heroes are on the way to turn his associates against him and shut down his little organization once and for all. <br> Can the heroes dismantle <br> Zur's Saltwater Smugglers , or will the notorious criminal once more escape his just desserts at the cost of his underlings? <br> MINI-DUNGEON #204: Enou's Extraordinary Food <br> <br>  4-6 characters of level 3-4 <br> <br> Nestled in a forest, atop wooden pillars jutting from a little lake, a cozy stone building with a verbose sign awaits tired travelers. The sign proudly proclaims <br><strong> Enou's Extraordinary Food and a Place to Sleep</strong> . <br> Weary adventurers knocking on the door are greeted by a flamboyant gentleman keen on offering a truly outstanding feast to the rare visitor happening upon his surprisingly luxurious abode. <br> The feast offered is excellent, but the nightmare that follows will repeat unless the adventurers can find a way to best the otherworldly magics of <br> Enou's Extraordinary Food ! <br> MINI-DUNGEON #205: Like Tears in the Rain <br> <br>  4-6 characters levels 3 <br> <br> The Nimbus Forest is known for its perpetual rain clouds, so it is no surprise that the village of Virekot has been abandoned for years. Recently, however, the perpetual clouds of the freakish local weather have started spreading beyond the forest to nearby villages, leaving more and more peasants perpetually wet and in ceaseless gloom. <br> The stormy clouds seem to originate in the ruins of Virekot hidden deep in the rain-shrouded forest. Can the adventurers unearth the truth behind the lost village's ancient rites and end the torrential downpours, or will their blood be washed from the ruin's rocks <br> Like Tears in the Rain ? &quot;","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2341510/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1678200284","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2341510/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1678200284","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2341510/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1678200284","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2341510/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1678200284","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> <br>  Mini-Dungeons Bundle #201-205 </h2>  Mini-Dungeons are short, setting-agnostic adventures for 5th Edition which can be easily inserted anywhere in your campaign. <br> This bundle contains five such adventures for use with Fantasy Grounds Unity (line of sight included). <br> MINI-DUNGEON #201: Patchwork's Pit <br> <br>  5 characters of level 1 <br> <br> The game seems harmless enough: the first team to collect three chickens from the bottom of a steep-walled pit is declared the winner.
