{"about_the_game":"Might is Right is an old-school turn-based strategy game. It has simple controls and deep complex mechanics.<br> <br>You take control of a squad of up to 6 characters, including your hero and 5 mercenaries. You explore a huge world fighting your way through the troops of numerous enemies. Each character gains experience in combat, as well as new levels, increasing parameters and receiving talent points. The number of levels is unlimited.<br> <br>Each character has their own talent tree, offering completely different play styles. The talents allow you to develop tactical roles in combat \u2013 or even change them. For example, fragile mages can turn into full-fledged tanks, harmless healers are able to return decent damage, and damage dealers can heal their allies effectively.<br> <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1152160/extras/Gameplay_0_600.png?t=1653596070\" /><br>Tactical combat games can be simple and fun, but they often lack depth and customization.
