{"about_the_game":"Maze of Memories is a mildly challenging maze puzzle game where the solution - the path from start to finish - is an outline of a known landmark or place from around the world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome of the levels are easier while others are more difficult. It features 3 different sizes for a total of 60 levels:<br />\r\n- 10 levels of 40x40<br />\r\n- 20 levels of 76x50<br />\r\n- 30 levels of 120x70<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll of the mazes are perfect mazes, meaning none of them has a loop in it and there is only one solution.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe controls are done either by the W.A.S.D. buttons or by the arrow keys. Alternatively the mouse can be used as well by clicking on the head of the &quot;snake&quot;. Clicking on it again or using the keyboard movements disables this effect.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe path that has already been taken is marked in the maze. This might help to not to get lost twice in the same dead end.
