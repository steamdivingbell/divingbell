{"about_the_game":"Meer's: Escape is an island version of the classic city simulation. The game expands on some of the deep-rooted tropes of the city-building experience while introducing new gameplay elements to recognize the excitement and challenges of creating and maintaining a real city.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Multi-layered and challenging simulation</strong></h2>Building your city from scratch is easy to learn, but hard to master. As you play as the mayor of your island city, you will be faced with balancing your city's real economy system along with basic requirements such as food, wood, stone, iron, tin, diamonds and much more. Citizens in your city respond to multiple game scenarios with a fluid, dignified and authentic air.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Multipurpose villagers and necessities</strong></h2>It is very difficult to survive in this island city. As the mayor of your island city, rule the villagers in your city. Give them various tasks. Send some to agricultural lands, some to mines. Take care of the villagers' needs and remain as the head of the island.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Multi-purpose buildings and hard-to-obtain resources</strong></h2>It is very difficult to survive on this island. You have to pay a cost for each building you plan to build. With the completion of the construction of the buildings, you will see that various supplies are sent to your warehouse. Use them carefully.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Ensure continuity</strong></h2>Continuity is essential for survival on this island. Resources on the island may run out. But don't worry. You can easily replace any exhausted resource with a new one.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Escape the island</strong></h2>Each building has a different construction cost and each building gives different rewards. Use these rewards carefully. Because you will need these rewards when constructing a building that can help you escape from the island. After collecting all the rewards and feeling ready, escape or stay on the island by completing the last mission.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2246030/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1694735681","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2246030/page.bg.jpg?t=1694735681","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2246030/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1694735681","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2246030/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1694735681","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2264060,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Meer's: Escape is an island version of the classic city simulation.
