{"about_the_game":"Evolve and fight in this creature building Roguelike. Grow a creature by attaching new cells, add mutations to create powerful synergies, fight real-time tactical battles against weird enemies, and strategically choose a path across multiple campaign acts. Inspired by games like Spore and FTL.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build Your Creature</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3010490/extras/build.gif?t=1729191507\" /><br><br><strong>Add new cells to your creature to grow.</strong> Cells can be surrounded by cell walls which add defense, but constrain your growth in the future, so you'll need to strategically balance how your creature grows and where your creature is defended.<br><br><strong>Mutate to gain powerful synergies.</strong> Add a cryostalk to add a chance to freeze enemies to your attacks, then boost the freeze duration by mutating your cells into cryolymphs. Or add some leaves to your cells to add some local healing, boost your healing potential by mutating your cells into chloroplasts, then convert your healing into damage by mutating another cell with exotoxins. There are a staggering amount of possibilities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fight Tactical Battles</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3010490/extras/battle.gif?t=1729191507\" /><br><br><strong>Fight weird creatures in real-time tactical battles.</strong> Many attacks are automatic but you can use special abilities to neutralize your enemy's key cells. Or target the cells that are holding a creature together to literally break them apart from their neural core. Pause the battle mid-combat to evaluate your strategy and decide if you need to keep fighting or flee instead.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Make Your Own Path</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3010490/extras/campaign.gif?t=1729191507\" /><br><br><strong>Choose a Strategic Path Across Three Campaign Acts.</strong> Adding strategy-layer mutations like eyes can help you reveal the encounters on the map so you can pick a path that allows you to avoid battles and find helpful events instead. Or you can challenge extra elite enemies or raid cellular graveyards for extra rewards. You're running out of time though, each move you make takes you closer to a challenging and intense boss fight! Will you be strong enough to survive or will your species suffer extinction?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Choose Your Fighter</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3010490/extras/starter.gif?t=1729191507\" /><br><br><strong>Unlock a Multitude of Creatures and Mutations.</strong> You can start the game as a variety of different creatures, and build them any way you want, or choose a wild start, and build your dream organism from scratch.
