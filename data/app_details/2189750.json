{"about_the_game":"Sergeant, last night we received a signal that an unknown aircraft of extraterrestrial origin had crashed in the taiga. The locals assured us that at the crash site they observed five creatures very similar to humans, only with gray skin and large almond-shaped eyes. When our group arrived there, the flying saucer and the humanoids were no longer there. The locals said that a group of people and a lot of military equipment quickly arrived on the site, they collected every shard of it and fled. Only Professor Stearns, an ex-military man who is serious about the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations, could have done this. If they fall into his hands and he begins to use them for his own selfish purposes, then surely irreparable things will happen on Earth. Your task is to sneak into the base, to eliminate all the guards and release our brothers in mind. Then you'll just have to leave the territory of the base and return to headquarters. Is that clear? Execute.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main mission of the game is to release five aliens that are locked in cells, and to release them each cell needs an individual key. The key to the first cell is somewhere in the base (sector 3), having found it, you can save the first alien who is in cell #1. All subsequent keys will be in places where the aliens are imprisoned. After you save everyone, you need to get to the exit and save yourself. The entire base has a maze-like layout, which is guarded by armed guards. By eliminating one of the guards, you can take his weapons for yourself. The map also has medicines to help you replenish your health and ammo for your weapons. To avoid getting lost in the labyrinth, use the signs that indicate the block numbers. The maze itself is divided into 9 blocks, on the signs with the numbers you will be easier to navigate on the ground. I hope that you enjoy the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nControls in the game WASD - movement, E - lift and use the subject.
