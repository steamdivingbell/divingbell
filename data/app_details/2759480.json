{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Hangar 9 OV-10 Bronco 30cc took the market by storm as our largest giant-scale warbird to date. However, the 108-inch wingspan made it difficult for many pilots to store and transport. The OV-10 Bronco 20cc is a scaled-down version with an 84-inch wingspan that still offers a giant-scale experience but in a more practical size for everyday flying. The three-piece wing makes it possible to remove just the outer panels to transport the center section including the fuselage, booms, and stabilizer with the landing gear extended or retracted. Or you can remove a few more screws to transport and store all of the sections separately. The smaller size also makes it compatible with more affordable and popular 20cc engines and 6S electric power systems.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Like the larger model, this version also features lightweight but strong and long-lasting built-up wood construction. The factory-applied UltraCote film covering and matching painted parts replicate the finish found on the OV-10 aircraft flown by CAL FIRE. And the included decals allow you to personalize your model by applying the nose, N-number, and city name you choose. A variety of details including a pitot tube, antennas, cockpit details, a pilot figure, and more add to the scale finish. Plus, the included electric retractable landing gear set with shock-absorbing and trailing-link struts enhances the scale experience. And it all adds up to deliver a unique and versatile scale model that\u2019s a great choice for more experienced pilots!</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759480/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734547791","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759480/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1734547791","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759480/7551610d21c327ce2e6e2c8e9c9cf633309f7e00/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734547791","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759480/7551610d21c327ce2e6e2c8e9c9cf633309f7e00/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734547791","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Hangar 9 OV-10 Bronco 30cc took the market by storm as our largest giant-scale warbird to date.
