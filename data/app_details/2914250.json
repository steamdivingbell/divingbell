{"about_the_game":"Cosmic Rivers connect a galaxy of rival factions, each striving to secure their territory and assets. The fluctuation in the Cosmic Rivers make it impossible for commanders to properly secure a boarder for their territories forcing leaders to constantly maintain a high level of security on all colonies, industrial factories, and military complexes. In this hostile galaxy you must command your military to absolute conquest of all other planets in your galaxy, only then will your citizens know peace. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOffer no quarter or mercy to your enemies as you march your armies through the galaxy, and expect none for your citizens. Craft your planets to have the best opportunity to both attack nearby enemies, and defend against sudden invaders. Upgrade your ships to improve your chances for survival, specify planets for war by assigning them status of &quot;Assault Planet,&quot; and choose commanders both politically and militarily to lead your people to victory over all others.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2914250/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1715347653","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2914250/page.bg.jpg?t=1715347653","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2914250/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1715347653","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2914250/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1715347653","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Cosmic Rivers connect a galaxy of rival factions, each striving to secure their territory and assets.
