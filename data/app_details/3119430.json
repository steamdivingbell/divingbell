{"about_the_game":"Welcome to the Ascending Realms, a unique approach to a strategy game mixing in both the simple and complex mechanics of different kinds of strategy genres to provide an engaging and fun experience that serves well both the casual strategists and the strategic geniuses alike!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ascending Realms provides a set of unique approaches to the strategy game:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Maps - the game allows for both procedural maps, presets and custom scenarios with editable events, providing an excellent place to battle it out.<br>The procedural maps consist of many shapes and sizes, various terrain shapes and different strategic choke-points that arise naturally. From deep water through the dense forests and sandy beaches to the mountain peaks.<br></li><li> War - A warfare that encompasses different eras, tactics and doctrines, one unit type might prevail in a certain age, but what good would a knight be charging into a machine gun nest? One must keep an eye both on your progress and capabilities and your enemies too!<br></li><li> Intel - Sometimes information is the key to victory! It's difficult to cover all your fronts (the maps are quite sizeable after all!). You will be able to use various techniques to improve your intelligence standing and even counter enemy intelligence.<br></li><li> Variety - A varied strategy is more important than ever, in a world where hard counters may arise faster than ever, one must implement an army comprised of many unit types. In a similar way a variety of resources may be needed to support your varied endeavors, thus increasingly encouraging a mixed economy!<br></li><li> Technologies - You will start in early stages of humanity with only basic settlements and unit available and go up until the modern era (and maybe even a bit beyond!) to achieve your desired dominance over your opponent!<br></li><li> From simplicity to complexity - The game itself starts in a very simple manner, with only a handful buildings and units available for your use as well few resources to store and collect from your environment. Further on however as your discover new technologies you implement new resources or change the existing ones into something more modern and applicable. This will add more difficulty and encourage more strategic movements to conquer or rebuild your existing territories and expand your economy as the need for new varied war materiel grows.<br></li><li> Economy - As said before, economy is an ever evolving process, involving many resources and even more buildings. You will need to think carefully about locating your buildings to both maximize your profit and protect from enemy incursions. Build roads and infrastructure to support your economy and your military.<br>Shape the world to your advantage. Without proper economy you won't build a proper army after all!</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3119430/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735326653","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3119430/page.bg.jpg?t=1735326653","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3119430/a3350828d45c1e365c00ccb77890ffbaa53ddbf1/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735326653","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3119430/a3350828d45c1e365c00ccb77890ffbaa53ddbf1/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735326653","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to the Ascending Realms, a unique approach to a strategy game mixing in both the simple and complex mechanics of different kinds of strategy genres to provide an engaging and fun experience that serves well both the casual strategists and the strategic geniuses alike!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ascending Realms provides a set of unique approaches to the strategy game:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Maps - the game allows for both procedural maps, presets and custom scenarios with editable events, providing an excellent place to battle it out.<br>The procedural maps consist of many shapes and sizes, various terrain shapes and different strategic choke-points that arise naturally.
