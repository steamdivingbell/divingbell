{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Play as the vengeful secret agent Virginia West and take on a silver-obsessed madman known as The Silver Fox in this single-player interactive spy novel. Surveil your enemy, get revenge for your partner's demise, and maybe - just maybe - save the world while you're at it. <strong>Sometimes it's best ... to do your worst!</strong> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Your Mission</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your target is a madman known as The Silver Fox. You may be familiar with villains who lust after gold, but not so with this guy. He loves silver and despises gold - so much so that <strong>he plans to destroy the Golden Gate Bridge!</strong>  Even though it's not gold at all! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We previously sent in your partner, Franklin Benjamin, to deal with the situation and protect the bridge. But unfortunately, he's been lost in the line of duty, so this mission now falls to you, Virginia West. Get close to this madman, unravel his scheme, and stop him in his tracks. The fate of a national landmark rests on your shoulders and your shoulders alone. This is a single-player game, after all </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong><i>There's Always a Madman: Do Your Worst</i></strong> can be played with just a mouse. Gameplay consists of selecting the action or dialog you wish to take given the situation you\u2019re facing.

Like a classic James Bond novel or film where you can pick any one up independent of the rest, you can pick this story up without having experienced any prior stories in the <strong><i>There's Always a Madman</i></strong> franchise.

Put your mind to good use and make intelligent in-the-moment decisions on how best to handle your current predicament. Only by out-thinking your opponents can you survive to tell the tale </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>I Expect You to Die</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This madman has killed one of our own, but revenge is a dish best served cold. Get close to him and make sure the bridge is out of danger before you put this guy six feet under </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Sounds Like a Winner</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Although the game is text-based like a novel, an emphasis is placed on visuals and music to set the appropriate mood for each scene, changing based on whether you're in a safe location or you're exposed to danger. It also features a theme song (with lyrics) written specifically for this game </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Short and Not So Sweet</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong><i>There's Always A Madman: Do Your Worst</i></strong> aims to be about the length of a movie for a single playthrough (roughly two hours). During that time, you may very well have to do some not-so-nice things to succeed. But that's okay - as they say, well behaved women seldom make history </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">For reference, here are some similar games outside the <strong><i>There's Always a Madman</i></strong> series to help you get a further sense for what the There's Always A Madman games are like: Perfect Dark (and James Bond games like GoldenEye), No One Lives Forever, Alpha Protocol, Mission: Impossible N64, Splinter Cell games, Henchman Story, Agent A: A Puzzle in Disguise, Framed, I Expect You To Die, Batman Telltale Series, The Wolf Among Us </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Q: Why make this game text-based?
