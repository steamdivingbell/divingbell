{"about_the_game":"Adapt is a survival evolution game designed to simulate the constantly changing environments which life must navigate to thrive. To succeed, your species will need to find food using a multitude of dietary strategies, seek out habitable environments, and react to changing seasons, and global climate. Your competitors will evolve alongside you, vying for food and territory to ensure their own survival.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/888780/extras/Header-Create.png?t=1727957785\" /><br><br>Deep species customisation allows you to adapt to whatever the environment throws your way.
