{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Space Combat Action / Simulation</h2><br>Allegiance uses a unique Newtonian flight model which perfectly balances fun with flight. Space ships turn, slide and boost. You have fluid control of your ship in a wide variety of combat types. Select an agile scout, a hidden stealth fighter, an in your face interceptor or an all around fighter. Or, perhaps you would like to team up with a few friends and pilot a base killing bomber while your friends man the turrets. Get even bigger in a full line of capital ships with better fire power, and even more turrets, and a wide range of support ships all controlled by your teammates. Play it your way; even the sky is no limit.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Real Time Strategy</h2>Allegiance is also a fully formed RTS with tech trees, exploration, base building, and resource gathering. But there\u2019s a twist: most of your ships are flown by real human beings! As the commander of your team, you bring your strategic vision to life by gives direction to the team from an overhead command view. Allegiance melds RTS elements like steering expansion by building new bases, investing in technology upgrades to a seamless command experience designed to help you lead your team to ultimate victory.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unique Gameplay</h2>Allegiance is easy to learn. Hop in a ship and start flying. Get with a wingman and start achieving your goals: exploration, map control, research and resource collection and best of all, end game dominance. Allegiance is deep.

Maps are broken down into several sectors connected by wormholes, which contain resources vital to your team\u2019s survival. But not only finding resources, but also observing the movements of the enemy is vital to your team\u2019s success. Each team has a shared view of the world, seeing only what at least one of its scanners (from ships, bases and deployed sensor probes) picks up.
