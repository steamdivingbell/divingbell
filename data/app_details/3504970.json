{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You are the CEO of a leading company that designs and builds spacecraft. Your goal now is to establish yourself as the top spacecraft designer by competing against other companies with superior designs and combat performance. To build your spacecraft, you must efficiently place blocks with various functions and strategically utilize each block's characteristics to create a powerful ship.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The success of your spacecraft in combat against other companies' designs will determine your company's rank. Winning battles boosts your company's ranking, and successful designs and combat results are key to increasing your company's reputation and competitiveness. However, simply placing many blocks does not make a strong spacecraft. Strategic placement of each block, according to its unique characteristics, is crucial. A well-designed spacecraft can achieve high efficiency even with a limited number of blocks.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The blocks come with four types of operations and three operational modes, each with specific enhancement requirements. Enhancing each block requires certain resources, which can be acquired through combat or supplies. By acquiring new blocks through supplies, you can maximize your spacecraft's performance. Additionally, unused blocks can be disassembled to obtain resources, offering an opportunity to optimize the use of available assets in the design.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Some blocks require interaction with others to function properly, and understanding and utilizing these interactions is key to spacecraft design. As you acquire different blocks through supplies, you must examine their functions and requirements, and plan how to effectively arrange them. Certain blocks may require others to operate, and this must be taken into account in your design.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the process of designing and enhancing your spacecraft, it is vital to understand each block's characteristics and functions. Using the experience and resources gained from combat, you will create a powerful spacecraft. The effectiveness of block placement and enhancement will determine the performance of your ship, so careful strategy is necessary.
