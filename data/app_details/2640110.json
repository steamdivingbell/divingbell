Retell your story to an operative of MI6's secretive &quot;Witchcraft Research Center&quot;, as you recall navigating your brutal blinding at the hands of a cosmically warped child. Relive each moment as your character is slowly consumed by an unknowable force that permeates the halls, with your actions aiding or resisting this consumption, altering the trajectory of the narrative.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2640110/extras/TouchMode.gif?t=1727536600\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hauntingly Idyllic</h2>Set in the idyllic southwest of England during the early years of WWII, the game captures the distressing reality of wartime evacuation. Uncover the sinister transformation of innocent evacuees and their carers into monstrous beings, The Chosen and The Rejected. These mentally and physically corrupted beings, once people, are now in thrall or completely mindless, as they relentlessly seek to hinder you, toy with you, or simply tear you apart. Unable to see these enemies you must listen for them, smell their rancid flesh, and carefully feel your way around so not as to cause a loud noise and alert them.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2640110/extras/InspectionMode.gif?t=1727536600\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A War Like No Other</h2>The war you fought has long past but now your primary battlefield is the large house you found employment at. You remember the corridors and rooms well, but memory is not perfect, and many smaller items of use may be hard to find. You will have to feel around cabinets, tables, and even the floor, to find the tools you need to complete your escape. Unable to adequately fight in your current state, and with your enemies being the very people you considered friends and wards before this all happened, the only way out is with delicate navigation and caution.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2640110/extras/UIHeal.gif?t=1727536600\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Each Step Into The Unknown</h2>Your pain and intoxication will be in a fine balance as you attempt to stem the pain of your eye wounds and any other injuries you sustain with what medical assistance you can find. Brace yourself for a terrifying descent into darkness and the unspeakable horrors that await in Bucknowle Manor. You're a veteran of the Great War, and even blind you're tough, you may get one chance to throw them off if they reach you, but you can't defend yourself forever. Always remember: just because you can't see them, doesn't mean they can't see you.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2640110/extras/StruggleMode.gif?t=1727536600\" />","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2640110/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727536600","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2640110/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727536600","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Eye related mutilation, implied horror based violence involving children, strong themes of horror, and usage of alcohol and morphine as pain relief."},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Demo Gameplay Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Memory Vision: Navigate the world as a blinded character, relying on vague outlines of walls and static objects, while small or moving objects remain unseen.<br></li><li>Particle Vision: Tune in to a unique system of particle and wave effects to perceive sounds, smells, and collisions, adding a new dimension to your surroundings.<br></li><li>Touch Mode: Interact with your immediate vicinity using a wide area of touch to find large objects or handle objects like doors.<br></li><li>Inspection Mode: Use a more precise and detailed touch to discover small objects.<br></li><li>Pain and Intoxication: Balance your character's pain and intoxication levels.
