Currently, you can buy the previous title 2021 for around 600 yen and 2018 for 200 yen, so you might as well be satisfied with that one.\u201d<br>positive \u2013 YOSHI_KUMA<br><br>\u201cOK, so I'm a sucker for agribusiness games and the FM series has always been enjoyable, if a little rough around the edges.  They actually made a step change with this one; there's a lot more moving parts, and for the most part they work well and it's refreshing.  There's a few janky bits and some early access hiccups but it's in better shape than a lot of EA releases, the development team are actively soliciting feedback and have already pushed a more glaring balance fix.  As it stands it's in the region of 15GBP; I've already got my money's worth and it's a chill little farm game.\u201d<br>positive \u2013
