Industries are attempting to control humanity through the use of microchips implanted in people's brains, forcing them to lead a life of slavery under a strict routine of work, sleep, and repeat. However, some individuals rebel against their oppressors, sparking a war against the ruling elite who control the world in secret. In 2201, the top 1% of society, who were losing the war, spread a virus as a last resort to try and contain the rebellion. This virus quickly got out of their control, turning humanity into mutants and zombies. A few have survived in bunkers or sewers, but now, after 30 years of living underground, it is time to reclaim their rights and take back the surface world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2172320/extras/LARGEWORLD.png?t=1728751179\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2172320/extras/Large_world_LW.gif?t=1728751179\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You start alone with nothing but quickly find your way in this treacherous and dangerous world.
