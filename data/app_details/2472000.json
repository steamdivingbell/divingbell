{"about_the_game":"Immerse yourself in the enchanting world of Sap, a unique meditative single-player game about nurturing an ever-evolving ecology. Witness the wonder of a bizarre, expanding and collapsing environment that you control with strategic tile placements. Choose from biomes, mechanical elements, and a plethora of organisms to adorn your board, and marvel as surprising interactions unfold.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2472000/extras/Gif_01.gif?t=1689704650\" /><br><br>Experiment and explore layer upon layer of complex mechanics, unfolding new challenges and strategic avenues as you progress. Keep in mind, with each turn, you surrender control over your tiles - so think ahead and plan your layout carefully.  Each turn you'll be offered 5 new tiles to select from, and with limited energy to pay for them per turn, you'll have to be strategic.  The goal of sap is to explore, more than to win - but let the board fill up and it's game over!  Try and balance the ecology to prevent system-wide collapse while seeing how many tiles you can discover!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2472000/extras/Gif_large.gif?t=1689704650\" /><br><br>Designed not to be obtuse, but to foster curiosity, Sap invites you to lose yourself in its unique ecosystem, stimulating your mind while soothing your senses. Venture into this extraordinary game, where strategy meets serenity, and every playthrough reveals something new!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2472000/extras/Gif_02.gif?t=1689704650\" />","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2472000?t=1689704650","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2472000?t=1689704650","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2472000/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1689704650","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2472000/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1689704650","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Immerse yourself in the enchanting world of Sap, a unique meditative single-player game about nurturing an ever-evolving ecology.
