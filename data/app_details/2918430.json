{"about_the_game":"Kinetic Anatomy 3D offers a wealth of 3D animation demonstrations of human muscle and skeletal movements, allowing users to study anatomy efficiently and is suitable for teaching demonstrations within a certain scope. It includes four modules in terms of animations: demonstrations of basic kinematic movements of human joints, gait analysis, resistance strength training, and demonstrations of abnormal postures and positions, along with a static anatomical learning scene that encompasses all the structures of the human musculoskeletal movement system. Kinetic Anatomy 3D employs a list-based structure point selection control strategy, enabling users to select anatomical structures either in the 3D view or in the list. The software also features the ability to save custom presets and custom groupings, making it very user-friendly. The 3D rendering of Kinetic Anatomy 3D is based on the open-source Godot engine, ensuring the safety and controllability of the development process.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2918430/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724514687","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2918430/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1724514687","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2918430/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724514687","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2918430/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724514687","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2983420,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Kinetic Anatomy 3D offers a wealth of 3D animation demonstrations of human muscle and skeletal movements, allowing users to study anatomy efficiently and is suitable for teaching demonstrations within a certain scope.
