{"about_the_game":"The Tribe Game is a story-driven roleplaying game where the player creates their own custom character and steps into a unique, atmospheric post-apocalyptic world where hope prevails, inspired by the classic cult-hit TV series, 'The Tribe'. Taking centre stage in the story, the player interacts with a large range of characters and 'tribes', each of whom is seeking to build a new world, and will help shape their lives and destinies. There are many diverse places to explore, quests to be accomplished, professions to level up, items and resources to be found, battles to be won, friendships to be made and adversaries to be challenged... as the player experiences all of the humour and unpredictable drama in the world of The Tribe - and tries to keep their own (and their tribe's) dreams alive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Interact with a large cast of Characters and Tribes!</h2><br><br>Fate will make your character cross paths with many other survivors who are struggling to create a new world, including some familiar faces to those who have watched The Tribe TV series.  For those new to The Tribe, your character will quickly discover who are the other protagonists of this world. Some will be friendly, some will be hostile, some in need, while others threaten the future of the already fragile world.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1904330/extras/Characters_The_Tribe_Game_TV_Series.jpg?t=1654059049\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore a Post-Apocalyptic World (and be instrumental in creating a better future)</h2><br>Travel through lots of contrasting, atmospheric locations...
