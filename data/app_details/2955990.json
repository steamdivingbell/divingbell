{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">From accomplished developer Reppo, the remarkable EMD GP60M \u2013 and its cabless sister, the GP60B \u2013 comes to Train Simulator Classic! The GP60M and GP60B duo is featured in the classic AT&amp;SF Warbonnet livery and the vivid colors of Santa Fe successor BNSF.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In 1990, the Santa Fe Railway christened its armada of high-speed priority intermodal trains as the \u201cSuper Fleet,\u201d and reintroduced the railroad\u2019s magnificent and legendary \u201cWarbonnet\u201d red-and-silver livery. To power the Super Fleet, AT&amp;SF ordered new locomotives from Electro-Motive and General Electric, and the first to enter service, in May 1990, were the railroad\u2019s striking, powerful, and distinctive GP60M diesels.   </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Santa Fe Railway was always famous for flash and speed. Such was true in the era when its flagship was the \u201ctrain of the stars,\u201d the luxurious Super Chief, and such was true when its premiere trains were hotshot, transcontinental intermodals. For the Super Fleet of the 1990s, Santa Fe ordered 63 custom GP60Ms which were equipped with North American design cabs, and the railroad followed up with an order for 23 cabless GP60B sisters which were built in 1991. Each type wore Santa Fe\u2019s Warbonnet livery, and in something of a throw-back to an earlier era, the diesels often would operate in \u201cA-B-B-A\u201d lash-ups. In another nod to history, the GP60M units were assigned AT&amp;SF road numbers 100-162 (Santa Fe\u2019s landmark FT diesels which largely dieselized the railroad during World War II also carried 100-series road numbers). Santa Fe GP60Bs were assigned road numbers 325-347.   </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Like the standard Electro-Motive GP60 (of which Santa Fe operated 40 units), the GP60M and GP60B were 3,800-horsepower, four-axle locomotives powered by EMD\u2019s 16-cylinder, two-stoke 710G3 powerplant. And as was typical for EMD locomotives of the time, the stylish locomotives were constructed at General Motors\u2019 London, Ontario, Canada facility.   </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Santa Fe\u2019s GP60M and GP60B diesels served at the forefront of \u201cSuper Fleet\u201d operations in the early 1990s. In 1996, Santa Fe and Burlington Northern merged to form today\u2019s giant BNSF. Initially, the diesels retained their Warbonnet liveries with large BNSF lettering and it was not long before the speedsters also began hauling intermodal traffic on ex-BN routes such as that over Marias Pass. By the early 2000s, the diesels increasingly appeared in BNSF orange and green (and would wear various versions of BNSF liveries). Today, more than three decades past their entry into service, the GP60M and GP60B diesels remain in main line service for BNSF, assigned to a wide range of services throughout the sprawling system.   </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Created for Train Simulator Classic by talented developer Reppo, the GP60M and GP60B diesels are superlative and accurate re-creations of these distinctive and powerful diesel locomotives. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The unique, handsome diesels are featured in AT&amp;SF Warbonnet and BNSF liveries. The GP60M pack includes four realistic career scenarios, two each on the Raton Pass route (featuring Santa Fe operations) and the Marias Pass route (featuring BNSF operations). The locomotive is also Quick-Drive compatible.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The story of the EMD GP60M began in 1990 with a flash of brilliant red and silver, and it continues today across the BNSF system.
