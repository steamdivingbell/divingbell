{"about_the_game":"Classic <strong>turn-based dungeon crawling</strong> with an <strong>80s action movie</strong> twist! You know the drill: four directional grid based movement, 90 degree rotation, you-go-they-go turns in combat, puzzles and secrets and loot galore. But instead of heading into a basement to fight rats with Yesterday's Knife and a two-copper pleather frock, you're a one man army raiding an island full of non-specific international terrorists with your impossibly huge gun and no shirt!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3016480/extras/eotc_commando_booty.gif?t=1726591271\" /><br><br>First Person dungeon crawling in Third Person, a combination we proudly call <i>Thirst Person Dun--</i><br><br><strong>Update</strong>: Legal has advised us to choose a different label for our unique blend of genres.
