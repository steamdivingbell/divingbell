{"about_the_game":"Is your child curious about the world? Do you want your kid to discover the answers for bothering questions on its own? After all, the most effective way of learning is exploring instead of receiving ready solutions! This is the reason, why we\u2019ve created Professor Why Chemistry\u2122 - the game, which teaches through play and enables players to run chemical experiments at home. However, you don\u2019t need money for reagents or chemical apparatus. Your kid won\u2019t be exposed to the damaging influence of chemicals, because experiments will be carried out virtually - thanks to the Augmented Technology (AR) which we implemented in our game. But you don\u2019t need to buy expensive sensors to use the AR, the only thing you need is simple webcam or even mouse!
