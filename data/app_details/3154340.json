{"about_the_game":"<i>Rationality has gone out the window, and horrors are creeping in from the remote corners of the world. It wasn't supposed to be your problem to deal with, but here we are.</i><br><br>The Dawn Obscura is an old school role-playing adventure with turn-based hex-based tactical combat. It's set in a world that's experiencing a breakdown of rationality and an infestation of the supernatural. This is not a positive development, in case you were wondering.<br><br>The player will create one character of one of the five main classes, and will evolve this character through the choices they make as they progress through the world. Along the way the player will gather a party of allies, each with their own agenda, personality and abilities. To interact with other characters, the player will use a branching conversation system with skill checks and choices based on previous actions.<br><br>Combat is light on stats and has simple rules, a bit like chess, but a lot shorter. Players will have five classes to choose from: <ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>man-at-arms one handed + shield + any armor)<br></li><li>vanguard (two handed/polearm + any armor)<br></li><li>fencer (dual weapons + light armor)<br></li><li>marksman (ranged + any armor)<br></li><li>spellcaster (spells + light armor).</li></ul> No party will be able to have all of these classes at the same time, so every party composition will need different tactics to be successful in combat.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3154340/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727647015","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3154340/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1727647015","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3154340/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727647015","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3154340/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727647015","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<i>Rationality has gone out the window, and horrors are creeping in from the remote corners of the world.
