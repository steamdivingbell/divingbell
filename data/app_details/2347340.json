You are a Mage who, using your deck of cards, can summon spells or create units with unique abilities to fight under your control. <br><br>The game has two main modes of play: adventure mode where you progress to unlock new spells and units, and player vs. player magical combat where each Mage uses their deck to defeat the opponent. <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2347340/extras/Slidemagi_level001.jpg?t=1720543745\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features: </h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Sliding: Units move by sliding the lines.
