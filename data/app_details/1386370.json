Krumit's Tale involves the same core deck building mechanics as Meteorfall: Journeys and the same cast of overly optimistic heroes, but expands the \u2018swipe\u2019 mechanic into a dynamic grid based system. This means more depth and longevity \u2013 our heroes will have to choose perks to complement their deck-building strategy and carefully manage the board if they wish to triumph.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><strong>Unique roguelike gameplay</strong><br>Your hero starts out with a deck of basic cards (items &amp; abilities).  At the start of each dungeon, your hero's deck is shuffled into the dungeon deck (monsters) and dealt out in a 3x3 grid.  Defeat monsters to earn gold, then use that gold to acquire your items &amp; abilities from the dungeon.  Remove a tile from the dungeon and a new one will be dealt out from the dungeon deck.  After you clear a dungeon, you'll earn new, powerful cards to add to your deck as well as perks - passive traits that bend the rules of the game.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1386370/extras/bossbattle.gif?t=1596989321\" /><br><br><strong>Colorful characters</strong><br>The exciting and colorful cast of Meteorfall: Journeys (iOS &amp; Android) returns in Krumit's Tale.
