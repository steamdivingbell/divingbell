It's more about exploration and fun. We pick up things and carry them to their places. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDue to the fact that things have different shapes and sizes, you will have to puzzle over how to deliver this or that thing to the place on time. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDifferent things fall out of the window of the house, you need to pick them up and carry them to the castle, placing them in places marked in green.
