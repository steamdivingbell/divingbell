{"about_the_game":"In Spiritual Prophecy, you are entrusted with a sacred mission: to save an innocent spirit from the clutches of malevolent entities that torment it. This game, set in a horror atmosphere, challenges you to confront dark forces and protect both your own life and the life of the needy spirit. Before the game starts, you can choose up to three special abilities, known as blessings, which will provide powerful aids on your journey. However, these blessings will not all be available at the start; they will be unlocked as you save more tormented spirits.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThroughout the game, you must collect four fragments of faith scattered throughout the dark environment. These fragments are vital because, upon gathering them, you will activate a sacred altar. This altar is the key to saving the tormented spirit, freeing it from the malevolent forces surrounding it. However, the task is not easy: if either of your lives reaches zero, the mission will fail, and both will succumb to the darkness.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTherefore, it is crucial to balance your actions, ensuring your own survival while protecting the innocent spirit. Use your blessings wisely and explore the environment cautiously to find the fragments of faith. As you progress and save more spirits, new blessings will be unlocked, expanding your combat and strategy options. In the game, you will need to dodge attacks and counter-attack to protect yourself and the spirit. Focus on saving the spirit and achieving victory in Spiritual Prophecy.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2973610/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734376577","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2973610/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1734376577","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2973610/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734376577","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2973610/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734376577","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In Spiritual Prophecy, you are entrusted with a sacred mission: to save an innocent spirit from the clutches of malevolent entities that torment it.
