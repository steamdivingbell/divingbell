{"about_the_game":"<i>Up in the Air</i> is a zany, open-world game in which you play a balloon dog exploring a demented carnival populated by crazy children. Players must use a variety of power-ups, from water balloons to ground pound, to fend the kids off and collect carnival tickets. Players can burn Big Weenie, knock over a castle, trap children in a cardboard jail, master hopscotch, become radioactive, turn off the sun, or get popped by a cactus. If they are particularly unlucky, they could even find the notorious child Chunkles and his gaping maw.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Open world sandbox-style gameplay set in an amusement park<br></li><li> An achiever's dream with dozens of challenging mini-games<br></li><li> Fun hidden puzzles and prizes throughout the park<br></li><li> Casual, silly gameplay and mild, subversive humor that will appeal to kids and adults</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Notes:</h2> <ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <i>Up in the Air</i> is published by SMU Guildhall and developed a small student team at SMU Guildhall over a development cycle of 16 weeks.<br></li><li> Proceeds from your purchase of <i>Up in the Air</i> on Steam supports the students.
