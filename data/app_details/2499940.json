Players can choose between various heroes with unique abilities and playstyles. Shattered Lands seeks to put a twist on the genre by making a more casual and fun approach to combat while maintaining the planning/strategy elements of classic RTS games.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2499940/extras/combat-final.gif?t=1737341381\" /><br><br><strong>FEATURES</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Lead an expedition to explore and conquer the newly formed islands<br></li><li>Manage resources strategically and construct a settlement to establish a lasting foothold on the land<br></li><li>Lead from the front by taking direct control of your hero in a fast paced combat system<br></li><li>Level up your hero and adquire new talents and abilities throughout the course of each match<br></li><li>Find lost treasure and powerful runes scattered throughout the land to aid you in your conquest<br></li><li>Fight the mysterious Edra(PvE) with scaling levels of difficulty, or against rival kingdoms(PvP)<br></li><li>Battle alongside your friends in co-op against the Edra or even PvP matches(2v2), sharing the settlement and resources with your teammate</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2499940/extras/story-resized.png?t=1737341381\" /><br>Once upon a time, there existed a magnificent kingdom, where harmony and prosperity flourished among its inhabitants. However, this idyllic existence was shattered one fateful night when a fiery meteor streaked across the sky and crashed into the heart of Verdantia. The impact unleashed a cataclysmic force that tore the kingdom asunder, transforming it into a scattered archipelago of fragmented islands. Once the dust had settled, the King dispatched his greatest heroes to explore the newly formed islands, only to uncover a malevolent force eager to seize control and plunge the world into eternal darkness.<br><br><strong>STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT</strong><br>In Shattered Lands, most of the base and unit management is simplified. Workers will build, repair, and gather resources without the need for any direct commands. Combat units can be ordered to follow the player where ever he goes, fighting alongside him. Recruiting units and constructing buildings is as simple as a click of a button, allowing the player to focus on the ongoing battle directly. <br>Have a friend that doesn't enjoy managing a base? No problem. In co-op, both players share the same base and resources, allowing one player to single-handedly manage the base entirely.<br><br><strong>COMBAT</strong><br>Combat in Shattered Lands is action based and naturally chaotic. There are no basic attacks in Shattered Lands. All entities have unique attacks and abilities that they use autonomously during combat, often associated with an area of effect and knock back displacing targets hit. Each Hero has access to a set of 5 (or more) unique abilities to use during combat, along with a set of unlockable talents that upgrade your character as you level up. Knowing each unit's abilities and behavior is essencial for victory in this fast paced action oriented combat.<br><br><strong>PLANNED UPCOMING FEATURES</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>New playable races with their own unique heroes<br></li><li>Additional neutral and Edra enemy types<br></li><li>Story Mode</li></ul>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2499940?t=1737341381","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2499940/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1737341381","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2499940/613e770aabcc9cfa66ff5f02ece4a2bb77174a71/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737341381","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2499940/613e770aabcc9cfa66ff5f02ece4a2bb77174a71/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737341381","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":" Join the official Discord!<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2499940/extras/strategy-final.gif?t=1737341381\" /><br>Shattered Lands is a simplified real time strategy game where you can manage your units, buildings and resources from a top-down perspective, and the player can also take direct control of a hero on the battlefield from a third person perspective and fight enemies head on!
