The artwork is of course very 1992 but that's nothing to criticize in a 1992 game. What counts is that this a fun game - I found many of Rex's remarks and object and location descriptions very witty, even though not everyone might like Rex's kind of humor. But I did and that's why Rex Nebular and the Cosmic Gender-Bender gets an A- from me.\u201d<br />\r\n91 \u2013 Just Adventure<br />\r\n","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/328430/ss_128892ce2b42f41a803aec91652a9200d36d3071.1920x1080.jpg?t=1689356902","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/328430/ss_128892ce2b42f41a803aec91652a9200d36d3071.600x338.jpg?t=1689356902"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/328430/ss_5d747a818cde34efd02a9220f9bebebf42173845.1920x1080.jpg?t=1689356902","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/328430/ss_5d747a818cde34efd02a9220f9bebebf42173845.600x338.jpg?t=1689356902"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/328430/ss_986aba87bab8fd714d586c90ea22bfa18091ae8a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1689356902","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/328430/ss_986aba87bab8fd714d586c90ea22bfa18091ae8a.600x338.jpg?t=1689356902"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/328430/ss_4470e5aa04694e01419f36f384875ba4b7eefb86.1920x1080.jpg?t=1689356902","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/328430/ss_4470e5aa04694e01419f36f384875ba4b7eefb86.600x338.jpg?t=1689356902"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/328430/ss_1285f057850daebcf369610a609d0bdd189f189c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1689356902","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/328430/ss_1285f057850daebcf369610a609d0bdd189f189c.600x338.jpg?t=1689356902"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/328430/ss_7f52ae8ff457010e5b3ab52f5f67a307f5d7883d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1689356902","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/328430/ss_7f52ae8ff457010e5b3ab52f5f67a307f5d7883d.600x338.jpg?t=1689356902"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/328430/ss_48644ba1a1ab31e4cb20190bf147a9ba1f087066.1920x1080.jpg?t=1689356902","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/328430/ss_48644ba1a1ab31e4cb20190bf147a9ba1f087066.600x338.jpg?t=1689356902"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/328430/ss_ee5738aac2a86de2abb5b850ae77366e464b9d4b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1689356902","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/328430/ss_ee5738aac2a86de2abb5b850ae77366e464b9d4b.600x338.jpg?t=1689356902"}],"short_description":"A priceless vase is lost on a distant planet that doesn't exist!
