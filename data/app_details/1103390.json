Working on something this personal and intimately me is really taxing, and Maria could tell you a hundred stories of me nervously pacing the apartment mumbling about mechanics or story beats or panicking that I wasted my time on a bad game. In the end, I'm really proud of what ThreeStep is and how it turned out. <br><br>That being said it is the spookiest month, and since I love monsters, ghouls, skeletons, and all kinds of kitschy Halloween stuff, so I wanted to update ThreeStep with something spooky for ThreeStep's content update.  Frigid Hellscape is a small extra mode following the killing of Jackson during the Story of ThreeStep, once you've killed him (and made sure he was dead) you'll get a new main menu and a new mode available.<br><br><br><br>Thanks to everyone who bought ThreeStep, hope it's as enjoyable to play as it was rewarding to make.<br><br>-Wyatt</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>ThreeStep follows the exploits of Sadie Kalasrade, a mother and ex soldier who returns to her home region of Western Alaska to hunt invasive wolves and grieve a loss.
