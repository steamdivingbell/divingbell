LSL was a pioneer of the adult humor in gaming.  We're designing our open world around the LSL formula of &quot;find an item here, use it over there&quot; all the while using adult humor to keep you laughing and immersed in the story. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">        \u2022  <strong>Punisher (NES)</strong> - Rail-scrolling action is a rare form of gameplay not used much these days.  In years past games like <i>Punisher, Gotcha!, Terminator 2 The Arcade game</i> and a few others made lasting impressions on us.  A <i>Punisher (NES)</i> rail-scrolling shooter from the 90s is exactly what VanillaBeast needs to keep that retro variety flowing and that's exactly what we're giving it.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">        \u2022  <strong>Mike Tyson's Punch-Out! (NES)</strong> - We've designed a full circuit of boxers to fight your way through as Vanilla reminisces back to the time he battled his way to face the Champ, Tike Myson, in our parody boxing tribute to the classic NES title.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">        \u2022  <strong>Jaws (NES)</strong> -  Remember how <i>Jaws</i> had a fun open water exploration on a boat as well as under-water diving game play? We've came up with a pretty sweet take on this classic you're sure to enjoy while reminiscing back to the good ol' days of gaming.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">        \u2022  <strong>NES Open Tournament Golf</strong> - One of the greatest Golf games of all-time (we know that's relative, please stop being so technical).  Our Golf mini game is based on the fan favorite NES golf game from the 90s with a twist of <i>Caddyshack</i>.  We're looking forward to seeing you tee off at &quot;All 3 Holes Country Club&quot;.  FORE!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">        \u2022  <strong>Friday the 13th (NES)</strong> - Remember F13 on NES?  We're sure you loved it, or at least loved to hate it, right?  We've taken this retro game designed to thwart that evil purple and teal evildoer to a whole new level as you go to Camp Crystal Fake and save the ladies in a Friday the 13th style side-scrolling level.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">        \u2022  <strong>California Games / T &amp; C Surf Design</strong> - Surf waves and fight enemies in a <i>T &amp; C Surf Design</i> inspired level. We've taken the classic surf style gameplay and added a combo point system, crazy obstacles, enemy combat and a massive shark to make this <i>T &amp; C Surf Design</i> parody level one of the coolest aquatic adventures you've ever seen.  Pixelated waves have never looked so good.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">        \u2022  <strong>Outrun (Arcade) / Speed Racer (Arcade)</strong> - Race from and into danger in an <i>Outrun / Speed Racer</i> inspired racing levels. With a full arsenal of gadgets and tricks at your disposal Vanilla's Black Bullet roadster has never looked better.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">        \u2022   <strong>Final Fight</strong> and <strong>Double Dragon</strong>  - Love the old school brawlers like <i>Final Fight</i> and <i>Double Dragon</i> games?
