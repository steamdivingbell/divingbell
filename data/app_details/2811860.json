{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2811860/extras/gameplay_gif.gif?t=1722129930\" /><br>Sovereign Elect is a game centered around accumulating influence. Your ultimate goal is to become the sovereign of the land. To do this, you must gain influence, which is primarily done through mercenaries you hire. Mercenaries come in different rarities. They each have different stats and abilities which effect your methods of obtaining merit. Once merit is obtained, it can be converted into influence by your mercenaries.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2811860/extras/partyslots_gif.gif?t=1722129930\" /><br>You will obtain contracts that you can use to hire new mercenaries. Your group will start off small, but given time, you can reach up to a total of 40 mercenaries. You cannot become king if you do not have a band of loyal followers.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2811860/extras/activity_gif.gif?t=1722129930\" /><br>Activities are represented by small icons the player can interact with. If they are related to merit, your mercenaries will interact with them automatically. This also includes enemies, which will target you if no mercenaries are present to defend you. Activities that give merit come in 4 varieties: Strength, Dexterity, Charisma, and Wisdom. These correlate with attributes your mercenaries have, which are represented by the color on their glove. Certain abilities your mercenaries have may also behave differently depending on the attribute/color they associate with. With this in mind, the type of mercenaries you decide to have matters.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Hireling","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2811860/bedd6563564068fc9d9d9030fba55f2103a1ae95.jpg"},{"name":"Prospector","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2811860/65f48e7388e91db9f03a2e4fb49c4107df7f3b4f.jpg"},{"name":"Warrior","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2811860/d4ffcbd8bac2044ef683370153dd08e7f25d587c.jpg"},{"name":"Pathfinder","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2811860/6d81b109c8667e2bc8f60ed7eeae34c3ec1254cc.jpg"},{"name":"Bowman","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2811860/a40bdc2a695b53fdaa2ac23715d734f1f783d4f3.jpg"},{"name":"Scout","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2811860/f5614e2b638d7f90bb7be6f24507f7258acbfdc9.jpg"},{"name":"Bondsman","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2811860/53a44a752576a2d2649c212fdad57283520de834.jpg"},{"name":"Bannerman","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2811860/0db4f60b574be51de12da2d2c86e7d09c3726d6e.jpg"},{"name":"Barbarian","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2811860/c28845195a67a6379368a4ca3a0a6f4f27f4872e.jpg"},{"name":"Thief","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2811860/48efbb289dafb3f9075225f74a3ff4a37d7c1df5.jpg"}],"total":53},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2811860/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1722129930","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2811860/page.bg.jpg?t=1722129930","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2811860/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1722129930","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2811860/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1722129930","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2811860/extras/gameplay_gif.gif?t=1722129930\" /><br>Sovereign Elect is a game centered around accumulating influence.
