{"about_the_game":"<strong>Space Station 14</strong> is inspired by the cult classic SS13 and tells the story of an ordinary shift on a space station gone wrong.

Your duties guide you through rich interactions with complex mechanics, whether you're managing your inventory, setting up the reactor, or flushing yourself down the disposal tubes.<br><br>As disaster, incompetence, and sabotage strike the station, the tension rises - opening up emergent situations that force you to make hard choices. Will you patch up the medical bay after an asteroid punches a hole in it, or fight for control when the captain gets murdered by revolutionaries? Do you break out an unjustly imprisoned clown, or sit back at the bar and serve drinks without a care in the world? <br><br>The story of the station's collapse is in the hands of its players, and each round is an intense, immersive experience that will leave you wanting more.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Beyond Space Station 14</h2><br>Space Station 14 is open-source and extremely extensible.
