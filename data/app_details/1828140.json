When the game runs, the energy will be consumed automatically. When it returns to zero, the character will be judged dead. Therefore, the player needs to find the material box to supplement energy and ammunition before the energy is exhausted, and enter the next level before the energy is exhausted, The difficulty of the game is to complete the task before the energy is exhausted<br />\r\n<br />\r\n*As a shooting game, the game adds two guns, assault rifles and sniper guns. When using assault rifles, grenades can also be used to destroy zombies.

The game is just a graduation project of your own. Due to technical and knowledge constraints, there will be many bugs in the game. Maybe players have a lot of problems when playing, but please forgive me. After all, this is only a graduation project, which is certainly not comparable to other games and will encounter bugs.
