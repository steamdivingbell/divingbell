{"about_the_game":"Welcome to Snowscapes, a cozy nature simulation game. Control the simulation, play cards to influence the world and have fun in this little frozen ecosystem. Watch it all happening from above or step into any animal to see it all up close. <br><br><strong>Nature simulation meets card game!</strong><br><br>It is up to you, if you will start a chaos or try to maintain a balance. You get a new set of cards every now and then to keep your options open - you can spawn multiple animals into your ecosystem or you can place them one by one. You can help them have babies and you can make them live longer. Animals can be spawned for free, special effects cost tokens which you earn by maintaining balance, raising babies and having animals live long enough to die from old age.<br><br>Snowscapes features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Different cards to influence the simulation - spawning animals, causing effects, shaping the environment<br></li><li>Nature simulation - animals eat, reproduce, grow and die<br></li><li>Possibility to watch the simulation from multiple cameras - including right in the action<br></li><li>Immersive experience<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Play cards to influence the world</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2347890/extras/Snowscapes2.gif?t=1692556487\" /><br><br>Take your time and enjoy this scenery as you balance your perfect ecosystem!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Keep track of your animals</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2347890/extras/Snowscapes1.gif?t=1692556487\" /></li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Bear","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2347890/4cc99707d0f1f4b742edb23ea2281784420b0fa3.jpg"},{"name":"Deer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2347890/60a7d2b7e24b4e9372efaddfe4f426394bcd5439.jpg"},{"name":"Fox","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2347890/2ae779deea453c000587a49f01648fe4202a2cf1.jpg"},{"name":"Seal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2347890/1e5eac402980c584cdfd7edc9bfa2f90e51d6cec.jpg"},{"name":"Walrus","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2347890/806dc052a3a64dd8c1b0fa563db713aba28b8976.jpg"},{"name":"Eagle","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2347890/60180f583c22f19e345744c3f9c3cd94da08ed9b.jpg"},{"name":"Reindeer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2347890/fddc7ff363d01075a4ead06f86461691f27e195a.jpg"},{"name":"Beaver","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2347890/2b6361b841a31e8eb5338b2e520875c057cd6657.jpg"},{"name":"40 Foxes Alive","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2347890/beb7e784763ce5a1c3bd6879594de60cfaa64a06.jpg"},{"name":"50 Babies","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2347890/803fc8942967089dd8e4b2efeac8a53337cf38d0.jpg"}],"total":20},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2347890/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1692556487","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2347890/page.bg.jpg?t=1692556487","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2347890/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1692556487","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2347890/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1692556487","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to Snowscapes, a cozy nature simulation game.
