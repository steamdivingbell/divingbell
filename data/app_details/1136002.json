{"about_the_game":"Ireland is famous for big bream fishing and Lough Kerr is one of the reasons why, as not only is there every chance you could catch a new PB, but you could also beat the national record! This perfectly formed venue of 18 acres is steeped in history and feels like time has stood still with ancient stone walls and mature foliage whilst the superb water quality makes it perfect for big bream to grow on. The lough is visited by some of the best anglers in Europe who are all chasing the elusive records it holds including \u2018Banshee\u2019 that has been caught at an incredible 21lbs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough all the attention is on the bream fishing, this lake also holds carp to just under 25lbs and good sized tench, roach and rudd. There are also three single player tournaments for you to master and three career mode events, as well as five new achievements that come with this venue.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1136002/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1575541072","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1136002/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1575541072","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1136002/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1575541072","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1136002/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1575541072","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Ireland is famous for big bream fishing and Lough Kerr is one of the reasons why, as not only is there every chance you could catch a new PB, but you could also beat the national record!
