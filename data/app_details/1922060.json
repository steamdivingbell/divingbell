Engage in intense combat or opt for a No Gore mode for a less intense experience. If firearms aren't your thing, there's a mode to turn them off entirely. Want to explore without the entities? No problem, there's a mode for that too.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Unearth the secrets of the backrooms by exploring over 100 immersive levels, each with its own unique atmosphere. Interact with over 100 items found throughout your journey, whether for survival, exploration, or combat. Carry a backpack to store your valuable findings as you traverse the various levels of the backrooms. Relive your favorite levels, including The Main 9, Level Run for your life, Level 188, The Terror Hotel, Level Fun, The Snackrooms, The Poolrooms, The Sh4dy Gr3y, Kitty's House, The End, and many many more.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Beware of the lurking entities that seek to harm you, and tame helpful entities to take on your way. Engage in strategic combat to slay these creatures and advance further into the depths of the backrooms. You can even build traps to ensnare them or befriend them to fight by your side.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Craft items, shelters, and weapons using scavenged materials to increase your chances of survival. Trade with NPCs to acquire valuable items and visit upgrade workshops to enhance your crafting capabilities.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If you prefer a more relaxed experience, indulge in the sandbox mode, allowing you to spawn items at will, interact with the entities, and experiment with Backrooms objects. Alternatively, you can choose the no gore/no entities mode to freely explore and survive in the backrooms.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Backrooms can be lighthearted too: Immerse yourself in a variety of mini-games like The Terror Hotel Casino, Skin or No Skin, Backrooms Brawl, General Starflare's Laser Game, The Charleston Button, Basketball, Squirt Gun Madness, Backrooms Fruit Finale, Music Sequencer, Backrooms Buck Hunt, and many more.

We rely heavily on our DISCORD community to help us create the game the community has always wanted. We take suggestions from our BrVR family and try our best to turn them into reality. Think of it as the Backrooms Wikidot in Virtual Reality. John and I are a father son indie dev duo who are enamored with The Backrooms and love making virtual reality games. Got an issue with the experience? Just come talk to us on the Discord. We are happy to help! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>The Concept</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We initially just wanted to make a &quot;high effort&quot; Reddit post. The original idea was to recreate the Backrooms Wikidot pictures in Unreal Engine so that people could just look around the room as we imagined it would look, and now it's so much more than that. We are amazed daily at how far this dream has come and it's all because of the amazing community of friends we've made along the way. Come join us on this crazy journey into the Backrooms. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>The Goal</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Our ultimate goal is to make it a Virtual Reality WikiDot where people can create levels and submit them to be in the game; vetted by the community. As of November 2023 that has become a reality as we added the amazing LEVEL THETA from our good friend Gatch13, an active member and playtester from our Discord. We literally rely on our amazing community, who we truly consider family, to help shape this massive fan-art project. You can do it too and we will even help you learn how in Unreal Engine via the Discord. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Weekly Updates</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game has updated weekly for over two years now and John says he doesn't see it stopping. However there is now a Beta Branch for the weekly updates to get playtested more before moving to the Main branch for the big monthly updates. He also crushes bugs, quality of life issues, and executes new suggestions from the Discord on a daily basis. We do this as a passion project, not for money. Come be a playtester! We say thanks by putting your name on our in-game wall. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>The Plan</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We plan to continue adding and upgrading levels, upgrading mechanics, upgrading graphics, making more interactible objects, and adding entities for a long time to come. We also want people to play it &quot;their way&quot; so we go out of our way to give you control over things like firearms and entities in your Backrooms. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We are very responsive and update regularly. <br><br>This game includes flashing/disorienting lights, blood effects, fantasy violence, and potentially disturbing/creepy content. We are not responsible for any injuries received during the game. There are no teleport or comfort settings at this time. There are jump scares! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1922060/extras/HoundShot.gif?t=1737557503\" /></p>","achievements":{"total":0},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1922060/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737557503","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1922060/page.bg.jpg?t=1737557503","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1922060/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737557503","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1922060/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737557503","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"There are weapons in the game like knives, grenades, flamethrowers, and guns which can kill enemies (The entities).
