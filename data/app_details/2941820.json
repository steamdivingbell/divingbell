{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Welcome to the most hidden corner of Steam!

The game is hard to explain (and sell) because there's nothing quite like it, at least not directly. Carceri is three things combined: a <strong>video game</strong>, a <strong>work of Art</strong>, and a <strong>Real place</strong>.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>As a video game...</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Carceri Zero is a relaxing, first-person narrative/exploration focused experience. You navigate several gorgeous, interconnected zones while platforming, talking to NPCs, finding lots of secrets, and taking pictures with a heavily upgradable camera. You also follow a story, one about the Programs that run our world. They've been given this beautiful place to live, yet aren't allowed to leave. Is this their paradise, or their prison? They need your outsider, human help!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>As a work of Art...</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Carceri Zero is a contemporary  landscape painting, an acknowledgement that <strong>video games and landscapes are both forms of <i>Escape</i></strong>. Many in my family are landscape painters, and this is my way of continuing that tradition. However, rather than dictate to you what this 3D landscape looks like, <strong>your camera changes the look of the world, so you're the Art director! </strong><i>(The abstract screenshots above were taken in-game, using the camera's options).</i></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>As a Real place...</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The world of Carceri Zero is conceived to actually Exist, a proper extension of our Reality. Carceri's  residents, Programs, consider their 3D world more legit than the physical world you inhabit now (which they think of a merely a Simulation). The game's design, and story, revolve around this concept. <strong>It's not breaking the 4th wall, because the 4th wall doesn't exist here! </strong>If you go in with that suspension of disbelief, that this isn't fiction, it changes the vibe of everything.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Any uniqueness or charm Carceri Zero has (if any) comes from this bizarre combination of elements.

Carceri Zero's not challenging, so anyone can complete the narrative portion of the experience, and there's things to do afterwards (like an in-game podcast discussing the Simulation Hypothesis). <strong>Also, buying the game gives access to the 41 song original soundtrack</strong> (only a bonus if you dig the music).  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2941820/extras/CarGIF08a.gif?t=1733734931\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>About the Creator</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Solo-dev <strong>James Beech</strong> is a bizarre combination of AAA game vet and Fine Artist.
