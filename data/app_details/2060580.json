{"about_the_game":"A mysterious alien civilization is watching you on TV, studying and judging everything you do. Progress through the ranks and reap the rewards. Make it to the rank of Grand Champion and you'll even get a single wish granted. What will you wish for? Wealth? Power? Freedom?<br><br>An action RPG at heart, Crossedland also has elements from several other genres mixed in. You\u2019ll teleport into arenas to battle, gather, loot, and hunt then retire to your personal island for rest. You can bring back people you find and rebuild the ruins scattered across the island, unlocking new features, equipment, recipes, and upgrades as you go.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2060580/extras/combat.png?t=1726671426\" />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br>Combat can best be described as souls-lite. It can be fast paced but is also methodical at times. It can also be very difficult if you\u2019re not careful. Enemies (especially humanoid enemies) are incredibly deadly at most levels if you don\u2019t pay attention to them.<br><br>There are currently over 100 weapons to find or craft and 18 different fighting styles based on the weapons you use. From one-handed swords, quick thrusting weapons, and polearms to massive, slow two-handed weapons and bows.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2060580/extras/Weapons.gif?t=1726671426\" /><br><br>More powerful enemies also await when you find the coordinates to boss locations. Each of them reward parts for upgrades on defeat and are necessary to defeat to progress to their rank.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2060580/extras/Enemies.gif?t=1726671426\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2060580/extras/arenas.png?t=1726671426\" /><br>You\u2019ll go into a wide variety of arenas. Many of them will be open, sprawling areas, that can be several different biomes, where you\u2019ll primarily gather resources to rebuild your island and create new gear and tech. These large arenas will also be full of enemies, too, so watch your back while you\u2019re gathering resources.<br><br><strong>If you die in the arena, you\u2019ll lose everything you gathered in that arena. So, be careful if you\u2019re low on health and see that shiny gold node off in the distance.</strong><br><br>Other arenas include cramped quarter combat arenas where your goal will just be to defeat the enemy and gameshows. Gameshows range from easy to complete to incredibly difficult but can have wonderful rewards.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2060580/extras/Gameshows.gif?t=1726671426\" /><br><br>Arenas feature time limits. Some are instant death but not everything is a hard end to the arena. Sometimes deadly robots will spawn, lasers will drag themselves across the landscape destroying everything in their path, invisible monsters will attempt to hunt you down, or orbital bombardments will randomly strike in large areas of the arena.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2060580/extras/TimePenalties.gif?t=1726671426\" /><br><br>You\u2019ll also have to contend with meteor showers, lightning strikes, gravity anomalies, and other threats while traversing the arenas.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2060580/extras/skillsandupg.png?t=1726671426\" /><br>There are 20 skills to raise. Most weapon styles have their own skills (some overlap) then each gathering type and crafting type have their own skills as well as a few others like athletics.<br><br>Skills are raised by using them. Raising your skills is important as the higher your skill, the more damage you do, the faster you gather, and the better you craft. <br><br>Hitting certain skill levels also unlocks one of the 32 abilities available in the game. Stat boosts, instant gathering, and a chance to instantly kill enemies with a headshot are just a few of the many available!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2060580/extras/Skills.gif?t=1726671426\" /><br><br>You\u2019ll also find various bits of tech to bring back to Vex who will turn them into upgrades for you (free of charge, because she\u2019s nice like that!)

Most prepared food will provide boosts to stats and regeneration. Try to always eat before heading into an arena.<br><br>Some recipes for meals will have to be found or bought out in the world but a lot of recipes will be automatically learned just from picking up the ingredients. You\u2019ll even be able to grow ingredients on your farm!<br><br>Weapons and armor can be upgraded if you find the right recipe and the right materials to use.<br><br>Some of the islanders can even make you gadgets like grenades that instantly gather materials or emergency escape portals so you can get out of an arena quick!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2060580/extras/building.png?t=1726671426\" /><br>The ruins of an old community are scattered across your island.
