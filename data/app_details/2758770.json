{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Welcome to Project Green: Unravel the Secrets of Everlast City:</h2><br>Embark on an immersive journey in Project Green, a first-person adventure set in the heart of a post-apocalyptic world. As Jae, a resourceful engineer with a mission, you'll navigate the perilous landscapes of Everlast City, a once-thriving haven now overrun by enigmatic organisms known as Alters.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay Overview:</h2><br>Dive into a unique blend of first-person shooter action, brain-teasing puzzles, and exploration. Whether facing Alters head-on or finding cunning ways to slip past, your choices matter. Ammo is limited, and there are no health pick-ups, forcing you to strategize and consider every move. Health regenerates outside combat or by seeking refuge in hidden spots, adding an element of survival to your journey.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore Everlast City:</h2><br>Discover the secrets of Everlast City, a survivors' dome built to endure the apocalypse. Governed by former businessmen, the city has devolved into a capitalist hierarchy. Evidence of social disparities is strewn throughout, revealing the stark contrast between the haves and the have-nots. Uncover the truth behind the Alters and the mysterious disappearances of survivors by exploring optional areas and collecting vital notes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unravel the Mystery:</h2><br>Everlast City holds more than meets the eye. Secret laboratories hint at questionable research involving the Alters. Was this the catalyst for the Alter outbreak? Only by piecing together the scattered clues can you hope to unveil the truth behind the city's descent into chaos.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Warning: Photosensitivity/Epilepsy Seizures:</h2><br>Project Green features visually intense elements that may trigger seizures or blackouts in a small percentage of individuals. If you, or anyone in your family, has a history of epilepsy or seizures, consult a physician before engaging in gameplay. Your safety is our priority.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2758770/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1705659944","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2758770/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1705659944","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2758770/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1705659944","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2758770/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1705659944","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Welcome to Project Green: Unravel the Secrets of Everlast City:</h2><br>Embark on an immersive journey in Project Green, a first-person adventure set in the heart of a post-apocalyptic world.
