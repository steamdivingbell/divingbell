{"about_the_game":"A real-time criminal RPG set in an expansive city with large population that is ripe to be a part of, or victim to, your criminal rackets. Become the city's most notorious criminal and gangster by taking part in all sorts of rackets and crimes. Start with nothing and learn the arts of crime to create your own criminal organization. Employ underlings to do your bidding or do the dirty work yourself. Actively engage in criminal rackets like number running, burglary rings, fencing stolen goods, bootlegging and rum-running, speakeasies, brothels, money-laundering, bribery, extortion, drug distribution, and much more. Actively brew your own beer and moonshine for distribution or to stock your speakeasies. Buy and cut drugs or simply cook your own. Bribe public officials and law enforcement to look the other way. There's almost unlimited replayability in such an open world where your decisions and strategy determine your own path through the criminal underworld. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEngage in mob wars for territory with rival gangs where you can be a target of a rival's aggression just as easily as any of your soldiers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA huge living, breathing world with thousands of citizens, all of whom have unique personality traits, memories, schedules, and vulnerabilities to different vices.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA wide assortment of different criminal activities to engage in. Become a jack-of-all-trades criminal or focus on one area in particular and become the city's premier criminal of that type. The choice is yours, and each playthrough will be unique.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBuy or rent safehouses all throughout the city to store your contraband or hide out when things get a little too hot.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCraft your own contraband using store-bought materials. Or just rob the store and take the materials. Either way the booze or drugs you brew will be much more lucrative than the materials themselves. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nUse a crafting system that requires specific equipment for different purposes to get the product just right. A bad product won't sell as well as a great product. Plus, a good product means that people are more likely to come back and tell others about it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHire underlings to perform different tasks and free up your time for more important and lucrative things.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nManage your criminal underworld by letting your soldiers perform their own crime and kick up payments to you. Or have your soldiers do all of your dirty work for you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBuy small business to launder your money to keep the G-men off your trail.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA local law enforcement presence plus federal investigators keep you on your toes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRandomized locations for buildings plus randomly generated population characteristics means there's virtually unlimited replayability. Focus on just drugs for one game; become the city's most notorious pimp the next time; or just become the most ruthless hitman.
