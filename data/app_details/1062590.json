And for Green Army Men, that means a new location for your toy soldiers to fight over. And, of course, some new weapons to use in the fight!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New Map - Thanksgiving</h2>The leaves are changing color, the family is in town and there is a fat turkey in the oven. We all know what that means - the fight for the kitchen has commenced on Thanksgiving Day.<br><br>Battle your way across the countertops, air ducts and dining room table as the Green Army Men invade Thanksgiving Dinner. Navigate your way through potato fortresses and wine bottle towers. The winner takes the turkey on this festive holiday map. And take the fight outside as you navigate your choppers around the back deck stronghold and Dad's half finished leaf piles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">4 New Weapons</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>BAZOOKA - a shoulder-fired 60mm rocket launcher capable of delivering high-explosive missiles at high speeds for the Grenadier role. <br></li><li>DESIGNATED MARKSMAN RIFLE - a 7.62 Semi-Automatic Rifle intended for medium range engagements for the Sniper role.<br></li><li>SMOKE GRENADE LAUNCHER - a cut down 40mm Grenade Launcher for the Grenadier role, capable of firing Smoke Grenades only.<br></li><li>PEASHOOTER - a 9mm Submachine gun fitted with a suppressor, reducing noise, muzzle flash and tracer visibility, at the expense of stopping power at range, for the Pointman and Grenadier roles.</li></ul></p><br><h1>Back to School Update</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1062590/extras/GAM_Guns_small_blurb.png?t=1574357908\" /><br><br>It is just about that time of year again - time everyone went back to school! So, to celebrate (or commiserate) the Green Army Men team has a free update for you, containing a new map and 6 new weapons:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New Map - Sandbox</h2><br>The kids are back to School and we all know what that means : the fight for the playground commences. Battle your way across the Sandbox as the kids take their tests inside the classroom. The Sand buckets have become your bunkers and the leftover popsicle sticks from art class will now build the fortress that you cling to in this epic battle of Schoolyard dominance. <br><br>Whether you fly the choppers or call in the napalm rockets onto the final castle objective, there can be only one King of the Sandbox. Going Back to School has never been this fun.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">6 New Weapons</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>BATTLE RIFLE: 7.62 Rifle for the Rifleman and Radioman roles. A self-Loading rifle that brings extra punch to the table, at the cost of added bulk and lack of fully automatic fire.<br></li><li>AUTOMATIC RIFLE: 7.62 Machine Gun for the Machine Gunner role. A Light Support Weapon that trades magazine size for mobility. The alternate firing mode improves shot grouping by lowering the rate of fire.<br></li><li>PERSONAL DEFENSE WEAPON: .30-cal Carbine for the Combat Engineer role. A lightweight carbine available as an alternative to the .45 SMG. The cartridge used by this weapon sports surprising power retention over long distances.<br></li><li>ASSAULT SUBMACHINE GUN: 9mm Submachine gun for the Pointman and Radioman roles. A compact variant of the Assault Rifle designed for operations in cramped environments, such as anthills or dollhouses.<br></li><li>RIFLED SHOTGUN: 12-gauge Pump-Action Shotgun for the Sniper role. An accurized variant of the Shotgun that fires high-velocity sabot slugs from a rifled barrel. Comes equipped with a High Magnification Scope.<br></li><li>OBREZ: 7.62 Rifle for all special roles! A high-powered, bolt-action rifle.  The haphazardly sawed-off stock makes this weapon compact enough to be carried as a sidearm. </li></ul></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Support your local community developers!</h2>Green Army Men is made entirely by community developers and is now available here as one complete DLC.
