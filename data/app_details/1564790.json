{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Become the Researcher</h2>Submachine is a hand-drawn puzzle adventure game. You will find yourself in a vast network of desolate locations containing puzzles, secrets, notes and items to collect to help you along the way.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1564790/extras/inventory.png?t=1733319545\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">the World of Submachine</h2>With over 1900 rooms to visit, there's a lot to see here. The underground world of submerged machines offers you vast variety of locations and structures to discover and repair. While everything is shattered, you will try to put things back together to understand and escape.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2>You are alone here. You will follow the footsteps of a banished lighthouse keeper discovering his descent into ruins of Submachine. The story is divided into chapters that will unlock for you as you progress through the game. The story is conveyed by series of notes that you'll collect and read.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Puzzles</h2>There are tons of puzzles, some of which you'll solve by bringing the machinery back online, tinkering with it, turning off and on again. For others you'll need to find missing parts, levers that were broken off or stolen, depleted power sources, gears, cogs, lamps, coils and so on. As you move through the structure, you will be putting back together things that were shattered.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Graphics</h2>Entire game is hand-drawn. There's nothing auto-generated nor procedural. Each location was thoughtfully designed. Stylized drawings give the game its eerie atmosphere.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Music</h2>Ambient music for this game was created by ThumpMonks, with chapter 1 ambient by Marcus Gutierrez. The music perfectly emphasizes the atmosphere of lonely exploration.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Monolith I","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1564790/266b6c30e10e8b3fc2869e30cd367e04771fb0ec.jpg"},{"name":"Monolith II","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1564790/e55360f8fff1e097392ecfd7ce043325a5f29949.jpg"},{"name":"Monolith III","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1564790/3de7006c0a95ce309a0fa321701dba349b9b7783.jpg"},{"name":"Monolith IV","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1564790/6b08540f2b7a030128566a939aa43c6d32c6d783.jpg"},{"name":"Monolith V","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1564790/a1b58477ddd7e4319f4de1f613230da2519847f4.jpg"},{"name":"Monolith VI","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1564790/16591fe8096205a782c53a9d12a7a44dad0b4c08.jpg"},{"name":"Monolith VII","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1564790/f901a4fcd536aeb12e13f9f2b90955c4e84490ba.jpg"},{"name":"Monolith VIII","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1564790/f6858b209283fa10817575024ca496e5a03c3718.jpg"},{"name":"Monolith IX","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1564790/4d88d851d22c4539c87c2f443a7dc82b6ce3aaaa.jpg"},{"name":"Monolith X","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1564790/3c774989c1c5ad7f4505da15fc7aa8c8ef557875.jpg"}],"total":28},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1564790/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733319545","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1564790/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1733319545","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1564790/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733319545","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1564790/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733319545","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Become the Researcher</h2>Submachine is a hand-drawn puzzle adventure game.
