{"about_the_game":"<strong>Roll</strong> is a unique VR platformer where you move by rolling around in a hamster ball. Race around obstacles, Bounce over precarious gaps, and Speed over steep ramps in this chaotic new Physics based game.<br><br>Roll started out as a idea for a YouTube video I had, and originally it was meant to be like Super Monkey Ball but in VR. After making it and seeing other people play it though, I realized that it had the potential to become its own actual game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Support ROLL on KickStarter!</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Movement</h2>Movement in roll is completely physics based meaning to move yourself forward you'll need to actually swing your hands against the ball. This brings a new layer to rolls gameplay, where if you want to get faster times you'll have to learn to move efficiently, and carry your momentum. This allows players to really experiment and find new ways to speed-run through levels.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2086500/extras/roll.gif?t=1660103650\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Levels</h2>Currently the first zone and its five levels are available in the demo. However in the future we plan to add several more zones with unique environments, levels, and obstacles.
