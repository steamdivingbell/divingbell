{"about_the_game":"Simple Video Merger allows you to join multiple videos into a single one. Initial videos have to be from the same or very similar source. Two outdoor cameras from the same manufacturer, for example. This limitation gives the application rocket speed and quality. The application does not do any transcoding or processing - you'll get the video in its original quality! And the main limitation is the speed of your drive. Usually, it's just a matter of minutes to join together multiple hours of videos.<br><br>The input videos are preferable to be recorded onto the same device. You can't merge videos from very different sources. For example, you can't join GoPro's video with a mobile one. Or vertical video with a horizontal one. But the software will help you if one camera recorded several videos, but you want to see them as a single one.<br><br>The application does not do any effects like transitions, shadows, transparency, etc. It just puts one video after another. But it does it fast! <br><br>Some Use Cases:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Action cameras. Have you had a good weekend and filmed multiple good videos? Do you want to grab all those videos and put them into one? Simple Video Merger is a solution!<br></li><li> Outdoor and IP cameras. They do have a habit of splitting the video by some timeline. Usually, the videos there are one minute long. But funny moments in life last longer! <br></li><li> Mobile phones. Have you filmed multiple videos on the same phone with the same settings? Just get a single video from them! <br></li><li> Game or software development. If you record the videos from the same screen with the same software - you'd probably be able to use Simple Video Merger to join them.</li></ul><br>The free version allows you to merge three videos at a time. You could always take the result from the previous merge and use it in another one.
