{"about_the_game":"Pathfinder RPG - Pathfinder Module: We Be Goblins Too! <br> The Licktoads, once the great and fierce goblin tribe in Brinestump Marsh, were defeated by human adventurers! All that remains of the tribe are its four goblin &quot;heroes&quot;--Reta Bigbad the fighter, Chuffy Lickwound the rogue, Poog the cleric of Zarongel, and Mogmurch the alchemist. Homeless and bored, they left their swampy homeland to join the neighboring goblin tribe, the Birdcrunchers. <br> The good news is that the Birdcrunchers are willing to let the goblin heroes join their tribe. <br> The better news is that the Birdcrunchers have heard of these four, and want one of them to become their new chieftain. <br> The bad news is that before the goblins can join, they'll need to endure a series of dangerous and humiliating tests. Very dangerous. Very humiliating. <br> The worse news is that lately Birdcruncher chieftains have had really short lifespans--they're being killed by the pet fire-breathing boar of a local ogre who wants the Birdcruncher land as his own. <br> Can the four heroes of the now-dead Licktoad tribe save the Birdcrunchers and, in so doing, become their new leaders? <br> &quot;We Be Goblins Too!&quot; is an adventure for four 3rd-level goblin characters, written for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and compatible with the 3.5 edition of the world's oldest roleplaying game.
