{"about_the_game":"<strong>Unrestricted Pest Control is a top-down shooter with rogue-lite elements and a unique room/floor system. As an exterminator, you step into a nuclear research facility to fix its bug problems with your extensive solution methods.</strong><br><br>Insects are famous for their adaptation and survival skills. A small push of radioactivity makes things a little bit complicated. They have outgrown themselves, gained new skills, and mutated distinctively.
