{"about_the_game":"&quot;In this game you can't do whatever you want&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The change&quot; is not a game. I mean, it is an indie game which wants to set a thought in your mind and in which you will be bound to go only ahead. Look forward. This game is a third person. Without 2018 graphics, indeed, but which wants to impress by words. Listen to me and discover the message behind the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The change&quot; is more like a story. A story which needs to be understood.<br />\r\nWhen you'll buy this game, don't expect a very long gameplay, as this is my first game. I will grow along with my games.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/872270/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1545683508","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/872270/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1545683508","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/872270/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1545683508","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/872270/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1545683508","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;In this game you can't do whatever you want&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The change&quot; is not a game.
