{"about_the_game":"<strong>Knight Island is a roguelike deckS builder game based on a tile system. In fact, it's not just a deck builder, but rather a deckS builder.

During the day, the only thing you need to do is to develop your island. You can do this using tile cards. There are 3 main types of tile cards: Attack, Economy, and Energy.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2785710/extras/deneme3.gif?t=1711668429\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Attack Cards</h2>You can probably guess what Attack cards do right away. They allow you to attack :) But of course, there are many different types of attack cards with various features. Choosing the right cards in the tough moments of battle is up to your skill. <strong>Knight Island, already very suitable for beginners with its easy game mechanics, begins to offer you much deeper and complex strategic diversity at this point.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Economy Cards</h2>The purpose of Economy cards is to earn money for your island. This allows you to recruit much stronger units or upgrade your cards to higher levels.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Energy Cards</h2>Energy cards are simply buildings that provide power to attack cards. Having an energy system with higher efficiency on your island allows you to use higher-powered cards more frequently in battles.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2785710/extras/Sequence_01.gif?t=1711668429\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Battle!</h2>As described above, when you complete developing your island during the day, it becomes night. And at night... At night, the only thing you need to do is fight.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2785710/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1711668429","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2785710/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1711668429","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2785710/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1711668429","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2785710/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1711668429","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>Knight Island is a roguelike deckS builder game based on a tile system.
