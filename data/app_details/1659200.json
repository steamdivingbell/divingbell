{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In <strong>Crossed Wires</strong> you play as a snarky super-computer with a fractured personality whose mission is to protect a bumbling maverick from out of control cleaning appliances, rogue attack drones, and... himself. Start with point-and-click controls where you hack cloud-connected devices to escape puzzle rooms from an omniscient top down isometric perspective. Progress to WASD-style controls as you get your hands dirty solving more complex puzzles and clearing obstacles. Discover your origins and collect secrets as you progress through this satirical, chaos-filled adventure and learn deep secrets of the universe like why flamethrowers are indeed dangerous.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Delight in Omniscience</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1659200/extras/ELON_Gameplay_v3.gif?t=1734461037\" />As an awakened computer program use the information superhighway to interact with electronic devices to steer your charge clear of danger.

Re-think established mechanics as you shift focus from protecting another to exploring the world yourself and advance through an abandoned research lab on foot.
