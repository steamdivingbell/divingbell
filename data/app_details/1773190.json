The Solomani are convinced of their own superiority and the 'Call to Greatness' felt by all their people. They have much to be proud of; inventing the jump drive and conquering the vast Vilani Imperium to name but two of their achievements. Yet there is a darker side to Solomani society, with the ever-present agents of Solomani Security reporting on the words and deeds of every citizen. <i>Aliens of Charted Space Volume 2</i> reveals the motivation of the Solomani people and why they genuinely believe they are better than everyone else.<br> The Droyne <br> Scattered all across Charted Space are communities of Droyne; some voyaging among the stars and others sharpening rocks to use as tools. The Droyne would be among the most enigmatic of all the people in Charted Space even if they were not known to be a remnant of the Ancients. Droyne do not explain their often bizarre actions, but there must be a logic to them.
