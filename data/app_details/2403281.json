{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PRO RANGE</h2>The Pro Range is aimed toward the serious train simulation enthusiast looking for a complex machine to master. Each product is designed to provide education and entertainment for users.

Authentically recreated here in exquisite detail by developer Bossman Games.<br><br>The last UK locomotive to be designed with a 4-4-0 set up, the Schools Class was one of the most powerful steam locomotives of its kind, and was used across the country for express and cross-country services. Loved by the driving crews the machine quickly became known for efficient running and high speeds. The highest recorded speed was 95 mph (152 hm/h).<br><br>A total of 40 locomotives were built by Southern Railway between 1930-1935, all of which are included with this add-on. Each one named after public schools from around England, hence the \u2018Schools\u2019 class name. Alongside the custom nameplates, this add-on also includes 10 different liveries which can be selected, including early and late versions - with/without smoke deflectors that were added with later design improvements.<br><br>By the 1960\u2019s most of the locomotives had been withdrawn from service. Only three remain in preservation, including 30925 Cheltenham where audio was recorded for this. Add a piece of rail history to your collection with the legendary SR V \u2018Schools\u2019 Class from Bossman Games.
