{"about_the_game":"In 1995, Andrew Connor's fiance was hit and killed by a car after she frantically ran out into the road from the nearby forest. It was clear that she had been spooked by something, but no one could figure out what. Since no evidence of foul play was found, the case was eventually marked as solved and archived by the police. Andrew was not happy with this though. His home town was full of mysteries, and now he found himself right in the middle of one of them. He knew that there had to be more to the story, so he began to search for answers on his own. However, he might just get more than he bargained for with this investigation.<br><br><strong><u>Collect Evidence</u></strong><br>Things like police case files are rarely served on a silver platter to however asks for them. It will be up to you to get the evidence you need to solve this mystery, and that includes doing things that aren't necessarily legal. Lock picking and trespassing are just some of the things you will end up doing on your quest for answers.<br><br><strong><u>Investigate</u></strong><br>Existing evidence can only get you so far. In some cases, you will need to go out and find new clues to help make sense of older ones.

You will have to exercise caution to ensure that you don't end up in jail, or worse. Stealth won't always be required, but you should be ready for when it is. There will be times where you will have to balance completing your current task, and creating as little noise as possible.<br><br><strong><u>Solve the Mystery</u></strong><br>You are on your own when it comes to solving this mystery, if there even is a mystery to solve.
