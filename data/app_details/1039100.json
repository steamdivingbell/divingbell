Resigned to a quiet life of tavern-keeping, Thorn's thoughts and dreams linger upon his long-lost daughter Leaf \u2014 until Thorn witnesses the reappearance of the one who abducted Leaf so long ago. With the company of his disabled foster son Phid, Thorn enters the fray once more, convinced the world needs his blade to make things right.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1039100/extras/Stories.png?t=1730740548\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1039100/extras/photo_04.gif?t=1730740548\" /><br>The narrative of No Place for Bravery examines the role and duties of father figures and the consequences of their choices in a troubled world.
