{"about_the_game":"&quot;Meet Your Maker: Sector 3 Arsenal Pack  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMeet Your Maker\u2019s Sector 3 Arsenal Pack introduces a powerful new weapon and an insidious new trap to your arsenal.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBuilt deep within the ruins of a chemical factory, the Genebank was humanity\u2019s last great hope for survival. With massive fortifications, the Fort Hope facility was set to preserve genetic duplicates of all forms of life known to man.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUntil a brutal war between rival factions erupted, and fanatic zealots wielding impenetrable shields overran the fort\u2019s defenses. When it was clear that all was lost, a massive explosive device was detonated, flooding the land with toxic chemicals and permanently erasing the entirety of the planet\u2019s genetic memory. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Sector 3 Arsenal Pack contains:  <br />\r\n<br />\r\n1 New Weapon: <br />\r\n<br />\r\nLodestar Shield <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA powerful tactical shield that enables its bearer to create a safe zone from which they can take apart defenses. Salvaged from the wrecks of cargo drones, the shield\u2019s core emits an impenetrable barrier that can withstand anything. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n1 New Trap: <br />\r\n<br />\r\nLaunchpad Trap <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA disarmingly simple device with an mischievous level of lethality. The Launchpad activates with proximity sensors to hurl any trespassers to a certain death (or not). Best used in devious combinations, this trap is a must for any fortification project. &quot;","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2692690?t=1702653109","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2692690/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1702653109","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2692690/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1702653109","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2692690/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1702653109","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"&quot;Meet Your Maker: Sector 3 Arsenal Pack  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMeet Your Maker\u2019s Sector 3 Arsenal Pack introduces a powerful new weapon and an insidious new trap to your arsenal.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBuilt deep within the ruins of a chemical factory, the Genebank was humanity\u2019s last great hope for survival.
