{"about_the_game":"In the realm of digital space, a fresh force emerges: GallowsHill. It's not just a game, it's a contest of wit, a test of courage. This falling block puzzle carves a new path, and you, the player, are the trailblazer. The cells on the stage are your chess pieces, your hand of cards, your weapons. Move them. Shape them. Dominate the stage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you align the frame and color, the world awakens. A symphony of reactions, colors bursting, cells disappearing. You're not just playing, you're conjuring magic, orchestrating a dance of elements on a digital stage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd the star - the \u2605 on the stage, the beacon, the enemy, the goal. To conquer it is to conquer the stage, to claim victory, to emerge triumphant from the battlefield. So, clear it. Defeat it. Make it disappear.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGallowsHill, a game of many mechanisms, many strategies, challenges not just your fingers, but your mind, your resolve. It questions, it provokes, it thrills. It is not for the faint-hearted. It is for the thinkers, the strategists, the warriors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, enter the world of GallowsHill. Your hand of cards awaits, the many stages beckon. Let the battle of wits begin. Stand tall. Be brave. Remember, you're not just playing a game, you're carving your own path. The path of victory.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"First Play","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2378480/1b44c317ad3e9b142edff8d9533117248878c1d3.jpg"},{"name":"All Clear","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2378480/4699ff43688b2381a09cbdb5d7b3d63c28753208.jpg"},{"name":"Perfect Clear","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2378480/f3f840b74a1ebb9836324b4d08957dd8c5c1f71f.jpg"}],"total":3},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2378480/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1697028099","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2378480/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1697028099","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2378480/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1697028099","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2378480/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1697028099","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In the realm of digital space, a fresh force emerges: GallowsHill.
