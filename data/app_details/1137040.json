{"about_the_game":"<u><strong>CAT &amp; MOUSE IS MULTIPLAYER ONLY. There is no Singleplayer gameplay aside from a tutorial and level exploration mode.

This is where players unlock the true mechanics of the game, turning into a mind game, a game of quick thinking, a game of abusing your enemies disadvantages and utilizing your advantages, a game of cornering your friends, a game of lies, a game of talking trash to someone only to be smashed into a yellow stain on the ground, a game of <strong>thinking</strong> you have someone cornered, a game of hoping the coast is clear and finding out it is indeed not clear, a game of cat and mouse.<br><br>Thanks for playing my stupid game!<br><br>If you have one, join the Discord:   - I am always online and will be posting there far more frequently than the steam page.<br>Check out the Roadmap/Current WIP on my Trello Board :  - This will be updated more as I get use to updating it.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1137040/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1687457606","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1137040/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1687457606","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1137040/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1687457606","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1137040/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1687457606","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<u><strong>CAT &amp; MOUSE IS MULTIPLAYER ONLY.
