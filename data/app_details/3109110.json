{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LEADER OF A TRIBE</h2>Control the avatar of a chieftain of your tribe. Manage the economy and well-being of your tribesmen by issuing work priorities.<br><br>Unlike a traditional RTS game, you control just your avatar using a mouse. You can manage your mighty empire with just one hand and a mouse. Micromanagement of units is not needed; insane APM (Actions per Minute) is not required.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3109110/extras/Explore_Heading.png?t=1724593259\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3109110/extras/GatherGif.gif?t=1724593259\" /><br>Explore the great wildland that your ancestors have lived in for thousands of years. Track different resources as they bloom and wane over time. Living as a nomad, your tribe will have to pack up and move from time to time to find better resources. Locate suitable land and be prepared to migrate your tribe to a new spot as the seasons change.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3109110/extras/Gather_Heading.png?t=1724593259\" /><br>Locate and harvest resources like berries, herbs, copper, and tobacco, and convert them into useful tools, trade goods, medicine, and weapons. These items will be useful to your tribe or for trading. Herd horses into your land, and track and hunt bison to increase your food source.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3109110/extras/Trade_Heading.png?t=1724593259\" /><br>Seek other tribes and outsiders and trade with them. They might offer something that you cannot create. Become friends or allies if they are deemed worthy. The outsiders, with their odd clothing and obsession with lands and buildings, may have more technologically advanced tools and weapons for trade. They also have knowledge that can advance your tribe's survivability and skill trees.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3109110/extras/War_Heading.png?t=1724593259\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3109110/extras/wargif.gif?t=1724593259\" /><br>If friendship comes to an end, be prepared to fend off any invaders. Better still, crush them with the might and bravery of your tribe before they settle. War is inevitable.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">UNLOCK SKILLS</h2>Trade knowledge with others for new skills.
