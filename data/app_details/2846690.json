{"about_the_game":"Ribbit Rampage is a fast-paced top-down shooter about a frog eating bugs. The frog can only do one thing: extend its tongue. But this one action is simultaneously how you move, damage enemies, eat enemies, and deflect projectiles. You will soon be frantically clicking all over your screen to hold back the endless waves of fearsome bugs, all of which require you to defeat them in different ways. And you'll constantly need to manage which enemy to prioritize - because it's one hit and you're croaked.<br><br>Each new difficulty level is gated behind a score threshold. So get those good runs in to advance to the more hectic parts of the game. Take down the coveted Super Heavy enemies to prove yourself. Chase after the elusive Earthworm for bonus points. And find the perfect opportunity to deflect a Bee's stinger into a crowd of enemies for a massive multiplier.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2846690/extras/description_embed.gif?t=1721988013\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2846690/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1721988013","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2846690/page.bg.jpg?t=1721988013","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2846690/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1721988013","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2846690/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1721988013","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Ribbit Rampage is a fast-paced top-down shooter about a frog eating bugs.
