Over the last couple weeks me and my team made a game for the BIgMode game-jam and it's pretty incredible. <br><br>Facet is a multi-genre mind-bending horror themed game with a heavy emphasis on multitasking and managing games within eight different genres.<br><br>It's somewhat similar in atmosphere to The Room Syndrome, but gameplay-wise in a league of it's own. If you at all liked my previous work check it out! <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1114030/extras/Title_art_3.png?t=1703202293\" /><br><i>Title Art by Lizzy Harriss</i><br><br>Link below!<br><br><br><br>Plus, if you want to know about my next retail release game <strong>Oathbane</strong>, head to my twitter as I will be posting updates about it come January!<br><br><i>Twitter </i>- </p><br><h1>Save your game!</h1><p>I can explain... In hindsight, this is probably something that should've made it into the game a lot earlier, but making a saveable game can be a bit tricky and I wasn't sure I would be able to do it. I then reasoned, that since it was supposed to be a really short game, saves wouldn't be needed.<br><br>I now realize that wasn't a great line of thinking, and I've finally bit the bullet, as to say, and figured it out. You are now able to save your game and continue it later. This should allow those who wish to put it down and pick it later, to do just that. And, I think almost just as importantly, those who want to try other endings, but don't want to go through the tedium of playing the whole game again, can now just use a save to get back to the end real quick if they choose to save at that time. I do understand some of you have been a bit frustrated at the lack of a saving mechanic and I do hope this solves that.<br><br>But all things must come to an end, and with that said, this will probably be the last feature updated into the game. There are other titles I wish to continue working on. While working on The Room Syndrome has been a wild ride, I don't see anything else needing to be added or changed without reworking the entire game. So, I think I need to put a bow on this and call it done.<br><br>I will continue to be aware of everything that happens around this game. Any bugs or issues that pop up, I will solve as fast as I can. So keep informing me of anything that breaks!<br><br>Thank you to everyone who played The Room Syndrome!<br><br>Warmest Possible Regards,<br>Jesse &quot;love you all&quot; C.</p><br><h1>Just Updated</h1><p>Hey all!<br>Big patch time!<br><br>This patch brings a lot of fixes and a couple of quality of life updates!<br>First and foremost, all endings should now be fixed. Before there was a massive amount of bugs and inconsistencies with the endings, aka, the wrong ending being displayed, to multiple endings playing out a once. This should now be resolved! If you encounter any further issues with the endings, let me know!<br><br>Next, a couple of missing UI elements have been fixed, and most importantly, I changed the interaction system to be a bit more consistent. This should make it so there is a lot less fiddling to interact with things.<br><br>In the same vain, You may now use the mouse wheel to scroll through the frequencies with more precision! Thanks to &quot;That Martin Guy&quot; for the suggestion!<br><br>And lastly, you are now able to run twice as fast by holding the &quot;shift&quot; key to sprint! Hopefully this will make trying to get some of the other endings a little less tedious.<br><br>Recharged Regards!<br><br>Jesse &quot;Mr. Patch-fix&quot; C.</p><br><h1>Release!</h1><p>Surprise! Well would you look at that. I actually released on time anyway. The game is out now and playable. I hope you all enjoy!<br><br>Reheated Regards,<br><br>Jesse &quot;Finally Finished Something&quot; C.</p><br><h1>Trailer &amp; Another Update</h1><p>For starters, the trailer is up! I'm using this to distract you from the fact I'm once again pushing the release back due me being a little bit of a dumb-dumb. Because I'm a bit of an idiot, I failed to complete a series of key tasks that are required for me to actually hit the release button on time. So... It's out of my hands now. I can say that the game Is pretty much complete and I am mostly waiting for some key things to happen before I can release. So sit tight! It's almost here!<br><br>Room Temperature Regards...<br>Jesse &quot;Tired, Hungry, and Worn Out&quot; C</p><br><h1>Update</h1><p>So quick update for those interested. I'm going to push the release date back to the 1st of November due to a couple of issues. First, the game is nearly complete, but I am still cleaning up some elements of development and it will not be complete soon enough to get the build reviewed in time. Secondly, two quite large games are also releasing on the 25th and It probably isn't the best decision to release on that exact date. So please be patient as the game is cleaned up and readied for release!<br><br>Slightly Lukewarm Regards!<br>Jesse &quot;Really Tired&quot; C.</p><br><h1>Release Date!</h1><p><strong>The release date for The Room Syndrome has been set for the 25th!</strong> I believe if development continues to go as smoothly as it has for the last two weeks, then I should be able to guarantee the 25th. Though like all development processes, I can't really predict the future, and I may hit an unexpected snag or roadblock that could slow progress to an extent. But with that said, I am confident that I will be able to release the game on time.<br><br>So with that, I'll get back to work, and hopefully all you lovely people try out The Room Syndrome upon release!<br><br>The Warmest of Regards!<br>Jesse C.</p><br><h1>Coming Soon</h1><p>It's real, It's here, and it's coming soon.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong>The (Game)</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Isolation breaks an individual down to their core elements.
