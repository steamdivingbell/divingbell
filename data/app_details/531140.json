Once they\u2019re done, they\u2019re done in my eyes. However All the Delicate Duplicates wants to smash that...And while your first time might be quick, second time around you\u2019ll likely take your time and soak in what the game has to offer. All the Delicate Duplicates has certainly left a mark.

Luminaries of such form might include Journey and Limbo and Firewatch, and it\u2019s safe to count All the Delicate Duplicates amongst such company...All The Delicate Duplicates is refreshing simply because it works the brain in ways that few other games even bother to try.
