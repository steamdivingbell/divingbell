Alone, you row to shore and discover its secrets. Lyonesse is a point-and-click game. You experience the mythical land by navigating through hundreds of hand-drawn panels. Moving between each unique panel will allow you to explore the island and experience its erotic encounters. A brief visit will typically last the player 30 minutes, but discovering all the secrets Lyonesse and its nymphs have to offer will captivate the player for much longer.<br><br>The game\u2019s story is organised into four seasons of festivities.
