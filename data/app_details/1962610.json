{"about_the_game":"Hypnagonia is a surrealistic deck-building card game where you play the part of a dreamer captured in a dream realm in their recurring dreams and struggling to overcome their own issues to break out of this loop.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn dreams everything is possible as the dreamer's personality turns into its component aspects which provide the actions to use in the ordeals you have to overcome: Ego, Disposition, Instrument and Injustice<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour chosen archetypes for each aspect will provide you with an initial deck of 12 cards which you will use to overcome Torments in your dreams. Each round you will draw 5 cards and will have 3 immersion to use. Each card in your hand costs an amount of immersion to played and provides some effect in the ordeal. Either providing Confidence to avoid Anxiety, or by interpreting the Torment you're facing. An interpreted Torment is overcome and removed from the ordeal. Do so to all of them, and the ordeal ends, rewarding you with a random choice of new cards (from your chosen archetypes), and/or other things like strange Curios or unlocked Memories.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut that's not all. You will also get to control the dreamer's choices in various surreal or otherwise weird encounters providing multiple options for you to choose from, while you attempt to maintain a balance of their emotional state as they maneuver in their own subconscious until they reach the main Antagonist of each act. Overcome 3 of these Antagonists, and your dreamer can finally achieve the good rest they deserve as they reach a breakthrough in their personal issues.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1962610/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1650609286","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1962610/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1650609286","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1962610/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1650609286","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1962610/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1650609286","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Hypnagonia is a surrealistic deck-building card game where you play the part of a dreamer captured in a dream realm in their recurring dreams and struggling to overcome their own issues to break out of this loop.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn dreams everything is possible as the dreamer's personality turns into its component aspects which provide the actions to use in the ordeals you have to overcome: Ego, Disposition, Instrument and Injustice<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour chosen archetypes for each aspect will provide you with an initial deck of 12 cards which you will use to overcome Torments in your dreams.
