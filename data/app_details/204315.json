{"about_the_game":"Mels is a cool kid that visited the Ronimo studio some months ago as part of a day that was organized for him by the Make-A-Wish Foundation. The Make-A-Wish Foundations is a non-profit organisation that grants wishes to children with life-threatening medical conditions, such as Mels. One of Mels' wishes was to experience and take part in the development process of a game, and we invited him to be part of Awesomenauts. We spent the day with Mels showing him how we make games and we also let him design a skin for his favorite character. This skin is the result of that day! We hope you like it Mels ;)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis DLC contains a custom skin for Sheriff Lonestar in Awesomenauts. You need to have Sheriff Lonestar available as a playable character in order to access the skin in-game. Owning this skin will also unlock the special portrait for use in-game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll the revenue that was received from the skin between its launch and December 31st, 2013, has been donated to the Make A Wish foundation.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/204315?t=1493973824","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/204315?t=1493973824","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/204315/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1493973824","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/204315/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1493973824","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Valve Anti-Cheat enabled","id":8},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Mels is a cool kid that visited the Ronimo studio some months ago as part of a day that was organized for him by the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
