{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Note from the Developer; A Love Letter to Character-Driven 2D adventures</h2>Blightseeker is a game that tries to capture the magic of hopping around in your favorite 2D side scroller, but within a 3D VR world.

Smooth/Snap turning modes, vignettes during fast movement, and other accessibility options will also be available.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Collect Treasures and Tools</h2>Multiple different tools and treasures, from simple torches and delicate statues to a bellows that can spew more than air, can be found in the ruins of this old abandoned world. And quite a few of these tools can be combined for delightfully unexpected results.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Customize your Play</h2>Your bracelet can be customized with new beads to suit your play style. Need a longer jump? find the bead and it's yours. Don't need so much health? Take it off and fill those bead slots with something more useful. The choice is yours.<br><br>Blightseeker is still in early development. I hope you'll wishlist it now though so that you can be the first to know about updates as development progresses.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">You Decide the Fate of this Old World</h2>Do you want to heal this world and its creatures of the blight that has overcome it, or bear witness to this ill power's full potential?
