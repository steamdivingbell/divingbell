{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Rio Grande Railroad\u2019s Tennessee Pass route across the Colorado Rockies: It was legendary, tough, scenic, and steep, and, in reaching an elevation of 10,221 feet above sea level, was the highest standard-gauge main line in the United States. And now, Rio Grande\u2019s renowned Tennessee Pass route comes to Train Simulator Classic!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Created by accomplished developer Milepost Simulations, the Tennessee Pass route for Train Simulator Classic extends 62 main line miles from Buena Vista to Minturn, Colorado, includes the famed Rio Grande (D&amp;RGW) Leadville Branch (extending five miles from Malta to Leadville), and brings to life memorable steam-to-diesel transition-era railroading featuring Rio Grande\u2019s massive and powerful Alco-built L131 2-8-8-2 articulated steam locomotive plus stylish Rio Grande Electro-Motive F7 and GP7 diesels!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the late 1870s, two great western railroads \u2013 the Rio Grande and the Santa Fe \u2013 battled toe-to-toe in a quest to acquire the best route across the spine of the Colorado Rockies. Santa Fe won legendary Raton Pass, while the Rio Grande gained control of a route westward from Pueblo, along the Arkansas River and through the magnificent Royal Gorge. Extending westward toward a rail link with Salt Lake City, Utah, the Rio Grande in the early 1880s pushed farther west along the Arkansas River and across towering Tennessee Pass, which rose to an elevation of more than 10,000 feet above sea level. Rio Grande\u2019s chosen route extended northwest from Salida via Buena Vista, Malta, the summit of Tennessee Pass, and Minturn to Glenwood Springs and beyond.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">To conquer Tennessee Pass was a monumental undertaking that required tracing the path of the Arkansas River; numerous tunnels, cuts, and fills; and, to reach the summit, lengthy main line grades of up to 3 percent. Indeed, D&amp;RGW\u2019s Alco L131 2-8-8-2s were designed and built specifically to tame the grades of Tennessee Pass and when constructed were the most powerful locomotives in North America. Even then, however, it regularly took three, or even four, of the massive articulated locomotives to lift tonnage up the unforgiving 3 percent eastbound climb from Minturn to the 10,221-foot summit of Tennessee Pass.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the era modeled by Milepost Simulations for Train Simulator Classic, the route was operated with a mix of train orders, Absolute Block Signals (ABS), and Centralized Traffic Control (CTC). Along with the line\u2019s blend of single- and double-track, the route delivers diverse and challenging operations. The line via Tennessee Pass remained D&amp;RGW\u2019s primary standard-gauge path across the Rockies until the opening of the Moffat Route and the Dotsero Cutoff in 1932, and thereafter continued to serve as a busy freight artery even after Rio Grande was merged into Southern Pacific in 1988. With SP\u2019s merger into Union Pacific in 1996, however, the line became largely redundant and today remains in place but inactive.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Thanks to Milepost Simulations\u2019 Tennessee Pass route for Train Simulator Classic, we can return to the glory days of the D&amp;RGW during the 1940s and 1950s when a steady flow of heavy tonnage climbed over the heights of the Rockies, powered by massive steam and brand-new diesel locomotives. In addition to stunning and dramatic Rocky Mountain scenery, the route features detailed and authentic re-creations of D&amp;RGW yards, structures, and servicing facilities at locations including Minturn, Malta, Buena Vista, and Leadville. The diesels included with the Tennessee Pass route are dressed in Rio Grande\u2019s beautiful \u201cas delivered\u201d black-and-gold liveries, and the route also features a selection of eleven types of freight rolling stock in the colors of D&amp;RGW and other era-appropriate railroads. Among the selection of equipment are Rio Grande steel and wood cabooses.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With the Tennessee Pass route for Train Simulator Classic, you will climb aboard steam and diesel power and get right to work thanks to a selection of eight career scenarios and two free-roam scenarios, plus the route is also quick-drive enabled.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Rio Grande\u2019s Tennessee Pass route was one of America\u2019s most remarkable, challenging, and historic main line mountain railroads, and the steam-to-diesel transition era was a time of unmatched and dramatic railroading.
