The game takes the classical progression formula and adds a twist; unlocks are now split between upgrading the main character, his possession powers, and the strength of the bodies he takes control of, instead of searching for better weapons and armor to utilize.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"></h2>The game follows the souls-like pattern of harsh and unforgiving enemies, with clear telegraphed movesets that can be learned and exploited, and punishing bosses. Player skill reigns supreme - great emphasis has been placed on the ability to play the game as you like, even without utilizing the core &quot;possession&quot; mechanic, or getting upgrades.
