{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">RenewEd3D is an interactive software designed to enhance Renewable Energy Education (REE) through Non-Immersive Virtual Reality. It integrates images, text explanations, voice narration, animations, and quizzes to facilitate learning. The software is bilingual, offering narration in both English and Malay to assist students, especially in pronunciation of scientific terms. Students explore the content, engaging with different modules and answering quizzes at the end of each session. Its goal is to raise awareness of renewable energy in an engaging and immersive way.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The gameplay in <strong>RenewEd3D\u00a0</strong>revolves around an  exploration of renewable energy concepts through a series of themed levels. Here's a breakdown of how the gameplay is structured:</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>1. Level Exploration:</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Students navigate through different levels, each designed to present a new aspect of renewable energy education. The levels are structured to encourage active learning and exploration:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Level 1: The Beginning</strong> </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Level 2: Energy Crisis</strong> </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Level 3: Inspiration</strong> </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Level 4: Exploration</strong> </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Level 5: New Hope</strong> </p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3343880/extras/Screenshot1.png?t=1734353654\" /></p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>2. Interaction and Learning:</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Virtual Interactions</strong>: Students explore various renewable energy systems (such as wind, solar, hydro, etc.) in virtual environments. These environments are designed to mimic real-world scenarios, allowing players to interact with energy systems, solve energy-related challenges, and make decisions that affect the outcome of their virtual energy projects.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Quizzes and Challenges</strong>: At the end of each level, students face a quiz or challenge that tests their understanding of the concepts covered. The quizzes are integrated into the gameplay, ensuring that students apply what they\u2019ve learned and reinforce key concepts through interactive feedback.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Rewards and Progression</strong>: As players complete quizzes and challenges, they earn points or rewards, unlocking new levels and gaining access to more complex content.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>3.
