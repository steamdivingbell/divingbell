{"about_the_game":"A short RPG that is a parody based on the Count of Monte Cristo, with many liberties taken that make it not very close to the original story. It's got turn based combat. It's about 2-3 hours long, with a few boss fights in it. It has over 40 maps. There are some jokes and humor that make it really neat. It has a decent amount of characters from the 1844 novel. It's a pixel RPG based on everyone's favorite Alexander Dumas book, made in RPGmaker MZ.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1617570/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1625691985","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1617570/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1625691985","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1617570/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1625691985","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1617570/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1625691985","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A short RPG that is a parody based on the Count of Monte Cristo, with many liberties taken that make it not very close to the original story.
