{"about_the_game":"Perhaps you were just bored or even lonely. Whatever the reason, you foolishly agreed to test out a friend's custom security system. Things start off smoothy, as you monitor your friends wandering throughout the house and occasionally slam your magnetically sealed door in their faces. Then cameras start to break. Your sanity wanes and you start to see impossible visions. A strange spider-like creature joins the creeping entities outside your room. It might all be in your head, but this is becoming a lot more than what you signed up for!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnjoy a simple, fun, and occasionally frightening simulation. Fun for all ages provided you can handle the scares. No gore, no violence. Just girlish yells followed immediately by nervous laughter.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"RAWWWWRRR","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/509290/4c9c21918f363203ac1d93eba2fd894bc26ded28.jpg"},{"name":"Two At Once","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/509290/a8d078c0437daf724719e5ea5d77aa7baf8b882f.jpg"},{"name":"Who Needs Sanity","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/509290/a4c0956afb577f6fbb7e03a13ecb45811f2498c7.jpg"},{"name":"Knife Hallucination","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/509290/f8a5269139f6b252eb4ca912d48fc93c64f5715e.jpg"},{"name":"AW GAWD BEEZ!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/509290/5f05bbecc0218c238a88b79237c7170368002b2b.jpg"},{"name":"Victory","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/509290/02256c378919e83007394b88a1d819fbdeee6612.jpg"}],"total":6},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/509290/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1504965932","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/509290/page.bg.jpg?t=1504965932","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/509290/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1504965932","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/509290/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1504965932","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Perhaps you were just bored or even lonely.
