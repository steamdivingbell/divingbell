{"about_the_game":"The game puts players at the forefront of a battle against rebelling turkeys. In this episode, the turkeys have constructed a gigantic cannon capable of launching planet-scale eggs against Earth, with the ultimate goal of encrusting humanity in an impenetrable wall made of egg white. Joined by an unlikely ally, players will travel to foreign, unexplored galaxies in an effort to locate and destroy the egg cannon before it reaches Earth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Thanksgiving Edition revolves around humanity's fight to regain control of Thanksgiving dinner against the rebellious turkeys and their army of allied intergalactic brethren. Major characters have been redesigned to incorporate traditional Thanksgiving elements: turkeys, pumpkins, pilgrim hats, etc. The player's intergalactic journey is also accentuated by unique fantastic scenarios, such as navigating through a field of gigantic floating feathers, or dodging molten planet chunks during a supernova explosion.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/370402/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1695975407","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/370402/page.bg.jpg?t=1695975407","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/370402/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1695975407","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/370402/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1695975407","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"The game puts players at the forefront of a battle against rebelling turkeys.
