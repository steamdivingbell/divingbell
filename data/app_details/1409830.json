You play as Thorald Olavson, a warrior hell-bent on tracking down the Jarl who burned down his home, kidnapped his beloved, and fled to distant England.<br><br>Raise a warband, establish strongholds, and personally lead your troops in a grand saga of vengeance. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1409830/extras/headline_01.png?t=1735791948\" /><br>Across the North Sea, far from home, you must first establish a stronghold from which to begin your assault. Hunting your nemesis down will take resources, soldiers, and strategic thinking. Manage a growing economy, establish siege camps and training grounds, raise a massive host, and raid neighboring villages to bolster your resources and push your enemy back.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Construct and upgrade a variety of buildings to collect resources, recruit warriors, and upgrade their capabilities and equipment. Elevate your burgeoning villages into powerful strongholds that provide well-armed troops and mighty siege engines.<br></li><li>Establish defensive structures as you push further afield \u2013 the enemy will not sit idly by in the face of your encroachment, and you can expect conquered border towns to turn into contested battlegrounds. Mercenaries such as pyromaniacs and skilled hunters exclusively available at these towns can turn the tide of battle.<br></li><li>With limited resources, planning your expansions and upgrades is of the utmost importance to ensure you have the right soldiers available at any given time. Will you prioritize a larger army of low-tier units? Or will you seek out expensive champions to help forge your path? A sea of swordsmen will fall to enemy archers perched behind stone walls unless upgraded with shields, just as a lone shaman would be swarmed by enemy footmen if left without an escort. </li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1409830/extras/image_02_loop.gif?t=1735791948\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1409830/extras/headline_02.png?t=1735791948\" /><br>Lead your men in tactical combat by issuing orders and utilizing special abilities and formations.

Success in battle comes from using the right troops for the right situation. Will you utilize the shaman for their healing powers to keep your troops fighting for longer, or is the rapid swinging of the berserker more your speed?<br></li><li>Command your troops to overcome evolving situations on the battlefield \u2013 order them to fall in line behind you, to charge forward, to retreat, or to form the impregnable shield wall when under a hail of arrows. Quick thinking, positioning, and army composition all play a major role in battle.<br></li><li>Break through the enemy shield wall and cut them down with your own blade or become a master of the bow and spear as you destroy your enemy from a distance. Fling flasks of tar and fire, equip powerful runes to embolden your troops, and down flasks of mead to maintain your fortitude as you stand with your men, protect their retreats, and lead their assaults.
