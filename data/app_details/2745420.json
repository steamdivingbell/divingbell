{"about_the_game":"A unique first person atmospheric exploration game set in a surreal woods nestled within the confines of a bizarre dream known as the Collective Reverie, a nexus of all dreamers where their individual hopes and fears coalesce into a bizarre nightmare. In this eerie landscape, you're not just a visitor but a catalyst for change. Your interactions\u2014whether with the ethereal phantoms, the inexplicable creatures, or horrors that defy the limits of human comprehension\u2014will shape the world around you. Each choice you make reveals a new path, offering a glimmer of hope to escape the nightmarish reality or, alternatively, seducing you further into the unfathomable depths of darkness.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe world of your dream is an ever-shifting maze, generated anew with each step you take. The environment and its inhabitants respond dynamically to your actions, making every journey unique. The items you choose to interact with determine the creatures and challenges that will emerge, crafting a personalized tale of terror and wonder.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHidden within this dream are nine distinct endings, each a conclusion to the story you weave with your choices. These endings range from finding a way to break free from the grip of the nightmare, to surrendering to its sinister allure and plunging deeper into the abyss. Uncovering these conclusions requires keen observation, puzzle-solving prowess, and the courage to face the unknown.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDiscover the secrets hidden in plain sight, solve obscure puzzles that challenge your understanding, and decipher cryptic messages that hint at a deeper mystery. Your journey through the surreal woods is a quest for truth, a search for answers in a place where questions multiply with every whispered wind. Will you find your way out, or will you become a permanent resident of the dream?","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Thank you for playing","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2745420/5e6017fd7f2d82e874d5e0d77aee52fb2fb395c6.jpg"},{"name":"Reckless Reverie","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2745420/97a66fa701dccea7c4f2dd7bd0acb4624a62e73e.jpg"},{"name":"Feed the Fishes","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2745420/1f2ff9b1417ed541a69fcc40616a2182a65f4cb7.jpg"},{"name":"Wayward Wanderers","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2745420/d81fb5e2e01c2550f48e989d144e344778453507.jpg"},{"name":"Familiar Favors","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2745420/ad07637bb407713a19296c7ad0d5b96b212db01a.jpg"},{"name":"Goal of Greed","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2745420/7441e8c920635f2928d57afaf0f6f387f3cd9f89.jpg"},{"name":"Feathers of Freedom","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2745420/c62156b0a9dbd2d1b17910940e2b3f15178900c1.jpg"},{"name":"Debted to Dragons","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2745420/14f520bf7564d50e077fd68bab4eec96d15ab59f.jpg"},{"name":"Writer of Red Letters","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2745420/4dd7470acc29b1e1d168a089c77c68fc1572f4f3.jpg"},{"name":"Dreamer in the Depths","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2745420/1a72fec5f82a58151f488f2f9658caea61246e28.jpg"}],"total":10},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2745420/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1713414307","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2745420/page.bg.jpg?t=1713414307","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2745420/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1713414307","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2745420/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1713414307","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"A unique first person atmospheric exploration game set in a surreal woods nestled within the confines of a bizarre dream known as the Collective Reverie, a nexus of all dreamers where their individual hopes and fears coalesce into a bizarre nightmare.
