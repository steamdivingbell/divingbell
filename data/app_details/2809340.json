{"about_the_game":"<i>Kneedle Knight</i> is a third-person, puzzle platformer game developed by students at SMU Guildhall Cohort 32. In <i>Kneedle Knight</i>, the player controls a mouse knight that uses his magical needle to sew fabric which he can merge into, moving back and forth between 3D and 2D. <br><br>Sir Lukoss the Small was a noble knight sent on a quest to defeat the evil Witch of Fabric. The Witch, using her enchanted fabric, imprisoned and transformed many citizens and knights into malicious fabrications. Sir Lukoss climbed up through her fortress to put an end to her tyranny, only to be hexed by her magic and transformed into a mouse. In the dark dungeon of the Witch\u2019s lair, the mouse finds a magic needle, granting him special powers to sew fabric of his own and merge in and out of the enchanted threadwork. <br><br>Now Sir Lukoss must use his newfound weapon to sew his path forward and up through the evil stronghold. The mouse knight can use his needle to solve puzzles, overcome challenging obstacles, and defeat the animated candle minions of the Witch. All with the hopes of returning to face the Witch of Fabric yet again to finish his noble quest.<br><br>Features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Original soundtrack</li></ul><br><strong>Lead Music Composer</strong><br>Eduardo Rodriguez-Pi\u00f1a <br><br><strong>Music Composers</strong><br>Max Whittaker<br>Brent Fatherly<br>Brandon Morrison<br><br>Original Music Composed and Performed by:<br><br><strong>Recording, Mix, Master Engineer</strong><br>Eduardo Rodriguez-Pi\u00f1a <br><br><strong>Cello:</strong><br>Katelyn Petersen<br><br><strong>Double Bass:</strong><br>Jackson Benjamin<br>Israel MacDonald<br><br><strong>Flute:</strong><br>Kristen Edwards<br>Kendra Hamblin<br><br><strong>French Horn:</strong><br>Jackson Thomas Ward<br><br><strong> Percussion:</strong><br>Melody Tang<br><br><strong>Viola:</strong><br>Spencer Byrd<br><br><strong>Violin:</strong><br>Duncan McVety<br>Brandon Morrison<br>Matt Velasquez","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2809340/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1709766535","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2809340/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1709766535","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2809340/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1709766535","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2809340/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1709766535","categories":[{"description":"Additional High-Quality Audio","id":50}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<i>Kneedle Knight</i> is a third-person, puzzle platformer game developed by students at SMU Guildhall Cohort 32.
