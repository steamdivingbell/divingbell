{"about_the_game":"<i>HIIIII im kalva. I love stikrs and nip. my favorate foob is cearbord. can you help me find my nip?</i><br><br>Ker-Chunk! is a small game I made as my senior thesis. You follow Kalva, a Co-Alo, and his journey to find treasure as well as his missing catnip. The game is a 3D sidescroller with some hand-drawn elements. The entire game is voice-acted, subtitled, and easy to play. Ker-Chunk is also very PG and safe for all audiences. I spent many months creating this small slice of planet Bethal, so enjoy! <br><br>-Mint","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2945240/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1722444101","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2945240/page.bg.jpg?t=1722444101","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2945240/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1722444101","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2945240/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1722444101","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<i>HIIIII im kalva.
