{"about_the_game":"The T-55 Tyro is a two seat, single engine, supersonic jet aircraft built to serve primarily as a trainer. It is capable of equipping all types of weapons and sensors, so it can be used to train all kinds of scenarios, and even be used for combat.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">IMPORTANT NOTE: For multiplayer, only one player per aircraft needs to own the DLC! A player who doesn't own it can hop into the other seat.</h2><br><br>The T-55 features a two seat cockpit with the same set of standard controls and displays in both seats. The rear instructor cockpit has extra tools such as MFD mirroring (view and control the copilot/student's MFDs) and flight control lock/override modes to help teach new pilots. The T-55 has a lower thrust to weight ratio and a lower drag profile compared to the other jets. This makes energy management more important when it comes to basic fighter maneuvers. This is a great tool if you have a friend who's getting into VTOL VR but needs a little help grasping the various aircraft systems, flight skills, and combat strategies.<br><br>This aircraft will release along with VTOL VR update 1.6, which will add custom livery (skins) support. Several trainer, aggressor, and airshow liveries are included for the T-55.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2141700/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1679684452","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2141700/page.bg.jpg?t=1679684452","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2141700/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1679684452","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2141700/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1679684452","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The T-55 Tyro is a two seat, single engine, supersonic jet aircraft built to serve primarily as a trainer.
