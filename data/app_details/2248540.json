{"about_the_game":"You are the newest arrival to a mysterious world, your goal being to reclaim the Space Dimensions, and seek out the secret of the lost Sanctum Arcadia.  Sanctum Arcadia is an arcade-style top-down space shooter that blends elements of bullet-hell, zero-g space physics, roguelikes and ARPGs.<br><br>This game was created to offer an easy-to-learn, difficult-to-master style of combat, where danger is always clearly telegraphed and mostly avoidable.  This game will truly challenge your spatial awareness and decision making.  Combat is paced to be engaging, but not require twitch-like reflexes.  Playing smart and mastering your ship's movement will get you far.<br><br>This game also offers a balance between most rogue-likes and rpgs.  Having punishing deaths makes your victories all the more meaningful, but there is still long-term forward progress.<br><br>There are several systems of player powerups, including stackable relics [buffs], and randomly-generated items.  Items come in tiers of strength, denoted by their colors.  Higher tiers will have more 'affixes' and larger stat increases.  Items can be 'farmed' for those players who wish to seek the best items.<br><br>You will generally be given 3 different map options to play, each with their own modifiers for XP rate, player buffs, enemy buffs, and rewards for completion.  You will need to weigh risk-reward, as sometimes your ship will be weak, but a difficult map offers a large reward.  There are always ways to challenge yourself or to play at a more relaxed pace.<br><br>This is an early-access game, so a few big features are still to come, but the core parts of the game are in a pretty nice state.  This game will continue to be regularly updated, and has some ambitious goals in the long run.<br><br>We hope you enjoy your stay in Sanctum Arcadia.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2248540?t=1695618113","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2248540?t=1695618113","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2248540/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1695618113","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2248540/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1695618113","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You are the newest arrival to a mysterious world, your goal being to reclaim the Space Dimensions, and seek out the secret of the lost Sanctum Arcadia.
