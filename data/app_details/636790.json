The more money you earn on flipping the cars the more you can invest back in your workshop to improve it. Get access to premium cars as a reward for having best in class workshop. All of that nicely packed as an old school arcade pinball game with voxel look and feel.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/636790/extras/640x180Logo.png?t=1730814821\" /><br><br>Apart from the best in class pinball experience there is a whole city in the top part of the gametable where you can go to test your car.
