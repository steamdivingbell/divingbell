{"about_the_game":"Bowling without the bowling ball is both lethal and non-lethal.  <br />\r\n  <br />\r\nWith the Arena game you have a bowling score and a game score.  Earn bonus shots to use against other targets. The Hillbilly level is expert, and Redneck is an easier level given the number of increased possibilities.  There are several targets to hit, and you need to be careful of pets as it will count against you if they get hit.  Deer season or rabbit season is earned by hitting tires or silhouettes in the center.  The squirrel bag limit increases with the number of shots or replacements.  Goose in the wild if you get 3 shots in a row.   Choose from different ammo and arrows as well as several pistols, shotguns, a shotgun, a bow, and crossbows.  Levels 9 and 10 are non-lethal and use a basketball or baseball shooter.  Levels 17 and 18 are timed and you must hit the pins before the time runs out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArtillery Bowling has 21 formations of enemies marching or crewing on pirate ships to strike with different weapons.  Switch between drones, catapults, .50 caliber machine guns, cannons, and ballistae.  Use &quot;reload&quot; to switch between flaming arrows and explosive arrows on the ballista.  Use &quot;reload&quot; to switch between cannonballs and cannon shots with the cannon.  Drones can replenish grenades to the refueling platform.   Bowling scoring is done when all 21 fantasy formations or pirate crew record a score based on the number of shots or dummies destroyed.  Bonus for each original redneck mannequin saved.  A new redneck dummy will spawn causing penalties if 4 to 5 original dummies are hit at sea or on land.  Your drone, catapult, 50 caliber machine guns, cannons, and ballistae can be damaged with a time limit penalty depending on the difficulty of the level.   Less than -10000 score ends the game.  The hit rate improves your score.  You have unlimited ammo.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArena Bowling - Hit the pins in an unusual Bowling Arena.
