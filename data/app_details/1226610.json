{"about_the_game":"Pandora Galaxy is a PC game. The game is based in space, in the far future, with elements of exploration and trade. The protagonist of the game is a merchant engaged in interplanetary trade, but as the story unfolds, the player can choose the path of an interstellar pirate or a planetary explorer. In addition, players can complete NPC quests to advance the plot. The game doesn\u2019t have a fixed plot route, but through clues in the game, players will slowly discover the history of interstellar trade and the lost forgotten hometown of the humans, \u201cEarth\u201d.
