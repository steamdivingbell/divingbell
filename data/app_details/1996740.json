{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dagger Woods VR is inspired by true stories and local legends, offering players a psychological thriller experience that combines elements of puzzle-solving, clue-finding, mystery, and adventure.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The narrative centers around Maggie Carmichael, a single mother in the 1950s, and unfolds a day after her three children mysteriously vanish in the snow-covered woods. The game explores Maggie's haunting journey as she intertwines historical events with her determination to confront a malevolent force lurking in Dagger Woods.\u00a0Maggie believes that the woods have been haunted by Hidey-Hinder, the Dagger Woods Howler\u00a0since the 1700s.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">She connects several historical incidents to Hidey-Hinder\u2019s influence, including the story of Mary-Ellen MacDonald and the 1922 fires in Caledonia Mills, NS, which share eerie similarities. Both Maggie and Mary-Ellen were adopted into new families during their teenage years, and when confronted about their actions, both exhibited no memory or rationale for them. Witnesses in both instances reported that neither Maggie nor Mary-Ellen were capable of causing the incidents, and they described experiencing numerous abnormal occurrences, sensing dark energy, and observing inexplicable phenomena.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Drawn to these parallels, Maggie begins to question the supernatural influence of Hidey-Hinder on her own life. The creature is notorious for preying on vulnerable individuals, coercing them into committing heinous acts, or causing them to disappear without a trace. Determined to rescue her children from Hidey-Hinder's clutches, Maggie embarks on her quest, during which the creature attempts to communicate with her.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Step into her shoes to find the truth behind the incidents!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Content Features:</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Dynamic Narrative</strong>: Experience Maggie\u2019s haunting journey through branching choices that impact her descent into the supernatural truth.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Puzzle-Solving &amp; Exploration</strong>: Solve intricate puzzles and piece together the story through interactive objects, notes, and environmental storytelling.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Historical Connections</strong>: Investigate ties to real-life legends like the 1922 Caledonia Mills fires and the mysterious case of Mary-Ellen MacDonald.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Psychological Thrills</strong>: Encounter supernatural phenomena, dark visions, and unsettling interactions with the enigmatic Hidey-Hinder.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Replay Value</strong>: Uncover hidden lore, explore alternate paths, and achieve different endings based on your actions.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1996740?t=1737388764","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1996740/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1737388764","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1996740/1f2deee182ae952030304b32c5bc7d17a9a56e63/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737388764","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1996740/1f2deee182ae952030304b32c5bc7d17a9a56e63/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737388764","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"In a few scenes, there are sensitive depictions such as:\r\n- Act of self-harm\r\n- Gore\r\n- Drug use"},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dagger Woods VR is inspired by true stories and local legends, offering players a psychological thriller experience that combines elements of puzzle-solving, clue-finding, mystery, and adventure.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The narrative centers around Maggie Carmichael, a single mother in the 1950s, and unfolds a day after her three children mysteriously vanish in the snow-covered woods.
