{"about_the_game":"It's 1809, and the Corps of Discovery has recently returned from their expedition into the new American wilderness.  They brought home tales of a land filled with an endless bounty of fur, game, and gold, spurring thousands of people to flock up the mighty Missouri river to find their fortunes.  Little do they know of the true horrors lurking in this land of riches.  Discounted as myths and legends by optimistic voyagers, blinded by the promise of wealth and adventure, many do not understand the mistake they've made until it is too late.
