{"about_the_game":"This game is intended as a demonstration of my game development ability. It consists of these three fun arcade style games:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBrick Fish Racing is a fast-paced, intergalactic, fish racing game! Become a brick to escape gravity wells, break glass, and smash your enemies! Be the first to the top of the procedurally generated maps to win all the fish food!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Flap Tapper use cute characters to soar past enemies in this rhythmic flying game! Flap your wings at just the right time to boost yourself higher and higher. Explore tough challenge rooms through portals, each with difficult bosses to defeat!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChris Kerfuffle is a brutal fighting game where you can bonk various recolors of me, the developer, to their death! You can quickly change sizes to avoid punches or to land devastating blows!","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/787990?t=1520098547","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/787990?t=1520098547","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/787990/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1520098547","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/787990/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1520098547","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This game is intended as a demonstration of my game development ability.
