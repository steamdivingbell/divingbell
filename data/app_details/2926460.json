{"about_the_game":"Space Zone is a science-based 1:1 scale simulation of the universe, featuring billions and billions of galaxies, nebulae, stars and planets shown in full, real-life scale. You can explore all of time and space - travel between the stars at a million times the speed of light. Each planet you encounter on your journey will have a procedural 3D landscape with detailed textures. Everything you see in the sky\u2014stars and galaxies, planets and moons, neutron stars, star clusters and nebulae\u2014is yours to explore. At your disposal is a spaceship that allows you to fly anywhere in the universe in Flight Simulator mode.<br />\r\nFeatures of the Space Zone Planetarium:<br />\r\nAll types of celestial objects are represented: galaxies, nebulae, stars and star clusters. Regions of space not yet cataloged contain procedurally generated objects: galaxies, stars, star clusters, nebulae and planetary systems.<br />\r\nCONTROL:<br />\r\nYou can move freely throughout the universe - move smoothly between any objects and at any distance, from the surface to orbit, into interstellar and intergalactic space. Moving around the space is as simple as click and go, with game-style free flight using the WASD keys or gamepad.<br />\r\nGRAPHIC:<br />\r\nVolumetric 3D models of galaxies and nebulae with interstellar dust clouds, as well as 3D landscapes of planets and stars. Many solar system bodies use actual space probe data, and huge high-resolution texture packs are available as free DLC. For unmapped and procedural planets, the surface is generated procedurally using your computer's GPU.<br />\r\nSPACE SCIENCE:<br />\r\nInternational Space Station exploration mode. You can explore the station inside and out. At the same time, it is possible to control the time scale. You can speed up time or stop it, for example, to watch sunsets or sunrises from a space station.<br />\r\nThe world is completely open and is a highly detailed 3D universe. There are a number of tools for easy navigation through the solar system and the milky way.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2926460?t=1715510487","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2926460/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1715510487","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2926460/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1715510487","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2926460/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1715510487","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Space Zone is a science-based 1:1 scale simulation of the universe, featuring billions and billions of galaxies, nebulae, stars and planets shown in full, real-life scale.
