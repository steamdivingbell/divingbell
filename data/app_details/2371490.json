{"about_the_game":"Pasture is an \u2018Action\u2019 farming simulator set in the Northern Territory of Australia. A homage to the rugged people who live and breathe the most challenging and exciting farming lifestyle in the world: Being an NT Pastoralist. Pasture allows gamers from all over the world to experience the highs and lows of being a pastoralist, doing battle with the weather, the markets, and mother nature herself to come out on top as they build their cattle empire. Make no mistake, without the vigilant stewardship of your property, your herd will escape, be predated upon, or perish. Clever management can cause your herd to flourish, your infrastructure to be sound, and your bank account to blossom. This sim lets nature take course whether you are watching it or not. There are the old ways to do things, which you will be taught, but there is always new ground to be broken, and your innovation can mean the difference between boom and bust.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2371490/extras/Red_HC_Green_Paddock_600_x_338.gif?t=1721026791\" /><br><br><strong>EXPERIENCE</strong><br>- Mustering<br>- Drafting<br>- Breeding and Genetics<br>- Buying and selling cattle<br>- Building and maintaining your station<br>- Pest Management<br>- Face environmental factors like drought and flooding<br>- Sustainable farming practices<br><br><strong>FEATURES</strong><br>- Pasture's unique herding algorithm allows each cow and bull to be individually different.
