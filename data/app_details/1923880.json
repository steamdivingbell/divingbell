{"about_the_game":"Sea of Minds is an immersive game in which the player moves through a crowd by slipping into the bodies of the people in it. Once inside a body, the player can see through its eyes, but cannot move freely and must rely on the person's movement to move forward. They can, however, move into the body of another person.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach person is different, and when the player is in possession of one, they can also observe their train of thought. By moving between characters, the player becomes aware of their thoughts, opinions and questions, and uses them to unravel the history of this world.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1923880/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1717187875","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1923880/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1717187875","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1923880/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1717187875","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1923880/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1717187875","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Sea of Minds is an immersive game in which the player moves through a crowd by slipping into the bodies of the people in it.
