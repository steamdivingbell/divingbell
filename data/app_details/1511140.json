{"about_the_game":"Laser Attraction is a puzzle game where you manipulate laser beams to reach their destination. With accurate light physics, make use of reflection and refraction to control the path of light. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe laser beams are created with red, green and blue lasers that blend together. As the different wavelengths refract at different angles you can use dispersion to separate them into individual beams of light. Or you can pass the beam through a filter to reflect a single colour.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUse the tools provided to direct one or more laser beams, to mix and separate colours, open doors, hit targets and solve the puzzles, many with multiple solutions. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeaturing 60 puzzles, original music, no timer or locked puzzles, complete the game at your own pace.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"The Answer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1511140/868c864a615b37b1f6312326ee223e7d5d9de3ca.jpg"},{"name":"Hey, put that back.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1511140/01c236a2130ead195340c99d6c409163e025b359.jpg"},{"name":"Thank you","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1511140/8cdc4c2894f26aa6d96536e7776666b77f368137.jpg"},{"name":"Complete 12 Puzzles","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1511140/2d8c9f118ab735213a014f1078adabe5099a7478.jpg"},{"name":"Complete 24 Puzzles","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1511140/0a89f515173e7965ae4268bf53393fe1938778ac.jpg"},{"name":"Complete 36 Puzzles","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1511140/d2518686c40c124f3e34644a7ac8497d2c698a72.jpg"},{"name":"Complete 48 Puzzles","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1511140/5a9664d5cbb21f879b88bec8ca905d0f5b791e24.jpg"},{"name":"Complete 60 Puzzles","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1511140/c5b27fd840216697b64e4e457fe5264566ab04d5.jpg"}],"total":8},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1511140?t=1634771521","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1511140/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1634771521","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1511140/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1634771521","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1511140/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1634771521","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Laser Attraction is a puzzle game where you manipulate laser beams to reach their destination.
