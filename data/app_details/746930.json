And for the Runemage, your ablity to cast spells is determined by how quickly and precisely you can draw the ancient symbols of runespeak. Whether you're looking for an up-close-and-personal, physically demanding melee role, or a more planned-out approach to combat via the musketeer's orbs, you'll find that combat in OrbusVR is unlike any other MMO you've ever played.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Relax</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When you're ready to put down your sword for the day, you've got some great options available to kick back and relax.
