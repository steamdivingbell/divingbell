{"about_the_game":"<i>In the Andromeda galaxy, humanity doesn't know why it is on the planet Monarch or how it got there. When an underwater accident in Monarch Harbour awakens a strange power, four very different women are drawn into each other's orbit, and into a race towards the mysteries of Monarch's origins.</i><br><br>You play all four heroines in this big multi-chapter sci-fi text adventure set in a young galactic colony still discovering its identities. Type your commands and read what happens next as you negotiate underwater mechs, AIs, abandoned cities, crime, friendship, suspense, horror, humour, an art exhibition, virtual realities and a tank. This is a prose gaming experience offering all the inner-world power of a novel plus the fine-grained puzzle and world engagement of gaming. The only graphics are in the automap!<br><br>Puzzles are woven throughout the game, starting out light but becoming more complex as the story evolves. You'll be doing different things in different locations in every chapter as you help the characters pursue their goals, some noble and some the opposite. You'll explore, deal with friends and enemies, overcome physical and mental obstacles, fight, flee, and pursue mysteries.<br><br>Psychology drives the narration for each character in a first-person style planting you firmly in their mindset.
