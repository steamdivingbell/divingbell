{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Long, long ago, there was a race with spiritual power, who sought inner peace and mastered the spiritual power centered on love. They were kind and powerful, guarding the earth. At the same time, there emerged a race representing material power, who sought material desires and power from the outside, constantly creating artificial intelligence robots to serve themselves. Due to the invention of machines, the balance of natural ecology has been disrupted, and the earth's resources continue to deplete. As the Earth was about to be destroyed, a war had to be launched to protect it, and a great battle of prehistoric civilizations began. Both races represent their respective civilizations and adhere to their own beliefs. Collide and merge with each other! In the end, both major races paid a tragic price! The Earth has finally been saved. Two civilizations have also disappeared forever from history!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Player 1: Use the WSAD key to control movement, double-click the directional keys to run, use the J key to attack, use the K key to jump, use the L key to defend and restore magic, and use the UIO key for special skill attacks</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Player 2: Use the directional keys to control movement, double-click the directional keys to run, use the 1 key to attack, use the 2 key to jump, use the 3 key to defend and restore magic, and use the 456 key for special skill attacks</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dragon and Phoenix &quot;is a magnificent action fighting game!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Regarding this game, the trial version can be played as a single player or two player game.
