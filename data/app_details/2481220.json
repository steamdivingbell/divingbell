We can't wait to hear from you!<br><br><strong>About this game:</strong><br><br>Automate Defend Repeat combines factory building with tower defense.     As you build your factory you will find you need new materials to continue.  You obtain those materials by placing a building called a Thumper.  The Thumper triggers monsters to spawn and attack it.   You can defeat those monsters for rare resources to unlock new technology.  Defeating the Boss of each resource type will allow you to build miners to get more of the rare resource, or to build the next Thumper.   Automate your factory, Defend your thumpers, and Repeat!<br><br>Currently in the game:<br>* 80+ Buildings and items.<br>* Factory game mechanics.<br>* Tower Defense game mechanics.<br>* 6 bosses, each unlocking their own technology tier.<br>* 7 turrets and multiple ammo options for each<br>* 12 Mob types and 6 different mob abilities<br>* Support for bases spanning thousand+ blocks<br>* Procedurally generated maps<br>* New Game + point system, 4 NG+ options to make the game easier, and 4 to add more challenges.<br><br>Beating the game will likely take most players 20+ hours, and there is a New Game+ option for players who want to keep going.<br><br><strong>Key Features:</strong><br><br><strong>Tower Defense:</strong> Each resource extraction disturbs the local residents - Beings rather attached to their planet's minerals. Construct and adapt your defenses to fend off these unique beings, each with their own abilities and quirks.<br><br><strong>Boss Fights:</strong> When you are ready to progress, summon and defeat the boss to unlock the next level of tower defense.<br><br><strong>New Game +</strong>: Once you conquer the map, earn a new game + point, and start again with additional modifiers that can make the game more fun or more challenging.<br><br><strong>Procedurally Generated Infinite Universe:</strong> No two playthroughs are the same in ADR. Every game map is procedurally generated and infinite, making each venture a unique experience.<br><br><strong>Difficulty Modifiers: </strong> Defeating monsters for resources not stressful enough? You can ramp up the difficulty to &quot;Impossible&quot; and challenge yourself.  Or reach New Game + mode and enable options like &quot;All Bosses&quot;, or &quot;Mobs Ignore Walls&quot; for a true challenge.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Slayer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2481220/1413c6a1fb5efc9dc46239873200587014ae69ab.jpg"},{"name":"Slayer Supreme","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2481220/07392283e73345e5d3e92818933693e3d5a889d6.jpg"},{"name":"Destroyer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2481220/9b8f44c6f67aa0825f96184ce9bf348bda681485.jpg"},{"name":"Mythic Destroyer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2481220/3535c369acdb2d3089e04252a689c4291813f3c0.jpg"},{"name":"Gatherer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2481220/6643ea68a4c710ef0e83170d03e6207fe1abfb7e.jpg"},{"name":"Diverse Collector","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2481220/bf603381b233a90b43ac310d2a1b82ac214c3d98.jpg"},{"name":"Glidercat","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2481220/73377fc8d87c2545ba3b9f935670d38655a32190.jpg"},{"name":"Kevin Star","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2481220/927ded5c9cea49bd2c8d6c4d27c4e29a8bef8145.jpg"},{"name":"Pebble Overflow","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2481220/bcee724a9566fa5bb13e750e39eca83a71e3d96e.jpg"},{"name":"Kill Stone Boss On Normal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2481220/f682ac50d3fa52763af4ade09d0fd0a6897d0faa.jpg"}],"total":72},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2481220/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714060844","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2481220/page.bg.jpg?t=1714060844","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2481220/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714060844","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2481220/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714060844","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2481220/extras/Small_Discord.png?t=1714060844\" /><br><br><br>We invite you to join our growing Discord community.
