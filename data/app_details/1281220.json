As the overall commander, you are in charge of seeking the destruction of the enemy naval forces and preventing your opponent, the Japanese Navy, from accomplishing its objectives. To achieve your aims, you have at your disposal the most fearsome sea projection weapon known to Man in 1942: your carrier air groups and the task forces that support them.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As a carrier task force admiral in this pioneering age of air/naval warfare, assume the mantle of retribution in this innovative interpretation of a classic topic, as the first title in a new series that will further explore and develop the genre. Forget about the limitations of the past, and let the best of wargaming and simulation blend and blossom together in this new take on command at sea! Re-live the great battles of the first year of the Pacific War as if you were there yourself. In here there is no dice roll, no artificial skill-tree, no arbitrary stats, selective fog of war or supernatural crystal-clear communications. It is real-time crisis management for you, realism and historicity without concession, as little abstraction as can be, and loads of action, suspense and refreshing gameplay packed in the same single computer software.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1281220/extras/CV5_plan_small-text.jpg?t=1736891152\" /></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As an Admiral, command the legendary American carrier task forces of 1942</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Innovative approach to serious wargaming in a full 3D simulation-based environment</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Pausable real-time, time compression available, no clickfest !</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">One of the most detailed &amp; authentic WW2 naval command game ever attempted to date</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A powerful in-game narrative engine managing scripted &amp; random events</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Lead the US Navy &amp; its ANZAC allies in 30+ historical &amp; hypothetical single scenarios</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Over 90 classes of ships and 40 types of aircraft meticulously researched &amp; recreated </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Accurate real-life ship, aircraft camouflages &amp; markings</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Advanced realistic ballistics and damage modelling</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Play it the way you like it: fully customizable realism &amp; difficulty settings</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">High-level of sound immersion, dynamic original soundtrack </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Post-battle replay player &amp; full scenario builder included</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1281220/extras/plane.gif?t=1736891152\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The thrill of carrier command in a full 3D world</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Experience naval command from an innovative first-person perspective.
