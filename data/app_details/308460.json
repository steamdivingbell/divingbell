{"about_the_game":"Finally the war of paper tanks comes into your room! <br><br>How long can you hold the defences against paper tanks. <br><br>Build your towers of paper before they get out of the box and make a big mess in the room. Manage the turrets, upgrade and be careful where you put them... every decision can be fatal! Watch out for the air units, they have a different route!<br><br>Take out your toy box and get ready for some of the most intense battles in a tower defence game that will make you reconsider the entire genre. As peaceful and simple War In A Box may seem for the casual player as fierce and thrilling the action will be once you get your hands on this paper battle madness! <br><br>Shred your enemies into pieces with different turret models - from simple guns to Tesla towers \u2013 in a battle against both land and airborne units that will do everything to get behind your lines of defence. Featuring real 3D environment and delivering a large number of original levels, War In A Box: Paper Tanks is as addictive as it is simple to play. <br><br><strong>Features</strong>: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>True 3D environment in each level <br></li><li>Turret and air view with different zoom options <br></li><li>Different game modes for different types of players <br></li><li>Game speed controls for adjusting the intensity of action <br></li><li>Available for Mac, Windows and Linux</li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"FIRST BLOOD","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/308460/b87739c45d7b0a76fb18f5203cba09bc0848d96e.jpg"},{"name":"Master of ARTILLERY","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/308460/72fcfbcce1ce3f5b8a7ee07fc2a001efd806571d.jpg"},{"name":"Master of CANNON","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/308460/8e70f02997b2e4c665f34943c9710da48c323d2b.jpg"},{"name":"Master of FLACK","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/308460/89e698fa9cc7df58848a9370f22d04724919b2b9.jpg"},{"name":"Master of GUN","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/308460/1b99498ee4585636d950b12ae8e4257d51dbbfe3.jpg"},{"name":"Master of TESLA","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/308460/729ffe4b461689f724e98347b46a2af966fabd3e.jpg"},{"name":"Super ARTILLERIST","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/308460/ee564dd0339c1baeca15cf0acae982808053338a.jpg"},{"name":"Super CANNONIER","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/308460/193471ca47c8922aa69a4bca28f8bf84da59ecef.jpg"},{"name":"Super FLACKer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/308460/2bf16eb12be9cde14a67f0aac31f533450f158cd.jpg"},{"name":"Super GUNNER","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/308460/8f3e557bc6c6166e9e4d0bbf7f6603e714471fb0.jpg"}],"total":19},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/308460/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1447362376","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/308460/page.bg.jpg?t=1447362376","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/308460/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1447362376","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/308460/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1447362376","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Finally the war of paper tanks comes into your room! <br><br>How long can you hold the defences against paper tanks. <br><br>Build your towers of paper before they get out of the box and make a big mess in the room.
