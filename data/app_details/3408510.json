{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Ava you play as a character named <strong>John. </strong>You don't know how you got there, where you are, or why you are there, but the thing you do know, is your name and that you work here. You work as a Prison Guard in a old prison called &quot;<strong><i>The Steelhold Citadel</i></strong>&quot; and you do night shifts there. Your task is simple, just do the chores given to you each night, make sure nobody gets out, and go back to your room. With power generators that break more often then they should. A company that only cares about if the job is done right, and something that just doesn't feel right, what could go wrong? See if you can find out the truth of what is really going on at this prison, or will the truth hurt more then not knowing?</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3408510/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737271171","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3408510/page.bg.jpg?t=1737271171","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3408510/0041762104772b0019a282ca7e0590b5ca3369c6/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737271171","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3408510/0041762104772b0019a282ca7e0590b5ca3369c6/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737271171","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Stats","id":15}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Ava you play as a character named <strong>John. </strong>You don't know how you got there, where you are, or why you are there, but the thing you do know, is your name and that you work here.
