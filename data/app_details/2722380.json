{"about_the_game":"<i>On a warm summer night, when the stars twinkle like fireflies and the rustling leaves whisper secrets in the deep woods, a captivating fairy tale weaves itself like magic around the flickering flames of a campfire. </i><br><i>This story began in a majestic \u0421astle on a Rock. Once upon a time there reigned a noble Lord loved and revered by his subjects. In his pursuit of wealth and safety, the Lord pressed upon the forest dwellers who called the thicket their home. The wild creatures were compelled to abandon their nests and retreat deeper into the woods. As years flowed like a river, the kingdom flourished, and the Lord's legacy continued through his two heirs. In a world where tradition dictated that the elder son ascend the throne, the younger one's heart seethed with jealousy that painted his thoughts a shade of darkness. In a moment when the old Lord breathed his last, his elder son found himself framed. His left hand was severed from his body by the very sibling he once called kin. The pain of betrayal and his father's death propelled him into a desperate escape, and he vanished deep into the woods.<br>In the heart of those enchanted woods, where ancient secrets were whispered through the rustling leaves, the elder son encountered the Wild Spirit \u2013 a sentinel of the land, as old as the forest itself. This guardian of the woods extended him a helping hand, infusing the elder son's life with new purpose, granting him the ability to summon the very creatures his father had once displaced.</i><br><br><i>End of story?

Everything is just beginning for you. <br>Embrace the power that springs forth from the heart of the woods, and let your journey through this fairy tale awaken the hero within you!</i><br><br><br><strong>What am I supposed to do?</strong><br>Guided by instinct and your own strategic acumen, you wield the power to dictate the ebb and flow of battle. Each encounter becomes a tactical dance, an intricate interplay of forces where you strategically choose and deploy your allies \u2013 the Sprigs \u2013 to conquer trials and adversaries that bar your path. The secret lies in the cards that adorn your left hand, each bearing the essence of a specific Spring. As you deftly select and unveil these cards, you set in motion a symphony of magic and nature, your chosen allies springing to life to face the challenges that await.<br><br><strong>Who are my enemies?</strong><br>Once-noble knights. Their honor washed away like the fading memories of a distant era. Clad in tarnished armor, the knights wield an arsenal of weaponry. They grip bows with arrows that whistle through the air, seeking to pierce your defenses. Maces swing in heavy arcs, seeking to crush your resistance with sheer force. Swords gleam menacingly, slicing through the air with a deadly elegance. Hammers, gripped tightly, strike the earth and unleash shockwaves, threatening to shatter your resolve.<br><br><strong>What do my Sprigs have against them?</strong><br>Within the embrace of the ancient forest, your loyal Sprigs emerge, each adorned with an array of weaponry as diverse as the foliage that surrounds them. <br>One of your steadfast companions wields a formidable wooden club. Another brandishes a massive log, a symbol of their unyielding connection to the land. A third ally grips a gleaming sword, poised to cleave through the ranks of your adversaries. Another companion dons a stout shield and thrusts forward with a sharpened spear. Twin daggers glint in the dappled sunlight, wielded by another of your comrades with swift precision. And amidst the clash of steel, an ally hefts a massive ax, each swing cleaving through opposition with a resounding impact.<br>Beyond the physical arsenal that accompanies you, your magic gauntlet pulses with arcane energy. Within its depths, spells of great power lie dormant, awaiting your command.<br><br><strong>I want to have more power </strong><br>Well, here's a little-known secret that the forest whispers to you in its ancient tongue. As you vanquish these fallen knights, a shimmering residue remains \u2013 the essence of their shattered dignity and lost glory. These soul fragments hold a hidden power, one that can be harnessed and saved within your piggy bank \u2013 a mystical repository of souls.<br>With each soul captured, the piggy bank resonates with a pulsating energy, a testament to the knights' struggles and their eventual redemption through your actions. These souls become your currency of growth, allowing you to venture deeper into the forest's heart and unlock the potential power of your Sprigs.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2722380/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1709155343","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2722380/page.bg.jpg?t=1709155343","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2722380/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1709155343","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2722380/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1709155343","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<i>On a warm summer night, when the stars twinkle like fireflies and the rustling leaves whisper secrets in the deep woods, a captivating fairy tale weaves itself like magic around the flickering flames of a campfire. </i><br><i>This story began in a majestic \u0421astle on a Rock.
