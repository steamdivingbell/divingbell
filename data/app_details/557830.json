The metal has allowed for rapid technological growth in a very short amount of time. The use of this metal however endangered it, leaving a low amount left to use. Mega Corporation Rock Co has nervously sent miners once more looking for any Radallium left in space. You however are trying to stop this - As an employee of the United Nations, you have been sent on an important peacekeeping mission to protect a rock deeply embedded with Radallium. Rock Co will remain relentless and do ANYTHING in their power to retrieve that rock you are so desperately trying to protect, how far will you go to protect it? <br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Complete different generated quests each play through<br></li><li>Mine ores to purchase unique items or exchange them for scrap<br></li><li>Manage your planet and have citizens produce resources for you<br></li><li>Collect upgrades to further strengthen you and your rock<br></li><li>Choose from 9 different characters to play as, each with a different play style</li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"The Farmer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/557830/fec8312f3ef958b59900cdb832c94fb20429e304.jpg"},{"name":"The Engineer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/557830/5c00cfcafca571965a3ce1054cdecfca1cc4d208.jpg"},{"name":"The Citizen","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/557830/cdc576449e1ff29ad11dcfdbf545d2c75fa7aaaf.jpg"},{"name":"The Miner","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/557830/fc8cc8490ffafef489b7f21efad4e0cd8d6937e5.jpg"},{"name":"The Task Force","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/557830/4cac0a8579f1e7b36b5816d6afe230d76f64b14a.jpg"},{"name":"The Scientist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/557830/28c9b9ddaa10026a7a94607fa79fd71b60b2f00e.jpg"},{"name":"The Janitor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/557830/3f53e3dc39fae4383343d169d2c5959d539ba852.jpg"},{"name":"Fired","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/557830/d097e1bb73dacda197ab996ea06af6d7f5ccc27c.jpg"},{"name":"Parts for my ship","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/557830/e5f18c5f399eb04a2d271a0328cc36c3cc2237aa.jpg"},{"name":"Show them who's boss","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/557830/6dca0b20d6cf3f3d69b2c8a0e1c53d3efbc18ed5.jpg"}],"total":26},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/557830/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1493416499","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/557830/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1493416499","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/557830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1493416499","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/557830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1493416499","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"My Pet Rock is a top down planet defense with rogue-lite, bullet-hell, and arcade elements.
