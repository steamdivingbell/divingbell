{"about_the_game":"Expand your zoo into a marine menagerie with Planet Zoo's Aquatic Pack!<br><br>Introduce five magnificent new animals, including impressive King Penguins, gorgeous Grey Seals, and playful Giant Otters.

Master a brand new challenge zoo set in Oregon, USA and put your zookeeper skills to the test - dive in and make a splash today!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>5 WATER-DWELLING ANIMALS</strong></h2>Care for five magnificent new aquatic animals: the King Penguin, Giant Otter, Grey Seal, Dwarf Caiman, and the exhibit-based Diamondback Terrapin. Keep your habitat animals entertained by splashing the cash on three new enrichment items in rubber ducks, platform floats, and jetties. <br><br>By building below-ground observation points, guests will love sinking time into marvelling at your new animals playing both on, and under, the water\u2019s surface.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>OVER 170 NEW SCENERY PIECES</strong></h2>Discover a whole new range of scenery and blueprints. Both regular and aquatic-themed pieces will help you build your ultimate zoo. Decorate walls with murals depicting wild jungles and icy tundra; pick reflective materials embracing water\u2019s mirror-like qualities; display graceful new animal sculptures; and even make your own cascading waterfalls.  <br><br>Your animals will adore their new surroundings. From warm sedimentary rivers and mangroves for the Giant Otter and Dwarf Caiman, to frigid coastlines for the King Penguin and Grey Seal, you can lovingly recreate each species\u2019 environment.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>MASTER THE CHALLENGE</strong></h2>Head to Oregon, USA and try your hand at reviving a water-themed zoo set around a dried-up riverbed. Spruce up the habitats, introduce new species, and add some much-needed love to return the place to its former glory. If you want to test your skills while experiencing everything the Aquatic Pack has to offer, this timed scenario is the perfect showcase.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1471590/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1706278417","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1471590/page.bg.jpg?t=1706278417","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1471590/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1706278417","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1471590/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1706278417","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Expand your zoo into a marine menagerie with Planet Zoo's Aquatic Pack!<br><br>Introduce five magnificent new animals, including impressive King Penguins, gorgeous Grey Seals, and playful Giant Otters.
