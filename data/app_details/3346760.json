{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Whisperstring was a chat program developed by &amp;&amp;&amp;$$$SSS66 (pronounced \u201cAnd-Es-Six\u201d) and released in the late 1980s. While it never gained the popularity of its IRC-based counterparts, it did have a small community of enthusiasts. Instead of focusing on chat rooms, it connected two random strangers who could chat one-on-one. While the mentioned enthusiasts are by now mostly non-existent, our team has decided to preserve the software and make it compatible with modern computers. Feel free to give it a try, and maybe you\u2019ll soon join us as part of the (hopefully) growing team of Whisperstring enthusiasts!
