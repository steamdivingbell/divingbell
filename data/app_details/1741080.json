Explore a colorful world filled with all types of people and try to create a place where any and all rejected witches can join together to create new kinds of magic, and form bonds that will last a lifetime. Grow ever closer to Battam's loving and long term partner, Sal, learn more about Battam's sibling Satine and watch them repair their shaky relationship, meet new people that challenge Battam's beliefs, and discover new ways that magic interacts with with the world-- all while fighting back against the overbearing Rowan Coven who is trying to stop any and all of Battam's progress!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1741080/extras/battam_profile_v1.png?t=1691868674\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1741080/extras/sal_provile_v1.png?t=1691868674\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1741080/extras/satine_profile_v1.png?t=1691868674\" /><br><br>This game contains R-18 scenes, with the option to opt out entirely in the beginning of the game for a strictly PG-13 version, if that is what you prefer.<br><br><strong>Current features are...</strong><br>-Gather items to brew cool potions and cook yummy food!<br>-Sell potions to make cash!<br>-Give gifts and get to know your coven members!<br>-A completely original soundtrack!<br>-2 sexy scenes with comic style art and a LOT of expressions!<br><br><strong>Planned features are...</strong><br>-~100k+ main story focusing on character development and interaction!<br>-An upgraded gathering/crafting system!<br>-Upgrade your coven for bonuses!<br>-A quest log to help you track what you're doing!<br>-Lots of good 'ol achievements!<br>-10 sexy scenes in total with so, so much art...<br>-Choose which sex scenes you want to see, if any at all.
