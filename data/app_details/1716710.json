It's up to you to select how you want to explore.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Raid</h2>The tiles themselves are often already settled by the invaders' own buildings which can be destroyed by building your towers next to them, giving you rewards or preventing the enemy to become stronger depending on the type of building.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Grow</h2>Throughout a playthrough you will unlock new towers, upgrades and artifacts granting your defenses even more power. To further aid you your Commander has abilities of their own which you'll have to make use of when the invaders are attacking.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Defend</h2>The game consists of three acts, each with an adversary who has their own set of invading units which will grow increasingly complex the further you progress.
