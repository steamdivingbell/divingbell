{"about_the_game":"Humanity had just taken its first tentative steps in space, when the catastrophic destruction of Mother Earth plunges the galaxy into a new Dark Age. Centuries later, those few surviving colonies have stabilised into a simple feudal society, unable to comprehend or advance the technological artefacts they use to survive. Internecine fights between an aristocratic elite decide the fate of the scattered fragments of human kind.<br><br>As the leader of a faction of star systems, you must seek to ensure the survival and prosperity of your dynasty.

Depose your unruly barons, threaten and force concessions from other dukes, and blackmail other characters to get what you want. Unearth the secrets of your enemies to ruin their political standing in a galaxy where reputation is everything.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Experience a Rich Galaxy of Emergent Characters and Storylines</h2>You\u2019ll be kept on your toes by a procedurally generated cast of hundreds of characters, each one trying to achieve their own personal goals.
