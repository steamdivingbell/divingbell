{"about_the_game":"Delta Force \u2014 Black Hawk Down: Team Sabre is the official expansion pack to the #1 best selling PC game in North America. Team Sabre was developed using the Delta Force \u2014 Black Hawk Down engine and it requires the mother product to run. <br>\t\t\t\t\tThe game is a military-based shooter but the missions are fictitious and not based on any actual real events.  The expansion follows the Team Sabre Squadron as they are deployed to take out targets and carry out mission objectives in two separate single player campaigns (*approximately 5 missions each) that take place in Columbia and Iran.  The multiplayer feature boasts 30 new maps and an enhanced level of mod support for players to build their own unique maps. <br>\t\t\t\t\tThe highlight of this expansion pack is that it features lush jungle terrain, never seen before to this extent in a Delta Force game.
