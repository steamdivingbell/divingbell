{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Think you\u2019re up for a real challenge? Our game is so tough, no one\u2019s beaten the demo yet. Dare to be the first?</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Space Variance Authority is a platform puzzle game where players move by dragging ropes, which can be used to encircle and eliminate bubbles. Players need to carefully plan their action routes and eliminate all bubbles. As the levels progress, the game will continuously introduce new mechanics and design puzzles based on these new mechanics. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3033340/extras/armor616.gif?t=1737202666\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Like most platformer games, in this game, players can control the main character to perform actions such as jumping, double jumping, wall jumping, and dashing. However, as a logic puzzle game, players not only need to have certain platform game operating skills but also need to carefully plan the movement route of the main character. As the main character moves, they leave a rope behind them. Players need to use this rope to encircle the bubbles in the level. When the rope forms a closed loop, the bubbles inside will be eliminated. Only by eliminating all the bubbles in the level and collecting three suns can players pass the level.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3033340/extras/dynamic616.gif?t=1737202666\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The core puzzle lies in the fact that if the bubbles are eliminated in the wrong order, it will cause key bubbles to be eliminated too early, leading to a loss of platforms or walls needed to stand on to eliminate subsequent bubbles. The game tests not only the player's control skills but also their overall planning and puzzle-solving abilities.</p>","achievements":{"total":0},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3033340/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737202666","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3033340/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1737202666","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3033340/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737202666","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3033340/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737202666","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Think you\u2019re up for a real challenge?
