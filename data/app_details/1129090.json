{"about_the_game":"Sticky Paws is a 2D platformer game about a cat that can climb anything! Sticky the Cat is on a little adventure to retrieve a cake that a mouse stole. Catlyn, a new playable character, has joined the adventure too! Help Sticky through 8 levels full of dangerous mice. Go about the adventure however you like at your own pace. You can play single player, or you can play with up to 4 players simultaneously.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are many hidden goodies in these levels. Many things can be buried underground, so use your ground pound to uncover them. Find all of the Big Fish to fully complete a level. The level in the world map will become golden if you have found everything in the level, so keep exploring, but don't take too long as you can run out of time!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome levels can be very tricky to maneuver, so time your jumps right! Jump over gaps and spikes, swing on ropes and pound through cardboard boxes to get through some of the harder stages!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaster the movement, and go through levels as fast as you can! The game will save your personal best times for each level. Run at high speeds, jump and pounce your way through enemies to reach the goal.
