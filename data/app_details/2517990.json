{"about_the_game":"Project Stratarch is a movement FPS designed around wall jumps, rewarding good movement on top of good aim. There are two game modes, both completely kill-based: Solo Deathmatch (Free-For-All) and Team Deathmatch. Compete against other players and become the best you can be!<br><br>FAQ:<br><br>Q: <strong>How many people are working on this?</strong><br>A: Just one; this project was purely developed as a passion project. As such, bug fixes and patches may be slow, so please be patient.<br><br>Q: <strong>Will this game have any cosmetics or skins down the line?</strong><br>A: There will not, for various reasons, but the most important being that there will be NO monetary factors attached to the game. The game will remain free-to-play and microtransaction-free forever.<br><br>Q: <strong>Are there plans for controller/console support?</strong><br>A: Definitely a no for console; may add controller support down the line but if so there will be either no aim assist or a small amount. I'm not looking to get into the whole AA issue.<br><br>Q: <strong>Will you add more movement mechanics to the game?</strong><br>A: Possibly down the road, will have to wait and see. Currently I lack the technical skill on the animation side to do much more, so for now I think I'm gonna leave it as-is and see what people can do.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2517990?t=1738948758","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2517990/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1738948758","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2517990/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738948758","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2517990/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738948758","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Project Stratarch is a movement FPS designed around wall jumps, rewarding good movement on top of good aim.
