Here's some of the Goatical stuff you can do in BattleTubers:<br><br>Defend worlds modeled after Vtubers from increasingly deadly waves of CopyWrights. Battle through waves of enemies themed to match their Vtuber world and try to survive CopyWright boss fight waves using any Goatical guns you can get your hooves (or hands) on during the fight.<br><br>Upgrade your weapons and character buffs through multiple tiers using points. Fighting Solo your goal is to stack as many upgraded buffs etc. as you can to survive the wave scaling. When battling with a group of friends in Coop mode you'll have to coordinate your points and upgrades between team members and rely on tricks like stacking status effects on enemies to survive.<br><br>Laugh at your friends while you refuse to revive them. <br><br>Chew Grass and Bleat Ass with healing items like Grassums. The snack that tastes like grass because it's a bag of grass! Enemies have a random chance to drop Goatical powerups to help you and your team fight. Inceased fire rate, double melee damage, extra weapons. You never know what temporary powerup you're gonna get until you shove that buff food down your gullet!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2684080/extras/Twitch_Menu_Example.png?t=1739475624\" /><br><br>Twitch Integration now available!
