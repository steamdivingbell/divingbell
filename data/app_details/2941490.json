{"about_the_game":"In this retro-themed arcade game bundle, play as the eponymous Brucie and single-handedly perform all major ends of restaurant management!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe four included games allow you to hone your skills, each with varying demands for focus and time:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Ingredient Run: An involved, time-limited challenge to find the most ingredients in an obstacle-laden environment riddled with hazards. Strategize a path to pick up point-multiplying powerups and capture evasive ingredients. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n- Cooking: A moderately intensive task in speedy memorization, where you must flip similarly patterned meat on a grill. Combat limited guesses by chaining matches.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n- Serving: A dynamic exercise of strategy to serve increasingly impatient guests. Balance relaxing moments of cleanup with stressful amounts of concurrent orders awaiting completion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n- Stacking Leftovers: A chaotic test of reaction and endurance that places you in an unrelenting torrent of discarded leftovers, takeout boxes, hazards, and powerups. Dangers lurk beneath you as well: rats, rolling barrels, and fallen bombs are there to catch you off guard and impair your abilities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOr, if you have time to spare, immerse yourself in Marathon Mode: a back-to-back run of all four games with an accumulated score.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Vegetarian","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2941490/b0a6205891889c62db45aa2b61628a76a1a0b7c5.jpg"},{"name":"Hot Stuff","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2941490/95eba4f24801ae9bc51ab5f471d4934e06d779cf.jpg"},{"name":"Beevasive Maneuvers","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2941490/f361bcc87ee979f78a21c6ba93bad056110dcbbf.jpg"},{"name":"Down in Flames","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2941490/75ef3f6cf652f53250fe721e093b89bdd281acf6.jpg"},{"name":"Kebab'd","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2941490/a714194d1dcc6eb898d6ef3e8b8df88794986234.jpg"},{"name":"Double Double Decker","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2941490/885a88158dda7258017caa3fd17cf2bcc0744d21.jpg"},{"name":"Matchinator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2941490/7e99098d8ac53799e213e1805e53e685de3b5808.jpg"},{"name":"From Beyond","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2941490/bdf0df7a36834600934dbc4a415ae48a5900d5ad.jpg"},{"name":"Table Flipper","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2941490/2f0e90b3c6ccc99220ecc4d1c1086e4adf231fa2.jpg"},{"name":"Close Call","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2941490/a840f74f0a48ba50618fdba1bf8793e0b9fae9c9.jpg"}],"total":30},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2941490/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1722214575","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2941490/page.bg.jpg?t=1722214575","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2941490/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1722214575","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2941490/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1722214575","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"In this retro-themed arcade game bundle, play as the eponymous Brucie and single-handedly perform all major ends of restaurant management!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe four included games allow you to hone your skills, each with varying demands for focus and time:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Ingredient Run: An involved, time-limited challenge to find the most ingredients in an obstacle-laden environment riddled with hazards.
