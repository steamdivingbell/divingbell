You and your Radar-Intercept Officer code named <strong>Wizard</strong> now have to fly in the Griffin Starfighter and restore peace in the universe by vanquishing <strong>King Nimrod</strong>, all of his forces and all of his assets wherever they may be.

The Griffin Starfighter can indeed glide in Earth's atmosphere. During spaceflight, the Griffin Starfighter uses an Attitude Determination &amp; Control System (ADCS) to change its attitude. The Griffin Starfighter is equipped with a spaceworthy Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) dual axis multi-beam technology radar which gives its pilot <strong>instant situational awareness</strong> of the battlespace. The Griffin Starfighter also has Regenerating Shields and a Turbo Speed Thrust Level rocket motor. The Griffin Starfighter's canopy is an all-plastic design. The angled airframe of the Griffin Starfighter also has radar stealth (low observable) characteristics, like the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor and the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, to deflect radar signals. The design of the Griffin Starfighter is such that it has a low radar signature. Moreover, it is equipped with wingtip mounted High Energy Laser Cannons directed-energy weapon and Fire-And-Forget Missiles. The current Griffin Starfighter models have no flare and chaff dispensers. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2081600/extras/Divider_9_2.png?t=1732254591\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">THE FIRE-AND-FORGET MISSILES OF THE GRIFFIN STARFIGHTER:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2081600/extras/MissileStorePage.png?t=1732254591\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2081600/extras/MissileForStorePageBlue.png?t=1732254591\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Griffin Starfighter's Fire-And-Forget Missiles have warheads that produce more than 300 pounds penetrating blast fragmentation explosive force.

You are from a fictitious exoplanet called The Hive which is located light-years away from the Earth. The evil King Nimrod and his forces from an undisclosed exoplanet in a galaxy somewhere in the universe are conquering the universe. The leader of The Hive, <strong>Queen Crusher</strong>, opposes King Nimrod. You and your Radar-Intercept Officer code named <strong>Wizard</strong> now have to fly in the Griffin Starfighter and restore peace in the universe by vanquishing <strong>King Nimrod</strong>, all of his forces and all of his assets wherever they may be. The despicable King Nimrod and his forces are mechanical extra-terrestrial (E.T.) lifeforms known as the Raptorbots, while you (Paladin), Wizard and Queen Crusher are insectlike extra-terrestrial (E.T.) lifeforms known as the Hivians. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>THE GRIFFIN STARFIGHTER SPECIFICATIONS:</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2081600/extras/The_Starfighter_3_Views_For_Store_Page_With_3D_3.png?t=1732254591\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2081600/extras/New_Griffin_Starfighter_For_Store_Page.png?t=1732254591\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Griffin Starfighter is a <strong>sleek</strong> gold colored near-mirror surface finish two-seater in tandem, twin-tail, single rocket engine, extra-terrestrial <strong>multirole starfighter</strong> with control-canards, and double-delta wings. The Griffin Starfighter can indeed glide in Earth's atmosphere. During spaceflight, the Griffin Starfighter uses an Attitude Determination &amp; Control System (ADCS) to change its attitude. The Griffin Starfighter is equipped with a spaceworthy Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) dual axis multi-beam technology radar which gives its pilot <strong>instant situational awareness</strong> of the battlespace. The Griffin Starfighter also has Regenerating Shields and a Turbo Speed Thrust Level rocket motor. The Griffin Starfighter's canopy is an all-plastic design. The angled airframe of the Griffin Starfighter also has radar stealth (low observable) characteristics, like the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor and the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, to deflect radar signals. The design of the Griffin Starfighter is such that it has a low radar signature. Moreover, it is equipped with wingtip mounted High Energy Laser Cannons directed-energy weapon and Fire-And-Forget Missiles. The current Griffin Starfighter models have no flare and chaff dispensers. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2081600/extras/Divider_9_2.png?t=1732254591\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">THE FIRE-AND-FORGET MISSILES OF THE GRIFFIN STARFIGHTER:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2081600/extras/MissileStorePage.png?t=1732254591\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2081600/extras/MissileForStorePageBlue.png?t=1732254591\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Griffin Starfighter's Fire-And-Forget Missiles have warheads that produce more than 300 pounds penetrating blast fragmentation explosive force.
