It's up to you to create the scene. You can play around with the stock content, or download mods other people have made and play with them! If you still aren't satisfied... You can make mods yourself. With a complete video tutorial series, a documentation, and example resources. You can make anything.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Planned scene/world saving features</h2>With this, you could set up a scene, or town on a map.

You have the freedom to do what you like.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Open world maps</h2>Maps that come with the game have no limits to where you can go. If your vehicle can fit, you can take it there. <i>unless you teleport the vehicle, hehe</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Advanced vehicle component simulation</h2>Your vehicle parts can overheat, break, and have different performance properties.
