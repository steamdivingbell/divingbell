The temple holds the original faith of the people of Draibryn, barely tolerated by the ruling One Church. She was originally a citizen of Llanllwch, where her father joined the Draibryn rebellion, but was ultimately killed. Her mother, a servant, found it incredibly hard to feed the family in the aftermath, and ended up dying in the pestilence that scourged the land. Carys was then adopted by the temple, and though she was never the most adept Incanter, it gave her a place to leave her past behind her.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3167530/extras/bleddyn_small.png?t=1739217734\" /> <strong>Bleddyn </strong><br>Bleddyn is a Gwyllgi, a wolf-man race. The Gwyllgi were enslaved by the Ampyrians, who used their fierce and powerful builds to carry out assassinations and wreak terror upon those who rebelled. Even today, the Gwyllgi are feared, and utilised by the current nobility for similar reasons. Bleddyn\u2019s father was Gelert, a Gwyllgi personal guard for a noble family. However, an incident caused Bleddyn to leave the castle alone, though he isn't keen to talk about the past.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3167530/extras/idwal_small.png?t=1739217734\" /> <strong>Idwal Thornfield </strong><br>Idwal is the firstborn and only son of the Thornfield family. As a child, he was loud, playful, and intently curious about the world.  Though now, he hides behind his long hair, his manner quiet and meek. One could mistake him for a beautiful maiden. Though full of doubt and always downplaying his own abilities, he is a skilled student of magic.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3167530/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1739217734","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3167530/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1739217734","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3167530/5d34334c0cdc8200770729f3268422880b0117bb/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739217734","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3167530/5d34334c0cdc8200770729f3268422880b0117bb/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739217734","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A story inspired by Welsh Mythology.<br></li><li>A demo containing the first 3 chapters - around 3 hours of gameplay!<br></li><li>An alternative take on Turn-Based RPG combat - break your enemy's poise to leave them open to attack!
