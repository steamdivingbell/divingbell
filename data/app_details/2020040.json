Graduates of Oscar's Academy can look forward to a very lucrative career! The one big downside of attending Oscar's Academy is that it costs $5,000,000... This debt gets reduced by defeating club champions in battle. Defeating 1 club champion drops student debt to $2,000,000, defeating 2 club champions drops student debt to $1,000,000, and so on. You'll also have to worry about and help stop the increasingly dangerous Plume Gang. Plume Gang steal Wizabeasts, show a suspicious interest in cart research, and seem to be plotting something. You're also having recurring dreams that appear to have connections to events in the past and present... During your adventure, you will meet several characters like the snobby rich rival Edward and the friendly aspiring baker Cara. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2020040/extras/monsterLightPhoenixAdult1.png?t=1736297557\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2020040/extras/monsterDarkDragonAdult1.png?t=1736297557\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2020040/extras/storeHeaderTame.png?t=1736297557\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can encounter wild Wizabeasts when you want to, or you can avoid them if you don't want random encounters. There are many cool and/or cute Wizabeasts to meet! All Wizabeast species are viable in battle so you can pick your favourites without worry! To add a wild Wizabeast to your party, it's suggested that you deal some damage first. Once you've dealt damage and are within range, you can attempt a download with a cart.

Wizabeasts share experience after battle even if they're knocked out, so you can focus on your winning strategy! Your party is fully healed after battle so you can keep your momentum after winning!
