{"about_the_game":"<strong>Let me be surreal with you</strong><br><br>I really like xxxxxno galaxias, I freaking love that game, the person reading it, the ability to run around geometry, and the ability to just listen to cool music while doing it. Maybe, it lost some exploration in the translation to space, but at the same time, who the mictlan cares? Every game is now open world, and in some alternative universe, they'll charge you for every step that you make, so yeah, I wanted to make a game like that, but no, it's not the game that you're thinking about... But I was too dumb to make it, but now, I'm just as dumb, but way more resilient... So every 3D object that you put in the game can now be a planet, isn't that cool?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3166130/extras/Mundo.gif?t=1733955497\" /><br><br>I also wanted to do some surreal stuff, like, yeah, here, jump the obstacles. Now that you're trapped here, you may continue with your life, but she'll continue to be here forever, and there is nothing you can do. Why?

So yeah, I mean, you don't really need to play the first game, you'll be just as confused, which is what I want, if I just keep you confused, then you'll not know how to feel.<br><br>So here is the deal, my new protagonist, ALMA, is freaking trapped, in a world of dreams, inspired by 60 years of life and 30 years of being trapped there. She's like a half-mermaid and a half-bald person. I also wanted to have a prophet, someone who will spew propaganda and contrapaganda for a new god, someone who works hard, and she is super smart, just look at her go:<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3166130/extras/Doing_her_best.gif?t=1733955497\" /><br><br><strong>What does the future hold?
