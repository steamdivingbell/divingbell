{"about_the_game":"You play as Zephyr, a mysterious robot, surviving in a dangerous post-apocalyptic Earth, filled with threats both natural and artificial.  Zephyr discovers Resonites, self-replicating, transforming drones.  As Zephyr, you help the Resonites become an army and they become an extension of Zephyr as you navigate this ruined landscape.<br><br>Use your Resonites and your wits to complete objectives as fast as you can and in unique ways.  You are encouraged to find any shortcut you can for Zephyr using the means at your disposal.  Only the fastest will survive against the storm.  <br><br>Along the way, you will learn to transform your Resonites into four different forms.  Use their strengths to push onward.  <br><br>They are: <br>The Lotus - Resonites used to chain electrical currents which can do many things from activate mechanisms to electrocute enemies.<br>The Starburst - Utility-focused Resonites which can be used to protect yourself from the elements, access inaccessible areas, and find secrets.<br>The Centipede - Land-bound Resonites which can be used to construct climbable pillars and platforms and carry heavy objects.<br>The Stingray - Glass cannons Resonites which are speedy, potent in combat and can be armed to explode.<br><br>Other Key features <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Pseudo-Linear: While having a critical path and clear visual indicators of direction, environments should prod the player\u2019s curiosity and imagination and invite them to discover secrets and shortcuts and experiment with alternative means of traversal.<br></li><li>Designed for speed run game play. Compete against other players via a global Leader Board for the fastest time to complete levels.<br></li><li>Collect resources and build up your swarm.
