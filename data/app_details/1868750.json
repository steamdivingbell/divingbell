Your strength is correlated to how strong your soul is. Your soul becomes stronger through bonds and acquiring info about other people. Similar to Persona with the arcana. When you beat someone in a fight, one's soul can no longer fight back and you have the option of essentially forcing them to give away a general secret that they wouldn't want known. If you choose to take their secret, you become vastly more powerful. But if you choose to not take it, there are other benefits to be seen.<br></li><li> What is the significance of the characters' outfits?<br>One's outfit is based on their personality. This also applies to their powers too. <br></li><li> Who is Mash? <br>He is the titular character of the game. Although the game is similar to an RPG, it isn't 100% an RPG because you are stuck as playing Mash, who has his own character. Although, Mash's true character is not <i>entirely</i> explored nor does he speak much. Thus, you can put your own spin on the character. <br></li><li> In zone two, there is a locked gate. What is the passcode? <br>check the room order. Heart, Ace, Spade, Clover. Make this of what you will. <br></li><li> How long is the game?<br>The game is fairly short. A standard playthrough will be 1-3 hours long. However, with there being a lot of various hidden events in the game, you will not see everything the game has to offer in one playthrough! So most will probably play the game again until they find mostly everything. <br>The demo is around 20 minutes. </li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1868750/extras/Wishlistv2.png?t=1718141964\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Wishlist</h2>Go Wishlist Secrets For Taking now!
