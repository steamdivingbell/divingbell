{"about_the_game":"Dungeon Brewmaster is an immersive VR experience that transports you into the role of a seemingly ordinary magical bartender. You\u2019ll brew potions (or poisons) for a variety of fantastical patrons. Every recipe is unique, made from a collection of unusual raw ingredients. But be warned; Every brew comes with consequences. The effects of which will be felt far beyond the walls of the old tavern. So choose your brew wisely. <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/832720/extras/DBM_Trailer01.jpg?t=1530038742\" /><br>Behind the old bar, you\u2019ll find a constantly growing assortment of ingredients, equipment and utensils - all at your disposal. Each one with a specific, specialized function that will test your wizardly skill level.
