{"about_the_game":"The Gee Bee Model Z was an air racer built specifically to win the 1931 Thomson Trophy in Cleveland, Ohio.<br><br>Designed and constructed by Granville Brothers (\u2018Gee Bee\u2019) Aircraft, it proved to be a very capable aircraft with a 535-horsepower radial engine, and went on to win the trophy.<br><br>Later fitted with a 750-horsepower engine, the Model Z beat the official speed record for land aircraft and unofficially achieved more than 300mph, but was destroyed in a crash shortly afterwards. <br><br>Being a unique aircraft, the Gee Bee Model Z serves a healthy dose of thrills and spills during all aspects of flight. It is surprisingly easy to stall the ailerons during take-off, and when landing, a sideslip approach is recommended because the aircraft\u2019s extraordinary nose makes it almost impossible to see the runway.<br><br>Even when you\u2019ve touched down, the excitement is still not over, as applying the brakes carelessly will stand the Model Z on its nose.
