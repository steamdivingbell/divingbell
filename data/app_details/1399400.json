The founder is Siddhartha (565~485 BC) and his matrilineal family name is Gautama. Sakyamuni is the honorary name given to him by Buddhists, meaning &quot;the saint of the Sakyamuni&quot;. The rise of Buddhism coincided with the rapid development of slavery economy in India. At that time, the social and economic development of the Indian subcontinent was extremely unbalanced. Most areas entered the slave society, but some places still maintained the remnants of clan communes; in some economically developed areas, productivity has been greatly improved, and agriculture is produced The main form, the handicraft industry, has diverged from agriculture; with the development of the commodity economy, batches of slavery countries dominated by cities and towns have begun to be established. At that time, various countries conquered each other, the Aryans and other tribes from outside and the indigenous peoples had many contradictions, and class contradictions were very sharp.<br><br>Before the rise of Buddhism, Brahmanism was the main religion in India, and Brahmanism held a dominant position. Brahmanism advocates the three principles of Vedic Revelation, Sacrifice Almighty, and Brahman Supreme. However, with the emergence and development of slavery countries, this trend of thought has not been able to fully adapt to the ruling needs of the emerging Kshatriya nobility, so free thinkers appeared. Promote the trend of thought of Salmon. According to the Buddhist scriptures, these trends of thought have &quot;six divisions&quot; and &quot;96 kinds of external views.&quot; The main ones are Shunshi, Shanaism, and Life School (also known as Xie Ming Wai Dao) and so on. Buddhism is also the main school. . Among the slavery countries at that time, Magadha and Qiaosaluo were both areas where Buddhism became popular earlier.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1399400/extras/2.png?t=1659429955\" /><br><br>Buddhism has experienced a history of 1800 years in India, and its process can be roughly divided into 4 periods: primitive Buddhism period (6th or 5th century BC~4th or 3rd century BC)\\Mini Buddhism (4th or 3rd century BC~ To around the first year of the Christian era), Mahayana Buddhism (around the first year to the seventh century) and Esotericism (about the seventh to early 13th century). In the latter three periods, many schools of different theory and practice appeared.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1399400/extras/3.png?t=1659429955\" /><br><br>From the second half of the third century AD, Buddhism began to spread outside ancient India and gradually developed into a worldwide religion. In India, it was due to the prosperity of Hinduism after the 8th to 9th centuries AD, plus internal Buddhism factions. Other disputes and corruption of monks, as well as frequent foreign invasions, especially Islamic conquests by force, many monks were killed, and many important temples and cultural relics were destroyed. As a result, Indian Buddhism began to decline and tended to be in the early 13th century. It died out and only revived slightly after the 19th century.<br><br>(600-800 BC) The historical characteristics of ancient India are the establishment of the Varna system and its transformation to a caste system, the assimilation of tribal society and its transformation to the state, the rise of the land grant system and its transformation to feudalism , Buddhism went from prosperity to decline, and the rise of new Brahmanism and its transformation to Hinduism.

According to Buddhist literature, there were 16 countries in India at the beginning of the 6th century BC. The main ones are Magadha, Kassa, Chisara, Bazhi, Julu, Pandhara and Gandhara. In the great countries of this period, Varna\u2019s hierarchy replaced the tribal system. Monarchs and warriors became Kshatriya, priests and teachers became Brahmins, farmers and taxpayers became Vaishyas, and laborers who served the above three levels became Sudras.

In the Maurya Dynasty, only the king had the right to have a standing army and receive tribute. The power of the king marked the victory of Kshatriya in the long struggle against the Brahmins, but the Brahmins still had great power in the Maurya Dynasty. During the reign of King Ashoka, the dictatorship of slavery monarchy in ancient India reached its peak. In order to expand his kingdom, King Ashoka fought for 11 years, but the blood and cruelty of the war made him repent. Later, King Ashoka converted to Buddhism and established a new law based on the Buddhist doctrine of peace.
