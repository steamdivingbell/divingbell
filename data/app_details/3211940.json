While these upgrades can make you stronger, they also come with risks, such as close-range explosions damaging yourself. Auto-aim might not always target your desired enemy. Constructing your abilities wisely and exploring interactions between different weapons and talents becomes an essential part of the game!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3211940/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734577042","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3211940/page.bg.jpg?t=1734577042","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3211940/971b9118dbfb3c6ef6b5429d37111b9570b95125/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734577042","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3211940/971b9118dbfb3c6ef6b5429d37111b9570b95125/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734577042","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;Weapons Arena Demo&quot; is a top-down, turn-based strategy game where players control a firearm to break through encirclements of melee weapons!<br><br>This demo includes:<br>-Content from the first chapter<br>-Over 20 types of enemies<br>-50 talents and corresponding 50 upgraded talents<br>-8 maps with 4 different level modes<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Features:</h2></strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Easy to pick up, hard to master</strong> </h2><br>The game has minimal controls: use the mouse to aim in four directions, and left-click to shoot.
