{"about_the_game":"As we revisit our memories, they change. How do we know what is real? How do we know who we can trust? Our seemingly peaceful neighborhoods house monsters disguised in human skin. These monsters live on the innocence of our children, leaving them wandering confused in the afterlife, forever alone and afraid. Our minds give the monsters a place to live, even after they are gone. Sometimes, we become the monsters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIs there really a mystery to be solved? Or is this all in my head? I have no plan. I have no place left to hide. Am I the missing? Or am I the taker? I'll let time find out for me. It will unfold with or without me.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Traumada Soundtrack includes music of multiple genres including indie rock, electronic, and alternative. Music by James Horn with drums for the title track by Rick Teed. An additional track &quot;Slow&quot; by Ghost Slime.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2112850/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1660287483","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2112850/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1660287483","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2112850/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1660287483","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2112850/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1660287483","content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"some language"},"detailed_description":"As we revisit our memories, they change.
