Starting with just a single Krellan battlecruiser, as you rise in the game's seven ranks (each rank has five missions), you'll gain more complexity, such as escorts, planetary invasions, and eventually full sector command. <br><br>Each mission is a randomly-generated galactic war sandbox, and while you have specific objectives, how you accomplish them is entirely up to you. No other space game gives you this much depth, detail and control. Fight, board, and capture ships, send landing parties and full invasion forces down to planets. Bombard cities (sparingly, as you want as many cities intact as possible) from orbit while avoiding planetary defense fire from high technology planets. It's all here.</p><br><h1>A Bit of Background/Quick Things to Keep in Mind</h1><p>Version 1.0 of this game was published by Interstel Corporation and distributed by Electronic Arts. When this game was originally released in 1989, it was rushed to market in order to get it in stores in time for the Christmas season. The result was a very buggy release. Debugging and development continued until 1991 with the release of an enhanced and fairly bug-free Version 1.5B, which is the most common version found on websites that provide old games. Then, in 2018, with the developer\u2019s original 486 PC back in action, the author, Trevor Sorensen, resumed development to produce what is now 2.0.<br><br>As this game came out in 1989, it has absolutely no multithreading of any kind. Therefore, due to the real-time nature of the game (although you can pause at any time), sometimes responses to your commands might be delayed a moment. Have patience with the game, it's doing a lot at one time, from calculating AI for dozens of ships and even individual torpedoes, to managing your ship's systems and much more. <br><br>While the game might look daunting at first, there are eight fully-documented and detailed tutorials in the game to help teach you everything from basic navigation to ship combat to planetary invasions and more. <br><br>Also please note that there is no mouse control in this game, instead there is a detailed list of keyboard shortcuts at your disposal.  <br><br>This is the pinnacle of the DOS gaming experience from the 1980s. Going in with these expectations will help you have a much better time. Thank you!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong><i>Star Fleet II: Krellan Commander</i></strong> is the second in the Star Fleet series of advanced space strategy simulations.
