{"about_the_game":"Rutie was previously known as the Warden Witch: a powerful Witch tasked with imprisoning and guarding all the world's evils. One day she overslept and one of the greatest evils, Azazoth, managed to escape and lay waste to the world in her absence! He was promptly recaptured by the other Witches, but not before leaving behind pieces of himself - dubbed Remnants by the High Coven - to continue to wreak havoc while he's imprisoned. Stripped of her title and demoted to the much weaker position of Duskwitch, Rutie is now forced to clean up after her mistakes and eliminate all the Remnants!
