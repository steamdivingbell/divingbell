{"about_the_game":"<strong>Jack's Game</strong> is a fast-paced multiplayer arena shooter. Spawn into the arena immediately as a futuristic drone and queue destruction as you would expect in any shooter! Use your Arms to jump off of walls and your m32 to rocket-jump to glory. Combat is designed from the bottom-up to be as fun as possible.<br><br>Expect some issues while in Beta. The server and client versions may become misaligned, which could result in ridiculous bugs at any time. There is no interpolation and very little support for players with poor network quality.<br><br>We're <strong>updating the game frequently</strong> so make sure to check the Steam page for updates! If you like the game make sure to visit the official discord, which you can find on the steam page. Features in development include: The Server browser + Inventory management. We hope to make Jack's Game into the fastest-paced survival game ever made.
