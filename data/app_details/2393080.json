You will be especially effective when facing more cumbersome and slow-shooting enemies, managing to send a couple of shells their way before they can respond or fall back.

Your turret armor is good, but you need to hide your hull or else your 1,500 HP will run out quite quickly. Keep in mind that your alpha damage and armor is not the best for trading shots, especially if you\u2019re facing a hard-hitting opponent. <br><br>The FV201 (A45) was not designed for close-quarters combat or sitting under heavy fire.
