{"about_the_game":"Daugger is an 8-bit adventure about a dog named Olive exploring &amp; using her snoot to sniff out information, and peeing on every piece of ground she can. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSolve problems in different types of neighborhood. Use scent to read messages left by other dogs. Maybe even be a little stinker and cause some trouble now and then. Battle over grassy lots with Prince Crimson. Scour dusty desert for signs of life. Seek out solutions to other dogs' conundrums. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis top-down adventure features an amazing original chip-tune soundtrack of beautiful melodies. You may be tempted to put scrounging around on the back burner, and just listen. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDaugger features no combat, damage, or death. It's a relaxing game that can be enjoyed at any age. Reading is not required, but does enhance the experience. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnjoy this love letter to pets everywhere.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Opera Fan","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2874900/ad781135ed02e3447fb669c59549cc5b073958bb.jpg"},{"name":"Wet Nurse","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2874900/4c66d296137bfc9dc8b53a9f7f44aa63ebe6f76a.jpg"},{"name":"Eau de Serpent","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2874900/b1b88dfb440254a841203f035f0d5b0649e188c3.jpg"},{"name":"Blade Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2874900/01fcd16060dc17d751278f12332b990c1bf93e4b.jpg"},{"name":"Dookdom","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2874900/8be06f2da43a30406b5aa530a4a7798ced214430.jpg"},{"name":"Midday at the Oasis","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2874900/fb965534b981c81f2464cdc7d414f4c22b996997.jpg"},{"name":"Stinger","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2874900/d13bd103732695a3bc5b105d4ad93dda5b94ab70.jpg"},{"name":"Desert Mouse","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2874900/0f27e4680892e455fdbc4684870aa4b4dc268d37.jpg"},{"name":"Hassle Crasher","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2874900/726a8741516c5095a4295d0930f8df43e9cabb23.jpg"},{"name":"Golden Afternoon","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2874900/06b025f20bb30e7b0de5b772155b0231d379b487.jpg"}],"total":23},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2874900?t=1712096092","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2874900?t=1712096092","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2874900/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1712096092","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2874900/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1712096092","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Daugger is an 8-bit adventure about a dog named Olive exploring &amp; using her snoot to sniff out information, and peeing on every piece of ground she can. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSolve problems in different types of neighborhood.
