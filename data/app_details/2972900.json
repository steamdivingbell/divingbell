{"about_the_game":"Instant Armory is an application that allows you to design arms, armor, and equipment for fantasy tabletop roleplaying games, such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons or Pathfinder, using a myriad of hand-drawn art. Currently you can design swords, axes, bows, warhammers, daggers, maces, flails, polearms, potions, shields, staves, and wands with a system that is similar to creating a character in a video game. For example, if you are making a sword, you choose which blade, crossguard, and handle you would like, mixing and matching as you see fit. Once the parts are selected, you can select colors for each. The application allows you to then name the item, write a descripiton, and apply stats.  The final item can then be downloaded as a printable equipment card or have dice sets applied to it that can be rolled directly in-app during a tabletop gaming session.  Because the application allows you to input anything into the description and stats, the application remains ruleset agnostic.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2972900/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1715968899","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2972900/page.bg.jpg?t=1715968899","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2972900/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1715968899","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2972900/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1715968899","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Instant Armory is an application that allows you to design arms, armor, and equipment for fantasy tabletop roleplaying games, such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons or Pathfinder, using a myriad of hand-drawn art.
