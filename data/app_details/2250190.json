A small helper here is a distance counter in the upper right hand corner of the screen, where you can also see the time spent in the current journey. And the further you go, the more intricate the obstacles!<br />\r\nOn starting the game you've got two choices - go for the long run in an endless forest where you can build your score, or else begin  a short run with a goal - a city in a given distance, where you can master your speed runs.<br />\r\nIn this game you can use different weapons for hunting and fighting, make campfires and cook meat, find scattered chests with food, weapons and random tools to survive.
