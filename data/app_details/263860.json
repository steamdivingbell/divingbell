I found Spacecom even more exciting and involving than most triple-A games recently. I would highly recommend it to all people who like good games.\u201d<br>9/10 \u2013 IGN Deutschland<br><br>\u201cSpacecom is simple, both graphically and mechanically\u2014so simple it could almost be a board game.  And yet despite\u2014or rather, because of\u2014this unassuming exterior, there's a lot of depth for you to explore within a limited space. That's the kind of strategy I like! It's like playing an actual game of chess where each piece has a very defined set of rules versus a weird game of pseudo-chess where each pawn functions slightly differently and you won't really understand the point of half of them until you're fifty hours in.  We like to say &quot;Graphics don't matter! Graphics don't matter!&quot; Well, here's your proof. Just bring your imagination to the table, and there's a deeply satisfying strategy game waiting for you.\u201d<br>4/5 \u2013 PC World<br><br>\u201cSpacecom is exactly what I like. Challenging, smart, addictive, stimulating and yet not overloaded with unnecessary things. Flow Combine &amp; 11 bit studios production represents the real meaning of strategy games and it\u2019s essence. Every single fan of this genre, not only those with space theme, should check Spacecom.\u201d<br>8,5/10 \u2013 <br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/263860/ss_635c45820de566bb6f6abafa22bb03cfcfd7943f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1727869198","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/263860/ss_635c45820de566bb6f6abafa22bb03cfcfd7943f.600x338.jpg?t=1727869198"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/263860/ss_ac46d6109967caab9146cb7d37592851618a527c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1727869198","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/263860/ss_ac46d6109967caab9146cb7d37592851618a527c.600x338.jpg?t=1727869198"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/263860/ss_d3545b30d77c929f0d1a394c1b9ba819158b88b5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1727869198","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/263860/ss_d3545b30d77c929f0d1a394c1b9ba819158b88b5.600x338.jpg?t=1727869198"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/263860/ss_f7910b7592277c1b688366662b4a7c50344618cd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1727869198","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/263860/ss_f7910b7592277c1b688366662b4a7c50344618cd.600x338.jpg?t=1727869198"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/263860/ss_f4a938ed7a2e4da4ce74e6f62849e8d677b82f12.1920x1080.jpg?t=1727869198","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/263860/ss_f4a938ed7a2e4da4ce74e6f62849e8d677b82f12.600x338.jpg?t=1727869198"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/263860/ss_d2249f1ab46fabc67bea37b743196ff0bcc72d2d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1727869198","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/263860/ss_d2249f1ab46fabc67bea37b743196ff0bcc72d2d.600x338.jpg?t=1727869198"}],"short_description":"SPACECOM \u2013 a strategic-to-the-bone, starfleet command game in which deception, smart movement, and choices to battle decide victory or defeat.","steam_appid":263860,"support_info":{"email":"support@one2tribe.pl","url":""},"supported_languages":"English, French, German, Spanish - Spain, Polish, Russian","type":"game","website":"http://www.spacecom-game.com"}
