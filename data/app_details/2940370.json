{"about_the_game":"You will find yourself inside a mysterious hotel, where every corridor conceals its own secrets and dangers. Your goal is to reach the very bottom floor, but the path will be strewn with trials and puzzles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour only compass is the benchmark floor, which you must find and remember. Ahead of you are corridors where reality can warp, anomalies may lurk at every turn. One wrong decision, and you could find yourself trapped forever.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour ability to discern differences from the benchmark floor will be your key to success. If you notice a difference, turn back to avoid danger. If everything appears normal, proceed forward, getting closer to your goal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCarefully and attentively explore every corner of the hotel, trust your intuition and resourcefulness. Only then will you be able to overcome all obstacles and reach the very bottom floor, gaining your freedom.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Find the way out","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2940370/dbd8d40a4c184eeb78dbce1df57cdf4e483694a1.jpg"}],"total":1},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2940370/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714558524","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2940370/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1714558524","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2940370/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714558524","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2940370/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714558524","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You will find yourself inside a mysterious hotel, where every corridor conceals its own secrets and dangers.
