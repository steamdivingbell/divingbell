{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Automata Streetcar is an interactive, digital-media art project that uses historic streetcars as a metaphor to explore ideas about connection, communication, and community.  The project is inspired by the four historic streetcar systems that once operated in British Columba - in Victoria, Vancouver, North Vancouver, and in particular the small, remote mountain community of Nelson.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As mechanical devices, streetcars may be interpreted as a type of automata: self-guided, interactive mechanisms that respond to a sequence of predetermined instructions.  They follow a fixed track through city streets, stopping to collect passengers at predetermined locations, operating within a sequential yet highly interactive environment.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The project is primarily intended for installation in a museum or gallery setting,  featuring a composition of large-scale physical  objects with digital projections onto adjacent walls or screens. \u00a0Interacting with the physical art objects (as custom-made game controllers) allows exhibit visitors to explore a digital recreation of Nelson's main street as it was 100 years ago when streetcars operated there.  Players take on the roles of the conductor and driver to operate a streetcar, collect passengers, and build community confidence.
