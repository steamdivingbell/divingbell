{"about_the_game":"You've been invited to an old lady's mansion, who claims to be a distant relative of yours. Her name is Gretchen and she says she wants to discuss a matter of heritage with you. As you have no family or closer connection, except a few friends in town, you gladly accept. She is an elderly lady of a frail and sickly nature. You learn that she for many years has lost the ability to walk and is therefore bound to her wheelchair. She is also unable to speak and can only communicate through notes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is a long and tiring journey but eventually you arrive at the mansion. It is only the two of you there, which at first seems very weird since she is barely able to move, let alone speak. Something feels off... It doesn't make sense... And as you prepare to spend your first night in the mansion, you're starting to get second thoughts about your decision to stay...","achievements":{"total":0},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1543810/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1619796404","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1543810/page.bg.jpg?t=1619796404","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1543810/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1619796404","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1543810/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1619796404","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Scary moments.\r\nVisual depiction of corpses. \r\nReferences to the occult. \r\nPsychological stress."},"detailed_description":"You've been invited to an old lady's mansion, who claims to be a distant relative of yours.
