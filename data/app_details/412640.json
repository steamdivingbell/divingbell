{"about_the_game":"Immerse Creator is a collaborative VR environment where you can create 3D models, architectural spaces, free-form sketches, leave notes, and access a library of high quality assets.  While our goal is to introduce increasingly sophisticated 3D modeling tools, Immerse Creator is initially releasing with a very simple and easy to learn 3D sketching system.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe will soon be launching mulit-player mode, which will open the door to a whole new world of collaborative creativity.  Subscribers to multi-player will be given a private passcode to their scene, similar to a conference call dial-in, which they can share with others they wish to join them.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA non-VR 'viewer' mode will also be distributed for free, which will enable those without a VR headset to explore Immerse scenes.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/412640/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1513892220","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/412640/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1513892220","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/412640/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1513892220","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/412640/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1513892220","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Immerse Creator is a collaborative VR environment where you can create 3D models, architectural spaces, free-form sketches, leave notes, and access a library of high quality assets.
