Makes me want to leave my job, pull a Stardew Valley, and move to the countryside right away. :)  Of course, the peaceful opening tone makes... the twist that much more radical and gripping.  I am ambivalent about the choice to speak about the player character in the third person. Most games would say &quot;I&quot; or &quot;you.&quot; Saying &quot;The Farmer&quot; puts a little distance between the player and the player character.\u201d<br />\r\nitchio<br />\r\n","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2904860/ss_f9c0e015d319293ae21a715bbc9908cc3749a94c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1714094122","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2904860/ss_f9c0e015d319293ae21a715bbc9908cc3749a94c.600x338.jpg?t=1714094122"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2904860/ss_09197b6798aa2bdf04e34c9f1903a97620038b98.1920x1080.jpg?t=1714094122","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2904860/ss_09197b6798aa2bdf04e34c9f1903a97620038b98.600x338.jpg?t=1714094122"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2904860/ss_02eeff0e4d0f08b76e1881164497d519401d85f0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1714094122","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2904860/ss_02eeff0e4d0f08b76e1881164497d519401d85f0.600x338.jpg?t=1714094122"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2904860/ss_4b9b56773b2404ba8c148d2ed01fc10b5b3c770c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1714094122","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2904860/ss_4b9b56773b2404ba8c148d2ed01fc10b5b3c770c.600x338.jpg?t=1714094122"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2904860/ss_087c04a89cb8bf841c6c16f07ca87c787c07b1f0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1714094122","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2904860/ss_087c04a89cb8bf841c6c16f07ca87c787c07b1f0.600x338.jpg?t=1714094122"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2904860/ss_4dd897c7d1642970184ea7e410b11b59a760bcd2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1714094122","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2904860/ss_4dd897c7d1642970184ea7e410b11b59a760bcd2.600x338.jpg?t=1714094122"}],"short_description":"&quot;A very short psychological horror Visual novel.
