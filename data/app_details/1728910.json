{"about_the_game":"IL-2 Sturmovik: Great Battles series is more than just a combat flight-simulator, it is also a combined arms environment that includes our newly built anti-aircraft weapons system - the Sd.Kfz. 10/5 Flak 38! This mobile anti-aircraft gun shoots a 20mm HE or AP round that can shoot down enemy planes or attack enemy ground targets with rapid fire! <br><br>Our Sd.Kfz. 10/5 Flak 38 can be used in both single-player and multiplayer scenarios and includes several custom-made missions to demonstrate its ability at knocking down enemy planes. Also, you can play as the driver, gunner or commander and lead your team into deadly combat. Multiplayer supports multi-crew gameplay so you and your buddies can all man one truck together and work as a team! Most AAA systems in WWII were actually operated by a team of soldiers or sailors, not just a single person as popular movies or even other video games would have you believe.<br><br>Custom skins are also supported and we include summer and winter paint schemes to match your environment and better hide from the enemy. We also include support for our Tactical Code system so you can assign custom markings to your half-track.<br><br>The Sd.Kfz. 10/5 Flak 38 also includes a detailed damage model with Dynamic Visual Damage support, so your half-track will bear the scars of battle and take realistic looking damage.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">History</h2><br>The Sd.Kfz. 10 or Sonderkraftfahrzeug (special motorized vehicle) was a German half-track that saw action throughout World War II and on all fronts in Europe and North Africa. Its main role was as a prime mover for small towed guns or liquid agents and it could also carry eight troops. Different models could be specialized for a wide range of duties.<br><br>It was powered by a Maybach 6-cylinder water-cooled gasoline engine. It had a semi-automatic Maybach Variorex-transmission with seven forward and three reverse gears. It could attain 65 km/h (40 mph), while the cruising speed was 45 km/h (28 mph). Steering was performed by both the front wheels and caterpillar treads. Shallow turns were done using the front wheels and sharper turns were done using the treads with one braking like a tank would.<br><br>Sd.Kfz. 10 /5 carried the Flak 38 anti-aircraft gun in its rear bed and fired a 20mm projectile. The Flak 38 was an improvement over the older Flak 30 design and it had a rate of fire of 220 rounds per minute and weighed 420 Kilograms. Its use was ubiquitous throughout the war in all German theaters of operation and was the most produced artillery piece of the war by the Germans. Later designs mounted four Flak 38 cannons together for an added punch. The Flak 38 could also be towed by trucks or other vehicles when not mounted on Sd.Kfz. 10 half-tracks.
