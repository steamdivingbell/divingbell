However, one day, everyone inside didn't leave the building. Ever since, anyone that went inside never came back.

Stubborn as you are, you enter the facility in the hopes of finding them. Unlock new areas of the facility using various codes that are lying around and use the features of the Randomization IsoLocator to forge a path towards the CEO's office.
