Westwall highlights the major battles along the German frontier between Arnhem and Aachen, including the battles around the Peel Marshes, Geilenkirchen, and the Stolberg Corridor. As the Allies, can you breach the Westwall and overrun the exhausted German Army before they can rest and regroup? Or as the Germans, can you hold out sufficient reserves for a lightning strike against the Allied juggernaut?<br> <br>Featuring highly accurate, detailed and beautiful maps, these scenarios field a varied force mix, including some with heavy concentrations of armor requiring dynamic, challenging operational decisions. The scenarios range in size from Regimental actions through to Army level operations. It contains 12 scenarios.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/524170/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731886922","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/524170/page.bg.jpg?t=1731886922","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/524170/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731886922","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/524170/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731886922","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/524170/extras/Westwall_Break.jpg?t=1731886922\" /><br><br>The Westwall series covers the Allied attempts to breach the vaunted Siegfried Line and drive into the heart of Germany in the fall of 1944.
