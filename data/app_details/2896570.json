{"about_the_game":"Zombie Possum Games Inc, in collaboration with Darwin's Toys Inc, is excited to bring the Empire Builder series of board games to your PC. As fans of these games, we at Zombie Possum Games Inc sought more time in our busy lives to enjoy them. To our surprise, we couldn't find any playable versions online using the services that we love like Steam and Xbox. That changes now. With the release of Empire Builder - Europe and the license to offer all other installments in the franchise, we are partnering with Darwin's Toys to publish the latest versions on Steam, iOS, Xbox, and other platforms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you are an avid train gamer in the physical space, we hope you will enjoy our adaption of the board game to the digital game space.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures to be included in the initial release include the following:<br />\r\nAll of the game's resources, cities, demand cards and event cards, fully implemented in the digital game.<br />\r\nA select number of popular house rules. (TBD)<br />\r\n2-6 player multiplayer between Steam friends and those with a ZPG account.<br />\r\nA user interface that is designed to make the game play of the boardgame faster.  Our goal is to get 4 player game play down to under an hour or 45 minutes for experienced players.<br />\r\nTournament rules.<br />\r\nCurrent tournament approved map coming soon for the physical board game.
