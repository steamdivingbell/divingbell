I'm a college student studying Computer Science and game development is one of my passions. I love it, so I spend a significant amount of my free time on it. Since I'm one person and I really don't like to cut corners, I do almost all of the work. If it's in the game, not a sound effect, and not credited to someone else, I probably did it. This is my biggest passion project, so I really hope you enjoy playing it with your friends.</p>","developers":["Codegnat Studios"],"genres":[{"description":"Action","id":"1"},{"description":"Early Access","id":"70"}],"header_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3445850/header.jpg?t=1739339227","is_free":false,"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"></ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"></ul>"},"name":"Friday Night Knockout","package_groups":[],"pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core 2 Dual<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Mobile Intel 4 Series<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 12<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 1 GB available space</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel i7<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 16 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA GForce GTX 1050<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 12<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 1 GB available space</li></ul>"},"platforms":{"linux":false,"mac":false,"windows":true},"publishers":["Codegnat Studios"],"ratings":{"dejus":{"banned":"0","descriptors":"Viol\u00eancia","rating":"10","rating_generated":"1","required_age":"10","use_age_gate":"0"},"steam_germany":{"banned":"0","descriptors":"Gewalt","rating":"12","rating_generated":"1","required_age":"12","use_age_gate":"0"}},"release_date":{"coming_soon":true,"date":"Coming soon"},"required_age":0,"screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3445850/ss_7b7a938ca9db4c402b563ee52f280cdedc59809a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1739339227","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3445850/ss_7b7a938ca9db4c402b563ee52f280cdedc59809a.600x338.jpg?t=1739339227"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3445850/ss_7d61f09c9b9c99aa2e06e927f7fd3382471cead7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1739339227","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3445850/ss_7d61f09c9b9c99aa2e06e927f7fd3382471cead7.600x338.jpg?t=1739339227"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3445850/ss_3e6fbf54c29d542ef8150ef5d2f0d5f9877ed842.1920x1080.jpg?t=1739339227","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3445850/ss_3e6fbf54c29d542ef8150ef5d2f0d5f9877ed842.600x338.jpg?t=1739339227"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3445850/ss_d28965b78dfb3937a68d66855bece9634617a349.1920x1080.jpg?t=1739339227","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3445850/ss_d28965b78dfb3937a68d66855bece9634617a349.600x338.jpg?t=1739339227"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3445850/ss_5dbbef3c321871eeb28145b2dee895f6801699ef.1920x1080.jpg?t=1739339227","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3445850/ss_5dbbef3c321871eeb28145b2dee895f6801699ef.600x338.jpg?t=1739339227"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3445850/ss_694fb691d5177739d4608f2a56298b499612bcbf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1739339227","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3445850/ss_694fb691d5177739d4608f2a56298b499612bcbf.600x338.jpg?t=1739339227"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3445850/ss_0efc23c787f0a5e8469356403659210330d9fe0d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1739339227","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3445850/ss_0efc23c787f0a5e8469356403659210330d9fe0d.600x338.jpg?t=1739339227"}],"short_description":"A casual arcade stick fighter, great as an introductory title to the genre made for quick 1v1 games.","steam_appid":3445850,"support_info":{"email":"codegnatstudios@gmail.com","url":""},"supported_languages":"English","type":"game","website":null}
