{"about_the_game":"A mind virus has taken hold of the population! Assume the role of drag-queen--zombie-slayer extraordinaire Zane Dmaaj and battle your way through mobs of NPZees, Fatties, SoiBois and more in the high octane, pearl clutching shooter Drag the Dead! A heart of gold, a corset of vengeance, fabulous in a world of revolt - don't get in her way! Dive into the chaos and fight to the end and see if you can put a stop to the mental pathogen that's turned humanity into a mindless mob of miscreant monsters!<br><br><u><strong>COMPLEX AND DEEP PUZZLES</strong></u><br>They don't exist in this game. You aren't going to have to worry about getting hung up on any block pushing or backtracking endlessly until you figure out how to trigger some kind Rube Goldberg machine style contraption to move on from one area to the next. Nope, not here, you just need to focus on killing everything.<br><br><strong><u>INTRICATELY DEFINED GAME MECHANICS</u></strong><br>Yeah, these are also not in the game. Drag the Dead is simple. Walk, aim, shoot. That's it. Kill a zombie and don't stop moving. We've stripped this project down to basics. No running, no jumping. No reloading, no health kits, no ammo. Just walk, aim and shoot.<br><br><strong><u>ARCADE STYLE ACTION</u></strong><br>Alright this is definitely part of Drag the Dead. You're going to be tearing your way through hoards of the infected - each mob bigger than the next - with new zombie types joining the fray as you progress through the game until the final showdown with &quot;The Big Bad&quot;. If you die, don't worry, there's no pesky checkpoints and you'll be able to start right back at the beginning of the level.<br><br><strong><u>MULTIPLE DIFFICULTIES</u></strong><br>Drag the Dead features three difficulty levels. Firstly there's &quot;Dragged Through Hell&quot; which is normal, which is difficult but that's what passes for normal. Second is &quot;Dragged To Hell&quot;. This option is not normal and more difficulter than the prior option. Lastly there is &quot;Journo&quot; which is designed for those players who may really struggle with the other two options, which means it's really easy. We're talking really, really, really easy.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Blue Ribbon","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2265290/b03c74e90ec1dc2008f42adec5af23c6eac2384d.jpg"},{"name":"Red Pill","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2265290/3692c382f64565c75ca0875fa9eacf254cf7955b.jpg"},{"name":"Black Pill","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2265290/83d488fe319ee42b93e4a51f9b297f90f6228e5f.jpg"},{"name":"Behave, We're Watching","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2265290/10e64029652faf6f912b73a17a0ccf6a2b18af35.jpg"},{"name":"Stop Winning","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2265290/46f5e58e0f82644069f0ffbf43516e8f6dbe7810.jpg"},{"name":"Coffee Bean","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2265290/ca4b0d45aef6ff0eab7ea9f231ffa414c89e932b.jpg"},{"name":"Now You Can Die, Change My Mind","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2265290/62257d97c71743ad65f39747b98f1681c31bf825.jpg"},{"name":"Vanquisher Of Worms","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2265290/6e4a864a8723f05c142425c15a0c063765415c5f.jpg"},{"name":"Special Little Hero","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2265290/ab747d3706cb61738ce472356170e5807ca5840c.jpg"},{"name":"Winner In My Book","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2265290/4824b502d0a4ccbc3552151bfcdc907c06fd7aa1.jpg"}],"total":10},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2265290?t=1702516465","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2265290/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1702516465","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2265290/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1702516465","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2265290/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1702516465","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Nudity or Sexual Content, Frequent Violence or Gore, General Mature Content, and Satirical Dark Comedy."},"detailed_description":"A mind virus has taken hold of the population!
