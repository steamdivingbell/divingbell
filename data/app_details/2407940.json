Occasionally a protector of the land, it is more commonly an omen and bringer of death, as was the case in the Welsh town of Portmadoc. Thus, a party of six set out with one motive: slay the black hound that haunted their moors. All six ignored mockery, counsel, and pleas before disappearing into the moors\u2019 eternal mist. The town waited until morning for their return. Believers waited a week. Families waited a month. But when the seasons changed, all gave up hope. <br><br>Over a year later the youngest of the party, seventeen-year-old Jacob Arawn, returned. Bruised and bloody, he was alone \u2013 but carried a dog\u2019s head twice the size of any other, its eyes still burning red with liquid fire. Jacob never recounted the same story twice, but there was one detail that remained consistent: his party travelled into the Underworld to find the beast, and he was the only one who escaped. <br><br>Soon, Jacob was flooded with letters from towns living in fear of their own dark Hellhounds. Tired, haggard, and with yet unhealed wounds, Jacob was indignant to hear of more monstrous hounds. He didn\u2019t hesitate to journey to moors far afield, where his life was consumed by the never-ending quest to banish all of Hell\u2019s hounds from the isle. <br><br>Eventually, rumors of The Black Dog neared extinction. In their stead, travelers and taverns told tales of The Moorhound: a Hunter who sails on the mist, strikes with the lightning, and protects his sacred moors from trespassers. Children and adults alike now feared The Moorhound, the very man who sought to rid them of the dogs that prowled through their nightmares.  <br><br>Perhaps perturbed by this betrayal, Jacob now sets sail for a new land, where he may leave his myth behind and continue his fight against the Underworld and its new packs of Hellhounds. Or perhaps he cares nothing of the myths and, more than half a century after leaving Portmadoc, the bayou offers the only thing he knows: a Hunt.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2407940/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1723708696","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2407940/page.bg.jpg?t=1723708696","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2407940/1f30239dd03faef657c543d4a389eb72c8dd398c/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1723708696","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2407940/1f30239dd03faef657c543d4a389eb72c8dd398c/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1723708696","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Remote Play on Tablet","id":42},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"This DLC contains one Hunter, two Weapons, and one Tool:<br><br>- The Moorhound (Hunter)<br>- Maw of Darkness (Romero 77)<br>- Hell's Dewclaw (Pax)<br>- Snarling Dawn (Flare Pistol)<br><br><br><u><strong>The Moorhound\u00a0</strong></u><br><br>Jacob Arawn set out to slay the Black Dog of Hell, but has become a figure near synonymous with the hound he hunted.
