Throughout the following years, A. Fruit created over 300 custom sound effects and 31 original music tracks. In her own words: &quot;this album is mostly experimental stuff made with the sounds of old clocks and other mechanic noises I've recorded. Being composed with vintage instruments and mixed with the interface sounds of the game, it reminds of the electroswing and the hip-hop music, but with the atmosphere of an industrial steampunk town.&quot;<br><br>Total playtime: 1:39:07.
