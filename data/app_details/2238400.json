{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">GAMEPLAY:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Take control of PizzaBoy, a nimble pizza delivery guy equipped with an air-dash that allows him to bounce off walls.

PizzaBoy must navigate dangerous environments to deliver pizzas to hungry monsters.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Pizzaboy must make it the end of the level to deliver the pizza, but don't expect it to be too simple, as each area is full off pizza-hungry monsters.
