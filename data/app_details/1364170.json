In turn with the enemy, you make moves with your cards or use objects. To win the game, you need to destroy the main card (Place of Power) of the enemy. There are no pre-prepared decks here - all cards and items are selected in turn from the general list. Already at the stage of choosing and placing cards, you can get a significant advantage over the enemy by blocking or taking the cards he needs.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">  All cards in the game (Heroes and Places of Power) have basic characteristics (attack, defense, health) and 2-3 unique skills. Items play a supporting role. They can both enhance the basic parameters of your cards, and inflict direct damage to enemy cards.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">  For a comfortable game, it is better to start playing with a friend, gradually learning the abilities of different cards and items, their strengths and weaknesses. At the moment, the game has 48 Hero cards, 13 Places of Power cards and more than 80 items and rings.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1364170/extras/battle_forIntro2_.png?t=1737133012\" /></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1364170/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737133012","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1364170/page.bg.jpg?t=1737133012","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1364170/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737133012","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1364170/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737133012","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1364170/extras/--------------------------------ss.jpg?t=1737133012\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">  This is an adaptation of a board game for two players.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">  The game takes place on one playing field.
