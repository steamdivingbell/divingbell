{"about_the_game":"Path To The Devil is a replayable, rouge like deck building game in an RPG environment.  The objective of the game is to defeat the devil in a deck building battle as fast as you can.  Of course to do that you must build a strong deck by travelling down a path to the far side of an island and along the way take out the devil's mercenary army and complete various non combatant encounters.    <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay 1 of 3 games on 1 of 7 randomly selected islands with different decks and different mercenary armies.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game play and user interface are deliberately uncomplicated so if your into causal play for a hour or two at a time Path To The Devil may be for you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease note the main focus of the game is deck building so the rpg features are minimal apart from the rpg environment.  The player basically moves forward along a path and triggers deck building battles, automatic pickups or prompts for non combatant encounters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNOTE.  It takes multiple attempts to win a game.   If your a new player and find it hard to win do not be discouraged.  All games can be won in 45 to 120 minutes once you are familiar with the cards, how to play them effectively and of course the enemies.  Good luck and have fun.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2503280/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1700347368","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2503280/page.bg.jpg?t=1700347368","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2503280/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1700347368","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2503280/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1700347368","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Deck Building Battles simulate attacks and death of the player and npc's.
