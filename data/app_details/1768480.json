{"about_the_game":"<i> <strong> A.S.T.R.A. </strong> </i> - a game made in 2D hand-drawn graphics, which is a collection of various mini-games in different genres.<br>Do you like exciting arcade games, set a new record, and pain in your eyes? Then I suggest giving this game a try!<br><i> <strong> ASTRA </strong> </i> - artificial intelligence that controls the system in the computer space, which was captured by the virus <i> <strong> &quot;B&quot; </strong> </i>, the purpose of which is complete destruction of the OS. From time to time he will get in touch and try to do something wrong. You take on the role of a simple user facing an infection. Your goal is clear - reset the system by destroying the virus. However, the virus encrypts all the data from your eyes and does not allow it to be done so easily, and in addition, it takes a fee for each action with an impromptu currency, which will have to be earned in games in various genres. Choose a game, buy it, wait for it to load and voila! It's on your desktop. Everything is almost like in life.<br>Several mini-games are waiting for you, which will definitely not let you get bored, and will challenge you to a new record.<br>In <i> Platform Hero </i> you have to literally survive using a grappling hook and a firearm, clinging to platforms. But this will not last long: the hook does not hold up, and the platform keeps dropping. It's time to catch on to another, but no matter how it is: the enemy is moving towards the hero. It's time to use your weapon.<br>Another mini-game in the space network is <i> Planetoids </i>. The goal is the same - to get points, simultaneously destroying asteroids. Here you have complete control over the ship, and the asteroids themselves are split into pieces, which can be caught game over once again.<br><i> Dino Island </i> - a runner in which you play as a dinosaur. You have to jump over stones and trees and periodically turn into a pterodactyl, also flying around obstacles.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1768480/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1703336006","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1768480/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1703336006","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1768480/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1703336006","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1768480/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1703336006","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"May cause epilepsy"},"detailed_description":"<i> <strong> A.S.T.R.A. </strong> </i> - a game made in 2D hand-drawn graphics, which is a collection of various mini-games in different genres.<br>Do you like exciting arcade games, set a new record, and pain in your eyes?
