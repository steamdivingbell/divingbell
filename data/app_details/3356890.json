{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Fight</strong> an army of corrupted souls in highly dynamic combat with a unique health system.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Navigate</strong> a pitch black world using waypoints, wisdom, and blind luck.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Upgrade</strong> your arsenal, Rods, and items by finding Runes and bosses across the Void.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">And keep that up.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Even though there's nothing here.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Made From Fire</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You are stuck in the Void. It's pitch black and there's nothing here. But you're here, a bright, uncorrupted beacon of pure fire. You have a better chance at survival than any human has ever had.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You don't even have a health bar. Or spells. Or as little as a weapon.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You only have Rods.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Rods</strong> are fiery, explosive, and in endless supply. Slash or even throw them at enemies to burn them alive. They also must protect you from damage, however - spend too many Rods on offense, and you may not hold yourself together for long. Don't enter fights you cannot handle, but as the Void is large and open, fleeing is usually an option.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If you get lucky, you can even harness its strange power to upgrade your Rods, your only measure of health, attack, and defense... that can only be a good thing, right?<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3356890/extras/fireballs.gif?t=1736297744\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Map In The Tar</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">For a world with nothing in it, there is a load of navigation to be done. Rooms fit together in a grid that is not easily revealed. Even if it was, which rooms to go next in your quest to leave, that's a complete mystery as well. With very little direction from all the help you can get, you mark locations of interest on a black screen, and pray the next room won't lock you in combat...</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Navigating blindly, of course, is only one method. <strong>Waypoints</strong> are scattered across the floor, indicating potential rewards all over. Beacons reveal maps of your surroundings, though they still do not reveal adjacent rooms. Floor paths, enemy placement, blocking walls, and powerful upgrades gradually make your journey through the Void a bit easier... but none of them actually tell you what lies even just one room ahead.<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3356890/extras/mapview.gif?t=1736297744\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Customize Your Solitude</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Lonely as your position may be, you're not giving up that easily. Upgrade your abilities and stay ahead of the curve - <strong>Sigils</strong> may really help here. Perhaps your Fireballs should have bigger explosions? Maybe you want your Primary to deal massive knockback? Or internalize Dynamic and just move really quickly, if you're willing to forgo the damage.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Every player has different priorities and access to power, all in order to avoid being corrupted by the endless power of the Void. Any playthrough is your own; become the best survivor in the depths... and find what you must do to leave.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Though sometimes, you can't help wonder... if this power you seek, is making it worse.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3356890/extras/sigilchoice.gif?t=1736297744\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Is There Truly Nothing?</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Sure, the Void has a reputation for being... empty. Most rooms are empty, there's no towns, no travelers, absolutely nothing. You simply cannot build a civilization, a workshop, or a home without it all being taken away soon enough. Believe me - some have tried.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">And, somehow, <i>some have prevailed for longer than they were supposed to.</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This demo is pretty expansive, and contains:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">2 to 3 areas filled with ruins of other fallen entities</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Void Winds, Vaults, curse, tentacles, and Fusion</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Runes to trace: get access to rooms, maps, items, lore, and more</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Campfires to use as access points, save points, and a false sense of security</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Obelisk, as powerful as usual</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">1 boss!
