He lives alone with his mother and, due to economic reasons, cannot attend university despite being an excellent student. He decides to look for a job and help with the expenses at home, but luck is not on his side and after a month, he has not been able to find anything, as it is not easy to find employment without experience in his country.<br><br>One day, he receives a mysterious letter from a lawyer requesting that he come to her office. Somewhat hesitant and surprised by the request, he decides to attend. She informs him that his uncle, his father's brother, left him an agricultural land on the outskirts of the city as an inheritance. This could be good news for anyone, but not for him. His uncle's death affects him, and he sincerely wished he could have known him. The inheritance left him at a crossroads: what should he do with the land? He could sell it and attend university, but on the other hand, he felt that it was his uncle's last legacy and that it was not right to do so.<br><br>That night, after the appointment with the lawyer and after talking to his mother and deeply reflecting on it, he comes to the conclusion that he will not sell the inherited land. But what would he do? He was an inexperienced young man, without knowledge of agriculture and without money. Work the land? It was a crazy idea, but he still wanted to try. The world had not given him a job opportunity, so he decided that he would create his own. A huge challenge for one person, but he would not do it alone on this tough journey. He would meet new friends, form bonds, and even find love. The road to success will not be easy, with new challenges every day, but he has what it takes to succeed. The important thing is to never give up.<br><br><strong>Characters</strong><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396690/extras/descripcionClaudio630.png?t=1731546840\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396690/extras/descripcionDianne.630png.png?t=1731546840\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396690/extras/descripcionIasmin630.png?t=1731546840\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396690/extras/descripcionSylvie630.png?t=1731546840\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396690/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731546840","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396690/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1731546840","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396690/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731546840","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396690/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731546840","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Just Life&quot; is an immersive role-playing and life simulation game that revolves around storytelling and human connections.
