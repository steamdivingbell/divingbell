{"about_the_game":"The Promethium armada is headed to Earth, leaving a toxic trail of destruction in its wake.

I'd really recommend a Joypad though, this game is tough enough as it is. <br><br>Use any analog stick or the d-pad to control the experimental fighter, or in keyboard mode use WSAD or cursor keys to fly.<br><br>You can fire using any of the triggers, bumpers or the 'B' button on Xbox 360 or Xbox One controllers and the 'O' button on the Dualshock controller. If you are in keyboard mode you can press the space bar to fire.<br><br>You can buy the current power-up by pressing the 'A' button on Xbox 360 or Xbox One controllers and the 'X' button on the Dualshock controller. If you are playing using a keyboard then any key other than WSAD, Space or the cursor keys will allow you to buy the current power-up - I'd suggest the return key is a handy one.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Newbie","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/624680/b65b629f1f65c05bba274179038a2a5d58b2e9b0.jpg"},{"name":"Experienced ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/624680/3d4546251d02d07a70ed30b9fe1d9ccf183894d1.jpg"},{"name":"LEGENDARY!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/624680/f716a1cdcc6e80ad664d341c18d25bdc1b397ec5.jpg"},{"name":"Must try harder","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/624680/cdc9b5211b15317e08cd50b13152a967c9f0511e.jpg"},{"name":"Are you even trying?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/624680/a1fd6a255c55941f9687e117be0c49cfea42d0ac.jpg"},{"name":"Suicidal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/624680/ebb54ab9e590c75142e3ce09822e94ebf77bf5ce.jpg"},{"name":"Level 1 complete!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/624680/581c69a70fd5bed4a3a2961cfee6604eac099299.jpg"},{"name":"Level 2 complete!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/624680/4b20d7c2e89cf20dca9a748499c6e57c3dcb3006.jpg"},{"name":"Level 3 complete!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/624680/4acaca2cb49247f11130b4ca33947883ac1e8fef.jpg"},{"name":"Level 5 complete!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/624680/ef47afda7d5723ecdae4b826e4602e9e6746a41b.jpg"}],"total":24},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/624680?t=1672852268","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624680/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1672852268","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624680/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1672852268","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624680/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1672852268","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"The Promethium armada is headed to Earth, leaving a toxic trail of destruction in its wake.

That's the core concept behind UK indie developer Byron Atkinson-Jones' upcoming shooter Promethium.\u201d<br>Kotaku<br><br>\u201cSide-scrolling shmup with some sweet cel-shaded art and a nice line in really gigantic-feeling spaceships in the background, in a way that reminds me faintly of the Red Dwarf intro credits. It\u2019s fairly straightforward, being unashamedly a C64-inspired shmup rather than a wild and weird J-shmup-inspired piece, but that means it can get on with cranking up the difficulty and being a pure test of skill rather than bamboozling you with mechanics.  Speaking as someone who only has occasional relationships with shmups and as such isn\u2019t particularly motivated by difficulty, I did find it perhaps a little samey level-to-level, but it\u2019s tight and I do love the model spaceship-like look.\u201d<br>Rock Paper Shotgun<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624680/ss_1b7af9fe40fbc70ab6cc3e2dfd3fc6b246dd49ea.1920x1080.jpg?t=1672852268","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624680/ss_1b7af9fe40fbc70ab6cc3e2dfd3fc6b246dd49ea.600x338.jpg?t=1672852268"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624680/ss_74a9edfd06ca506f19a7f36ab06de570db4f719c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1672852268","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624680/ss_74a9edfd06ca506f19a7f36ab06de570db4f719c.600x338.jpg?t=1672852268"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624680/ss_984030b21da4d1f3bbc0dcbdae855da644d37066.1920x1080.jpg?t=1672852268","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624680/ss_984030b21da4d1f3bbc0dcbdae855da644d37066.600x338.jpg?t=1672852268"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624680/ss_c2107a086b993346bb3546f4abb17a12efec289b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1672852268","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624680/ss_c2107a086b993346bb3546f4abb17a12efec289b.600x338.jpg?t=1672852268"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624680/ss_bc236ab86e8352f1f65377ff71988e444a2526c2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1672852268","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624680/ss_bc236ab86e8352f1f65377ff71988e444a2526c2.600x338.jpg?t=1672852268"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624680/ss_00f3a0b5352a6cc4d7011915ee07d549f614ad51.1920x1080.jpg?t=1672852268","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624680/ss_00f3a0b5352a6cc4d7011915ee07d549f614ad51.600x338.jpg?t=1672852268"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624680/ss_9269864215fd7ff737ab146a267f96d52874a231.1920x1080.jpg?t=1672852268","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624680/ss_9269864215fd7ff737ab146a267f96d52874a231.600x338.jpg?t=1672852268"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624680/ss_10750b8c7c29477bef76879d12ff95b02a40413a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1672852268","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624680/ss_10750b8c7c29477bef76879d12ff95b02a40413a.600x338.jpg?t=1672852268"},{"id":8,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624680/ss_43f97310a2c10fa7c12e8c6e9a8281b68e6cfbfc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1672852268","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624680/ss_43f97310a2c10fa7c12e8c6e9a8281b68e6cfbfc.600x338.jpg?t=1672852268"},{"id":9,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624680/ss_649a01efa720b89d43724063d86affbcaa80c880.1920x1080.jpg?t=1672852268","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/624680/ss_649a01efa720b89d43724063d86affbcaa80c880.600x338.jpg?t=1672852268"}],"short_description":"Inspired by classic Commodore 64 and arcade games, Promethium is a hard-as-nails retro inspired side-scrolling shoot-em-up that takes place over numerous levels that get harder and harder.
