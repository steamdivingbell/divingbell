{"about_the_game":"<i>Electric Alps</i> is a 2D puzzle game based on real-world electrical engineering. Explore how electricity works. Plan your circuitry, install devices and solve logic-based wiring problems.<br><br>You take on the role of an electrician, returning to the remote village of <i>St. Ampere</i>, nestled in the breathtaking Austrian Alps. Tasked with wiring up homes and structures, you\u2019ll master the principles of electrical engineering. Install cables, switches, and other electrical devices, strategically wiring them up to create functional circuits. Each building is a puzzle, requiring your skills to power it up. Your journey will ultimately transform the village, awakening it from its unpowered slumber. One circuit at a time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\u26a1 Based on Real-World Electricity</h2>Explore the fundamentals of electrical engineering, delving into real-world electricity. Understand the principles of current flow and master the art of wiring in this hands-on and educational experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\ud83e\udde0 Solve Puzzle-Based Circuitries</h2>Engage wiring challenges that combine logic, strategic planning and your new-found electrical knowledge to solve a variety of puzzles in the world of electrical installations.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Utilize a Vast Toolbox</h2>Explore a vast array of devices and appliances as you advance through St. Ampere.
