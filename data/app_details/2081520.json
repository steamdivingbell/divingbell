But in the coming years, their land grew ill, and soon they all followed. Siblings and cousins, aunts and uncles: Maeve helped her mother give them all back to the earth, burying them with their favorite possessions in hand. When Maeve buried her mother, there were no treasures left to harvest, so she placed dried seeds on her cold fingers and prayed they brought her mother bounty in a world beyond. <br><br>Harvest season came again, and from the decaying flesh of her kin, the crops grew fuller and richer than ever before. A ravenous Maeve fed and gorged, and when her gaunt body could take no more, she shared it with the birds, the rabbits, and the deer. <br><br>Maeve kept to herself, and it would be many years before she met another person. When she did, they were people no longer. Disgusted by the greed of the rotting who refused to give back what was no longer theirs, she turned her tools into weapons and left her home behind. Following the scent of death to the Bayou, she readied herself for a different kind of harvest.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2081520/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728562797","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2081520/page.bg.jpg?t=1728562797","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2081520/f9aab45f7bf44588d31a2ca8aca928d5ca5315c4/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728562797","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2081520/f9aab45f7bf44588d31a2ca8aca928d5ca5315c4/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728562797","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Remote Play on Tablet","id":42},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"This DLC contains one Hunter, two Weapons, and one Tool:<br><br>- Daughter of Decay (Hunter)<br>- Bountiful (Berthier 1892)<br>- First Fruits (Hunting Bow)<br>- The Scion (Knuckle Knife)<br><br><br><strong><u>Daughter of Decay</u></strong><br>As a child, Maeve Flynn buried her family, and from their rotten flesh grew the crops that allowed her to grow vigorous and sturdy.
