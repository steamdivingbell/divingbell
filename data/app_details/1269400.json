{"about_the_game":"Welcome to the <strong>100-Player Twitch Chat Party Pack</strong>, a set of minigames and upgraded arcade classics that let you play in real-time with or against your viewers.  Imagine something like Twitch Plays Pok\u00e9mon where <strong>everyone</strong> controls their own character (viewers use Twitch Chat commands) and it's absolute chaos.  And when you need to step away, AFK Mode will give your channel a way to stay engaged during the downtime.<br><br>Current games included in the pack are:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Splat Chat</h2><br>A perfect blend of luck and survival.  Everyone is trapped on an island and reach round, heavy objects will fall from the sky.  Guess which space will stay safe, and try your best to not get splat!  Splat Chat provides a hilariously chaotic experience for everyone in your stream.  Seconds to learn, impossible to master.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Minesweeper Extreme: 100</h2><br>Why are we always minesweeping from a distance? Isn't it about time we were <strong>actually there on the minefield</strong> with 100 of our friends, living or dying together, as a team? With Minesweeper Extreme: 100, everyone controls their minesweeper on an active minefield, frantically trying to work together to clear it before a major earthquake triggers all the mines.  Beware! A single mistake will cost you your life, and the lives of those next to you.  This game even works well with a very small number of players!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Happy Tanksgiving</h2><br>In this free-for all arcade game, everyone controls a tank on a battlefield free-for-all.  It's you versus 100. As a streamer, you'll be commanding a super tank with heavy armor that can be controlled in real-time. Each of your viewers will command their own lightly-armored hovertank by using chat commands. They can kill you, or kill each other, but only one tank can claim victory.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Bombertown</h2><br>A truly unique 100-Player take on a classic bomb-planting game! Control your bomber, surround your enemies with bombs, and be the last one standing, all the while collecting powerups and tightening the noose around your enemies.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DMCA-free music</h2>With all the issues surrounding video game music DMCAs on streaming platforms, all the music has been either specifically created for the game, or licensed from the same indie artist (Couteau Papillon, who also did the soundtrack to Spaceteam), and is verified by SOCAN to be streamed without triggering a DMCA.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1269400/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1645219976","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1269400/page.bg.jpg?t=1645219976","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1269400/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1645219976","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1269400/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1645219976","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Notice</h1><p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Twitch Account is REQUIRED to play.</h2><br>These games will never ask for your password to connect, and they use a simple, secure connection to connect to your chat.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Games in the Party Pack are all designed for streamers with <strong>100 active viewers</strong> or more in their audience.</h2><br>Be aware: Minesweeper Extreme: 100 and Splat Chat can both work well with a very small number of players, but the rest of the games do not play well with, and are not designed for a smaller audience.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Welcome to the <strong>100-Player Twitch Chat Party Pack</strong>, a set of minigames and upgraded arcade classics that let you play in real-time with or against your viewers.
