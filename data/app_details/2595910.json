{"about_the_game":"In this demo you get all the summer stages from Mow That Lawn, ie. the first 3 stages and the first boss, on &quot;Normal&quot; difficulty. Play as much as you want and try to achieve a spot on the Demo Highscore list.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMow That Lawn is a  fast-paced and colorful side-scrolling platform shooter, where you play as Thomas, who has gone to the garden to mow his lawn. Unfortunately, the lawn is full of holes and piles of dirt, which make it difficult to get the job done. The garden's wildlife also often gets in the way and as if that were\u2019nt enough, many of Thomas\u2019s old friends hang out in the garden and tease him as he drives around. Especially one old friend has grown tired of Thomas, so every time Thomas is out on the tractormower, he flyes drones over the garden and bombs Thomas with water balloons. Fortunately, Thomas has learned to jump over the holes, sitting on the tractormower, and he always has an unlimited number of soda cans with him, which he can throw at the various obstacles. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe gameplay is inspired by the arcade games from the early 80\u2019s and the difficulty level is challenging as in these. Earn points by shooting everything around you and try to do well enough to achive a spot on the highscore list.","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2595910/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1695301966","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2595910/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1695301966","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In this demo you get all the summer stages from Mow That Lawn, ie. the first 3 stages and the first boss, on &quot;Normal&quot; difficulty.
