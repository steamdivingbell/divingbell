This includes the careful design of street layouts, the strategic positioning of buildings and the consideration of their interrelationships. A well-planned city can significantly increase economic efficiency, which in turn can translate into increased city revenues. <br><br>The key is to create a harmonious balance between residential areas, production zones and sacred buildings, buildings that provide entertainment, but also special buildings that provide care for structures and people.

Meeting the demands of Pharaoh and other cities, responding to military threats and navigating the complexities of a hierarchical society will become routine tasks.
