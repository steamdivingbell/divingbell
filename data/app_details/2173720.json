{"about_the_game":"A Piano Tale is a narrative game with elements of music skills. The game tells the story of a fictional musician, Alexandra Aaronovitch, in several stages of her life. Alexandra is an elderly woman with Alzheimer's disease, and discovers that her father Boris Aaronovitch, who was a composer during the Stalinist era in the USSR, composed a secret, subversive concerto at a time and place when artists were not allowed to create what they wanted. The concerto was dedicated to his daughter Alexandra, and the search for this secret motivates most of the narrative. Depending on the player's success in the Point&amp;Click passages and in the musical skill parts, there will be three possible endings, which will show whether Alexandra has managed to retrieve her memories despite her illness, and whether she forgives her father for the difficult and strict childhood he put her through.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2173720/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1670338373","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2173720/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1670338373","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2173720/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1670338373","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2173720/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1670338373","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A Piano Tale is a narrative game with elements of music skills.
