{"about_the_game":"Colorlines was the original Russian DOS version of Lines. It is a turn-based board game. Each turn, three randomly colored chips fall on random grid of a 9x9 squares board. <br><br>Your mission in Colorlines is to re-locate the chips (by moving one of them per turn) to form lines consisting of five or more chips of the same color. The lines can be arranged vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Each line you build immediately disappears, giving you points.
