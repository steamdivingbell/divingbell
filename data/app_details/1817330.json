{"about_the_game":"A world Desolate of life and overtaken by an infectious virus that causes people to lose their minds and morals. To become more than human. Explore Richmond Washington, a west coast district overran by a religious cult known only as the Acolytes. Ran by a man known only as Cyrus, a priest who views the apocalypses as the rapture who leads a holy war on the people of Richmond in his attempt to lead the people to salvation. Immolation is a true open world survival horror set in a lore rich apocalypse. Explore, Survive, and Thrive in Richmond Washington and face off against psychos, husks, and cultists. This game uses survival mechanics such as hunger, thirst, and managing health and stamina. Explore the world in search of these supplies all while taking on epic quests and challenging foes.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1817330/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1668213243","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1817330/page.bg.jpg?t=1668213243","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1817330/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1668213243","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1817330/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1668213243","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Blood and Gore\r\nUse of Drugs\r\nStrong Language\r\nIntense Violence"},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"A world Desolate of life and overtaken by an infectious virus that causes people to lose their minds and morals.
