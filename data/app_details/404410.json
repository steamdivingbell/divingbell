{"about_the_game":"Endless Sky is a 2D space trading and combat game inspired by the classic Escape Velocity series. Work your way up from a relatively wimpy shuttle, cargo ship, or fighter, to a highly upgraded and customized flagship or to a massive fleet of warships or freighters. Earn money by carrying passengers or cargo, escorting convoys, bounty hunting, or plundering and capturing enemy ships. Take sides in a civil war, or ignore the story line and just enjoy exploring the galaxy and blasting pirates. <br><br>The main story line takes about 8-16 hours to play through. The galaxy contains hundreds of star systems and planets, and several alien species with their own unique technologies. You can choose between more than fifty ships and several hundred ship upgrades. A plugin system allows anyone with a text editor and a paint program to create new ships, weapons, or missions, and the galaxy editor can be used to add new star systems and planets. <br><br>Endless Sky is free, open source, and cross platform (Windows, Mac, and Linux). Over time, the game universe will expand as contributors add new missions, story lines, alien species, places to explore, sound effects, and artwork.<br><br>For more information, please visit the website or read the player's manual.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/404410/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1706394306","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/404410/page.bg.jpg?t=1706394306","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/404410/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1706394306","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/404410/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1706394306","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Endless Sky is a 2D space trading and combat game inspired by the classic Escape Velocity series.
