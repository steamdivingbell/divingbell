The operation had two parts: Operation Olympic and Operation Coronet. Set to begin in November 1945, Operation Olympic was intended to capture the southern third of the southernmost main Japanese island, Ky\u016bsh\u016b, with the recently captured island of Okinawa to be used as a staging area. In early 1946 would follow Operation Coronet, the planned invasion of the Kant\u014d Plain, near Tokyo, on the main Japanese island of Honshu. Airbases on Ky\u016bsh\u016b captured in Operation Olympic, and possibly other captures on nearby Shikoku, would allow land-based air support for Operation Coronet.
