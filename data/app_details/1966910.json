Defeat creatures and gain power by using your (dog-like?) abilities: Biting, Barking, and Dashing. As you progress through waves the enemies get stronger but don't worry, as various items spawn to fuel your limitless dog-power. Each map has its own theme and setting belonging to a god. Arachne dwells deep within a creepy dungeon. Artemis arises from the ash, dust, and debris of a fallen ruin.
