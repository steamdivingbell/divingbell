With this new power, they were able to quickly sweep over the smaller nations of Arcadia along with its neighboring nations. <br> <br>Within a matter of months, Arcadia falls and becomes a puppet state to the seemingly unstoppable Vivica. With this, camps are built throughout the nation, where mass productions of these AI, formally known as 'Metalgeists', are being created to help pursue the war. <br> <br>But this mass production seems rather endless for something so complex. How did Vivica manage to get such a lead in Artificial Intelligence? What secrets are they hiding from everyone?  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3263220/extras/ArcadiaFlag_MP4.gif?t=1736896748\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Almost 2 years have passed now and we assume the role of a former Arcadian solider who Vivicans refer to as &quot;The Reaper&quot;. With the war still raging on as Vivica invades the bigger nation of Dorfrine, Reaper tries to find out more about himself whilst also trying to free the nation he abandoned. Or at least that's what he likes to believe. <br> <br>Through his journey he will run into many companions, people who are battling their own demons as they struggle to find light in all the chaos that is happening in this war. Will Reaper be able to unite with them to end the seemingly endless waves of Metalgeists, or will he potentially fall victim to them himself? </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3263220/extras/Ch03_010_MP4.gif?t=1736896748\" /><br>Much of the story depends on choices from the player.
