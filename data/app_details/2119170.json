We hope you like it!<br> Willy Abeel returns with <strong>Swimming through Sand to Sea: More Mounted Adventuring</strong> . You probably remember Willy's work from &quot;Jumping on Mounted Combat&quot; in ARCADIA 1. This article brings forth four new mounts known for their burrowing and swimming prowess: the axolottle,* the chuul, the bulette, and the juvenile purple worm. Plus, Willy created eight new magic items so you can take any mount out of its natural habitat and into a dank dungeon. MCDM's staff artist and art outsource manager, Nick De Spain, makes these mounts leap off the page.<br> <strong>The Chained Library</strong> from Cat Evans A new adventure location and organization that any GM can drop into their campaigns. Far from civilization, a cabal of mage librarians guards and studies tomes too dangerous for most mortal eyes. This article includes new magic items, creatures, NPCs, and story hooks to help you bring the Chained Library into your world. It includes art from Allie Briggs, Faizal Fikri, and Nick De Spain and maps by Miska Fredman.<br> <strong>On-the-Road Encounters</strong> \u00a0by game designer and cartographer Derek Ruiz Five encounters that you can drop into your game as the characters travel from one place to another. Combat, intrigue, and more can all happen on the road and bring your world to life. Art in this article comes from Kent Davis, Bruno Machado, and Elisa Serio.<br> *A giant axolotl. A regular axolotl is too little. You can't ride a little axolotl, you need a lotta axolotl.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2119170/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1664283954","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2119170/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1664283954","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2119170/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1664283954","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2119170/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1664283954","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Arcadia Issue 004 - May 2021</h2> Welcome to <strong>ARCADIA</strong> !
