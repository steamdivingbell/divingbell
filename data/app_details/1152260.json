{"about_the_game":"In active development since 2016, this is a first-person strategy game about summoning demons and herding them around like terrible cats to topple a civilization one castle at a time and finally become the new king, all on the orders of the guy who already did that and now spends his time making the people learn his tale.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game plays entirely in first-person as you re-live the Demonarch's story of conquest, which is why this game does not allow you to fight or build anything - he never did either, being too busy keeping demons happy and escorting them around. Demons don't take orders, of course, so your only way to lead a charge is by going in first. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour primary defense is the element of surprise - let news of your invasion escape and other towns will prepare. Let witnesses discover that YOU are the demon summoner and difficulty will increase everywhere that news reaches.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMade by a single disabled Army veteran over 8 years and counting, plus 49,000+ Eyes of the Tiger by Survivor. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYes, this game is developed by that one crazy guy who listens to the same song on loop while creating this game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1152260/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1723080566","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1152260/page.bg.jpg?t=1723080566","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1152260/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1723080566","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1152260/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1723080566","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Stats","id":15}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In active development since 2016, this is a first-person strategy game about summoning demons and herding them around like terrible cats to topple a civilization one castle at a time and finally become the new king, all on the orders of the guy who already did that and now spends his time making the people learn his tale.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game plays entirely in first-person as you re-live the Demonarch's story of conquest, which is why this game does not allow you to fight or build anything - he never did either, being too busy keeping demons happy and escorting them around.
