No trick is too dirty when you're preparing for The Final Confrontation. Only the hardest armor, the most powerful engine and the biggest guns will see you through the ultimate battle against The Adversary.<br><br>And when you feel you can't take it anymore, you can check out the underground market. Spiked bumpers, landmines, rocket fuel or sabotage can provide a way to create some nasty accidents for the competition.<br><br>Play alone or with friends!
