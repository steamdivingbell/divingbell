{"about_the_game":"Soul Machine is a pvp, turn-based, square-to-square, multiplayer game comparable to chess. After configuring the characteristics of your mecha, modifying its appearance at the same time, you will fight in 1 on 1 or as a team in procedurally generated arenas, in ranked or normal games. The experience gained during the fights will allow you to develop your skills in an innovative way: you will be able to choose among several modifications proposed randomly (&quot;increase of the range&quot;, &quot;push back the target&quot;, etc.). So you won't have to copy the best customizations offered by statistics websites or seasoned players as is the case with many competitive games, and you can therefore give free rein to your imagination and creativity. The very pronounced procedural aspect allows the constant addition of game mechanics and game modes, which constantly renews the game.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1449700?t=1608109785","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449700/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1608109785","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449700/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1608109785","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449700/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1608109785","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Soul Machine is a pvp, turn-based, square-to-square, multiplayer game comparable to chess.
