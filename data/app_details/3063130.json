{"about_the_game":"Welcome to <strong>Coconut</strong>, every two hours spin the mystical Coconut Wheel to receive a random coconut.

The excitement of the spin will keep you coming back for more!<br><br>But that's not all - each week some coconuts will be retired and will no longer be obtainable from the wheel. This means the coconuts you collect now will become even rarer over time, increasing their value and prestige. Don't miss your chance to build the most impressive coconut collection!<br><br>Coconut is lightweight, taking up less than 0.1 GB of space on your computer, and using under <strong>0.2% of your CPU</strong>. Plus, it can run in the background at all times, leaving your desktop free for any other activities!<br><br><strong>This is a community game, for the community!</strong> We welcome any and all suggestions through our Discord.
