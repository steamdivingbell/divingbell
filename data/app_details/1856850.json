{"about_the_game":"<strong>TukTuk</strong> is a 2D side-scroller which focuses on precise and unique platforming, and also on fighting. Having a steep learning curve, a fast-paced action-packed experience is established which gets more intense as your skill progresses.  <strong>TukTuk</strong> is designed primarily for experienced players, but non experienced players are taken by the hand through the struggles of <strong>TukTuk</strong>'s search for her mother.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ALL BECAUSE OF A ROCK...</h2><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1856850/extras/moonMp4-1.gif?t=1706297648\" /><br><br> <strong>TukTuk</strong> and her mother travel through space in different spaceships. Suddenly, a meteor hits the spaceship of <strong>TukTuk</strong>'s mother, and she has to do an emergency landing. <strong>TukTuk</strong> makes it her mission to find her mother. Is mom okay?

Especially after the first playthrough, the challenges and how the player chooses to tackle them become more open and offer the possibility to fly through the levels as you like. Every area is unique (if it's not a filler) and created so that the experience is always fresh and entertaining. Also, the camera embraces a very unique playstyle which has to be experienced in order to understand it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DO AS YOU PLEASE</h2><br><br>Besides the platforming, you will face enemies throughout your quest. The upgrading system will let you choose whether you want to focus on fighting, platforming or both and will let you decide on how you want to play the game.

When you are into difficult platforming, the late game will be just right for you. You can almost endlessly improve the stats of your character, but your skill is also always able to improve. This game is made for speedruns. It is a whole new experience when you try to go as fast as you can and the camera emphasizes this fast motion as well.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"I hope You wont end It here","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1856850/e46ac84a35c5fa96af93dbb402b6b3241cbcb4a8.jpg"},{"name":"Way to Easy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1856850/f6e29a2e73376d9cfa110c5a39d54e0c2f7baf28.jpg"},{"name":"Getting there...","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1856850/3fda4c5bc315aa9fe325eb6a436f21f7c4d1f0f6.jpg"},{"name":"Respect +","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1856850/dfbd729faf9992ec20982e05844212ad7ca71752.jpg"},{"name":"How the Hell did You do that?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1856850/7e04cf9a5d810aa2a3d2385a059d5516ffa693a7.jpg"},{"name":"I need Those.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1856850/1a2c9fbb3b1554676a497d40dc6ef329b162a614.jpg"},{"name":"Pacifist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1856850/d3d3462277678f613fd508235d342a0e71d7c173.jpg"},{"name":"Cheater","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1856850/42f57aa60331a434c7bc725f474fdbd3e6a7b800.jpg"},{"name":"Death to Me","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1856850/8a965e4b077e8dbe2be08f81921f6aa302b43fd7.jpg"},{"name":"Death to You","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1856850/92a334eaffd2e5eaeac493e259014c82b9d12737.jpg"}],"total":18},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1856850?t=1706297648","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1856850?t=1706297648","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1856850/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1706297648","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1856850/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1706297648","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"There is fighting and a tiny bit of blood ."},"detailed_description":"<strong>TukTuk</strong> is a 2D side-scroller which focuses on precise and unique platforming, and also on fighting.
