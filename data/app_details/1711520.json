How about combining all of them? Sure the marble can! Use all of the tricks to pass the challenges! The tips menu will also teach you how to perform the tricks, so you can learn them easily.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1711520/extras/GIF3.gif?t=1696329857\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Powerups and Surfaces</h2>Unique powerups can help the marble to cross various challenges: Super Jump gives an immediate height boost, and Super Speed gives an immediate speed boost.
