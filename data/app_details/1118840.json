{"about_the_game":"This is a novel with multiple plot lines, in which you only get to witness only a couple of days of a character who\u2019s name is You.

It\u2019s you and You facing inevitability.<br><br>This is you, and this \u2013 is You. Both of you have something in common \u2013 exceptionality in a monotonous moment of time, when meaningless decisions have to be made. Or meaningful, to such an extent, that there is nothing left once they are made. Who knows what awaits you around the corner \u2013 will you go to work in a continuous, 'almost-holiday' fever or wander in a labyrinth of crooked mirrors? Except for his name, it seems our character\u2019s life is nothing more than unexceptional \u2013 there\u2019s no room for miracles or cobwebs. The room is filled with office papers, some vaguely familiar family members, an ailing story of sensation, a couple of dropped lines and a sharp drop \u2013 a circle, inside and outside of which you and You wander.
