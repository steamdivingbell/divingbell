{"about_the_game":"<strong>SwordBounce</strong> is a linear pixel art <strong>puzzle platformer</strong> in which you find a mystical sword you can use to <strong>bounce on the obstacles in your path</strong>. Spike Traps and Bullets that would decimate an average explorer in an instant are no match for the sword's bouncing capabilities! You'll also find upgrades to the sword that make it even more useful when exploring and solving puzzles. The <strong>finely-tuned precision platforming</strong> makes conquering the unknown feel fair, yet challenging.
