Prices fluctuate based on real-time supply and demand, with no pre-defined values.<br><br><strong>Production:</strong> Drive the game's economy by creating and managing your own company. Invest in research and development to boost your corporation's output and become the biggest player in the economy.<br><br><strong>No hand-holding, No guardrails:</strong> Make any decision, even if it leads to the collapse of the in-game world. For example, if you're the sole producer of a crucial industrial good like computer chips and you decide to halt production, the economy will likely crash.<br><br><strong>Consumer markets:</strong> Navigate a competitive marketplace where companies sell directly to consumers. Establish a brand and dominate the market by attracting consumer dollars away from competitors.<br><br><strong>Shareholders:</strong> In game companies can be public or private and you can own shares in them. By making right investments you can become rich without ever managing a company. <br><br><strong>Regulations and laws:</strong> You can change the rules of the game by lobbying and influencing the politics, thus you are free to do regulatory capture and tip the scales in your favor.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Before you buy</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The game will not contain 3d graphics. 2d images will be very limited.
