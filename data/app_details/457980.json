It was tough, but I enjoyed it.\u201d<br>Higher Eclectic Ground<br><br>\u201cQuestion: On a lighter note, which member of your team do you think would have the best odds of surviving a real zombie apocalypse? Why?  Answer: None of us! We are just a bunch of geeks with zero survival skills. Getting us off our computer screens would be scary enough to give any of us a heart attack.\u201d<br>Greenlight Games<br><br>\u201cAfter playing Adele for a while, you might have a strange sensation of a Tim Burton universe, mainly because of the skinny animated characters and the dark colors of the game. However, the surrounding world and plot are far from that. The odd, macabre background almost wants you to pause for a while to look into the never-ending horizon. Hat\u2019s off to the artists for achieving that.
