{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">After a record breaking nap spanning several millennia, Kent finds himself in the year 10.000 with nothing but a stick and a very matter-of-fact robot companion. Tired, hungry and still employed he will need to explore the unknown in order to craft the machines that will turn his broken space module into a self-sufficient base of operations. And maybe kickstart civilization again, if he has the time.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2165140/extras/Title_EXPLORE.png?t=1734972120\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Discover the wonders and the oddities of a vast, ever-changing world filled to the brim with quirky fauna, flora and climate events.
