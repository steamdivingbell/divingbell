{"about_the_game":"The Perfect Tower is an idle strategy game that puts your tower defense and resource management skills to the test. As waves of enemies relentlessly approach, your task is to defend your tower by upgrading a variety of enhancements. Destroyed enemies yield resources that can be used to enhance town buildings, discover new technologies, and improve your tower. Although your progress within the tower testing segment resets upon the destruction of your tower, the town acts as a persistent hub where you can permanently enhance and upgrade your tower. These improvements empower you to tackle higher waves during subsequent tower testing sessions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Development Process</h2>The #4 idle game on Kongregate is coming to Steam and you can be part of the journey!<br>The Perfect Tower was originally released in 2016 on Kongregate and was the first game to combine the theme of tower defense with incremental mechanics.<br>Following its initial release, the game continued to be developed in close collaboration with the community.
