{"about_the_game":"In Astral Disorder, you are the lone maintenance worker on an unkempt space train station. The facility has become mostly automated, decreasing the need for human workers. As the last remaining utility expert, your state-of-the-art equipment and tools used for navigation and repairs are strewn about the chaotic facility. After a devastating crash causing the station to start running on backup power, a monstrous entity unleashed by the crash starts its relentless pursuit. Your mission is clear: find a means of escape before this horrible beast overtakes you. <br><br>This is a first-person game where the player will be avoiding a monster by using a variety of mobility abilities and intelligent tactics to get to places where it cannot reach. The player will explore the station looking for items or new abilities to help them reach their goal, an escape pod to escape from the creature. With the station in backup power, traditional methods of navigating the station are unavailable and the player must find access cards, vents, or reroute the backup power to doors to facilitate their escape.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2>    <ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Relentless Pursuit:</strong> A beast relentlessly tracking your every move forces you to keep on the move and utilize all your tools and cunning to keep ahead of it. <br>    </li><li><strong>Dynamic Navigation:</strong> Navigate the varied environments within the space station with a variety of navigation methods to evade the monster including sliding, grappling, and wall-running. <br>    </li><li><strong>Mind-Bending Puzzles:</strong> Solve complex puzzles and obstacles by thinking quickly and strategically to reach new equipment and paths, all while ensuring the monster can't catch up. <br>    </li><li><strong>Destructible Environment:</strong> A destructible environment to open up new avenues of escape, but beware as new paths for you mean new paths for the monster to corner you.</li></ul>","achievements":{"total":0},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2866580/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1715116233","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2866580/page.bg.jpg?t=1715116233","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2866580/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1715116233","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2866580/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1715116233","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In Astral Disorder, you are the lone maintenance worker on an unkempt space train station.
