{"about_the_game":"In 2015, Vladimir Putin received a call from  aliens, who said they would destroy the Earth. We didn't have to wait for help from the West, because they were rotten. Therefore, Putin was not confused, and together with loyal friends punished the aliens in full!<br />\r\nNow, in 2020, it's time for the final battle! Between stability and surprise, between the sun of all Russia V. V. Putin and God-fearing Aliens! In space! <br />\r\nIn the game you will learn the secret of the origin of aliens, as well as get a unique gaming experience, because the game consists of four parts: Arcade, Strategy, RPG and, of course, Putin!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game has been developed for more than 5 years, so we had the opportunity to carefully study each genre in which the game takes place. For example, in the strategic element of the game, you can control a fleet of spaceships that interact closely with each other in real time. In the RPG part of the game, you will find yourself in a whole living fantasy world that lives by its own laws. You will be able to learn different professions, perform non-linear tasks, observe the change of the daily cycle and the reaction of the NPC to your actions. The arcade part of the game is smoothly intertwined with dialog inserts, where you can make decisions that affect the further development of the plot. When developing the game, we realized that it would not be like other games, and we hope that this approach will be interesting for you.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1404240/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1599045113","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1404240/page.bg.jpg?t=1599045113","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1404240/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1599045113","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1404240/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1599045113","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In 2015, Vladimir Putin received a call from  aliens, who said they would destroy the Earth.
