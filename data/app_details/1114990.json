This means that combat can be planned, and your battle plans can be thought of in terms of facts and not praying on rolls. Every unit will do it's precise amount of damage, and every unit will take it's precise amount of damage. There are no excuses to loss in this game, if you lose, it means you got outplayed.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">$ave Dat Money</h2>This game doesn't feature Fetty Wap, but it does feature an in-game economy. In order to get units, buildings, and upgrades you'll have manage your in game economy and buy them. This means you'll have to be smart in considering what units or buildings to buy, when to buy them, and sometimes making a hard choice between two options. Each player starts each game with the same income-per-turn, but it can be increased with the purchase of Supply Pads.
