{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SLAY THE WORLD</h2>It's the End of the World. A series of natural disasters have been set in motion that will wipe out the world of man in a few short days. Time enough to test your wits and skill against the madness. Build a deck before and during a run, upgrading cards to face the challenges present in each stage. Every enemy poses a different threat, with multiple attack types and maneuvers. Defeat is only a setback - your progress in each run provides you with the means to improve your deck going forward. This is the deckbuilding roguelite for adults.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2951940/extras/Annuit_Coeptis_Card_Attacks_GIF.gif?t=1720192886\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FIGHT OR DIE</h2>Fast-paced card combat against a wide variety of foes. Use your attacks strategically to defeat enemies. Anticipate their actions to minimize the damage you take - to prologue your inevitable death? Or, perhaps, to win.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GROW AND EVOLVE</h2>During a run you will have opportunities to expand and customize your deck. Add new cards for stronger attacks and to gain new options in combat. Each individual card may be upgraded as well, choosing from a variety of effects including buffs and attack damage.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LEARN AND MASTER</h2>Between runs you can spend Useless Trinkets obtained during previous runs to unlock better cards. You may also lock away cards you no longer wish to appear in your deck. In this way, you can craft the deck you start each run with to your own style and approach while increasing in power to make it further with each playthrough.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EXPLORE AND CONQUER</h2>The land of Zoryavia is a fully-realized dark fantasy kingdom. As you cut a bloody swathe through the country, you will witness firsthand the breakdown of society and the crumbling of order. You will collect various discarded items, each with a story to tell about the world, its past, and its people. You may also learn of darker things unknown to men - the old gods and beasts that dwell beneath the earth. Will you be strong enough to reach the source of the calamities? Only time will tell.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Did Not Immediately Die","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2951940/683535aac052ee973f68eb77550fd992bb6dd6bb.jpg"},{"name":"FALLEN","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2951940/5392e140bcfec5b05297c42e373b51c29d3fdbab.jpg"},{"name":"FORGOTTEN","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2951940/f4c115fba2ab5b1559543d65736eae240e1945ed.jpg"},{"name":"CUT OFF","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2951940/7e92fb52fd7206f94d36979fe2df46b63cd44673.jpg"}],"total":4},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2951940/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1720192886","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2951940/page.bg.jpg?t=1720192886","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2951940/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1720192886","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2951940/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1720192886","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Implied violence and horror.
