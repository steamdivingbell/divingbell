{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Overview</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">&quot;Surveillance Work&quot; is a horror spot-the-difference game where you monitor surveillance camera footage  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">to discover and report anomalies. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There are two things you do: </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- Monitor by switching between multiple surveillance cameras installed in the facility. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- Report any anomalies you find. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There are two

the anomaly. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Anomalies can range from objects increasing, disappearing, or moving. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Some anomalies may interfere with surveillance systems such as surveillance cameras and reports,  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">or may attempt to destroy surveillance cameras, so a calm response is required. </p><p
