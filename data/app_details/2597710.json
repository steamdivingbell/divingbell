{"about_the_game":"Embark on an exhilarating adventure as a rugged veteran in the driver's seat of a battle-worn vehicle that's seen better days, yet harbors a heart of steel. This isn't just any decrepit car \u2014 it's a roaring beast equipped with a formidable tank cannon and a high-powered jetpack, ready to defy both age and gravity.<br />\r\nJourney through a procedurally generated world that unfurls new challenges and vistas with each play through.<br />\r\nUnleash chaos as you obliterate obstacles in your path, transforming your once humble vehicle into a powerhouse of destruction with a plethora of upgrades awaiting to be discovered. Flex your strategic muscles as you decide whether to obliterate your enemies in a rain of cannon fire or soar to new heights to reach previously inaccessible areas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince Unity is now fucked up, I decided to semi cancel this game.<br />\r\nNow it will be completely free, so they don't make any money from it.<br />\r\nBut now the game will be only 1 level long. I might continue the project and 100% complete it if I don't have anything better to do with my life, but now I'll probably start a new game on UE5 or Godot","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2597710/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1695899401","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2597710/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1695899401","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2597710/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1695899401","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2597710/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1695899401","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Embark on an exhilarating adventure as a rugged veteran in the driver's seat of a battle-worn vehicle that's seen better days, yet harbors a heart of steel.
