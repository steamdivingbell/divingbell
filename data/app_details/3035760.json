{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Live. Die. Rise Again.</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">RogueLiteOnline is a multiplayer roguelite MMORPG where every step is a calculated risk. Featuring open-world PvP, dangerous dungeons, and a high-stakes loot system, only the strong - or the clever - will thrive. Will you fight alongside allies, betray fellow adventurers, or fall victim to a cutthroat world where death has real consequences?</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Your Journey, Your Struggle, Nothing Else</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">RogueLiteOnline is free to play up to Level 20, allowing players to experience its core mechanics before committing. After that, a flat subscription fee grants full access - no cash shops, no microtransactions, and no paid expansions. Every dungeon, every update, and every piece of future content is included at no extra cost. The only thing separating players is their skill, knowledge, and willingness to risk it all.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Ruthless World Where Death Has Meaning</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The overworld is a PvP-enabled warzone, where chance encounters can lead to alliances, betrayals, or ambushes. But beware: killing another player has its own risks. Guard forces in every major city hunt PKers on sight, making safe zones anything but safe for the wanted. For those who seek structured combat, sanctioned arenas provide a proving ground for warriors and guilds alike.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Loot or Be Looted</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Most MMORPGs let you hoard loot with no real risk - but RogueLiteOnline changes the game. Upon death, you drop everything - unless you've secured it in a rare and valuable bag that retains its contents. Will you risk everything for the perfect gear, or stash your treasures before heading into the unknown?</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dungeons: The True Test of Strength</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The heart of RogueLiteOnline lies within its handcrafted dungeons, filled with brutal bosses, intricate puzzles, and unforgiving combat. While the overworld is dangerous, dungeons are lethal - each one offering a limited number of lives per run. If your party is wiped out, you leave with nothing. Before prestige levels, quests will guide your journey, but once you've completed them, dungeon grinding becomes your primary path to power.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Four Classes, Infinite Strategy</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Mage - Unleash arcane destruction from afar.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Warrior - Strike hard, endure harder.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Paladin - A stalward defender with healing prowess.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Rogue - Swift, deadly, and always one step ahead.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each class comes with a variety of skills, letting you customize your playstyle for solo survival or synergized group play.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Survive Together or Die Alone</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">While solo adventurers may carve their own legend, strength lies in numbers. With guilds, party mechanics, and coordinated PvP battles, forming alliances is the key to survival. Will you forge a powerful guild and control the battlefield, or wander alone, testing your fate against an unpredictable world?</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Living World, Always Expanding</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The world of RogueLiteOnline will continue to grow with expansions, new dungeons, and evolving mechanics. Expect more challenging raids, new zones, and ever-changing PvP battlegrounds in the future. The adventure never ends.</p>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3035760?t=1740070165","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3035760/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1740070165","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3035760/46796fdf9b5899ccc3c1efb7b85bf7f0c95504e3/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1740070165","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3035760/46796fdf9b5899ccc3c1efb7b85bf7f0c95504e3/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1740070165","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Live.
