Journey to New Atlantis will lead the player through encounters like jumping off skyscrapers buried in the sand with a dune buggy, walk through a gigantic spaceship that has crashed through a mountain, and outrun men dressed in armadillo armor made from salvaged scrap metal. Each encounter will feature puzzles that focus on logic skills appropriate for the age range, as the game has received extensive consulting from a child and family development specialist.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1211320/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1578330980","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1211320/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1578330980","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1211320/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1578330980","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1211320/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1578330980","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Journey to New Atlantis is a post-apocalyptic adventure game that follows Lana and her friend Marco in their quest to find water for Lana\u2019s ill grandfather, in a world almost completely dried up.
