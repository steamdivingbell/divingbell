{"about_the_game":"&quot;Pathfinder 2 RPG - Pathfinder Society Quest #8: Shadows of the Black Sovereign<br> <br> A Pathfinder Society Quest designed for levels 3-6 (subtiers 3-4 and 5-6). <br> On the edge of the land known as Numeria, the Pathfinder Society has operated in secret under threat of death from the region's ruler, the cruel Black Sovereign. Venture-Captain Dagur Hawksight hopes that a meeting with the recently-sober monarch will allow the Pathfinder Society to operate openly and study the alien technology contained within Numeria's borders, but other forces have their own plans for the region. The PCs must ensure that the meeting between Dagur and the Black Sovereign goes off without a hitch, thwarting acts of treachery and sabotage. <br> Written by: Alexandria Bustion <br> <br><strong> Scenario tags:</strong> None <br>  This product is not a PDF or accessible outside of Fantasy Grounds.
