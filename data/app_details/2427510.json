{"about_the_game":"Thetawave is a physics-based space shooter with procedurally generated levels that ensure a new experience with each playthrough. The game includes a variety of enemies and characters, each designed to suit different playstyles. What sets Thetawave apart is its unique use of physics to create chain reactions among enemies. By understanding and exploiting the momentum and interactions between foes, players can cause them to collide and destroy each other. This adds an extra layer of strategy to the gameplay and challenges players to think creatively. Thetawave offers a blend of engaging mechanics that appeals to those looking for an inventive twist on the traditional space shooter.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2427510/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727414354","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2427510/page.bg.jpg?t=1727414354","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2427510/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727414354","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2427510/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727414354","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Thetawave is a physics-based space shooter with procedurally generated levels that ensure a new experience with each playthrough.
