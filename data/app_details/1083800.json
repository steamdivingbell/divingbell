{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Glitch, a fast and minimal arena first person shooter.</h2><br>Influenced by Quake and Unreal Tournament, Glitch is a classic old school shooter designed to encapsulate what makes AFPS great, and leave out what doesn't. <br><br>Gamemodes include duel, DM, TDM, Hoonymode and the new CTB (capture the balls, an evolution of CTF). <br><br>The focus is on gameplay and content instead of high fidelity details. Movement is non-linear, with an initial flick-dodge, step jumping (aka double jumping) and speed building via 'glitching'\u2122. Air control is medium-high and autojumping is a thing. Weapons are the &quot;holy trinity&quot; plus a shotgun starting weapon, and the ability to combo a rocket with rail. Maps are iconic archetypes of the genre. Hitsounds and hitmarkers on the way. Learn the game with HUD item timers.<br><br>Is this a dead game? Of course it's a dead game! It was designed to by played by 2-4 people: you and a friend or three. If you are looking for games with random people on the internet, this is not for you. You don't need a thousand concurrent players for a good time.<br><br>If you really love AFPS or want to try something new, grab a copy and join us in discord to find an opponent (linked from the game homescreen).","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1083800/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1665654713","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1083800/page.bg.jpg?t=1665654713","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1083800/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1665654713","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1083800/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1665654713","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Glitch, a fast and minimal arena first person shooter.</h2><br>Influenced by Quake and Unreal Tournament, Glitch is a classic old school shooter designed to encapsulate what makes AFPS great, and leave out what doesn't. <br><br>Gamemodes include duel, DM, TDM, Hoonymode and the new CTB (capture the balls, an evolution of CTF). <br><br>The focus is on gameplay and content instead of high fidelity details.
