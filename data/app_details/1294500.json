{"about_the_game":"Undead Can Dance is a dancing battle game in virtual reality where you compete against other sorcerers in taking control of the dead through rhythm, power and accuracy.  Once an undead is in your possession, it will start dancing for you, sweating and jostling on the dancefloor while boosting your score. You can't dance? Just pretend!  It\u2019s light-hearted yet intense and fun.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ONLINE BATTLES</h2>Undead can Dance is built from the ground up to offer a tailored, solid and fun multiplayer experience along with a single-player mode.
