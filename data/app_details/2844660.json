A group of vigilantes has created a darknet company offering corporate espionage services to other companies.

The remaining missions - due to their difficulty - require additional planning. This planning is crowdsourced - software is made available to a group of hand-picked participants all around the world. Using this software is like playing a video game - participants make their decisions in simulated scenarios. These decisions are then collected, analyzed and may eventually contribute to the planning of a corporate espionage mission.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You have been invited to participate.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each mission is set in the office/IT section of a building, a few hours after midnight.

As you proceed through the environment, it is important to remember that everything you interact with may set off your opponents, and they will investigate. To keep things interesting, sometimes they might even do something unexpected.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">To get you out of tough situations, you are given a tool that you will in time regard as your most valuable companion - a device that is capable of emitting strong light rays and targeted sound pulses, and is therefore guaranteed to create powerful distractions for your opponents at the location of your choice - assuming you have a direct line of sight to that location.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The missions are strictly non-lethal, even remaining hidden is not worth the cost.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">To facilitate experimentation, the software includes the &quot;Timeline&quot; feature - a way to quickly create and restore save points at any time, allowing different approaches to be attempted for the entire duration of the mission.
