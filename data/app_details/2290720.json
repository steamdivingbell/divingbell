{"about_the_game":"&quot;Starfinder RPG - Starfinder Adventure Path #48: Masters of Time and Space (Drift Crashers 3 of 3)<br> <br>  <strong> It's all connected!</strong> The crew of the Primorata have arrived at the Tesseract, a colossal four-dimensional structure built by mysterious aliens and hidden in the Drift. Somewhere deep inside this puzzling maze lies the secret to preventing galactic catastrophe. But the heroes aren't the only survivors who prowl the never-ending corridors and bizarre architecture of this ancient, ruined megastructure, and their nemesis Malacanta is hot on their heels... with a legion of soldiers straight from Hell itself!Masters of Time and Space is a Starfinder adventure that brings the 3-volume Drift Crashers Adventure Path to an exciting conclusion. Written by Ron Lundeen for four 5th-level characters, Drift Crashers is part of the Drift Crisis, an event taking place across the entire Starfinder game line; in the Drift Crisis, faster-than-light travel breaks down and the galaxy is thrown into chaos. In addition to the adventure itself, this book includes support for continuing the campaign beyond the events of the Adventure Path, along with an Adventure Toolbox filled with new rule options and strange alien creatures.
