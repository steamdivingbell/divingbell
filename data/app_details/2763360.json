Is how ultra fast the AI's returns are being sent back at the real players, and so, I expect to be practicing alot before beating the Legendary Sim Champs in the Trials mode! It's fast, it seems unrealistic, but professional, Olympic level Ping-Pong players are really that fast! Thankz for the level of challenging you've imbued into the gameplay's metrics! On 2nd thought, the returned shots sound more like: pingPingpingPing..! Nice job Dev! (2021)\u201d<br>4.8/5.0 \u2013 Google Play<br><br>\u201cPhysics are awesome! The physics in this game are truly impressive. I really felt like I could control the direction of the ball. I think that the paddle implementation was great, too. I didn\u2019t feel that using my fingers hurt the experience at all.  With that being said, I wish the AI had more personalization to them, such as specialized paddles or something unique to each of the opponents!  Keep up the good work!
