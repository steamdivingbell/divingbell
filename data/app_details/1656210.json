{"about_the_game":"Cats, Crime &amp; Comedy, delivered in a stylish, old school point n' click fashion! The first episode of a potential series by L. E. Mercer at Gui Zen Games!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the charming little town of Fort West - recent recipient of the 'City That Clearly Has The Lowest Rate of Crime In Recent Memory' award - a dark and not in any way foreseen tide of lawlessness is rumbling beneath the streets! Late at night, one of the town's citizens is murdered in cold blood! In a time when the local cops suspiciously underplay the incident, only one man - our lovable, bumbling everyguy Herbie - has the clinical insanity necessary to take the law into his own hands and fight the tides of corruption that threaten the town which TourAdvisor once called 'just the nicest place you could ever think of!'<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJoin Herbie and his crime fighting, alley hoppin' kitty Katt LeChatt as they... lounge around their house looking for Herbie's keys. Where the hell did he put them? I swear, you would lose your head if it wasn't attached! Well, crime fighting is certainly a priority, but first please join us in the slice of life comic book adventure game, 'The Adventures of Herbie &amp; Katt LeChatt'. This game is the first episode in a hypothetical series, and is designed to introduce you to the world, characters and sensibilities of Herbie &amp; Katt! Experience the cinematic comic book cutscenes and environments, and indulge yourself in conversations with a few old friends, all while jammin' out to some groovy tunes. And while you're at it, you may as well have a laugh.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nApprox. playing time - 1-3 hours.<br />\r\nReminder: This is only the introductory episode, and it is priced to reflect a culture that is willing to spend $5 on a cup of coffee or comic book.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUpdate - September 2022 - A message to our players, past and potential, that further episodes of The Adventures of Herbie &amp; Katt LeChatt have been discontinued. I'm sorry if this is disappointing to anybody in particular, and yet I remain grateful to anyone who enjoyed the game or is thinking of still giving it a try (you should, it's really fun). As a solo dev, it would simply take too many years to create the full game I had in mind and I would rather be spending that time designing a game I feel more passionate about. I have reduced the price to $3 before tax, roughly the price of a large slurpee (and just as enjoyable!), as the amount of work and time I put in this episode, in my humble opinion, deserves it. I'm still proud of this! But the game series that I truly want to make is going to be much better, something I feel that making Herbie has made possible. Keep an eye on Gui Zen Studios for news of our upcoming saga to be announced at a future date. Thank you to everybody who took a chance on this game, a labour of love even if discontinued. It's been a real joy to experience this process and I look forward to even bigger things in the future :)","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1656210/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1663448610","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1656210/page.bg.jpg?t=1663448610","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1656210/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1663448610","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1656210/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1663448610","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Mild cartoon gang violence\r\nSubtle sexual humor\r\nMild references to drugs and alcohol\r\nMild profanity"},"detailed_description":"Cats, Crime &amp; Comedy, delivered in a stylish, old school point n' click fashion!
