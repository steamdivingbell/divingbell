Play as the titular Clam Man and uncover a secret lurking in the basement of Snacky Bay Prime Mayonnaise that will change the course of your life! Do quests, get jokes, and do stand-up!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE GAME JUDGES WHO YOU ARE</h2>Seven different stats dictate your abilities and your path through quests and conversations;<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Aquadynamics</strong> - your ability to perform physically!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Improv</strong> - your ability to think on the spot, be strange and absurd, or come up with new takes or ideas!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Detection</strong> - your ability to perceive the world and use logic to understand it! </li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Assertion</strong> - your ability to tell people off and convince them that you're right!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Deadpan</strong> - your ability to keep your cool and lie!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Luck</strong> - I had to put this in here and now everyone specs all their points into Luck</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Self-Awareness</strong> - your ability to empathise with others and yourself (or not)!</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TONS OF DIALOGUE</h2>If you're averse to lots of reading, this might get tricky - Clam Man 2 has a LOT of branching dialogue, offering tons of replayability! Dialogues also feature tons of static skill checks that only unlock with the right stats; if a conversation only has a couple of available response options, chances are that other outcomes and absurdities hide behind a different character build!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GATHER MATERIALS</h2>In order to do stand-up, you need jokes! In Clam Man 2, quests are character-based with choices to be made and errands to be run, and finishing a quest rewards you with material you can use in your shows! Every quest has multiple endings, and depending on your choices, the resulting joke loot will change, and it's impossible to see even half of all the jokes in a single playthrough!<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1278380/extras/ezgif.com-resize_(2).gif?t=1737785902\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GET ON STAGE</h2>Each joke you receive from quests will measure your abilities, with classic RPG dice rolls. High stats and the right joke makes all the difference! Succeeding will give you multiple options of where you want to take the joke, and even failing will allow you to choose your destiny in a spiraling maelstrom of stuttering, awkwardness, and pure bad taste. <i>Will you land every joke, or will you bomb your way through your shows?</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">NO FIGHTING</h2>Clam Man 2 is a narrative RPG, with zero combat! (Apart from a part where you can slap a guy in the face.) Similarly, failure is always a valid path forward in the game; you won't get locked out of anything, you'll just get a different outcome, different quest, or different story!<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1278380/extras/ezgif.com-resize.gif?t=1737785902\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS</h2>Clam Man 2 is being developed by a solo developer who is extremely tired because making this is too much work.
