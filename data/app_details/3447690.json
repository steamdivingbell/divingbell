In this game, you'll dig your way to success despite the bans and threats.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The life of your character is not going well: his wife left him for the neighbor because he has no job and no money, and his house is empty. However, one day, the main character decides to change his life. In the game world, there is a strict ban on digging on your own property \u2014 all underground resources belong to the state since someone found treasure buried beneath the ground. But our hero decides to find this treasure and regain his status.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can dig endlessly in your backyard, exploring different layers of soil to find valuable resources and useful items such as furniture for your house, accessories, metals, jewels, and much more. Everything you find can be sold to earn money and improve your home, making it a cozy place to live. The more you dig, the better your life becomes, and the more you surpass your neighbor who lives nearby.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">However, your neighbor isn't that simple. He constantly spies on you and might call the police if he notices anything suspicious. The police come regularly to check if you\u2019ve been digging, and if they find any traces, you\u2019ll be in big trouble. You\u2019ll have to use your wits and various tools to hide your actions and conceal the dug holes from prying eyes. To do so, you can use camouflage carpets, upgrade your digging tools, and employ other tricks.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Throughout the game, you\u2019ll be able to improve your tools, starting with simple shovels and pickaxes and advancing to powerful mechanical devices like drills or dynamite. You\u2019ll also have access to various bombs and even guard dogs to protect you from the pesky neighbor.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Game Features:</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Big Underground world:</strong> Dig up the ground, find useful resources, improve your house, and outshine your neighbor.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Caves:</strong> Explore the abandoned caves beneath your home and discover even more resources by completing challenges inside them.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Strategy and stealth:</strong> Hide your holes to avoid being detected by the police and the neighbor.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Variety of tools:</strong> Upgrade your digging tools, from simple shovels to advanced machines.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Defense against the neighbor:</strong> Use dogs, bombs, and other means to protect your territory.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Cute graphics:</strong> The stylish and bright graphics give the game a unique charm and atmosphere.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Up to 5 players cooperative:</strong> Play with your friends in a company of up to 5 people.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3447690/extras/Up5Steam.gif?t=1739263103\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In <strong>iDigging</strong>, you\u2019ll balance treasure hunting, home improvement, and the strategy of hiding from curious neighbors and authorities.
