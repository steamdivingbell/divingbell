{"about_the_game":"<strong>A FPS WITH FIGHTING GAME MECHANICS</strong><br><br>Use classic fighting game mechanics like parries, ducking and sidestepping attacks, melee combos/air juggles, meter for super attacks, etc. in a first person shooter game mode, combining precise long range combat of shooting games with crazy close range combat of fighting games.<br><br><strong>ITS ALL ABOUT THE METER</strong><br><br>Your meter gets filled when you deal damage, gets kills, etc. Once your meter is full you win but that's not all. You can use your meter to unleash powerful moves, if the moves land you get overwhelming advantage but if they miss you waste your meter. Its all about that meter.<br><br><strong>RAGE</strong><br><br>Low on health? Your opponent would be more worried than you because a player on low health gains access to rage, making that player a much bigger threat on low health. In rage, you become fast, small and explosive so taking out your opponent is a piece of cake.<br><br><strong>ONLINE AND OFFLINE MULTIPLAYER</strong><br><br>You can play online with up to 8 players and offline with splitscreen for 2 players.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1978090/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1719215362","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1978090/page.bg.jpg?t=1719215362","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1978090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1719215362","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1978090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1719215362","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>A FPS WITH FIGHTING GAME MECHANICS</strong><br><br>Use classic fighting game mechanics like parries, ducking and sidestepping attacks, melee combos/air juggles, meter for super attacks, etc. in a first person shooter game mode, combining precise long range combat of shooting games with crazy close range combat of fighting games.<br><br><strong>ITS ALL ABOUT THE METER</strong><br><br>Your meter gets filled when you deal damage, gets kills, etc. Once your meter is full you win but that's not all.
