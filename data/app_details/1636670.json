{"about_the_game":"Purchase the <strong>Tank Quest OST</strong> for access to the game's full soundtrack, at high definition. This soundtrack is composed by <strong>David Eshuis</strong>.<br><br>The Tank Quest soundtrack includes original tracks for each level in the game, as well as some menu and trailer tracks. The genre is quite experimental and each track gives a unique feeling as they fit the various different environments throughout the world. There are <strong>14 tracks</strong> in the album and they follow the game in order starting from the first trailer music, to the menu music, and then from the first in-game level to the last one. Most of the tracks are quite high energy, and make for a good listen when you need to get amped up. There are many different instruments used for each song, but a main theme is the use of a strong beat with deep bass. The whole album lasts for a <strong>total of 40 minutes</strong> of play time.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1636670/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1624557771","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1636670/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1624557771","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1636670/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1624557771","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1636670/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1624557771","categories":[{"description":"Additional High-Quality Audio","id":50}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Purchase the <strong>Tank Quest OST</strong> for access to the game's full soundtrack, at high definition.
