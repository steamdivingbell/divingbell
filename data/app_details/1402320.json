{"about_the_game":"Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond is an action-packed, immersive VR experience set in World War II, where you step into the boots of an agent of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in war-torn Europe. A deep single-player campaign bursting with authentic detail takes you through historic events on land, air, and sea, sabotaging Nazi bases, subverting enemy plans, aiding the French Resistance, and partaking in the biggest moments of the war.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nIn addition to the rich narrative campaign, you'll be able to hone your skills in challenging combat exercises and go deeper into the history with award-winning short films created just for the game.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nYou'll need more than good aim to succeed in your mission. Use anything in the world as cover, throw back enemy grenades, swim from sinking ships, and dive out of burning airplanes. You'll have to stay on your toes if you want to make it out alive. You're not watching history, you're experiencing it, like never before.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"One Shot One Kill","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1402320/5b91168fe7fe82fc1b14d47f56b48b9d5e47b56c.jpg"},{"name":"See You Too","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1402320/20aeaf4989f5f2b42a892623c0491f3e1e6ece73.jpg"},{"name":"Pugilist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1402320/8bf858bdbe8b64749f917c8ceadf08a6bbb35af1.jpg"},{"name":"Vinyl Enthusiast","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1402320/350959643cc9b99b48642e0ad5c858dfb4e963fa.jpg"},{"name":"Turingery","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1402320/8ec9a87672699458a9428cbd8f2e07f3e02202a0.jpg"},{"name":"Who Has Two Thumbs And Sunk A U-boat","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1402320/5b91168fe7fe82fc1b14d47f56b48b9d5e47b56c.jpg"},{"name":"Barrels Of Fun","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1402320/8bf858bdbe8b64749f917c8ceadf08a6bbb35af1.jpg"},{"name":"Masher Smasher ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1402320/8bf858bdbe8b64749f917c8ceadf08a6bbb35af1.jpg"},{"name":"Get to the Point","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1402320/8bf858bdbe8b64749f917c8ceadf08a6bbb35af1.jpg"},{"name":"Earned Your Stripes","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1402320/73dc1e68aa195f2040d3000334e65607ae0c47cf.jpg"}],"total":80},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1402320?t=1701470786","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1402320/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1701470786","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1402320/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1701470786","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1402320/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1701470786","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond is an action-packed, immersive VR experience set in World War II, where you step into the boots of an agent of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in war-torn Europe.
