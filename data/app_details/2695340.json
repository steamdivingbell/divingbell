{"about_the_game":"This DLC is free for all owners of 3DMark and includes two benchmarks: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Steel Nomad<br></li><li>Steel Nomad Light  </li></ul><br><strong>3DMark Steel Nomad</strong> is a cross-platform, non-raytraced benchmark for high-end gaming PCs and Macs. It uses the DirectX 12 API on Windows. <br><strong>3DMark Steel Nomad Light</strong> is designed for lightweight PCs. It\u2019s a lighter version of Steel Nomad, also using DirectX 12 on Windows. <br><br>Steel Nomad uses graphics technologies just like your favorite new game titles to give you a good idea of how your system will run the latest heavy PC games. Succeeding the massively popular 3DMark Time Spy benchmark, Steel Nomad runs at a 4k resolution and adds new graphics technologies like volumetric skies and procedural grass. New implementations of graphics techniques such as volume illumination, ambient occlusion, and depth-of-field makes the sun-scorched setting of Steel Nomad display some of the best PC benchmarking visuals to date, especially with HDR enabled.<br><br>Set at night, with the desert basin flooded by a vast lake, Steel Nomad Light is more accessible for lightweight and portable systems, lowering the resolution to 1440p and removing or reducing the most demanding graphical techniques used in Steel Nomad. <br><br><strong>Steel Nomad Stress Test</strong><br>The Steel Nomad stress test lets you easily find out how your PC\u2019s gaming performance may change over longer gaming sessions. Stress tests run for 20 minutes to give time for a typical system\u2019s component temperatures to stabilize. You\u2019ll want to make sure your device hasn\u2019t been running any benchmarks or games before you start the stress test to prevent heat from previous tasks affecting your run, though. <br><br>Stress tests give you a score for how consistent your frame rate was, and graphs showing how component frequencies and system temperatures changed during the test. Using these results can help identify whether your system performance is being throttled and help you identify potential causes such as inadequate cooling. <br><br><strong>Explorer Mode</strong><br>Explorer mode lets you freely explore the benchmark scene. Change benchmark graphics settings to find how different techniques affect visuals, tweak camera settings to create the perfect screenshot, or explore the scene to discover hidden secrets celebrating many of our benchmarks released over the last 25 years.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2695340/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736847878","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2695340/page.bg.jpg?t=1736847878","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2695340/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736847878","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2695340/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736847878","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This DLC is free for all owners of 3DMark and includes two benchmarks: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Steel Nomad<br></li><li>Steel Nomad Light  </li></ul><br><strong>3DMark Steel Nomad</strong> is a cross-platform, non-raytraced benchmark for high-end gaming PCs and Macs.
