{"about_the_game":"Set off on an adventure as a mild-mannered witch who transforms into a flying eyeball of vengeance after a smarmy knight and wizard steal her spell ingredients. You'll guide her through 50+ levels, each containing something completely unique: tricky new enemies, mysterious new environments, and puzzling new secrets. These elements are brought to life with colorful, clean pixel art and a lively, head-bobbing original soundtrack.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWitcheye is a new approach to platforming with a free movement dash through the air. Players are able to stop on a spot, reverse direction, or alter their course at will. Bounce into devilish little beasts, snag collectables and make it to the goal of each level however possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDesigner Peter Malamud Smith was the co-creator (with Charlie Hoey) of the viral hit The Great Gatsby For NES, and creator of the well-received mobile action puzzlers Satellina and Satellina Zero.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Thanks a Million!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1284950/78810f24e475e7395a71140721e778374e66b1f0.jpg"},{"name":"Recipe for Success","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1284950/dc72960860992742fc2d2c6b7d9c62f7445e0ef2.jpg"},{"name":"Toughened Up","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1284950/fc8927f9df3e0e756a95602243ff940ae5ce0909.jpg"},{"name":"Ms. Explorer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1284950/dcbbb85f7259c0f3c258f46ae3da8912db839a75.jpg"},{"name":"Resolution","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1284950/8bf40c3ac8a85a77b250c22e40b549e570871bcb.jpg"},{"name":"Without Batting an Eye","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1284950/93a5454872726b6d2446704f62d46c330a606fc5.jpg"},{"name":"Minor Threats","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1284950/6d0c81506f74e5a2ba9b862825b5f382c3ecf543.jpg"},{"name":"Big Talkers","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1284950/1d72128d515c0bdb0c79fafc3fd55688fd74df20.jpg"},{"name":"Spelunker","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1284950/1e29330b39d4b05391636618dea7464f07e20707.jpg"},{"name":"Woodswoman","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1284950/12455dd8d319937a62c77578c393115daf64ebff.jpg"}],"total":25},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1284950/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1659053867","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1284950/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1659053867","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1284950/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1659053867","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1284950/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1659053867","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Set off on an adventure as a mild-mannered witch who transforms into a flying eyeball of vengeance after a smarmy knight and wizard steal her spell ingredients.
