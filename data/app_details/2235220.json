{"about_the_game":"Let yourself be transported to the time of arcade slot machine games and indulge your senses with the colorful design of the levels.<br><br>You play as a pilot of a small spaceship with the ultimate goal of passing through a planetary defense system and getting to the planet.<br><br>Speed Madness is about combining skill, reaction speed and your ambition to be the fastest. With each level it becomes more difficult to reach the finish line. Find your way around energy cannons trying to hit you, lava pits you can fall into, walls you're not allowed to touch, and more. Some obstacles will push you back, others can be shot out of the way. On the way to the planet, you can tactically use pickups that will speed you up, slow you down, even give you temporary protection and more. As you progress and get closer and closer you can upgrade your ship to make it more resilient, faster and improve the built-in weapons. With the built-in manual speed adjustment, you can always find the perfect speed for every situation. With tactics and perseverance you can be fast enough to reach bronze, silver or gold to earn points and unlock more levels - all culminating in a fight against a giant boss cube, the very last obstacle until you finally reach the planet .<br><br>And once you have mastered a level, let me assure you:<br><br><strong>You can go even faster!</strong>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2235220/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724148048","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2235220/page.bg.jpg?t=1724148048","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2235220/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724148048","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2235220/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724148048","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Let yourself be transported to the time of arcade slot machine games and indulge your senses with the colorful design of the levels.<br><br>You play as a pilot of a small spaceship with the ultimate goal of passing through a planetary defense system and getting to the planet.<br><br>Speed Madness is about combining skill, reaction speed and your ambition to be the fastest.
