{"about_the_game":"This game made in 3D graphics with a side view combines the atmosphere of old platform games with more modern graphics. I'm working on the game, inspired by the old, very first &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; for DOS, as well as by the wonderful &quot;Fez&quot;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe action takes place mainly underground at different levels. And in the final part  the events are transferred to the surface of the planet and into space. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main character still does not know how to jump and to swim, but I will definitely teach him. Stay tuned!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a browser-based 3D game that will be supplied as a build for Windows on Webkit. In theory it also can work in any browser that supports WebGL in any operating system - Windows, iOs, MacOS, Android, Linux and so on. But for now you can get the game as Windows 7-8-10 installation package.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1125680?t=1607161908","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1125680?t=1607161908","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1125680/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1607161908","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1125680/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1607161908","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This game made in 3D graphics with a side view combines the atmosphere of old platform games with more modern graphics.
