{"about_the_game":"3 new missions. The culmination of  the Spec Ops mission to find the truth behind the Raccoon City outbreak. The elite Spec Ops are closing in on Umbrella and the Umbrella Security Service squad, but new threats and challenges cause them to side track as they help other survivors including Claire Redfield and Sherry Birkin.  As well as the ever present danger posed by the USS, zombies, Tyrants and Super Parasite Tyrants threaten to overwhelm you as Raccoon City descends into Hell. Missions locations include the secret Umbrella facility lab; the city hospital, the dead factory and finally a desperate fight for safe extraction from the city via rescue helicopter.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210013/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1452191637","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210013/page.bg.jpg?t=1452191637","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210013/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1452191637","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210013/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1452191637","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"3 new missions.
