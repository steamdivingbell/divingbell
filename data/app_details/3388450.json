Now, the prince of the Dog Kingdom wishes to declare peace with the Cats and end this centuries-old conflict once and for all. But first, he must complete his Fetch: the sacred pilgrimage performed by every prospective ruler of the kingdom where they must travel the entire length of their continent in order to retrieve the crown and then bring it back. His motives are pure, but he is naive, and there are many who would rather he didn't make it. Can he achieve his goal?
