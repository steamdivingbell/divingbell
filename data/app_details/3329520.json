{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Welcome, curious minds and eager hands! Come in, come in, for here at Labyrintheam we have challenges more twisted than tavern gossip and more turns than a reheated stew.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If you\u2019re one who enjoys testing your wits, you\u2019ve come to the right place. I warn you, stranger, a strong shield won\u2019t be enough here. No, no\u2026 you\u2019ll need brains and cleverness.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Each room will present you with a puzzle\u2026 a door that holds your freedom</strong>. But it won\u2019t open willingly; you\u2019ll have to figure out what trick it needs to let you through. Maybe it\u2019s about choosing the right order, finding the correct symbol, or even handling objects in ways as twisted as the spell of a drunk wizard.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">I warn you, strangers, logic and coordination between you and your partner will be as necessary as air. This challenge is a task for two, like wine and a mug, or bread and soup. Watch each threshold closely, and mind your step, for a wrong move is as treacherous as cheap wine.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You\u2019ll find rooms where the walls have eyes and the clocks have no patience, filled with mysteries and surprises that, I assure you, will make you doubt even the echo of your own steps.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">So go ahead, intrepid souls! In Labyrintheam, you don\u2019t get out alone, no, no! Here, collaboration is key, or you\u2019ll end up as tavern decorations. Remember, the door only opens when two heads think together.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Good luck, strangers! And may the winds of fortune always blow in your favor!</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3329520/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731436131","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3329520/page.bg.jpg?t=1731436131","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3329520/d14854e83c837eacc15c27cfd42cd1f9b1a2cb96/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731436131","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3329520/d14854e83c837eacc15c27cfd42cd1f9b1a2cb96/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731436131","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"There is presence of blood constantly, even included in the main game, being needed to see it and interact with it to solve the puzzles.
