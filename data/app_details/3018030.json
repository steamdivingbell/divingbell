You're set to feel the darkness of the rural south. The world is meant to feel believable with elements of humor hidden all around creating a unique tone and vibe.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Puzzles:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your intellect is challenged with intricate and varied puzzles that require keen problem-solving skills. You'll have to solve the various puzzles to escape this hellish nightmare.<br><br>Each puzzle requires you to figure out which elements of the world will help you translate the alienese symbols. Translating these symbols will help you determine which ornament should be placed on the shrine at the top of the mountain. Completing all puzzles and placing all ornaments completes your night walk to begin the end.<br><br>These puzzles are randomly generated so no play through will ever be the same!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Enemies:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>There are currently three main enemy types in the game:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Slow moving aliens that are the hardest and most invincible aliens in the game. These aliens work by proximity and can cause your head to explode. They do not need to hit you, just need to be close enough. (Hardest)<br></li><li> Aliens that can move at double the speed of your sprint. These are limited in number. Each one you kill means 1 less to deal with as you play through.<br></li><li> Zombies that will chase you at near your sprint speed. They'll follow you until they kill you or you kill them. Zombies will seek to surround to trap you if there are enough of them at one time. This will lead to your demise with no real way to escape.</li></ul></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Avoiding abduction is a big one. Often times, you find yourself being tracked by an alien ship. It's important you turn your flashlight off or find some sort of cover</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Although this isn't a main enemy, it's something to watch out for. Alligators roam some of the forest near water. It's best to watch your step and is one of the reasons having your flashlight active is extremely important.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Weapons:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There are three weapons in the game currently. The Beretta M9, MP-40, and the Micro-UZI. Which weapons are more powerful or better at handling the different enemy types are up to you to determine.
