{"about_the_game":"<i>A single spore floats gently to the alien earth below.  It lands, and against all odds, finds the minerals and water it needs to take root.

You control a colony of extra-terrestrial fungus spreading across a planet.  Invading aliens will attempt to wipe you out, so you will need to balance your resource gathering with defenses.  <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2623370/extras/TechyDance-ezgif.com-crop.gif?t=1733848510\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2><br>Xenomycology is played room-by-room.  In each room you will start with a single mushroom, and steadily build up your resources to expand your colony.  Some rooms will be contested - enemies will attack after a set amount of time.  Enemies will come in waves, and you will need to build defensive mushrooms to take them out.  After the waves are complete, you'll be able to move on to a new room.  <br><br>Xenomycology is not linear, however.  Many rooms will have multiple exits, and some of the exits will be blocked until you've unlocked certain technologies.  This means you can backtrack to old rooms and improve your existing colonies.  This doesn't just allow you to find new exits and explore new areas, though, existing colonies will send a percentage of their resources to new rooms.  So, upgrading your old colonies will give your new colonies an advantage.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2623370/extras/CaveDance-ezgif.com-crop.gif?t=1733848510\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Xenomycology is a city builder, but your city is a colony of extra-terrestrial mushrooms.
