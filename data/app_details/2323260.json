This is a world where plants and minerals do not react as they do on Earth. The environments, or biomes, are mesmerizingly beautiful, but don't let that distract you, or at least not for too long, from your research goals. The department has granted you the help of the droid Copernick in order to help you in the realization of the missions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiple missions to realize</h2>The missions in the biomes are varied since the environment as well as the properties of the plants and rocks are constantly changing. The scientific missions included in your internship have two main objectives. The first objective is to find scientific information that could help regenerate the Earth's ecosystems. The second objective is to improve your knowledge and skills related to digital literacy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Why a serious game?</h2>Play to learn!
