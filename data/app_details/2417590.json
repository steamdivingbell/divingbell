{"about_the_game":"Epidemic Escape: A Race for the Cure is a 3D single-player action adventure in the setting of a hospital. Players must fend off infected zombies while searching for components of the cure and escaping each level before time runs out. The player will likely be infected once the timer reaches zero causing the game to end. Each level increases in difficulty as the player finds the needed components of the cure at each healthcare complex. Players must use the appropriate fighting mechanics to stay alive using weapons at their disposal in the form of hospital equipment, furniture, guns and knives. There are puzzles which require solving to find the proper escape path as each level is increasingly difficult. The player wins the game after surviving every level and concocting the antidote to the epidemic to cure all zombies remaining alive all before time runs out. Replayability is key as the survivor who kills the fewest zombies will receive the greatest reward when turning them back to normal with the antidote.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2417590/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1683653093","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2417590/page.bg.jpg?t=1683653093","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2417590/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1683653093","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2417590/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1683653093","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Mild to moderate blood and gore."},"detailed_description":"Epidemic Escape: A Race for the Cure is a 3D single-player action adventure in the setting of a hospital.
