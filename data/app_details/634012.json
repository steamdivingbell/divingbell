{"about_the_game":"Serving the Scargi Emperor was one of the happiest times in the life of Commander Rocket. Not only was he allowed to lead his Renegades into battle in service of the Scargo race, he also spent a lot of his time in the palace kitches to enjoy his third-greatest passion: cooking (the others being fighting and cursing). None of the Scargo cooks initially thought much of the little guy, but with a little help from a tiny companion he found in the pantry, he quickly turned out to be able to create beautiful banquets and majestic meals from the simplest ingredients. They gave him full access to the kitchen on just one condition: never to bring any salt into the kitchen, as it was a hazardous substance to the snail-like Scargo.,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen the Renegades were driven from the Scargo forces, it not only meant the Commander was left without an army, but he also found a new hobby: hunting down the Scargo emperor! Sometimes he still dons his old apron though... just to remind him of happier times.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis DLC contains a custom skin for Commander Rocket in Awesomenauts. You need to have Commander Rocket available as a playable character in order to access the skin in-game. Owning this skin will also unlock the special portrait for use in-game.
