Accent colours are loud. Weapons and effects are bold [\u2026] like Silent Hill by way of Persona and Paradise Killer. God it looks great. It's fun, too.\u201d<br>Alice O'Connor, Rock Paper Shotgun<br><br>\u201cThis is an absolute fever dream love letter to a really specific era of PS2 horror games. Namely Killer7 meeting Silent Hill, via a neon filter, to create a sort of sexy, fixed camera survival horror game full of clever ideas and that just absolutely serves\u2026 style.\u201d<br>Leon Hurley, GamesRadar<br><br>\u201cThe characters are nicely designed and all of them have a very big queer aesthetic going on which is obviously awesome [\u2026] tight controls and a really nice combat system and it\u2019s added that to the aesthetic and the general mood of PSX Silent Hill.
