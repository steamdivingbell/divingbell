{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Weird things can happen on the road...</h2>A short, simple first person horror game about exploring area in the middle of nowhere to get help with repairing your car and continuing your path. Your only real enemy here is mist that shrouds the whole forest and does something weird with anyone who end up getting lost here... On your way you'll find forester's cabin but, unfortunately, there's no one home, so you better go looking for its owner, maybe he'll know how to help or have a phone so that you can make a call. You'll stumble upon different places, be it an abandoned meteostation or radiotower, but the longer you stay here the more the mist is taking control over you.<br>Eventually you'll find something that shouldn't be here: places that have no connection to the forest you are in, voices from nowhere that tell about their lives and...weird figures in the distance.<br>To get out of here you'll need to use various items, from the classic indie horror shotgun to defend yourself to the radio receiver that'll help you to navigate through the forest to find important locations. Be aware that your resources are quite limited and you'll need to utilize everything you'll find in order to succeed and get out of here.<br>Game has several various endings, each one depends on your actions in the playthrough: dialogue choices you make, and amount of sheer boldness of your actions in defending yourself and finding your way out.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"All eyes on me","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2705370/47d2cb6a43bd8b3043ec2a69a24240b369ce6665.jpg"},{"name":"Who in the world did put this here?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2705370/1391527477588f38dd92731d51e389887a7d98d2.jpg"},{"name":"Death","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2705370/209d55fd54a6ed39c9a8dc20fcd913fd7176b3e4.jpg"},{"name":"Getaway","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2705370/6aa3124ebeaabe406676b2b4fd1ba344ae0fbeba.jpg"},{"name":"Lucid dreaming.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2705370/0ccc0ae854c534d5c9230dc27ee7df8fb53b5e05.jpg"},{"name":"Scheduled shutdown","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2705370/0b468f5881eb2379fd89541a8c02ec60dd0afaab.jpg"},{"name":"Stoic response","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2705370/206c7c78960221a4541b8a7b0460626eeabd19f0.jpg"},{"name":"You already know all the answers","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2705370/ea72d62059e3442452d38cfd00df3f2d14623f15.jpg"},{"name":"Into the mist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2705370/9592ab43014075787e408bb398ec2900597f7dc1.jpg"},{"name":"Not doing that","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2705370/d237b11b7ec10d03659994a6c044f1a7003ddea7.jpg"}],"total":10},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2705370/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727329961","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2705370/page.bg.jpg?t=1727329961","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2705370/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727329961","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2705370/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727329961","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Weird things can happen on the road...</h2>A short, simple first person horror game about exploring area in the middle of nowhere to get help with repairing your car and continuing your path.
