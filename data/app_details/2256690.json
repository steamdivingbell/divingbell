{"about_the_game":"Take control of the Saadex Defense Terminal in this strategic tower defense game. Build, move and upgrade <i>everything</i> to fend off waves of relentless enemies! Utilize tactical skills to reshape the flow of battle in your favor. Secure your rank on the leaderboards as the top operator.<br><br>The enemy movement is simulated with a combination of fluid mechanics and traditional pathfinding - a unique feature not found in any other game on the market. Enemy spawners slowly corrupt the game board. Corrupted tiles spawn enemies each wave. Balance difficulty by reducing the corruption growth to decrease the number of enemies spawning, or let it grow and reach a higher score!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Deploy Strategical Weapons!</h2><br>Spend power to purchase one of the six unique intelligent towers. Each tower features fundamentally different mechanics, such as lasers, drone carriers, black holes and more. Move towers into the fray to save your cores at a critical junction, or relocate them out of harm's way when you cannot keep up with the tile corruption. Launch powerful rechargeable beacons to empower your towers and disrupt the enemy flow.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Upgrade ANYTHING!</h2><br>Level up your towers by destroying enemies and spend skill points on powerful upgrades to increase combat stats or acquire entirely new abilities. Most upgrades have a compounding +50-100% effect on stats, designed to be meaningful and interesting. Once a tower is maxed, you can reset its experience to boost the capabilities of other towers.<br><br>Power is gained after completing waves. Besides purchasing towers, power can be spent on upgrading your cores or even the enemy spawners to intensify difficulty and maximize score gains.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Score High!</h2><br>Everything is ranked - individual levels have leaderboards, and the global ranking boards showcase your performance across all levels. Saadex has no meta grinding; the only way to reach a higher rank is to improve your skills. Cheaters will be automatically identified and banned, ensuring fair competition for all players.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Level Editor</h2><br>Craft your own levels using the in-game editor and upload them for others to enjoy. Users can rate your levels, providing valuable feedback to enhance your future level designs.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2256690?t=1735926349","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2256690/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1735926349","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2256690/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735926349","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2256690/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735926349","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Take control of the Saadex Defense Terminal in this strategic tower defense game.
