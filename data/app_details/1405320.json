Extra content unlocks when you beat the game to add more hours of fun as you play this game! To learn how to play the game, the intro level allows you to experience how to control the hero, Maximus. In each level, enemy knights are scattered about that will try to take you down if you get close to them. Traps are also added like spikes for example that will hurt you if you collide with them. Each level has a boss that you need to take down to progress in this game. Learn how they move and act to take them down is my suggestion!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game will have three builds that will feature mouse and keyboard controls, only PS4 controls, and only Xbox One controls. The mouse is disabled and not visible in the PS4/Xbox One versions to avoid the loss of focus if you accidentally click on the screen. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor casual players, the game will start off easy for them to get comfortable with the mechanics before the levels get slightly harder towards the end depending on the difficulty you select. You unlock hard mode once you beat the game that will contain a higher item drop system for fewer items to spawn, and enemies taking out more damage once they hit you. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAre you ready to avenge the death of Maximus's wife?","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Slasher","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1405320/0df428f00b880aa731c84d59188d9f402e55e882.jpg"},{"name":"Why you die?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1405320/0b12550258bfb5003422bed844db78130323816e.jpg"},{"name":"Fire Boss","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1405320/98cb58670769957b15ec572de2d74cd249889319.jpg"},{"name":"Electric Boss","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1405320/63b6b7c6ad27ea9366f33a23213731f2a7ef2d9c.jpg"},{"name":"Ice Boss","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1405320/90360c2fdb9c62392457cc4176802849206a6a28.jpg"},{"name":"Dark Boss","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1405320/729457c3e99af6dddb799414734b5cfd6eff139d.jpg"},{"name":"Wolf Boss","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1405320/291bab73eafb3cda1a21397870da3641dcc1b04a.jpg"},{"name":"Male Pre Final Boss","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1405320/bf0cc43f9d19015d593e3e24a901484e718d046d.jpg"},{"name":"Final Boss","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1405320/32704603473a4f626dc544e6cf9344405e07452f.jpg"},{"name":"Beat The Game","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1405320/c37dd9807f6f1953049e87a391438ed87247b787.jpg"}],"total":22},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1405320/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1666987181","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1405320/page.bg.jpg?t=1666987181","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1405320/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1666987181","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1405320/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1666987181","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"With the events that lead to the death of Maximus's wife, you embark on an adventure to avenge her death.
