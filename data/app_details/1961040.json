{"about_the_game":"The game depicts a future in which Earth is dominated by a race of self-aware machines that was spawned from the creation of artificial intelligence early in the 22nd century. At one point conflict arose between mankind and machines, and the machines rebelled against their creators.  A massive war emerged between the two adversaries. Machines control the weather and create storm clouds and floods to sink all human civilizations and capture humanity. The war ended with the victory of the machines, and the remaining humans were hidden under the sea. To stop the war, you need to drive your ship to machine city and hack their core.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>You start with a basic frigate and some laser weapons.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Buy and customize your ship.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>To loot new weapons, modules and blueprints.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Upgrade your weapons and ships based on the resources you have.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>To kill incoming enemies.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>All weapons automatically attack.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Game scripts are editable.
