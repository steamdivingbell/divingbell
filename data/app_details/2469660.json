{"about_the_game":"&quot; <br>   <h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Aegis of Empires 5: Race for Shataakh-Ulm</h2>  <strong> Into the Endless Wastes!</strong>  <br>  The legendary treasure of the lost Conroi Expedition draws your heroes onwards, but they are not alone in seeking fame and fortune. Factions race across the seemingly endless plains of the Haunted Steppe and must brave its harsh elements, hostile cannibal tribes, and eerie burning undead that crackle with the energies of a forgotten cataclysm. The heroes must piece together the hidden trail left behind a century ago to discover the true prize sought by those ill-fated explorers and must face the rising of an ancient evil from the Lost Lands' past that could arise to threaten every civilized realm. If they want to enjoy their fabled treasure, the heroes first need to survive! <br>  <br>  Race for Shataakh-Ulm is a <br>  Pathfinder Second Edition adventure for 12th-level characters set in the fabled Haunted Steppe in the <br>  Lost Lands Campaign Setting . This rich and exciting world 20 years in the making has been home to dozens of adventures from Necromancer Games and Frog God Games and produced with their cooperation to be compatible with <br>  The World of the Lost Lands campaign guide! It is the fifth of six adventures in the <br>  Aegis of Empires Adventure Path , with each adventure exploring hitherto unexplored areas of the Lost Lands with a combination of horror, intrigue, deadly danger, and the lure of ancient mysteries. <br>  While designed for use with the Lost Lands, these adventures are loosely connected rather than following a strictly controlled plotline, enabling you to easily place them into any campaign world. Your heroes can explore at their own pace to discover the secrets of antiquity or be consumed in their seeking as they brave the dark paths of the <br>  Aegis of Empires .
