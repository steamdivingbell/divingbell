{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">It's a world of heroes and villains, masks and capes, and Penny Larceny -- grifter, con artist, catburglar -- is barely scraping by.

But when you've got six figures of student loan debt thanks to a for-profit medical school gouging you, the options for paying it back are limited. It's either sell your organs or go into supercrime.
