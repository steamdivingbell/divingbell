{"about_the_game":"Space Mechanic Simulator is not just another mechanic game where your only job is to fix some parts. All the parts in this game are simulated, which makes the gameplay more immersive and lifelike. You can't simply disconnect a pipe before closing a valve, and sometimes you won't even know what is broken until you check the schematics and diagnose the problem using your tools. All of this takes place while you're floating in zero gravity or in complete darkness while orbiting on the dark side of a planet.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/429380/extras/01.gif?t=1724760033\" /><br><br>Fortunately, you are well-prepared for all of this. Your spacesuit has a powerful flashlight and thruster automation that helps you stabilize when needed. Just be careful not to run low on oxygen, fuel, or energy, as you'll have to fly back to your shuttle to replenish everything. Of course, you could always take a bit of risk and cut it close, but time is money, after all.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/429380/extras/03.gif?t=1724760033\" /><br><br>Naturally, it would be very unprofessional to throw a new astronaut into all of this without proper training.
