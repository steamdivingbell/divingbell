Her aloof personality can be misleading at times, but she's one of the most caring residents of the Crystal Vale. If you're ever hungry or need some company, you'll do good by paying her a visit at the Sleeping Fox Inn.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Nai</h2>Dr.Nai is a medical professional in charge of making sure that the Crystal Vale's residents are in good health. She is a staunch advocate of good sexual health and believes that overall well-being begins in the bedroom. Aside from her medical services, she runs an additional sex toy business, where you'll find all manner of things to spice up your romantic life.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hazel</h2>A traveling merchant with a bit of a greedy side. Hazel obsessively collects items that she comes across in the hopes of finding something important that she lost. Unfortunately, she doesn't remember what she is looking for. When she's not out searching for things to sell, you'll find her peddling her wares at her local shop.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Rua</h2>Rua is a forager with a knack for crafting and survival. Her cold personality is merely a facade and she can be quite trusting and warm when she gets to know someone well.
