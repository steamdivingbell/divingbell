{"about_the_game":"This game is a simple 3D platformer in which you will have to finish some levels which are made to test your patience and mostly, your skill. In each level, you control a robot, named RS-1192018E2119. With this robot, you must finish each level and move to the next one, until you have completed the game. The only controls you will need to use are the WASD movement buttons, or the arrow buttons if you prefer them. Patience is key, as the levels are designed to make this game a hard experience for you, since the goal of the game is to make the player feel the emotions of rage and defeat, until they reach their ultimate goal, the completion of each level. Once you have completed a level, you can always try and speedrun the same level, to see how good you are at winning those levels, compared to other players who are just like you. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game features:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-4 levels full of adventure and replayability<br />\r\n-Simple controls which makes it easy for anyone to play<br />\r\n-Challenging puzzles <br />\r\n-Adventure<br />\r\n-Bringing the old-school type of game back to life<br />\r\n-Speedrunning tournaments and much more!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Big Mistake","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2105090/1adb1e1e1a97f532e6025f12f3161e40135d8558.jpg"}],"total":1},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2105090/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1688407213","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2105090/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1688407213","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2105090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1688407213","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2105090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1688407213","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This game is a simple 3D platformer in which you will have to finish some levels which are made to test your patience and mostly, your skill.
