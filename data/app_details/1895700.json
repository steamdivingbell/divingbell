{"about_the_game":"<strong>sonata1219 on Great Marble Adventure Soundtrack:</strong><br><i>The soundtrack used in Great Marble Adventure mainly takes inspiration from nature sceneries, landscapes, and photographs. As myself is also a fan of nature, I like to incorporate that element into music. In addition to the natural sceneries, I am also a fan of video game music, especially tracks composed by David Wise in the Donkey Kong Country series, and ZUN from the Touhou Project Series; these also inspire me to create the majority of the tracks in this game. I also like to incorporate my feelings when composing every track, which can be understood from the name of each track.<br><br>Most of the tracks were composed before the levels of the game were made, so NaCl586 got the full potential to listen to the music, feel the emotion of the music, and created what he visioned from the tracks he listened to, which means the levels were made based on the music. It's a form of art, after all, both music composition and video game, and I hope you can also see what NaCl586 envisions in Great Marble Adventure, or perhaps, you can also feel the adventure of emotion after listening to Great Marble Adventure OST.</i>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1895700/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1670767860","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1895700/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1670767860","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1895700/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1670767860","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1895700/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1670767860","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>sonata1219 on Great Marble Adventure Soundtrack:</strong><br><i>The soundtrack used in Great Marble Adventure mainly takes inspiration from nature sceneries, landscapes, and photographs.
