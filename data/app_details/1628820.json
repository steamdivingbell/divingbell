Making any sudden noises in her wilderness will definitely anger the creatures that surround you thus making preforming loud tasks like mining and shooting weapons very dangerous and require the suitable equipment, fire power and planning to complete your expeditions and return safely.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mining</h2>As an AsmiCorp miner, your main goal is to mine the minerals above and beneath Vidora\u2019s surface. Along your expeditions, you will come across many valuable and interesting minerals, the most important being Asmegite. In order to extract these minerals, you will be required to use the many unique tools and equipment that AsmiCorp has provided you with or you have crafted.
