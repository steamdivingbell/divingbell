{"about_the_game":"Ruinic is a massive multiplayer adventure, with monsters to kill, quests to complete, and treasure to win. You control your own character who will improve and become more powerful the more you play. This isn't a game where everything that happens is pre-determined. What you do in the world is up to you!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">This Is Your Adventure</h2>You can go exploring, or earn a living practicing a craft such as cooking or crafting. Many of the characters in the game can give you quests to go on, each with different rewards. If you are brave you can search for riches in the dungeons or world but make sure you are well armed! Try your hand at archery, or magic to give yourself an extra advantage.<br><br><br>The game is multiplayer which means you will meet many other people in the world who you communicate and trade with. Make new friends and go adventuring together to stand a better chance against the stronger monsters. Perhaps you want to make your money trading valuable goods with others. Or if you like taking risks, you can choose to fight with like-minded people to try and steal their treasure.<br><br>There are many more things you can do!
