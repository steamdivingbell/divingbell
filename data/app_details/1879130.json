your Oracle and go to the game area.<br>In the game area you have access to all the cards of the chosen oracle.<br>You can shuffle and draw cards from the top, middle, or bottom of the deck.<br>There are two methods of shuffling: Manual and Automatic.<br>None of the methods use random patterns.<br>There are 4 game modes that affect the size of the cards and the maximum amount that can be placed on the table.<br>On the table the cards adjust from the center but you can adjust them manually by dragging them.<br>The way you will consult and interpret is free within the cards limit.<br>It has a size adjustable camera tool that you can generate images of the cards laid out on the table.<br>It has fields to type the cards in case you need to search for one or more specific cards.<br>You can
