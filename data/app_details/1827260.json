Immerse yourself into a world set in early 90\u2019s in which you gather (or fabricate!) evidence, deduct and run fierce courtroom battles. Would you choose to be a lawful attorney or rather an underhanded rogue who uses all his means to win the cases no matter the cost?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2><br>Follow the story of Mark Ferry, a fallen attorney-at-law, who has just left rehab to start his life and career from the beginning. A lot of time and effort will be needed to regain his former position and trust among acquaintances.

You will visit the crime scene and other locations to check possible clues, interrogate witnesses, examine potential evidence and decide what to do with it, prepare your client for the trial and eventually prepare your line of defence. During this part you will be switching between two playable characters: Mark Ferry and Hector Diaz, who both have their own flaws and strong sides, having different impact during dealing certain situtations. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1827260/extras/gif1.gif?t=1714028005\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Courtroom</h2><br>During the courtroom battle you will use all your knowledge about the case and previously-formed conclusions during evidence analysis, listen to testimonies and cross-examinate potential witnesses.
