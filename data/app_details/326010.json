{"about_the_game":"BR ordered more than 24000 21t hoppers to several different diagrams over the 10 years from 1949. These wagons were a continuation of a former LNER design, with some of the earliest examples featuring the long brake lever and single-sided brakes of late LNER examples and also riveted bodywork. In common with all coal carrying wagons, they were subjected to the problems of body rot. Between 1971 and 1978 a major re-bodying programme was instituted, with both unfitted and fitted wagons being scheduled for attention.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Re-Bodied 21t HTV Hopper Wagon Pack features former Diagram 1/146 vehicles that were fitted with roller bearing axleboxes and vacuum brakes along with the new body. Three livery variations are included, in both clean and dirty options: Freight Brown body, with black frames and running gear; Freight Brown body and Frames, with black running gear; maroon body, with black frames and running gear. Empty and Loaded physics options are provided and the loaded examples come with 5 random coal load shapes. There are also 4 random styles of lettering provided to give a bit more variety, as the wagon code was variously rendered as HOP 21 VB, HOP 21 HTV, or just HTV.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/326010?t=1447363937","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/326010?t=1447363937","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/326010/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1447363937","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/326010/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1447363937","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"BR ordered more than 24000 21t hoppers to several different diagrams over the 10 years from 1949.
