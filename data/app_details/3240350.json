Different forms of your slime produce and consume different metabolites each time you progress to the next turn.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Running out of any of these resources can cause your slime to lose portions of its body or completely starve to death, so it's important to produce enough metabolites. But beware: if you produce too many, metabolites can build up to toxic levels, which can also cause your slime to suffer.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Metabolites depend on interacting with the slime's environment, and not all resources are infinite, so you will need to balance your rates of growth, production, and consumption carefully if you want to grow complex enough to complete your slime's life cycle.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">5 metabolites to manage</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">15 biological forms for your slime to use</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Turn-based growth and resource management</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Procedurally generated maps</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A quirky 2.5D art style</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Charmingly eccentric music</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Support for mouse &amp; keyboard, keyboard only, and mouse-only controls</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Difficulty &amp; tutorial settings</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Developer cats in the credits</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3240350/extras/store_banner_about.png?t=1732560320\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Spore Valley is <strong>a short game</strong>, meant to provide a complete experience of puzzling play in a single extended sitting.
