{"about_the_game":"In this thrilling co-op game, you play as a group of brave kids who must fight against hordes of creepy monsters that have taken over their town. Battle through various areas, including the school, summer camp, and neighborhood, to save them from the monsters' grasp. To save the day, you'll need to collect and upgrade homemade weapons and unique abilities. Don't face the monsters alone! Rescue new friends to join your team and help you fight back before it's too late. With randomly generated levels, no two games are the same. It's a top-down twin-stick shooter that'll keep you on your toes as you fight for survival in a town overrun by monsters.
