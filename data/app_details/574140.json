{"about_the_game":"The crime... is murder.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur story takes place in a court trial, set in a futuristic world where most humans have cyberbrains. The defendant on trial is an agent who coordinates with artists to create the data for cyberbrains to interact with people\u2019s emotions. The victim is a girl artist named Lux. The jury has to investigate what really happened by reliving the memory data of the defendant. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom the creative mind behind the WORLD END ECONOMiCA series, this title is Spicy Tail\u2019s new adventure adopting HMD in a VR space. Project LUX is a &quot;story-oriented&quot; work for VR, in contrast to recent VR works, which can described as &quot;experience-oriented.&quot; Born from an idea upon reading Dr. Naotaka Fujii's book, &quot;Kakuch\u014d Suru N\u014d&quot; (Expanding Brain) in 2014, Project LUX is a VR animated story that puts you in the perspective of the agent as he interacts with Lux. What will be revealed from reliving the agent's memory data of what transpired...?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProject Lux features five &quot;episodes&quot; that bring this VR adventure to life, featuring the voice talents of Aimi Tanaka as Lux and Teruaki Ogawa as the agent.
