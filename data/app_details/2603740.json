Unlike other evolution simulators, Atoms and Time inserts you right into this world, filled with other species that adapt just as fast as you can. The story of your organism's survival is told in a simplified format inspired by games like Oregon Trail, skipping the wilderness-wandering and throwing you right into the highlights of your creature's life. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2603740/extras/bug_options.gif?t=1709394300\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Advanced Evolution Prediction</h2>Playing through one organism's lifetime is fast, but the road of evolution is a long and complex one. Atoms and Time does not ask the player to wait around for an interesting mutation to randomly appear in your simulation, or provide the player unrealistic creative tools for character creation. Instead, the algorithm of &quot;auto-evo&quot; calculates the selection pressures that affect your species, given the current environment and known laws of biology. As the player, you get to choose one of a few scientifically plausible pathways to pursue.

In addition, auto-evo allows the simulation to understand HOW a species is surviving, and why certain mutations were selected, providing a new window into the story of your simulated life.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2603740/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1709394300","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2603740/page.bg.jpg?t=1709394300","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2603740/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1709394300","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2603740/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1709394300","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2603740/extras/smol_egg.png?t=1709394300\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Star in your own paleontology documentary!</h2> Atoms and Time is an evolution survival game with a strong scientific focus, powered by new technological advances in ecosystem simulation.
