{"about_the_game":"Prepare yourself for an epic journey into the heart of a world where strategy, survival, and myth collide. Mythic Battlegrounds: Demonic Siege is a turn\u2013based strategy and defense game that thrusts you into a relentless battle for survival against dark forces. Command one of four unique races \u2013 Humans, Elves, Orcs, and Dwarves, each with their own legendary commanders and units. As the world teeters on the brink of destruction, it\u2019s up to you to lead your armies, forge powerful alliances, and turn the tide against the demonic horde.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Strategize, Survive, and Conquer:</h2><br>In Mythic Battlegrounds: Demonic Siege, battles are automatic, but every decision you make before the clash is critical. Each turn, you\u2019ll need to carefully manage your resources, train your units, and place your forces to survive the next wave of enemies. Will you invest in powerful units or save your gold to earn interest? The choice is yours, and it could mean the difference between victory and defeat.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2438780/extras/GIF20-600.gif?t=1737769001\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Lead Legendary Commanders:</h2><br>With 8 commanders to choose from, each with unique abilities, your strategy will shift depending on who you lead into battle. Whether you\u2019re rallying troops with Kaela Valtorin, the Master-at-Arms who can transform militias into seasoned soldiers, or unleashing the ancient magic of Archdruid Archeon to summon fierce creatures of nature, your commander\u2019s skills will shape your path to victory.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Train and Upgrade Over 40 Unit Types:</h2><br>From swift elven archers to mighty dwarven warriors, your army is your greatest asset. With over 40 unit types, including a legendary unit for each race, you\u2019ll need to build a balanced force capable of taking on any threat. As your units gain experience in battle, they\u2019ll rank up, boosting their stats and becoming even more formidable on the battlefield.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2438780/extras/Race_Icons.png?t=1737769001\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Face Off Against 60+ Enemy Types and 20 Bosses:</h2><br>The demonic siege won\u2019t be easy to break. You\u2019ll face off against more than 60 different enemy types, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Test your might against 20 powerful bosses, each guarding the way to new abilities and the next chapter of your journey. With every victory, you can unlock new skills that will improve your economy or give you the edge in warfare.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Quests and Rewards:</h2><br>Between battles, take on quests that offer unique challenges and the chance to earn powerful rewards. These quests are more than just side activities, they can dramatically alter your strategy and give you the upper hand in the coming battles. Will you risk everything for early, game-changing rewards, or will you play it safe, even if it means securing those bonuses later?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Endless Replayability:</h2><br>No two games are the same in Mythic Battlegrounds: Demonic Siege. With random spawns, diverse skill trees, and the ability to choose different commanders and unit compositions, each playthrough offers a fresh experience. Adapt your strategy on the fly and discover new ways to conquer the demonic horde.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Epic Story, Casual Controls:</h2><br>Immerse yourself in an epic storyline where the fate of the world hangs in the balance. From the quiet village of Aeshen\u2019s Rest to the final confrontation with the dark forces, your journey will be filled with memorable characters, intense battles, and tough choices. But while the story is grand, the controls are simple and intuitive, making it easy to jump into the action and start strategizing your way to victory.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Are You Ready to Defend the Realm?</h2><br>The forces of darkness are on the move, and only the bravest commanders can stand against them. Will you rise to the challenge and lead your armies to victory? The fate of the realm is in your hands in Mythic Battlegrounds: Demonic Siege.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2438780/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737769001","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2438780/page.bg.jpg?t=1737769001","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2438780/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737769001","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2438780/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737769001","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3284400,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Prepare yourself for an epic journey into the heart of a world where strategy, survival, and myth collide.
