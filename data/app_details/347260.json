{"about_the_game":"There's no room for error when travelling at the speed of light, racing through star systems in a desperate search for a new world to house Mankind. But there are plenty of opportunities for mistakes. Alien races of every conceivable size, shape, temperament and sophistication seek to aid, use, corrupt or destroy you - and you don't know which.<br><br>Sure, your starship is 15,000 feet long and armed with remote-controlled fightercraft, kamakazi fighters, a devestating plasma gun and high-tech probes, but will all that <strong>firepower</strong> be against The Stentor, rithless time-travelling space pirates, or the colossal energy beings known as The ZOR?<br><br>Perhaps <strong>diplomacy</strong> is the answer. The Cicisbeo are vain and arrogant - perhaps that ego can be worked to your advantage. The broodmasters are sinister, manipulative and seek universal domination, but are they a little <strong>too</strong> eager?<br><br>Perhaps something can be gained from shrewd <strong>trading</strong>. But that will be tough against the ever-seeking, ever-hungry Collectors, keepers of the Museum of Time; not to mention the supra-intelligent Jot, who control the minds of everyone nearby.<br><br>Whatever choices you make, make them quickly. You're moving at Hyperspeed - second thoughts could be fatal.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/347260/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1708626415","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/347260/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1708626415","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/347260/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1708626415","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/347260/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1708626415","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"There's no room for error when travelling at the speed of light, racing through star systems in a desperate search for a new world to house Mankind.
