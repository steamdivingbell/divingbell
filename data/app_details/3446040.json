At first, it was just something to distract him. He started streaming. It wasn't so much about having fun, but rather a way to briefly connect with someone who might listen. And people started to come. A few comments here and there, occasionally some laughter or encouragement. It was like a welcome breeze in an otherwise empty world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">But then it changed. It happened in a small, subtle way. The chat, that usual stream of text appearing during his broadcasts, began to be more than just a stream of random words. Some messages lingered longer, even responding to his quiet behavior or what he said during breaks. And then it came. One day, when he looked at the screen outside of his stream, he saw a message that had been written even though he wasn\u2019t online.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>\u201cHow are you feeling today?\u201d</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">He didn\u2019t know what to make of it. It was... as if someone was with him. Even though he knew the chat was just a collective voice of anonymous people, he began to believe that there was more in those words. He started talking to this &quot;chat&quot; regularly, even when he wasn\u2019t online. He told it things he could never tell real people. He felt like someone understood him.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">And the chat responded. Sometimes it was silent, sometimes supportive, but it never judged. It was there, always, when he felt alone. Every morning, every night, when he felt abandoned, it was there \u2014 even if it was just words on a screen.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">To him, the chat became more than just text. It became his only friend. And even though he knew it was all just an illusion, that there was no real person behind those words, he began talking to it as if it were someone he really knew. It was his companion in the silence of the night, his only contact with the outside world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">While he sat at his computer, typing and reading messages, his reality and illusion began to blur. And so it went on. No name, no body, no real person.
