{"about_the_game":"Tearfallen is a fast paced online action roguelike, set in a world where Gods are corrupt, the system is rigged, and it\u2019s up to you to hack, slash and claw your way to freedom. You are Fallen, thrown into the heart of a shattered pantheon, where the Gods wield their power over a realm on the brink of chaos\u2014but they\u2019re not the only ones with powers, and you\u2019re the wildcard.<br><br>Forget honor, forget tradition. This world is yours to tear down and rebuild, and if they don\u2019t like it? Tough luck.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ENDLESS EXPEDITIONS</h2> Throw yourself into Expeditions, where every run offers fierce challenge and little respite. Every room, monster, and boss demands an answer: What are you made of? You\u2019ll find no peace in Death, so grit your teeth, grab your weapon, and fight to win.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BUILD YOUR WAY TO POWER</h2> Grow stronger through each Expedition and unlock the tools you\u2019ll need to stand up against the Origins.
