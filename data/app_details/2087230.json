{"about_the_game":"Step into the shoes of a franchisee owner of an Exemplary Villain Industries L.L.C. Lair, and be a part of a leading enterprise in the hero killing business. Your mission? To build your malevolent empire, defeat pesky heroes, and maximize profits through cunning schemes and shrewd negotiations.<br><br>Manage your lair, hire minions, and kidnap members of royalty for lucrative ransoms. Tax evasion? Negotiating with hero-slaying unions? It's all in a day's work for a true villainous entrepreneur.<br><br>With consistent progression, your lair becomes a formidable force, and it's your business acumen that will lead you to the top. Big Boss is not just about being a villain; it's about being a savvy CEO of your own villainous enterprise. Embrace your inner tycoon and conquer the world, one hero at a time!<br><br><strong><i>Becoming a Boss</i></strong><br>Being a boss is more than just defeating heroes. It's about the kind of heroes that are defeated, and how much cash you can get after defeating them. To defeat heroes, though, you need a dungeon. You decide to form your own Hero Defeating company and franchise a location from Exemplary Villain Industries LLC. They help you lure heroes and assist with payroll and you have a place to defeat heroes.<br><br><strong><i>Managerial Duties</i></strong><br>As a boss, having minions under your command is a perk, and keeping them on payroll is in your best interest. Minions risk their lives with Royalty Acquisitions, as any good evil doer needs to have a couple lures for heroes. Depending on the Royal acquired, new, stronger heroes will attempt to challenge you, leaving you more money as they're defeated. Minions also construct traps, and if you give them some armor and a sword, they'll stand guard at checkpoints, too. Minions are not little playthings, however. They have feelings and mouths to feed as well. Pay them well and they will treat you well, else you might have to negotiate with union leaders. <br><br>Managerial duties goes beyond just the first lair your company owns. As you grow, your company grows as well. Becoming the final boss is a matter of rising through the ranks of EVILLC through the purchasing and managing of new boss lairs, eventually creating a network for heroes to challenge in order to save their royal. Interview and assign mini-bosses to take control of other lairs and pose as mid-dungeon threats, and establish corporate connections in the underworld to increase profits and influence corporate decisions. <br><br><strong><i>Post-Partum Estate</i></strong><br>Not everything lasts forever, and that includes your duties as a boss. In the event that a hero defeats you, your company must find another boss to take the reigns as Chief Executive Overlord. Defeat means your company has no head, and heroes will take anything they can get their hands on that their inventory slots will hold. Everything in the dungeon is gone. Everything out of the dungeon will be liquidated in order to keep the company afloat. People still have mouths to feed, after all. If the company goes under, then it's game over.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2087230?t=1734849660","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2087230?t=1734849660","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2087230/9ea70e0959d9672c48cf5896c26b3428a8454f87/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734849660","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2087230/9ea70e0959d9672c48cf5896c26b3428a8454f87/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734849660","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Step into the shoes of a franchisee owner of an Exemplary Villain Industries L.L.C.
