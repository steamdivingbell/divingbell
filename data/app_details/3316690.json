{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">a surreal apocalyptic world awaits you outside the building where you wake up. without memory or knowledge of what happened to the world, you emerge into a broken city full of mystery, ringing a massive purple monolith that rises beyond the dark clouds high above, dead in the center of an empty world. the air hangs heavy with radiation, the rolling clouds above constantly raining ash onto a world untouched for a long, long time.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">the travelers is a text-based adventure and mmo. the world is one massive grid to be explored by all players at once, where items can be discovered, bases can be built, and combat can be engaged. hidden within the world is a unique story, with dozens of old transcripts from a forgotten world to read through. hidden even within this, across the whole world, is a grand puzzle, guiding the community through clues that will reveal what happened to humanity. together, you can uncover the secrets of the wasteland.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3316690/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738110684","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3316690/page.bg.jpg?t=1738110684","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3316690/beafa99cbfa4a9b83a4d8599e9e53b9637b0cc24/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738110684","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3316690/beafa99cbfa4a9b83a4d8599e9e53b9637b0cc24/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738110684","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"Steam
