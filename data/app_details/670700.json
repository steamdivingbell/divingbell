{"about_the_game":"<strong>Summer 2017</strong><br><br>Russia is in the 4th year of a 15 year project to install the \u2018SHELF\u2019 underwater Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS), a very modern equivalent to the US Navy\u2019s Cold War system of listening arrays in the Greenland-Iceland-UK (GIUK) Gap.
