{"about_the_game":"Autopista is a car racing game inspired by 80s toys.<br />\r\nThe racing tracks in the game have this particularity:<br />\r\nthey are a sequence of geometric pieces of predetermined shape, for example<br />\r\ncurves of different characteristics, straights of different lengths, bridges, climbs, descents.<br />\r\nThey always start from a short straight section, where the cars line up at the start, and then complete<br />\r\nthe circuit obtaining always different shapes each time.<br />\r\nThe cars race on the track following a pre-established trajectory, each track has two parallel trajectories.<br />\r\nThe peculiarity of the game consists in having a view of the race always from the side of the track and never<br />\r\nfrom the position of the car.<br />\r\nRotating the view around the track seeks the best perspective<br />\r\nto see all the cars in the race, at a glance.<br />\r\nPlaying is very simple, you choose a track, select the available options and start the race.<br />\r\nThe car that completes the set laps first wins.<br />\r\nThe player observes the race and information relating to fuel consumption, tire wear and turbo booster charge,<br />\r\ntherefore it manages some settings in real time to benefit your vehicle:<br />\r\ngeneral difficulty of the race (decide based on your experience),<br />\r\ndrift mode (some corners become faster with the car drifting),<br />\r\nactivation of the turbo booster (for an extra boost at the right moment),<br />\r\nuse of the twin turbo (for more energetic acceleration),<br />\r\npit lane access for tire change and refueling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBetter performance means more tire wear and higher fuel consumption.<br />\r\nBut less fuel and fresh tires make the car lighter and faster, it's up to you to decide.<br />\r\nOvertaking and lane changes are automatic.<br />\r\nThe characteristics of the track, the settings selected, the times and ways in which the player makes his decisions,<br />\r\nsome unexpected crashes and changing driving skills of opponents will give you unique experience every time<br />\r\neven when you run several times on the same track.<br />\r\nHowever, you always have two hundred racing tracks at your disposal so you don't get bored and play quite relaxed.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2404850/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1686081676","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2404850/page.bg.jpg?t=1686081676","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2404850/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1686081676","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2404850/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1686081676","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family
