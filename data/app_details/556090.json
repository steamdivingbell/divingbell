The fleet\u2019s shipyard allows them ship upgrading and customization with cash earned and technologies found. But make no mistake! With each planet liberated, the challenges get only tougher and the stakes higher. <br><br><strong>Features </strong><br><br>-14 different stages spread across djungle worlds, icey wastes, asteroid belts, and interdimensional vaults <br>-Discover new technologies throughout your journey and equip them in the shipyard <br>-Features a 15-piece original soundtrack <br>-50+ different weapons, ships and upgrades <br>-Choose between 8 different pilots, each with their own set of abilities! <br>-Pilot-Rescue(tm) saves your pilot in case of capital hull damage!
