{"about_the_game":"You're an AI that wakes up in an artificial world filled with puzzles that is there to train your cognitive abilities. There you meet an observer that directs you with snarky comments. The puzzles are set up to train your rope slinging (grappling gun) abilities. You start of with an 0% accuracy/complete status and have to build your skills up to a 100% to unlock the next challenge. You can expect fun and challenging physics puzzles where you need to use your grappling gun, and later your tethering gun, to manipulate your environment to get to the exit of each puzzle. You need to jump, swing, drag, throw, push, pull, and tether objects together in whatever ways necessary to achieve this. Expect challenges where you need to combine rope acrobatics with your puzzle solving abilities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What you can expect:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Physics <br></li><li>Rope slinging acrobatics   <br></li><li>Platforming action<br></li><li>Grappling gun based puzzles<br></li><li>Anti-gravity and many more physics driven twists<br></li><li>Robotic humor<br></li><li>And later...tethering gun  \u033f\u033f \u033f\u033f \u033f\u033f \u033f'\u033f'\\\u0335\u0347\u033f\u033f\\\u0437= ( \u2580 \u035c\u035e\u0296\u2580) =\u03b5/\u0335\u0347\u033f\u033f/\u2019\u033f\u2019\u033f \u033f \u033f\u033f \u033f\u033f \u033f\u033f</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/880720/extras/entangledgif.png?t=1715173905\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Grappling master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/880720/08e0bef444c7190eafd3c46e1096e87c1cb83822.jpg"},{"name":"Grappling trainee","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/880720/edc36197591ac8b00275cef384f2575e7990e69a.jpg"},{"name":"Tether master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/880720/6e407b0de930d57a9dc2386e225735d4757a2d9e.jpg"},{"name":"Tether trainee","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/880720/d6e4c0fffb08ca5964178478e3c9eeccdfae5280.jpg"},{"name":"Completionist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/880720/27bfb426758168b213469d5c7159246a2339474c.jpg"},{"name":"Seemles record","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/880720/49ea12c9b143f008afb32d30193f856e9b24c15e.jpg"}],"total":6},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/880720/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1715173905","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/880720/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1715173905","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/880720/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1715173905","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/880720/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1715173905","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You're an AI that wakes up in an artificial world filled with puzzles that is there to train your cognitive abilities.
