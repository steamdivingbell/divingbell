{"about_the_game":"It's just a game made by a small character.<br />\r\nAs a player, I've been thinking about a lot of stslike games, what is the core highlight of this game, does it have a sense of &quot;a mod that looks a lot like sts&quot;? unfortunately, most games don't. There are many games that &quot;stitch&quot; together a slaying spire game and a battle flag game, but after I experienced it, I always felt that these games lacked a bit of a &quot;build&quot; game flavor. As a game that controls a single role, it is difficult to restore the feeling of strategizing and commanding generals in a war chess game, so I still focus on the &quot;cards&quot; in the process of &quot;stitching&quot;, and make the so-called war chess elements into the fourth port in addition to the &quot;offensive end&quot;, &quot;defense end&quot; and &quot;operation end&quot; - &quot;mobile terminal&quot;, so I have always emphasized that the small role is not stslike plus battle flags, but stslike plus &quot;one-dimensional&quot;.<br />\r\nI hope I enjoy my game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2881020/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729420716","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2881020/page.bg.jpg?t=1729420716","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2881020/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729420716","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2881020/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729420716","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3039770,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"It's just a game made by a small character.<br />\r\nAs a player, I've been thinking about a lot of stslike games, what is the core highlight of this game, does it have a sense of &quot;a mod that looks a lot like sts&quot;? unfortunately, most games don't.
