{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dungeoneer</h2>Dungeoneer is a rouge-like, RPG, souls-like maybe future MMO game.<br><br>Taking big inspiration from Dark Souls, Runescape, Hypixels Skyblock, Metin 2 and Enter The Gungeon.<br><br>The game is split into 2 main parts.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">1. The Town/Hub </h2>Here the player can shop for items, accept quests, upgrade their gear and many other things. The town also has the entrance to the main part of the game which is the dungeons.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">2. The Dungeons </h2>There are multiple dungeons each with their own theme. All the dungeons are also separated into a few floors (currently not decided how many). Each time you enter a floor it is randomly generated. Floors slowly get more difficult having harder and harder enemies, floors also have bosses at the end. After finishing a floor the player is graded on how well they did ranging from F-S+.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>Having a top-down view you move using WASD and attack with left and right click. You can currently equip a main weapon and a main ability(might be changed). The gameplay revolves around waves of enemies spawning everytime you enter a room, after killing them all the doors open and the player can go into other rooms. The bosses will have some resemblance of bullet hell where you can utilize the roll mechanic that gives you a burst of speed and makes you invincible for a few frames. There is a classless system meaning any player can quickly switch out their gear from lets say more tanky to more damage oriented. With a big variety of weapons and armors players can form combinations that work well together.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3057810/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725823085","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3057810/page.bg.jpg?t=1725823085","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3057810/33fa60cd563958b587cc2c2f8fb07c71d3aad422/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725823085","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3057810/33fa60cd563958b587cc2c2f8fb07c71d3aad422/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725823085","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dungeoneer</h2>Dungeoneer is a rouge-like, RPG, souls-like maybe future MMO game.<br><br>Taking big inspiration from Dark Souls, Runescape, Hypixels Skyblock, Metin 2 and Enter The Gungeon.<br><br>The game is split into 2 main parts.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">1.
