{"about_the_game":"Pelago is a creature-catching adventure game! Explore the islands of Pelago and befriend the creatures that live there. Build your perfect team to overcome any challenge and unravel the mysteries of the islands.<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Creature Catching!</strong> The islands of Pelago are filled with a variety of different creatures. To befriend these creatures you'll need Bondstones. These special stones can be found naturally around the islands, or purchased from the Stonesmith's Guild. Different creatures prefer different types of Bondstones, so choose carefully for best results!<br></li><li><strong>Creature Training!</strong> Many creatures on the islands evolve and grow to new forms as you train them. As a creature grows stronger they learn more powerful skills to use in battle. With your skill as a trainer, you can teach those skills to other creatures on your team that might not otherwise learn them. As you win battles with your team, you can customize each creature to become stronger, studier, or faster to better fit your team. Each specific creature also has unique innate talents. Some will be stronger, sturdier, or faster than others. Build your team to fit your own playstyle!<br></li><li><strong>Creature Battling!</strong> Many of the inhabitants of Pelago are eager to find other trainers to train with. The standard way that trainers battle on the islands is 2v2 with a maximum team size of 5. Some skills are stronger against some creatures than others, be careful if your fire creature comes up against a water creature!<br></li><li><strong>Exploration!</strong> There are many different types of environments on the islands and each species of creature has their own preferences. To explore all the islands you'll need the help of the Mariner's Guild. They'll be happy to sail you around the islands as long as you can prove that you can help defend the ship if pirates attack!</li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"A Friend to All","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2939290/30af57fab4626bcba1dbf4e52103eee4636efdac.jpg"},{"name":"All-Arounder","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2939290/920d14aed4a1b9ff1afab3f826c8a721280b64bb.jpg"},{"name":"Hothead","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2939290/b271202252ec6eb5a63a1154951591a5b5f18d07.jpg"},{"name":"Salty","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2939290/d4b0872dfeae1fd47ada8e5a8716bea4f71929d1.jpg"},{"name":"Naturalist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2939290/11ece5b57a39e3fe17da32c4b22d2a013246160f.jpg"},{"name":"Aviator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2939290/64041c618333715023b68bfaccdb6f7c55c45568.jpg"},{"name":"Lightning Rod","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2939290/c8cabbc4916bc9191116571c422a8180a257d087.jpg"},{"name":"Mountaineer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2939290/bb21fdfdb10849cbbe49bd674d9013d40ec8bf22.jpg"},{"name":"Beachgoer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2939290/c1ffaf2a93f03e0a8f30a7ad87a0db3bca102adb.jpg"},{"name":"Ice Cold","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2939290/027dc35914d8e3f5dc661fb9f14b1d68e64f71b7.jpg"}],"total":27},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2939290/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1718835404","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2939290/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1718835404","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2939290/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718835404","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2939290/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718835404","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Pelago is a creature-catching adventure game!
