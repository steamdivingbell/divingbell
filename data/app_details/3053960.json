{"about_the_game":"Hi, I'm Joshicus and I spent about a month creating this <br />\r\ngame in Aseprite and GameMaker2 before handing it over to <br />\r\nmy friend KanjiCoder to put up here on Steam. Know that <br />\r\nany money you decide to give us will go toward our future <br />\r\ngame endeavors. I hope you enjoy my simple game. Make sure <br />\r\nto check out the demo before you buy!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen played perfectly, this game can be completed in just <br />\r\nunder 6 minutes. However, that feat is very very difficult.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBasically you will fail a lot. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere's no health; no lives, no saves, no continues. <br />\r\nThere isn't even a pause button. <br />\r\nThere are 6 levels which you will generally have to <br />\r\ntraverse both forward and backward within the course <br />\r\nof a single run. Each level takes about 30 seconds to <br />\r\ntravel across. And in-between each level there is an <br />\r\nautomatic pause screen where you do have a chance to <br />\r\ncollect yourself and take a break if you need.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo yeah. Check it out. The demo is just the first level <br />\r\nwith the room transitions turned off.
