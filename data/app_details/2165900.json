It\u2019s described as a metal soundtrack on the game\u2019s store page, and it accompanies the gameplay and the art style of the game perfectly, hyping you up to go against more and more bosses and levels. I genuinely believe that without the music and sound design, the game would not be played to its truest form.\u201d<br>POP! by INQUIRER<br><br>\u201cWe also can't talk about Good Knight without mentioning the absolutely rockin' tracks. Some of the best I've ever heard since Lords of Thunder and Ys, and that was a long time ago. They're like a mix between those games and some of ZUN's work on Touhou -- mixing classical instruments with hard rock and speed metal. Just amazing music that you have to hear, and it's perfect for the game. I'm telling you now, it's next-level shit, and it'll have you looking to buy that soundtrack.\u201d<br>Shmup Junkie<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2165900/ss_fd42023b1c33e4bc2095e50d1dda65e2db7fe822.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664613169","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2165900/ss_fd42023b1c33e4bc2095e50d1dda65e2db7fe822.600x338.jpg?t=1664613169"}],"short_description":"Good Knight's original soundtrack composed by LEAF XCEED Music Division, available in MP3 320 CBR!","steam_appid":2165900,"support_info":{"email":"alexevaldez@gmail.com","url":"https://goodknightgame.com"},"type":"music","website":"https://leafxceedmusicdivision.wordpress.com/"}
