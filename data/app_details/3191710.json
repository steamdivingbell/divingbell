{"about_the_game":"Our Ascent is an incremental roguelite RPG with many layers of metaprogression. The game is currently in the Alpha Testing phase!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main gameplay loop is similar to that of a traditional RPG. Level up, upgrade your stats, buy equipment, etc. Where this game differs is through the incremental roguelite mechanics. You can only fight a certain number of enemies before the run ends, and once a run ends your levels and stats get reset. In exchange, you keep your equipment and powerful buffs which let you explore much further than before. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith silly dialogue and nearly guaranteed progress, this is a simple, casual game. But for those who want to reach the limit of what is possible, you are heavily rewarded for min-maxing your stat allocation, pathing to find the optimal routes, and choosing the best equipment for the current situation.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3191710/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726437505","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3191710/page.bg.jpg?t=1726437505","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3191710/f75cdc91e5b900dae4a4c7d095a554af2e3df4e5/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726437505","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3191710/f75cdc91e5b900dae4a4c7d095a554af2e3df4e5/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726437505","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Our Ascent is an incremental roguelite RPG with many layers of metaprogression.
