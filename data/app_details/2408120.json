It requires 2 controllers to play local multiplayer.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A BYU Center for Animation Capstone Project</h2>This project was planned, developed, and tested over the course of a little less than a year, completely through student work. We are proud of what we were able to accomplish in that time period. However, please note that Solar Showdown is not representative of a complete game. Additionally, many of the students who worked on this have moved on to other coursework, internships, or jobs, meaning future work on this game after release is unlikely. While what we have released showcases the core mechanics and gameplay features we wanted in our game, it may contain bugs, optimization problems, and other issues that impact the overall experience.
