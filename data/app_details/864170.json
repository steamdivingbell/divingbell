Set in a medieval European city during the early 1900, you\u2019ll scale towering castles, leap across rooftops, and dive into the fray against hordes of twisted enemies. With every attempt, grow stronger, unlock new abilities, and push back against the darkness that threatens to consume everything. The Midnight Horde is relentless, but you\u2019ll adapt, overcome, and survive.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/864170/extras/jump-between-towers-6--optimize.gif?t=1733329472\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Reverse Bullet Hell, with Gravity and Parkour!</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Prepare for a whole new bullet hell experience where movement is just as important as any sword or spell.
