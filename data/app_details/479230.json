{"about_the_game":"This DLC adds the Himalayan Ecosystem to your Tyto Ecology game, opening up a new type of biodome you can create with 28 new species!<br><br>We were deeply inspired by the incredible region of the Himalayas, which is why we chose to feature it in our first expansion pack. Nestled in the Indian subcontinent, it spans almost 2,500km wide, across seven countries. This diverse region is home to an immense number of species, with more being discovered each year. It's also home to many charismatic, well-known species, such as red pandas, snow leopards, pangolins, bengal tigers, Asian elephants, one-horned rhinos, and Asian black bears, all of which are also included in this expansion!<br><br>The Himalayas' region is threatened, with many of these species extremely endangered due to illegal poaching, climate change, and growing human populations fragmenting the space available for wildlife.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">We will be donating $1 from each Himalayas DLC sold.</h2>We'll be donating to the World Wildlife Fund, an organization that does impactful sustainability work in the Himalayas.
