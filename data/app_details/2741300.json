{"about_the_game":"La Bestia: The Migrant's Long Journey is a virtual reality game that provides an immersive experience of the challenges faced by migrants on their journey from South America to the United States of America. The game is set on a train called La Bestia, where you take on the role of a migrant. You will encounter many other migrants on the train, each with their own unique story to share. These stories are based on real events and offer insights into the difficulties and experiences of migrants. You need to move around the environment and get closer to each migrant to hear their story.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game consists of two scenes. The first scene places you in a train car with other immigrants. It is a contemplative experience where you can interact with the migrants, who are represented as statues, by simply moving around. The second scene takes place inside a train car, and the mechanics are the same as in the first scene. The game automatically switches between the two scenes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is a moving experience that offers a glimpse into the harsh reality of the migrant journey. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this version, all the migrant dialogues are in Spanish.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2741300/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733260693","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2741300/page.bg.jpg?t=1733260693","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2741300/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733260693","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2741300/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733260693","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"La Bestia: The Migrant's Long Journey is a virtual reality game that provides an immersive experience of the challenges faced by migrants on their journey from South America to the United States of America.
