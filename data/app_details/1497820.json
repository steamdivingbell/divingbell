But as their train rumbles along the tracks, the sudden crack of a pistol and the clatter of hooves marks the beginning of a new journey that will take them even deeper into the lawless frontier!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter saving a local mayor from certain doom, Jack and Jill begin a mission to build a railroad that connects his small town to the civilized world. But as they pacify the unforgiving terrain, Raging Buford and his band of thieves stand in their way at every turn.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsing a simple but innovative bonus system that allows players to choose the best strategy for completing a level, you'll have to work smart to rebuild settlements and think fast to keep the outlaws at bay.
