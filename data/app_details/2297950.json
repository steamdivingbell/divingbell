{"about_the_game":"Bring subtle sounds and music to your game with atmosphere! ayato sound create is back with another music pack, this time offering up 12 BGM tracks that focus on atmospheric sounds over bombastic beats and orchestral overtures. Let your players explore your game world as water burbles in the background and birds tweet cheerfully in the trees above their heads, or have wind chimes jingle in the background while they piece together important clues at the latest crime scene.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNot every map or cutscene needs blasting music for its audio, and this pack knows that. Mixing together simple instrumentals melodies with natural background noises, these songs create the perfect tracks for setting the mood without the need to add in extra BGS files. Let a slow piano piece play while rain patters in the background and the creaks of nearby neighbors pop in here and there to remind your hero that they\u2019re not alone no matter how gloomy they feel in the moment, or have the crunch of footsteps and bird songs play as your players wander a not-quite-empty park early in the morning. Set your players off-balance with an eerie electronic tune playing over the thump of feet and muffled calls of children playing during a cutscene where your hero recalls the first time they met the villain, and have the whoosh of cars driving by and calmer music ground them in the present once they step back outside into the sunlight. Each track comes in multiple file formats, so it\u2019s simple to add right into your current project.
