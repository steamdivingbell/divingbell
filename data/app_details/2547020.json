Occasionally, a new group of fish will drop in the &quot;Local Fish Store&quot;. Every single fish is unique, so there are a limited number of fish in the game. This also means fish can go extinct! Use this to your advantage... try to build a monopoly on a single species of fish!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2547020/extras/Desc_Automate.gif?t=1717730529\" /><br><br>You can balance your tank's ecosystem by having just the right amount of light, nutrients, and CO2. This means fewer water changes and less cleaning. Have newly bred fish go straight to the store, and collaborate with your friends (and guild) to care for a tank. Go run your dream automated, fish-selling, $$$-making fish store!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2547020/extras/Desc_Grow.gif?t=1717730529\" /><br><br>Some fish are hardy, and some are delicate. To create the optimal environment to breed healthy fish to sell, you must cultivate plants, fine tune water parameters, and feed premium fish foods. Earn currency for each fish or plant your guild sells, then use it to buy more fish species to expand your stock. You can also sell fish to institutions, like the Biology Lab, as long as you breed them up to their standards!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2547020/extras/Desc_Prev_CoryEmerge.gif?t=1717730529\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2547020/extras/Desc_Design.gif?t=1717730529\" /><br><br>Use a beautifully arranged and aquascaped tank to market your fish and increase sales as other players scroll through the &quot;Local Fish Store&quot;.
