{"about_the_game":"Burgleville is a 2D top down stealth game where you'll sneak around, break into houses, pick locks, crack safes, steal stuff, run from the police, and go on missions.<br><br>You can switch anytime between story missions at unique hand-crafted locations and exploring procedurally generated neighborhoods and houses.<br><br>As you progress, you'll visit new places, meet interesting characters, gain new skills and abilities, and make story choices that can change the ending.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><strong>So many items!</strong><br>There are over 1200 items, with multiple variants to keep things interesting. From different types of clothes and accessories, to toys and electronics, to foods and drinks, and more.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3147130/extras/desc_items.png?t=1736086067\" /><br><br><strong>Unique Story Missions</strong><br>Each character has their own set of missions for you. They usually involve stealing, but can also include sabotage, spying, destroying evidence, and even babysitting. Some missions can be completed in different ways, which can affect the outcome.<br><br><strong>Unique Locations</strong><br>Apart from houses, apartments, and mansions, you'll also visit a supermarket, an office, a multi-level ship, a library, a multi-floor hotel, and a prison, just to name a few.<br><br><strong>Characters and Factions</strong><br>You'll meet lots of different characters, with very different styles, and they all have their own agenda.

You can switch back and forth at any time. Everything is accessible either way.<br><br><strong>Unique Aesthetic</strong><br>All pixel art is hand-drawn. Everything has a cartoony, DIY feel.<br><br><strong>Collectibles</strong><br>You'll get rewards for collecting items. There are also hidden collectibles to find, so be on the lookout!<br><br><strong>Procedural Generation</strong><br>Each time you visit a neighborhood that's not a hand-crafted story location, you'll get a brand new city that you've never seen before. And every house in it will also be unique. You'll never see the same one twice.<br><br><strong>Quickplay</strong><br>Whenever you just want to jump in and sneak around and steal things, you can enter quick play and visit an infinite number of procedurally generated neighborhoods.<br><br><strong>Customizable Safehouse</strong><br>If you proceed through the real estate missions, you'll get your own safehouse. You can change the layout between a few options and recruit people to move into your safehouse and provide services like fencing, bribing, and training.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay Mechanics</h2><br><strong>Suspicion and Notoriety</strong><br>Suspicion lowers over time, but notoriety does not. You can bribe specific people to lower it.<br><br><strong>The Police</strong><br>Cops will follow you if your suspicion is high, and they'll chase you if you are wanted. Don't let them see you do anything illegal. Try not to get busted!<br><br><strong>Put on your Mask</strong><br>Your mask will protect you from notoriety, but it's also suspicious. So you may want to take it off when you're not doing something illegal.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3147130/extras/mask_and_lock_1.gif?t=1736086067\" /><br><br><strong>Picking Locks</strong><br>You can pick locked doors and crack locked safes (learn the ability first). Talk to a trainer to level up these skills to get a better success rate.<br><br><strong>Inventory Management</strong><br>A big part of the game is choosing what to steal. You can't carry it all. Do you look for specific items for a current mission? Or do you choose the items with the highest value? You don't know the value until you talk to the fencer, but you'll remember the range of values you've seen before for an item. Then you also have to think about weight and volume. Some things are heavier or take up more space. Do you choose to steal a few large valuable items or many small cheap items? Just watch out for cheap items that are large or heavy. The best is a small, valuable item. But you might not be able to sell those right away.<br><br><strong>Skills and Abilities</strong><br>As you gain experience, you'll level up and earn skill points. You can talk to a trainer to use those skill points to improve different skills. Prioritize the style that you like to play. Do you prefer kicking in doors or picking locks? Do you want to be fast or do you want to carry more?<br><br><strong>Change Characters</strong><br>The story will be the same, but you can change the way you look.<br><br><strong>Animals</strong><br>Quack! Ruff! Neigh! Mooooo! Cats and dogs move around on their own. Some might even follow you. Just watch out for skunks.<br><br><strong>Vehicles</strong><br>You can buy different vehicles to stash your stuff in while you're in the city, giving you more space to hold the things you steal! You start with a bicycle, but you can get a school bus, an ice cream truck, a postal van, a delivery van, and more.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3147130/extras/vehicles.gif?t=1736086067\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Attention to Details</h2><br>Some effort was put into polishing little details to make this game more fun and interesting.
