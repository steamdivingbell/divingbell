{"about_the_game":"Fight off hordes of enemies using a combination of magical powers and constructing defensive towers!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnleash your magical potential with classic spells such as Fireball to burn your enemies to a crisp, or send them back from where they came with Wind Blast! These can be used to deal a lot of damage, or to buy you some time when things are getting too hectic!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDefend your base with towers, from crossbows to cannons to flamers you must decide where and when to place each of these in order to maximize their utility or killing potential.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdapt - The level layouts may look the same when replaying, but the waves are partially randomized, so focusing your defences in one area may work the first time but you may need to sell and move your towers around to meet the threats. The waves tend to follow themes for each level, and as such, the most optimal towers and placements will differ between all of the levels - you won't be able to get away with using the same strategy over and over!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe orcs are cunning, and have constructed siege weapons that may tear down some of your weaker walls, leaving you exposed! Don't forget to cover all angles, and above all else, secure the center of your base!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe undead are quite durable and tend to come back even after they are slain! They often use dark magic to weaken their enemies - that would be you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe bandits value nothing more than personal gain, and they will ransack your towers, and base, stealing your resources!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpecifics of this demo:<br />\r\nThis demo includes 3 playable levels from the &quot;Grasslands&quot; realm and features around 20 minutes of gameplay","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2952350/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1722224654","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2952350/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1722224654","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2952350/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1722224654","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2952350/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1722224654","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Fight off hordes of enemies using a combination of magical powers and constructing defensive towers!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnleash your magical potential with classic spells such as Fireball to burn your enemies to a crisp, or send them back from where they came with Wind Blast!
