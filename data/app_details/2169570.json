Play as Liam or Sophia, the newest member of the Lilygrove Scout Corps, as the young mice find themselves on the journey of a lifetime to save their home from ruthless pirates.

Their initiate ceremonies are cut short when sea rats attack their beloved home. As the senior Scouts rally for battle, it's up to the Scout Corps' newest recruit to outwit the enemy, light the beacon, and summon aid from the surrounding woodlands - before there is nothing left to save.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2169570/extras/Steam_Description_Section_Header_2.png?t=1722880754\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Scout Act 2</h2>The beacon is lit, troops rally to fend off the invading searats, and Liam reunites with his dear Sophia beneath the Lilygrove Lighthouse, but not all is well. Scumsnout's vengeful cries can be heard in the distance and it is revealed that our Scout's betrothed has been poisoned by the wereat's venomous bite. With no time to spare, the couple race to the Winsome Wraith, where a mysterious and dangerous stoat may have the antidote they seek. As if things weren't bad enough, the sea rats are moving inland and the shadow of a large predatory bird lurks just at the edge of the woods.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2169570/extras/Steam_Description_Section_Header_3.png?t=1722880754\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Scout: Act 3</h2>After being mortally poisoned by Scumsnout's vicious maw, our young Scouts have made it to the Winsome Wraith in one piece, if just barely.
