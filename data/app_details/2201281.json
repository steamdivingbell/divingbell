{"about_the_game":"Are you a MV user who has been searching for some beautiful generator parts? Then you need to check out Another World Heroine Generator 2! Gee-kun-soft has painstakingly recreated their MZ generator part for MV, meaning you can finally give your characters a dream makeover! With 42 parts that include accessory, hair, eye, and clothing options, this pack is here to help you find the perfect pieces for each of your female characters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n20 different clothing options cover all sorts of possible personalities and classes. Dress your mages in caped outfits or two-tone asymmetrical dresses, while the party\u2019s dancer captures the enemies\u2019 attention with her moves in her body-hugging crop top and pants! Top the outfit with one of 5 accessories to really tie the look together. Maybe your sage wears a lightweight crown with decorative curves, or your maid-turned-assassin still wears her ruffled headband!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith 5 front hair, 5 rear hair, and 5 eye options, you\u2019ll have an easy time giving each heroine a unique faceset. Different eye shapes can turn a simple smile into an honest grin from a young and positive archer or a knowing smirk from the party\u2019s resident bad girl. Keep long hair out of your warrior\u2019s face by tying it in a low ponytail or up in a braided bun, or let her keep it simple by cutting it off at her shoulders. And to finish your beast girl party member, make sure to add in this pack\u2019s fluffy ears and tail! Each part is numbered in a way to avoid other resources, so you can drop it into your generator folder without a worry and start updating characters instantly.
