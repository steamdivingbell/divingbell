Repeat.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Procedurally generated Dark Forest</h2><br>Choose the game difficulty, go into the Dark Forest, find powerful artifacts, and improve them using runestones. Destroy enemies on your way, and go through ten Dark Portals to stop their invasion. Find and destroy the Lich Lord to complete the game and get your rewards.
