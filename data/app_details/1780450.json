{"about_the_game":"<strong>Buyer beware: Buggy Game is NOT an arcade game!</strong> This is a <strong>simcade</strong> game with a simulated tyre model, load transfer, differential, power curve and everything!<br><br>It's easy to pick up, but you can't just crash your way to the finish. You are going to need to work your way up the pack with style and grace. And a little bit of well-timed aggression, because the <strong>AI is very competitive</strong>!<br><br>The main event is the <strong>campaign mode</strong>, where you try to become champion by collecting the most points while racing <strong>procedurally generated tracks</strong> through various worlds, but beware - if you <strong>damage your car too much, it's all over</strong>.<br><br>There's also a <strong>time trial mode</strong>, with <strong>ghost cars</strong> from both your best run, and the developer's par record. Are you better than me? Only one way to find out!<br><br>This game is best played using a gamepad with analog controls. Keyboard and steering wheels are also supported.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1780450/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1661270049","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1780450/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1661270049","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1780450/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1661270049","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1780450/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1661270049","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>Buyer beware: Buggy Game is NOT an arcade game!</strong> This is a <strong>simcade</strong> game with a simulated tyre model, load transfer, differential, power curve and everything!<br><br>It's easy to pick up, but you can't just crash your way to the finish.
