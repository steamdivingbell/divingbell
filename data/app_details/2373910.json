Players can select different &quot;Cores&quot; and mech skills to design their ideal team. The game features three elemental types: Frozen, Burn, and Electric. By strategically combining these skills, players can trigger &quot;chemical reactions,&quot; such as Frozen's crowd control effects, Burn's damage over time, or Electric's high chain-attack damage.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Diverse Class Roles:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0\u00a0 There are five distinct classes in the game, each with unique abilities and tactical roles:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>-</strong> <strong>Striker:</strong> Excels in close combat, quickly closing the gap with enemies and disrupting their formations.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>-</strong> <strong>Keystone:</strong> Specializes in defense, using shield-based weapons to block incoming attacks and create space for teammates to deal damage.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>- Buster:</strong> Specializes in long-range bombardment, using heavy weaponry to anchor the team\u2019s firepower.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>- Bullseye:</strong> A sniper class that excels at long-range attacks and can eliminate enemies from a distance.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>- Apostle:</strong> Provides backline support, specializes in control-type weapons, and acts as the team's tactical core.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Mech Forging and Upgrades:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game features a gacha-like mech forging system where players collect blueprints and materials to craft new mechs.
