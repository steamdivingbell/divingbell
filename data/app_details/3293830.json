{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game tells a horror story where players, in first-person perspective, lead their girlfriend/friend on an adventure in a Japanese-style ancient town. Throughout the game, they encounter skeletons, ghosts, zombies, and numerous events that defy common sense. Players use the WSAD keys to control movement, press B to open the inventory, M to view the map, and E to retract the equipped item. Players can possess various items such as swords, guns, umbrellas, magic, and deployable obstacles, which can interact with monsters in the scene.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">On a night shrouded in continuous rain, you and your girlfriend found yourselves lost in a desolate Japanese-style town. The streets were deserted, with only the sound of rain tapping against old tiles and stone pavements. It is said that this town harbors ancient secrets, and you must uncover these mysteries to find your way back home.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As the night grew darker, you decided to look for a place to take shelter from the rain. By chance, you discovered an old Japanese teahouse that seemed to have been abandoned. Pushing the door open, a musty smell hit you, but to your surprise, the interior was unexpectedly clean and tidy. You decided to stay here for a while to collect your thoughts.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In a corner of the teahouse, you found a yellowed journal that recorded the history of the town and some perplexing events. The journal mentioned an ancient ritual said to be closely connected with the town's secrets. You realized that to solve the riddle of finding your way home, you might need to perform this ritual. In the teahouse, you carefully read every word of the journal, trying to understand the meaning and steps of the ritual. The last page of the journal mentioned a crucial clue\u2014a hidden ancient shrine in the center of town, where the final key to unlocking all the mysteries lay.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You decided not to delay any further, picked up the journal, and stepped out of the teahouse. The rain seemed to have eased, but the night wind still carried a chill. The shrine at the center of town appeared especially eerie, with trees swaying in the wind, making a rustling sound. The entrance to the shrine was covered with vines and weeds, as if resisting the entry of outsiders.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You carefully cleared the obstacles at the entrance and stepped into the shrine's courtyard. In front of the main hall of the shrine, there was a stone altar with some strange symbols and patterns. Following the instructions in the journal, you began to place offerings and light candles in a specific order.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As the ritual progressed halfway, the environment suddenly changed. The sound of the wind weakened, the rain stopped, and the surroundings became eerily quiet. You felt an indescribable force flowing through the air, as if something was awakening.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Suddenly, the candles on the altar began to flicker, and a deep, ancient voice echoed in the air, seemingly telling the story of the town's past. As the voice faded, a beam of light shot out from the center of the altar, illuminating a hidden passage.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You realized that this passage would lead you to find your way home. Although your hearts were filled with the unknown and fear, you knew that only by bravely moving forward could you uncover the town's secrets and end this adventure shrouded in mystery.</p>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3293830?t=1740059506","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3293830/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1740059506","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3293830/a3660f61965245da2afa5779605bf65614cf57d6/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1740059506","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3293830/a3660f61965245da2afa5779605bf65614cf57d6/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1740059506","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"The game features zombies covered in blood, skeletons, terrifying faces, and other horror content.
