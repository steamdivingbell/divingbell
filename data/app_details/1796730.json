{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ABOUT SEARING</h2><br>SeaRing is a 2D indie action-puzzle RPG, putting a devilish twist on its predecessors by flipping the script and making defending the only way to attack. Submerge yourself in a world rich in lore, and be taken on a journey full of colourful and often comical storytelling, as you join the Princess of the Sea in a nostalgic quest to recover her mother\u2019s lost crown, become queen, and restore peace in a world now ruled by fire.<br><br>As you leave the Water Kingdom behind to venture into the desert, you\u2019ll meet witty and humorous NPCs, witness astonishing backdrops, and be carried by a soothing soundtrack!
