Each time, players can create different combinations of characteristics and appearances for their tank.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There is no specific plot in the game; instead, the focus is on the gameplay and delivering maximum enjoyment for players.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">One of the main features of TANK ZERO is the ability to create a customized tank. Each part of the tank has an impact on its characteristics, with the cannon being particularly significant, as it determines the type of shells that can be fired. Players can choose between a standard cannon that fires classic shells and variations, such as incendiary and nitrogen shells. Alternatively, they can opt for a spray turret that uses propane or acid to deal damage to both enemies and allies.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">But that's not all! In addition to building a tank, you will also need to choose a pilot and a class. The pilot gives you a passive ability, while the class grants you an active one.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>There are four unique game modes available for you to choose from:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">1. <i>Last Stand Mode</i> - the main gameplay mode. You can play alone or with friends, defending your headquarters against waves of enemies. As you kill enemies, you earn money, which can be used to repair your base, turrets, purchase weapons, or support AI-controlled allies.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">2. <i>Versus Mode</i> - this is where you and your friends become enemies for a short time. Divide into two teams and attempt to destroy each other's bases or reduce their health to zero. You also earn money for eliminating enemies and can use it to buy support allies or weapons for yourself.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">3. <i>Missions Mode</i> - here, you'll be given a series of tasks to complete. These range from simple defense missions to escort trains.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">4) <i>Classic Mode</i> - A homage to the classics. This mode will take you back to the good old days. In this mode, you will need to complete a series of levels designed in the classic style. Destroy the enemies and prevent them from reaching the headquarters (this mode is playable by a maximum of two players).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3325260/extras/\u0411\u0422\u0420_\u0437\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044b\u0439.png?t=1736661820\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3325260/extras/\u0422\u0430\u043d\u043a_\u043e\u0433\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0442_\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439.png?t=1736661820\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3325260/extras/\u041b\u0435\u0433\u043a\u0438\u0439_\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043a_2.png?t=1736661820\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3325260/extras/\u041c\u0435\u0433\u0430_\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043a_1.png?t=1736661820\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Game Features:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">*4 game modes; <br>*Tank customization with many variations; <br>*10 pilots giving a unique passive ability; <br>*10 classes, giving a unique active ability; <br>*More than 10 unique enemy types; <br>*More than 20 unique weapons; <br>*A commentator voicing what is going on;<br>*Ability to play up to 4 players online, via Remote Play;</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong><u>YOU ONLY NEED 1 COPY OF THE GAME TO INVITE UP TO 3 FRIENDS TO PLAY;</u></strong></p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Mega What?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3325260/4f3947890c6d91f98f4e8dbec26b1fc6deb2c8c6.jpg"},{"name":"All Assembled","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3325260/9e808a0233747e6efec7880fc86cc08c8a39c2b8.jpg"},{"name":"Nuclear Deterrence ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3325260/ecdcb64a507784a0bdf8355df67361bf275cafb8.jpg"},{"name":"Don't thank me!
