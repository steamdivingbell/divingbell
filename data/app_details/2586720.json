Your objective now is to uncover the fate of the previous expedition and find a way to escape this nightmarish location!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>How to play?</strong></h2><br>You move your astro with WASD keys, and use mouse buttons for bashing (melee weapon/utility) and firing magnets. The magnets and magnetic forces are the highlights of the game - cleverly reposition objects, items and creatures in order to defeat them. There are many environmental hazards dangerous to creatures only, but NOT to you! Use them wisely!<br><br>There are many types of physical objects involved in gameplay, like big rolling spiked boulders, exploding mines, throwing lances, deadly metal shards and so on.. All of those are free to use. The walls within cave are fully destructible. Remember, bashing (LMB) is the least effective way to defeat an enemy. Just push/throw them into the spikes or onto a devouring plant.
