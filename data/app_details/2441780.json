{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Arcadia Issue 016 - May 2022</h2>  Welcome to ARCADIA! Inspired by old-school tabletop magazines, ARCADIA is MCDM's digital magazine for 5th edition GMs and players. We hope you like it! <br> <br><strong> Masterwork Artisans</strong> by Jamie Flecknoe with illustrations by Gustavo Pelissari. Do you want a sweet new sword, but are too low-level to brave the lich's dungeon to get the nine lives stealer inside? Does that breastplate need an upgrade, but you can't afford an enchanter? This article has you covered with new nonmagical materials for crafting superior armor, ammunition, and weapons. Now almost any adventurer can afford to slice down foes with an obsidian greataxe while looking good in a suit of celestial silver chainmail! <br> <br><strong> The Crowned Genie</strong> by Ahmed Aljabry with illustrations by Martin Sobr. Born inside rare geodes, crowned genies carry incredible power. The evil ones cast knowledge-stealing curses, and the good create and preserve life. The jewels embedded in their elemental heads serve as a sign to others that these are exceptional genies. Forming an alliance with a crowned genie is as great a boon as making an enemy of one is a danger. Tread carefully, mortals! <br> <br><strong> The Blackweald</strong> by Michael E. Shea with illustrations by Matheus Graef. Folks visiting Mercy Street keep disappearing. What's more concerning is that hours after a victim goes missing, the person who reported the disappearance forgets ever having met the person. Something big and sinister lurks in the city district's shadows, devouring more than flesh and bones. Can the adventurers figure out what's hiding in plain sight before it erases them in this encounter for 7th-level characters? &quot;","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2441780/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1686059347","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2441780/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1686059347","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2441780/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1686059347","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2441780/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1686059347","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Arcadia Issue 016 - May 2022</h2>  Welcome to ARCADIA!
