{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Once upon a time, Lydia Whitaker woke up.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Alone and abandoned in the Whitaker Manor, once a testing ground for pseudoscience experiments, our female protagonist  navigates a mansion in an endless night, escaping a violent presence around every corner. She experiences other bizarre paranormal phenomena including an RGB nightmare, a haunted hedge maze, monsters in walls and more horrors. Discover the brutal truths that stay you from your freedom.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Explore over 100 rooms complete with light switches, rooms ranging from an arboretum to a recording studio and even a working A/C system.\u00a0You will solve puzzles, discover lore and be resourceful while escaping a variety of threats and the terror of your relentless pursuer - because if you die, it's game over. No reloading will save you. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game's story is inspired by &quot;mystery box&quot; styled media and unlike other single player titles, you can go any direction, any time after the introduction. Be careful though - your enemy will react depending on where you go. Many of the game's puzzles also change - either in location or solution - each playthrough and the game's final stage is different every time you play.\u00a0Much can consume your time outside the chases as well - adopt a cat, learn yoga and even get in on some retrogaming - complete with its own epic boss fight.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">/R uses a unique visual style that is claustrophobic and atmospheric with Lydia seeming to be under constant surveillance of a dodgy CRT-style display. With an eerie, pulsing soundtrack by the Amazing Doctor Tentacles and environmental ambience all around, this is a game that begs the use of headphones or a sound system. The graphics were hand-drawn before pixel editing and no AI-based generation was used in the making of this title, cobbled together between breaks at work by a one-man development team. This is an indie game for indie gamers.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Run, hide, adapt and survive - or die.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Closing song &quot;A Parasite's Lullaby&quot; is written and performed by Electric Armchair and is licensed/used by permission of the artist.</p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"asylum","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3396850/b627976cb8c3bcc04f5c293c881815f5c6556545.jpg"},{"name":"gatophobia","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3396850/c7a38bbae54e9c36f2f06c18688bf54c987af278.jpg"},{"name":"acedia","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3396850/4353dda76acc09f29af9069d07ab939b99f1b589.jpg"},{"name":"neurasthenia","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3396850/8c2f6abd420ba248fbee39ee81856fb8c6bb03fb.jpg"},{"name":"oneirophrenia","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3396850/c70ef55004a4d0445d60f534fd67245002a7d945.jpg"},{"name":"dromomania","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3396850/d5e0d228925c384a5fd6fc6bb37fa7ae9cdd4a23.jpg"},{"name":"glass delusion","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3396850/f7446b773562da07862850b11e086f600c611e43.jpg"},{"name":"monomania","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3396850/1599912e765e4d30e6e0ec808773c4160347b613.jpg"},{"name":"overcoming vapours","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3396850/10c12839af6a3839b169514891fd776da82222de.jpg"},{"name":"circular insanity","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3396850/d781c5028aca0d9317fb53a432f100da9fed6b2a.jpg"}],"total":15},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3396850/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737701225","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3396850/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1737701225","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3396850/d968042aaf393e04512c8574cbe9aef8ee2c4413/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737701225","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3396850/d968042aaf393e04512c8574cbe9aef8ee2c4413/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737701225","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Once upon a time, Lydia Whitaker woke up.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Alone and abandoned in the Whitaker Manor, once a testing ground for pseudoscience experiments, our female protagonist  navigates a mansion in an endless night, escaping a violent presence around every corner.
