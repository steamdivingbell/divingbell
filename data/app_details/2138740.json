{"about_the_game":"No weapons, no leveling up, no loot, no drama. Escapism for the modern age. Throw Your Phone (Into The Ocean) is exactly what it sounds like wrapped up in a surrealist package (plus a few surprises along the way). It's just a simple game where you can live out your secret fantasy of throwing a series of phones into a series of beautiful bodies of water. A meditative experience and cathartic way to deal with our attachment to technology.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Arcade</h2>A scored Arcade Mode where you toss your phones into a series of objectives as they float down the river or drift by your sea-scape.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Zen</h2>With no objectives and infinite phones to throw, Zen Mode is the ultimate escape. Take a walk through the palm trees on a moonlit tropical shoreline or witness the northern lights among the northern pines.<br><br><br>Featuring hyper-realistic water as the centerpiece around a series of extremely beautiful stylized cartoonish environments.<br><br>An immersive experience from the moment you open the game, you'll start off at the tiki bar where you can customize your settings and maybe visit the jukebox to set up some relaxing tunes for your visit. Like a vacation without leaving your home. <br><br>With none of the environmental hazards of throwing your real phone into real nature, <i>Throw Your Phone</i> is the responsible choice, and the ultimate simple satire simulator.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2138740/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1713461671","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2138740/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1713461671","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2138740/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1713461671","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2138740/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1713461671","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"No weapons, no leveling up, no loot, no drama.
