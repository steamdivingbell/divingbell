{"about_the_game":"Race Arcade is the ultimate top down racing game with a strong retro feeling and a super smooth gameplay. It is a fresh and evolved racing experience that seamlessly combines all the best parts from the good old racing games to the most recent technologies and game mechanics.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Vehicles</strong></h2>Cars and their handling are the most interesting part of every racing game. In Race Arcade there are six different cars each having a distinctive handling model. Vehicles vary from a fast sports car to a tractor and even up to a real UFO. Various color options expand the vehicle selection up to 60 diverse options. Extremely balanced gameplay keeps all vehicles competitive against each other. Learning the benefits of each vehicle is part of the fun that keeps the race interesting.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Gameplay</strong></h2>Polished game controls and car handling are the most important thing in a racing game. A great amount of work has been done in this area for Race Arcade to reach the same quality of gameplay that has been seen in the best archetypes of this genre. Controls in Race Arcade are a result of careful consideration, thousands of testing hours and decades worth of experience from video games.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Single player</strong></h2>In Race Arcade there is also a vast single player mode included. In total there are three different single player game modes, which are single races, time trials and career modes. Single races are quick and fun to play at any time, but the real bread and butter of the single player are the lengthy careers that are unique for each vehicle in the game. On the other hand, the time trial mode is great for fine tuning driving lines towards the perfection, but also helps to achieve new lap records and to learn tricks and traits of each car in the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Multiplayer</strong></h2>Multiplayer can be played both online and locally. In the online multiplayer compete against players around the world in the 100 fast paced tracks the game has to offer. Online multiplayer is supported up to 10 players. Race Arcade is also a perfect game to play locally from one screen up to 6 players. Sit on a couch with your friends in front of a big screen, or gather around one keyboard to experience the retro racing as it was played back in the 90\u2019s.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Editor</strong></h2>Track editor is easy to use and it includes all the same tools used by the developers. Creating custom tracks and sharing them with the community via Steam Workshop is fully integrated into the game. Initially there are 100 tracks in the game, but with the editor and community created content there are literally limitless amount of tracks to play.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>GAME FEATURES</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Over 100 diverse tracks<br></li><li>Online multiplayer up to 10 players<br></li><li>Local multiplayer up to 6 players<br></li><li>Extensive single player <br></li><li>Easy to use track editor<br></li><li>Steam Workshop support<br></li><li>Choose from six different vehicles<br></li><li>Multiple game modes </li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Starting line","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/355010/9515749c9ead50f2d1d8994cc4d8e2c340594f8f.jpg"},{"name":"All your car are belong to me","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/355010/9efdc0207353f33d644763680b4121f40b41dc70.jpg"},{"name":"A racer gotta do what racer gotta do","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/355010/cfe3095455f2b8ee83f8dfd17b5807dcf0314ddd.jpg"},{"name":"Tr00 racer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/355010/e8d97d916c79677cbe882821d24d4f684e932508.jpg"},{"name":"Points taken","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/355010/715439059ba78ade1897906ca3a84624ff0cbd45.jpg"},{"name":"Croesus Coinus","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/355010/48b8567422bb631ea82c8e23afe39d8ce219e8b5.jpg"},{"name":"Hot Rod","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/355010/0a08841712c93c518315a156a98b3e51e3698878.jpg"},{"name":"UFOS","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/355010/a25bf99c4aabf01eb88d2c80f668f2f7c3a834e5.jpg"},{"name":"Unrecognised Floating Ornament","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/355010/88adcbc34bd4dd1f38c11f7db7ae5d707139727b.jpg"},{"name":"Requirement For Velocity","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/355010/7f3ad1cda006bf40454721053a2e20a4cae34fba.jpg"}],"total":28},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/355010/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1711112551","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/355010/page.bg.jpg?t=1711112551","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/355010/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1711112551","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/355010/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1711112551","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Race Arcade is the ultimate top down racing game with a strong retro feeling and a super smooth gameplay.
