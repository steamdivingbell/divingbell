Desperate to find a source of income, he takes a night shift as a security guard at an abandoned underground parking garage. What seems like a simple job at first quickly becomes unsettling as the atmosphere of the place stirs a strange sense of unease.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">From the very start of your shift, you sense that this place is far from harmless. Dim lighting, endless concrete corridors, and the distant echo of your footsteps create an overwhelming feeling of isolation. But gradually, that feeling evolves into something far more sinister\u2014shadows begin to move, sounds emerge from places where no one should be, and it feels like someone, or something, is watching you from the darkness.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The player is drawn into a dark story where reality intertwines with illusions.
