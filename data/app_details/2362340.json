{"about_the_game":"Welcome to the mad world of Russell's Range!<br />\r\nYour job is to simply complete your tasks through each night, however the job isn't as easy as it seems. You find yourself fighting for your life as the night progresses in a survival horror management game where not everything is as it seems. You will need to perform tasks through the night such as setting the tables ready for the next day, and placing decoration in their proper places. However there are creatures determined to catch you, so you must use your flashlight, cameras and wits to fend them off and survive the night.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe demo contains 1 night and doesn't include features such as the point system or unlockables which will be available in the full game. The demo night will help balance the difficulty of the main game for release and does not represent the whole experience which will be available on release of Russell's Range.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRussell's Range was created using unreal engine and blender!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2362340/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1712921474","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2362340/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1712921474","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2362340/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1712921474","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2362340/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1712921474","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to the mad world of Russell's Range!<br />\r\nYour job is to simply complete your tasks through each night, however the job isn't as easy as it seems.
