{"about_the_game":"The design of the &quot;Twin Beech&quot; D18 proved so adaptable that Beechcraft Aircraft Corporation eventually produced 32 versions \u2014 and more than 9,000 total aircraft \u2014 from 1937 to 1969. They served in a wide variety of roles from passenger transport, to mail carrier, and even as a military trainer for navigators and bombardiers. The E-flite\u00ae Beechcraft D18 1.5m is the most convenient, well-equipped, and easiest-to-fly scale model of the unique general aviation aircraft yet! Its fully-molded EPO airframe is finished with a classic trim scheme and is outfitted with numerous scale details. Functional features such as LED navigation lights, retractable landing gear, and flaps further increase its realism. The 3S and 4S compatible power system includes an exclusive Spektrum\u2122 Avian\u2122 Dual Smart ESC, and the BNF\u00ae Basic version is also equipped with an AR631 receiver to deliver real-time telemetry data along with AS3X\u00ae and SAFE\u00ae Select technologies. The Beechcraft D18 1.5m turns the aviation classic into a modern-day RC marvel that's practical for a wide range of pilots to enjoy!<br><br>This model is equipped with Horizon Hobby and Spektrum exclusive AS3X (Artificial Stabilization \u2013 3-aXis) and optional-use SAFE (Sensor Assisted Flight Envelope) Select technologies, and when SAFE Select is turned on using the mode switch (B on the Spektrum InterLink DX controller) it offers:<br><strong>Pitch and Bank Angle Limits</strong><br>These envelope limits keep the airplane from rolling or pitching upside down.
