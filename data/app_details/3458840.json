{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Gather heroes, travel to unknown lands, and face monsters threatening Atven.  With tactical gameplay, move your characters and target your spells on a hexagonal grid. You will face hordes of enemies through expeditions, where your placement and your understanding of your enemies will be keys to success, reward and power.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Send your team through your portal, and complete missions. Don't let your portal be destroyed, as you will need it to gather all rewards safely. Between missions, you will be safe to upgrade your team permanently, and become stronger and stronger to defeat mighty bosses.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Upgrade your characters</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When joining the world of Atven, you may choose 2 out of 10 mysterious heroes, but they won't be enough to reach your goals. They will need to be upgraded through their spells, their equipment, their perks and more. Unlock new characters to assemble teams of up to 4 characters. But be careful when sending them on missions as portal will decay faster the more heroes join fights. Choose your valiant team wisely, all characters have their unique strengths and weaknesses. Some characters reduce their damage taken and counter-attack, some  protect their allies with auras, while others deal a series of small damage to all in a large area.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Play in Coop with friends</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">All missions can be played in cooperation with friends. Bring your heroes with your friends, and team-up together. Up to 4 players can send a maximum of 4 characters each, meaning you can play with a total of 16 characters on the battlefield. Because Atven is simultaneous-turn tactical RPG, you can play at the same time as your friend: no need to wait for your friend to end their turn before you can play. Your save is shared across singleplayer and multiplayer play, so you can bring your team to play with friends and later take it in missions alone.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Overcome all challenges with tactical combos</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Atven is about understanding your enemies and create opportunities with everything your characters can offer on the battlefield. Featuring unique mechanics, take advantage of your spells to combine them and beat your enemies to a pulp. Meet legendary bosses, get through challenging trials and claim your prestige !</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3458840/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738096899","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3458840/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1738096899","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3458840/9ce73d74dd3882242a89430d64a39b2d41b48a90/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738096899","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3458840/9ce73d74dd3882242a89430d64a39b2d41b48a90/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738096899","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Gather heroes, travel to unknown lands, and face monsters threatening Atven.
