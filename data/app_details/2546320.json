Since witchcraft is illegal, the old witch Gudrun is masquerading as a healer. Away from the curious eyes of the villagers and the vindictive village priest, Eyfrid has been learning the secret art of magic under her guidance.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">However, Eyfrid's peaceful life is about to change. Soon she must venture out to the world alone, navigate through relationships, prejudice and the whims of a tyrant king while an ancient evil prepares to descend upon the world. To prevail against her many enemies, she must not only master her skills in spellcraft but make difficult choices that will determine the fate of the world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2546320/extras/witch_banner_red.png?t=1733155310\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your wise teacher has taught you the basics of witchcraft but it is up to you to hone your skills and master them. You will find that being a witch is not just about brewing the best potions, growing the finest herbs or casting the most devastating spells \u2013 it is about protecting the balance of the world. It is about holding the threads of destiny in your hands and gently pulling them towards the best direction \u2013 or at least, the direction that best suits you!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There are many paths that you can take on your journey to become a witch. Are you a kindly wisewoman who will devote her life to treating the sick and injured? A comfort-loving cottage witch who has the most beautiful garden? A fearless battlemage? Or perhaps you are a cunning sorceress who works from the shadows to bring the kingdom to its ruin \u2013 or its salvation. The vast world of Ervein offers many opportunities for a magic user. However, you must be cautious. Attract the wrong kind of attention and you might end up in a pyre!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2546320/extras/heart_banner_red.png?t=1733155310\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The world around you has many interesting people and creatures to meet.

You are a witch. Feared and despised by civilized society, you have been forced to live most of your life in a lie. In a world that is set against you, can you even find someone to love?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Not everyone you meet will be as they seem. The monster may have a heart of gold. The shy peasant girl may be hiding a dagger under her apron. And the carefree, lovable scoundrel? He might sweep you off your feet only to stab you in the gut.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">On your quest for love, you may find undying devotion, burning passion or twisted obsession. They say that love conquers all \u2013 but love is a weapon, capable of corrupting hearts and turning kingdoms to dust.
