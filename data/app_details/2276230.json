{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Descirption</h2>CubeRun2 is a <strong>rogue-lite</strong> game with shooter elements with a top view. Your task is to pass procedurally generated maps or test your skills with your friends in multiplayer PvP mode. The more part of the map you clear, the higher your final <i>reward</i>. There is a <strong>boss</strong> at each level. To complete the race, you need to beat him. The choice is yours, kill him as soon as you find him, or else search and clear rooms to increase your reward. For the received in-game currency, you can buy a new design for yourself, weapons and maps. <strong>Good luck!</strong>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Welcome!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2276230/56ffdf769bb27a4ec89ff0c6f984996ea4e04d97.jpg"},{"name":"First blood","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2276230/c7e29cb4acfbfaf744c62e896f4c7ca8602fa8a2.jpg"},{"name":"Professional killer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2276230/196db16ad4b9b84d06daa8f6e6fe0a42637d8a4b.jpg"},{"name":"It's so cozy here...","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2276230/1e33b80ef20f5a88d31334b9041e754dbf575f81.jpg"},{"name":"Is this paradise?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2276230/d235f15bfed7326d5128d3469ca5e609ca8ddc05.jpg"},{"name":"See you later!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2276230/3a9a5dc86ae89d26cd6ab5a28b292b6f11185828.jpg"},{"name":"NEED MORE MONEY!!!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2276230/6a81340d81b27b350db27c2eddbb623e3b324fdc.jpg"},{"name":"Why do I need this?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2276230/1539ff8a2c8922aa07a57539bcaa5a7bb5b1caa7.jpg"},{"name":"After all, this is not paradise","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2276230/bcc03665f99489b967f7e5a9b1113f080cd171f0.jpg"},{"name":"Trial and error :)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2276230/e3227ec90639c0411acba4c775e83af800ba4c38.jpg"}],"total":21},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2276230/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1720384729","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2276230/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1720384729","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2276230/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1720384729","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2276230/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1720384729","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Descirption</h2>CubeRun2 is a <strong>rogue-lite</strong> game with shooter elements with a top view.
