On your turn, take two actions which can be:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Maneuver: Move your fighters and draw a card!<br></li><li> Attack: Play an attack card!<br></li><li> Scheme: Play a scheme card (cards that have a special effect).</li></ul>Get your opponent's hero to zero health, and you win the game.<br><br>What makes the game special is that each hero has a unique deck and ability. Alice grows big and gets small. King Arthur can discard a card to power up his attack. Sinbad gets stronger as he goes on more voyages.
