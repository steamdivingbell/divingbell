{"about_the_game":"The world is invaded by the Yokai spirits. The resistance is destroyed and the hope is lost, but the whispers are calling you to accept the burden. Embrace the curse of mysterious katana with all of its power in order to reach the heart of invasion and defeat the God of Yokai. Everything requires a sacrifice\u2026 <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game narrative is inspired by Japanese mythology and built in the genre of dark fantasy. You will fight armed with the cursed sword on two unique looking locations with multiple arenas and bosses in the end of each location. Unique part of this Hack and Slash game is its health system. Instead of typical health points you have a timer, which represents the curse. You need to defeat enemies in battle in order to receive time. The curse also gives you superhuman abilities like instant dash and you can launch a deadly projectile with your sword.<br />\r\nAnother unique mechanic is a demonic rage. Less time you have left - stronger rage becomes. It has two stages which trigger automatically and each stage increases your attack and movement speed, damage and It also enchances your abilities. If you want - you can manually activate special stage of rage. This stage will unleash the beast within Samurai, giving even more bonuses, but the timer will run significantly faster. <br />\r\nUse these gifts of the curse to defeat Yokai and banish them from our world!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter you beat the game - your record will be saved in the global leaderboard and you will be able to compete with other players for the fastest completion of the game!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is made by the student team of University of Applied Sciences Darmstadt, Germany. There are 5 members in internal team,2 sound production students and independent music composer.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Bigger they are, harder they fall","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3106200/221f6de1114d24117fa1284acfa1422b28940aa3.jpg"},{"name":"End of Hunger!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3106200/743a9263e4b85c03554448ca98bb598398ba10bf.jpg"},{"name":"First of many?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3106200/018bb86c30ead251b31ee51043375c3051d133b5.jpg"},{"name":"With their own weapons","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3106200/9939fac157c6fdf036e650b030ba44f2cf12a59f.jpg"},{"name":"Flawless!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3106200/d4be039399ff2f8b66c6d885b3cb7eb0631e2bd0.jpg"},{"name":"True Samurai!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3106200/57ed56edea61c501257e79b04a2601f3c9867dad.jpg"},{"name":"Runner","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3106200/c4356d3e9c668ca079b7608f7917668f8ab8b9a2.jpg"}],"total":7},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3106200/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729179771","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3106200/page.bg.jpg?t=1729179771","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3106200/c2a84441f74b50460b508a565f8e136d939f530a/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729179771","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3106200/c2a84441f74b50460b508a565f8e136d939f530a/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729179771","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"The game is built around sword battles.
