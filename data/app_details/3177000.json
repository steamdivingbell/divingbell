Alongside the visual novel experience, the demo features two mini-games: one where you hunt for a frog and another where you compose a note. You'll also explore the diary feature, which tracks your choices throughout the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Backstory</h2><br>When the Sun fell from the sky, and the world was covered in darkness and cold, it seemed that there was no more hope for people.
