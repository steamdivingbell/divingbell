{"about_the_game":"OVRdrop is a Utility Application for SteamVR that can mirror a Desktop Window, an entire Monitor, or a WebCam into a Cross Game SteamVR Overlay.

It is known to work for the HTC Vive as well as the Oculus Rift, though <strong>some games may not be compatible with the Rift</strong>.
