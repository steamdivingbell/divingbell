{"about_the_game":"<strong> </strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Legendary Sorcerers</h2><strong>There's Power in the Blood</strong>   <strong> <i>Legendary Sorcerers</i> </strong> is the latest volume in our series of class-focused player supplements, this time focused on those spellcasters gifted with magical power beyond their own comprehension. These mystical savants are arcane spellcasters, but the form of their magic is altered by the origin of their power. The <strong> legendary sorcerer</strong> is a fully redesigned version of the core caster class, with a unique class feature that grants spellcasting flexibility, makes cantrips more useful, and expands bloodlines to allow customization of your inherent powers rather than fixed advancement. No matter the quest, the legendary sorcerer is ready for adventure, with are 13 bloodlines, including the <strong>Aberrant Sorcerer</strong> , who mutates with each spell cast, the <strong>Draconic Sorcerer</strong> , who can exhale spells, the <strong>Elemental Sorcerer</strong> , who combines physical strength with the summoning of energy, and the <strong>Undead Sorcerer</strong> , whose magic curses those it touches. You'll also find six spectacular archetypes like the <strong> arcane seeker, impulsive mage,</strong> and <strong> disciple of violence</strong> , alongside nearly two dozen sensational spells and feats perfect for unleashing your arcane power with fantastic flair.
