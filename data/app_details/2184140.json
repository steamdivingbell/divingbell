{"about_the_game":"In the year 2062, humanity lives in megacities under extreme social isolation. The ecological disaster and pollution of the land during the Stained Wars necessitated rapid development of enormous megacities. The smog-choked skies above these megacities have become a murky reminder of the poisoned world outside, and of the fragile social ecosystem that exists within them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this dark world, it's hard to find a silver lining. The recent flooding in your district has left you jobless. Your debt has been mounting since, and it has become difficult to keep up with the payments. Personal bankruptcy is the ultimate decline and the most dreaded step in this dystopian world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGood thing you found a new job! Content curator at Liaise, the world\u2019s largest social media company. Your task is to remove content that violates the company\u2019s content policy. Deal with noisy chat bots, hateful messages, fake news and everything that disrupts the fragile social ties in a dystopian world. Chat with Liaise users, learn more about their lives and the conflicts among them. Along this path, you will encounter witty characters, silly creatures and complex cases. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nUltimately, it is up to you to make the right decision. But the right decision for the platform might not always be the right decision for your pockets or your mental health .... You walk a thin line between financial health and mental sanity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeware: not all is as it seems, and the powerful Liaise organization may have other plans for your future.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2184140/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1666027438","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2184140/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1666027438","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2184140/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1666027438","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2184140/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1666027438","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In the year 2062, humanity lives in megacities under extreme social isolation.
