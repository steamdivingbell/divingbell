{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Welcome to Woven </h2>Woven is a<strong> relaxing adventure puzzle game</strong> with laidback gameplay. <br><br>You play as Stuffy, a well-meaning but rather clumsy stuffed animal that wanders the world alone.

By solving <strong>rhythm-puzzle</strong> machines, you unlock new shapes for Stuffy, and changing shape gives Stuffy <strong>new abilities</strong>. Elephant legs may be strong, but rabbit legs can jump. <br>Stuffy can also <strong>change colour</strong>, to <strong>solve riddles</strong> or <strong>hide from dangers</strong>. <br><br>You set out to explore a world made out of fabric, where stuffed animals once lived in peace.
