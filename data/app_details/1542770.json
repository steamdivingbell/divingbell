{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Learn By Solving Real-World Problems</strong></h2><br>Have you ever wondered how scientists developed strategies to limit the impact of the 2020 pandemic on human lives and health systems? <br><br><i>Pandemic by Prisms</i> is an immersive algebra learning game that builds lasting fluency with exponential functions and allows you to apply algebraic thinking to one of the most important problems today - the global pandemic. While it does not deal with the science behind pandemics, it is designed to equip you with foundational algebra skills to understand how to make informed decisions about a critical public health issue.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Collaborate With Us!</strong></h2> <br>We\u2019re launching our beta module to collaborate with users (like you!) to gather feedback so that we can continue to iterate and make this module fun, engaging, and meaningful for all users! <br><br>Please leave us a review, provide feedback, or ask us any questions on our Discord.
