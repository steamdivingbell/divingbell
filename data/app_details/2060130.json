{"about_the_game":"Return to Monkey Island is an unexpected, thrilling return of series creator Ron Gilbert that continues the story of the legendary adventure games The Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2: LeChuck\u2019s Revenge developed in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games.<br><br>It\u2019s been many years since Guybrush Threepwood was last locked in a battle of wits with his nemesis, the zombie pirate LeChuck. His true love, Elaine Marley, has turned her focus away from governing and Guybrush himself is adrift and unfulfilled, having never found the Secret of Monkey Island. Hip, young pirate leaders led by Captain Madison have shuffled the old guard from power, Melee Island has taken a turn for the worse, and famed businessman Stan has been imprisoned for \u2018marketing-related crimes\u2019.<br><br>Banter with old friends and new faces on familiar islands now under dangerous new leadership. Then, take to the high seas and explore the new and unknown as you work your way out of tough predicaments. Clever puzzles, bizarre situations, and devastating ripostes are all that stand between Guybrush and glory.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Return to Point &amp; Click Swashbuckling</h2>Bringing classic point and click gameplay to the modern-day, intrepid pirates will solve puzzles and explore the islands with a clever evolution of classic adventure game controls. Context-sensitive interactions, reactive dialog trees, and an easy-to-use inventory system make pirating a breeze.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Embark on Archipelago Adventures</h2>Navigate the sometimes-friendly confines of Melee Island, a familiar place that finds itself under new management by leaders who have put the squeeze on old friends and new faces. Venture out into uncharted lands like the aptly named Terror Island and the chilling outposts of Brrr Muda to make allies and enemies alike.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Created by a Legendary Crew</h2>The new chapter in the Monkey Island series marks the return of the iconic series\u2019 creator Ron Gilbert, joined by game co-writer Dave Grossman, art director Rex Crowle (Knights &amp; Bikes, Tearaway) and composers Peter McConnell, Michael Land, and Clint Bajakian (Monkey Island, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck\u2019s Revenge).","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Pegleg","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2060130/19e3888d857b9d6c526a45f72d5c3f18a7756a1f.jpg"},{"name":"Lucky Duck","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2060130/c3675173a56469bd543820483c16e0d41b1f4882.jpg"},{"name":"Part One","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2060130/4e92a99f2ca13c740485a3b5facbffb337b287ae.jpg"},{"name":"Fan Service","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2060130/fd12df557c91907e87d9d6fe4d1f7978e0aa2596.jpg"},{"name":"Cartography Nerd","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2060130/2836cdad869210280e2290d149ff9e17bb6c440b.jpg"},{"name":"Mop Heist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2060130/87f5f5c28c7877164a7feb26df070e7296f72f77.jpg"},{"name":"Hey Wait!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2060130/48b52298312bb883b2b7083e15222c900756f6d4.jpg"},{"name":"Bragging","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2060130/6ebbff031f09cd4f70cecc63e7ba4c9a061d9bde.jpg"},{"name":"Mop Top","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2060130/697b046d5fd9234ab6700860ca4da9b82f4211c0.jpg"},{"name":"Part Two","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2060130/1d2ca669a7e8dd90ba75efcbabf0e4f32dbf9811.jpg"}],"total":39},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2060130/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1711536318","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2060130/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1711536318","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2060130/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1711536318","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2060130/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1711536318","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Return to Monkey Island is an unexpected, thrilling return of series creator Ron Gilbert that continues the story of the legendary adventure games The Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2: LeChuck\u2019s Revenge developed in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games.<br><br>It\u2019s been many years since Guybrush Threepwood was last locked in a battle of wits with his nemesis, the zombie pirate LeChuck.
