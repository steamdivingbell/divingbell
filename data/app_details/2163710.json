{"about_the_game":"AevumCore is an Action RPG that is currently in the process of development and is slowly expanding into a fully developed game. Currently, the project is at the Alpha stage.

The main goal is to make the gameplay fun and accompany it with an interesting and amazing story. This demo offers up to 5 characters to play.
