{"about_the_game":"Welcome to Aurora Hills!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNestled deep within the Appalachian Mountains, Aurora Hills was known for its thriving industry and its picturesque landscape. Owing to the region's natural resources, Aurora Hills was looking to become one of the most prosperous towns in the state.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll is not how it seems, however. A series of disappearances of residents and tourists alike have plagued the region over the past few years, sparking a mass exodus from the small town. Now, in October 1981, the town is a shell of its former self. The prosperity that once blessed Aurora Hills has all but evaporated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWorking as a park ranger, you must investigate what's going on with these disappearances and answer questions that have tormented residents for years. Why has there been an increase in disappearances over the past 6 months? Why are there no traces of the people who went missing?  Perhaps most importantly, who, or what, could be behind all of this?
