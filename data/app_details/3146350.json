Due to my limited experience, there may still be shortcomings in the game. I hope everyone can offer suggestions, and I will consider them and continuously improve the game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3146350/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736920350","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3146350/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1736920350","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3146350/c75c0a13c8352040be7f31d840c3ec3722839276/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736920350","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3146350/c75c0a13c8352040be7f31d840c3ec3722839276/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736920350","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Overview</h2>A horror game supporting up to 4-player online co-op.<br>Players will become Ghost Exorcists, accepting ghost report commissions and traveling to various locations to carry out their exorcism duties.
