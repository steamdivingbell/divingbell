{"about_the_game":"Join with the gods of Greek legend to bring peace to an ancient world that's on the brink of war! As Hellas descends into chaos, a bright light shines down from above to illuminate the sea below. Within its brilliance appears Poseidon, who has a mission for you: United with him and the other gods to save your world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour quest will take you on a matching journey packed with hours of addictive fun. Create chains of shimmering tokens to remove obstacles and collect magical items that will aid you in your expedition. Enlist the help of the gods to clear game boards faster. And enjoy diversions along the way, such as puzzle boards that will challenge your mind.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe entire experience is wrapped in a dazzling visual and audio package. Your eyes will pop as your screen lights up with a fiery display after you create a long chain or unleash a bonus that wipes out half the game board.
