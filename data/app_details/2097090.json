{"about_the_game":"<strong><u>Snow Problem</u></strong> is a game in which you collect snow. There are obstacles to stop this being easy of course, so you need to create extra terrain on the game screen to guide the snow to the bottom of the screen. Added some terrain in the wrong place / somewhere that was helpful but isn't any longer? No problem, you can delete it. Oh, and did I mention that there are also different obstacles that will melt your snow?<br><br>Many levels contain areas that change the colour of the snow, and you will need to collect a certain amount of each colour to complete the level. As you complete levels, more levels unlock for you to play. The full game will have 100 levels. Every level will be tested by the developer to ensure that it is definitely completable, so if you fail, you know it's your own fault! :-)<br><br>You'd think that 100 levels to tease your brain would be quite enough, but no! The game also contains a built-in level editor which will allow you to create up to 100 levels of your own. (Update - 107 levels now, since a few bonus levels have been added.)<br><br>The game features 24  pieces of (mostly well-known) classical music  to help you chill out a little while you stress out over how to beat a level.<br><br><strong><i>\u200bPlaying the game with a mouse is highly recommended, it's designed with precise control in mind which you may find difficult to achieve with a trackpad.</i></strong>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Let It Snow!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2097090/cf711864809508989f1351ae011a54f9ca1d4ee6.jpg"},{"name":"I snow what to do now","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2097090/f2e897484ac73229d070a4c9615c1ebd935b7c23.jpg"},{"name":"Icy what you did there","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2097090/c4c4cf2d365d1e1a88504fce6c8f995340c2ae67.jpg"},{"name":"It's getting cold in here","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2097090/5039e3a3fb16b334a4ca3e71aeaa866f2a3ff736.jpg"},{"name":"Snowed in","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2097090/0b6b89987271849c347b83990d88772a97061f80.jpg"},{"name":"Winter takes it all","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2097090/c6735d8f094d9b4ef7d8fc617fc851388a4a0295.jpg"},{"name":"I want to break freeze","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2097090/6363ba1ef75666756ab9bef034727e1f29bf1ec4.jpg"},{"name":"Ice Ice Baby","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2097090/d21a33fecf34c8740d27988eb450073e624da052.jpg"},{"name":"That's snow moon!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2097090/1d40f44bc195b4158e9cf4cfc76fd36ba9d35b05.jpg"},{"name":"It's all snowver","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2097090/fa3764b7a05bc64afb4864036937eb1347bc6ce9.jpg"}],"total":12},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2097090/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1685353138","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2097090/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1685353138","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2097090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1685353138","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2097090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1685353138","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2102290,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<strong><u>Snow Problem</u></strong> is a game in which you collect snow.
