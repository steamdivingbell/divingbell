The King, fearing an imminent invasion from the shadowy realm, has commanded You to cross into the World of Darkness and eliminate the perceived threat at its source. Bound by duty and loyalty, You accept The Writ without hesitation. You know the gravity of the King\u2019s words and the trust placed in You.
