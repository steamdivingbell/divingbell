{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Pathfinder 2 RPG - Blood Lords AP 5: A Taste of Ashes</h2>  The newest Blood Lords follow the trail of a deadly plot to the bone-walled metropolis of Yled, just as the city is gearing up for war against the undead nation's greatest enemy. From spectral theater performances to the city's secret defense installations, the Blood Lords race to stop a plan to bring forth horrors from beyond death--and before their foes leave nothing more than ashes in their wake. <br> <br> A Taste of Ashes is a Pathfinder adventure for four less-than-good-hearted 15th-level characters. This adventure continues the<br> Blood Lords Adventure Path, a six-part, monthly campaign in which the characters rise from skilled troubleshooters to join the Blood Lords who rule a land of the dead. The adventure also details the Warmaster Council orchestrating the nation's defenses and explores trade routes across the Inner Sea region. New items, spells, monsters, and more await in <br> A Taste of Ashes.  <br>  This product is not a PDF or accessible outside of Fantasy Grounds.
