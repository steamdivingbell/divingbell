In single player mode, beware that you need to do this before timers runs out. In versus mode, remember that you are in a competition. Once you initiate a movement, player will continue in that direction until he runs into a void - or runs out of ball. Multiplier tiles will give you more ball while hollow tiles will cause you to lose a ball - balance them. Breakable tiles won't be there once you pass over them. Button tiles will rotate switchable tiles once you pass over them. You can reset yourself in versus mode. Also you can rotate camera in single player mode to have a better perspective. Game has 3 areas, each has 15 levels for solo run. Enjoy every single bit of it.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2191370/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1676425473","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2191370/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1676425473","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2191370/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1676425473","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2191370/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1676425473","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2286050,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2191370/extras/gif1.gif?t=1676425473\" /><br><br><strong>LIGHT WEIGHT PUZZLER</strong><br><br>Mostly, you won't struggle to solve puzzles.
