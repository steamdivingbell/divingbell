{"about_the_game":"<strong>Greats of the Gridiron</strong> is a football simulation experience unlike any other where you need to <i>Outdraft</i>, <i>Outdesign</i>, and <i>Outcoach </i> other coaches from around the world if you want to win the coveted Gridiron Bowl and stake your claim to Greatness.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Outdraft</strong></h2>Pit your abilities and eye for scouting talent and strategically build your team from a pre-generated list of players, in real-time, as <strong>General Manager</strong> against other savvy coaches within your league or the AI teams. <br><br>But don\u2019t mismanage your salary cap or you may not be able to keep your stud players.

It\u2019s your team to do as you wish\u2026 Just remember, if your team is getting passed all over \u2013 you may have wanted to draft that lockdown CB instead of the stud OL you coveted.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Outdesign</strong></h2>As <strong>Offensive</strong> and <strong>Defensive Coordinator</strong>, you create plays down to the finest of details. Pull your tackles on a sweep or have your QB pump fake to get the WR open. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1553880/extras/setCatchInst.gif?t=1654115150\" /><br><br>Then head over to the practice field and check your plays against your offense or defense, make adjustments and perfect your playbook.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1553880/extras/practicePass.gif?t=1654115150\" /><br><br>Use any of the pre-generated templates for some basic formations and then customize them any way you want to implement your offensive or defensive philosophy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Outcoach</strong></h2>As <strong>Head Coach</strong>, you determine when and where each play is called using the <i>Play Call Acumen</i> system. You determine the down, distance, score differential, and timing. You\u2019ll also set the penalty/reward points depending on how that play does so that you don\u2019t keep calling the same bad play over and over, as well as making sure you call the plays that are working well.

Single player allows for a 17 game season to be played along with a playoff tournament and Championship game at the end. <br><br>Players can also form leagues with friends or coaches from around the world, online, to truly see where their drafting, design and coaching skills are and to try and win the glorious Gridiron Bowl and to see if they can truly be called a Great of the Gridiron.
