{"about_the_game":"BOX is a logic puzzle-platformer game where you must navigate small mazes and symmetrical obstacles to collect every &quot;dot&quot; placed within. Each level is a Box that can be rotated 90 degrees in either direction. Rotate the stage to change the layout of the level, as well as your own position within it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nObjects behave differently depending on their color: black platforms move with the stage's rotation, while purple ones do not. Red &quot;dots&quot; cannot be collected until certain conditions have been met. Experiment, and discover what is possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is not very long. On average, it can be completed within 2-3 hours. A perfect game for when you want to be somewhere else for a while.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt will get difficult, but do not stress. You will figure it out, I am sure. Don't worry if you can't get it right away- it will always be here when you're ready, like an old tape collecting dust on a wooden shelf, an old memory waiting to be remembered. A chromatic world of sight and sound.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd boxes.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1181070/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1591316173","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1181070/page.bg.jpg?t=1591316173","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1181070/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1591316173","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1181070/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1591316173","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":1191530,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"BOX is a logic puzzle-platformer game where you must navigate small mazes and symmetrical obstacles to collect every &quot;dot&quot; placed within.
