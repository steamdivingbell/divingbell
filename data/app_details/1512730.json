It's a relaxing and meditating experience that takes your mind off everyday distractions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery scene is carefully constructed so when you zoom out further it gives you fantastical three dimensional isometric art style vibe to the scene.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou play as the diver and will be given a list of objects to find spread throughout the scene. You will be able to control the scuba diver in a 3D world and reach each object by getting close to it and cross it off of the list. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnjoy the aquatic life with full of swimming fish, colorful reef, plants, rocks set in ocean, lake and river environments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeaturing original smooth chill soundtrack and simple minimalistic and easy to follow user interface.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Relax It's Aqua","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1512730/26d25cc43fcea72ac8acd98794cc82f1feae00b9.jpg"}],"total":1},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1512730/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1619299272","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1512730/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1619299272","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1512730/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1619299272","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1512730/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1619299272","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Relax It's Aqua is an underwater hidden objects finding atmospheric experience.
