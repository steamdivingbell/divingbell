{"about_the_game":"Hop, jump, and stick your way through a forest under threat to save your friends and family from the evil Flame Beast and his Embers. In <i>Mello</i>, you play as Mo the Marshmallow as he goes on a journey to free his fellow marshmallow villagers from certain death at the hands of the ever-hungry Flame Beast. Along the way you will have to help Mo as he encounters the minions of the Flame Beast, Embers and Ants. <br><br>Being damaged isn\u2019t all bad, though! As Mo gets more injured, he becomes stickier, allowing you to navigate the levels in new ways. Heal up at magic Fountains and outwit your opponents to rescue your people in <i>Mello</i>!<br><br>Our first Early Access drop will include our first level of 2D platforming fun, with 5 more levels already in the works for a subsequent update shortly thereafter.<br><br>Keyboard support now, game pad support to be added soon.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1619830/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1636037419","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1619830/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1636037419","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1619830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1636037419","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1619830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1636037419","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Hop, jump, and stick your way through a forest under threat to save your friends and family from the evil Flame Beast and his Embers.
