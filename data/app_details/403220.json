{"about_the_game":"This is the Original Soundtrack of Secrets of Grindea! It features a whooping 98 tracks (70 from Story mode, and 28 from Arcade Mode)!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe soundtrack is composed by Andrew Riley (Lucky Lion Studios), who's a superb musician and overall just a swell kind of dude! When we started out on the project, we were all students with no money to spare, and so couldn't afford any music. Along came Riley, who was so hyped on our work that he couldn't let that stand! He offered to compose the music at student-friendly rates, without sacrificing an inch of the quality.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe're very happy to be able to offer his music as a standalone soundtrack, and we hope you'll enjoy it!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo listen to the music, you can either use Steam's own music player, or find the songs as MP3s in the install folder.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/403220?t=1708614375","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/403220?t=1708614375","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/403220/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1708614375","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/403220/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1708614375","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This is the Original Soundtrack of Secrets of Grindea!
