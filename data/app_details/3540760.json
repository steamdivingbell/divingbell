{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Step into an art sanctuary woven from colors, shapes, and puzzles, and embark on an unprecedented journey of the soul. You will become an art seeker, traversing the inner worlds of four 20th-century art masters, unlocking the secrets hidden deep within their works.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Picasso's Cubist Fantasy: What passions and struggles are hidden beneath the bright sun of Barcelona?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Enter Picasso's world and experience the subversion and reconstruction of Cubism. The roar of the bull, the collision of lines, the splatter of paint... every detail holds a clue. In scenes filled with Spanish flair, you will search for lost brushes, decipher hidden symbols, and gradually uncover the source of inspiration behind Picasso's creations. When the bull breaks free, you will witness the ultimate power of art.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Malevich's Suprematist Purity: What purity and extremes echo in the geometric labyrinth?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Follow in Malevich's footsteps and explore the mysteries of Suprematism. In an abstract world composed of squares, circles, and crosses, you will experience an unprecedented sense of pure emotion. Solve geometric puzzles, find the key to conquering the sun, and finally reach the sanctuary of Suprematism, feeling the tranquility and harmony that transcends reality. This is not only a puzzle, but also an exploration of the inner world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Magritte's Surreal Dream: Where dreams and reality intertwine, what absurdity and poetry are hidden?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Step into Magritte's surreal world and experience a feast for the eyes and mind. Here, apples float in the air, pipes are no longer pipes, and familiar objects are given new meanings. In scenes filled with whimsical ideas, you will solve seemingly absurd yet meaningful puzzles. Traveling between dreams and reality, you will discover the truth hidden beneath the surface and feel Magritte's unique artistic charm.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Mondrian's Rhythmic Order: What balance and harmony are contained in the symphony of red, yellow, and blue?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Immerse yourself in Mondrian's geometric world and experience the perfect combination of order and rhythm. In the interweaving of the three primary colors of red, yellow, and blue, you will experience a simple and pure beauty. By solving puzzles related to colors and lines, you will gradually understand Mondrian's artistic concepts and discover the figurative reflections hidden behind abstract forms. This is not only a visual enjoyment, but also a profound of balance and harmony.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is more than just a puzzle game; it's an artistic journey through time and space. Are you ready to accept the challenge and embark on your art exploration?</p>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3540760?t=1740680855","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3540760/ad028b3258df7bc297de6b807941286e95c498bb/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1740680855","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3540760/283a316a6e534fa720e42a244888c2f632293b5e/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1740680855","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3540760/283a316a6e534fa720e42a244888c2f632293b5e/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1740680855","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play on Phone","id":41},{"description":"Remote Play on Tablet","id":42},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Step into an art sanctuary woven from colors, shapes, and puzzles, and embark on an unprecedented journey of the soul.
