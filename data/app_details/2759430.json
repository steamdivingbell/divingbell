{"about_the_game":"The E-flite Decathlon RJG 1.2m is one of the most capable and best-handling models of the iconic aerobatic trainer ever! It's a replica of the Decathlon that RJ Gritter (RJG) flies in airshows across the United States and sports a classic yet modernized red, white, and blue trim scheme. It also features a variety of scale details including functional LED landing and navigation lights, wheel pants, and wing struts. The one-piece wing is easy to install and remove thanks to hands-free connections and thumbscrews, and the struts snap into/out of place without the need for any fasteners or tools \u2013 though it's already conveniently sized to be easy to store and transport without disassembly! Digital and metal-geared servos along with ball-link equipped linkages provide precise and reliable control for smooth sport to aggressive aerobatic flying. The 3S and 4S compatible power system features a 45-amp Spektrum\u2122 Avian\u2122 Smart Lite ESC, and the BNF\u00ae Basic version is equipped with an AR631 receiver to deliver real-time telemetry data along with AS3X\u00ae and optional-use SAFE\u00ae Select plus motor/thrust reversing. All these details and features combine to deliver a very convenient and extremely capable scale model that's a great choice for low-time and intermediate to experienced pilots!","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2759430?t=1724951375","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2759430?t=1724951375","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759430/7d8a494039d8940b737c5ad349ea9185d047e8f4/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724951375","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759430/7d8a494039d8940b737c5ad349ea9185d047e8f4/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724951375","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The E-flite Decathlon RJG 1.2m is one of the most capable and best-handling models of the iconic aerobatic trainer ever!
