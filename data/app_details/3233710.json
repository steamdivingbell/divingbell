{"about_the_game":"The base principle is simple you search a house looking for things that were different in the original (anomalies). In case you find such an anomaly, you report it by pressing a button, and afterwards you loop back into a new iteration of the house. When you report right 13 times, you win.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe games random nature leads to ever different runs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are 30 anomalies that might appear in the rooms. However, there may only be a maximum of one anomaly at one time. As such, the playthrough length may differ drastically from ca. 40-80 minutes for the first playthrough.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you dare to enter the dark rooms of Monday the 14th, be assured that while you challenge your memory and luck, you will be observed.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"I was here before","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3233710/41c7543b28d1242f45dea63365c48363c48ec266.jpg"},{"name":"The End?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3233710/4d0e43f8f76e96d4568959dd39dee31473c90b8b.jpg"},{"name":"The End!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3233710/0925ea099806ac738a972639f7ba8b4a3aa97630.jpg"},{"name":"Round and round it goes","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3233710/244156528b59c5a21f50e7a392fd30506c8d91a1.jpg"},{"name":"15 is the new 14","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3233710/2928e945580bd9d6dd06bfacc8c78741c51af926.jpg"}],"total":5},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3233710/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729246618","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3233710/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1729246618","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3233710/c5389d6f4ff356b0a56043eacb03cf5f2be8c162/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729246618","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3233710/c5389d6f4ff356b0a56043eacb03cf5f2be8c162/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729246618","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The base principle is simple you search a house looking for things that were different in the original (anomalies).
