It is in the far future after humans have peeked and vanished; after their cities and monuments have been reduced to ruins; their greatness disintegrated into oblivion. What remains is hunger, hopelessness, and an inferior continuation of the human race; the children of Terra. There are a lot of Children dispersed in this world, sheltered in their factions, separated from each other by their conviction and mistrust.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Five Protectors in Service of Repentance</strong></h2>Today, I'll tell you about one group of Children, the Protectors, five of them to be exact. They are departing from a Protector settlement named Repentance. Sent by their elders to find the truth about a rumor that would not die about a place of great technology and resources. The Refinery. These five are an odd band, not your classical heroes; in fact, there are not many heroes in this story..<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><i>Blackjack</i></strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1680890/extras/Untitled_design__10_.png?t=1657044668\" /><br>One of them, an old warrior, leads them through the ruins avoiding many dangers; his name is Blackjack. He was never not a warrior.. and it was all he would ever be. His violence is directed at everyone, friend or foe. He is kept in check by a very old woman, the only one he listens to.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><i>Elle</i></strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1680890/extras/Untitled_design__9_.png?t=1657044668\" /><br>The woman is too old by any measure to be on such a journey. But she is an elder in the settlement, and none dare to oppose her. Her name is used to scare small children into obedience. Skilled in medicine, alchemy and could see the future.

He was never named but referred to as Rake for his recklessness.<br>Rake is unable to take life or suffering seriously, a constant trickster and joker. Jump scares or throwing rocks at sleepers. Simple humor never gets old to him. Rake has always been considered a freak in his settlement by his suspiciously bigger physique..... the only one who found a kindred spirit in him is Adana.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><i>Adana</i></strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1680890/extras/Untitled_design__11_.png?t=1657044668\" /><br>Adana is a young, innovative, and lithe warrior. Many regard her as a great future leader, as she cares about the wellbeing and survival of everyone. She dreams of a better future where all the Protectors are united in one settlement, where she doesn't have to run for her life anymore. Trained by the best, she is a warrior to be reckoned with.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><i>Sophronius</i></strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1680890/extras/Untitled_design__7_.png?t=1657044668\" /><br>Last among them is a nobleman's son that had fallen from his high station; he is a scholar and a tinkerer of the Ancients' technology, the human technology.
