{"about_the_game":"B\u00e0ito is a dynamic couch/party game that allows up to 8 players to play. Each game is based on the first player to reach 5-20 points. Players compete to stay up in a randomly generated arena each round; the last player standing earns one point. Each round features a modifier vote that can completely change the way the game is played. Modifiers can be combined in a variety of ways and interact with each other. In fact, players can change the weapon at their disposal, terrain type, map, interacting elements, skill, and mode so as to find their favorite combo. Initially, players will only have starting modifiers available; all others will have to be unlocked by playing. The experience is aimed at pure fun, and it is recommended to play with as many players as possible.
