{"about_the_game":"Dig deep underground by shooting balls and breaking blocks, traversing your way to the planet cores. With limited shots per round and some blocks fixed firmly to the wall, thoughtfully strategize and aim for maximum impact. Knock down as many blocks as possible while collecting crystals for upgrades and getting deeper beneath the surface.<br>Choose your ideal upgrades such as more starting balls, more shots per round, or storing more crystals, based on your play style and overall strategy. <br><br>Balance your plan between ball bouncing patterns and unpredictable, surprising bounces in this mesmerizing and curious game oozing with charm. Immerse yourself in a world of extravagant minimalistic art while jamming out to an original space acid soundtrack as you feel the satisfaction of digging further underground.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Six planets to dig through<br></li><li> Original soundtrack of seven diverse and space-acid themed tunes<br></li><li> A tight experience with 5+ hours of gameplay<br></li><li> Play together with a friend (1+ controllers required)<br></li><li> Endless play mode<br></li><li> 5 achievements<br></li><li> 11 leaderboards<br></li><li> Toggle for screen shake</li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Clear Screen","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1268370/7a0a6048bbc335a7e04355a149841b7e9b8cac91.jpg"},{"name":"That was on purpose","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1268370/5b611cd342836a1dcc7d0953a2e39ea0e58dbb3b.jpg"},{"name":"Wasteful","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1268370/011c86ef5a6d1be77f89336dd20b2960e9af869f.jpg"},{"name":"Saved by the ball","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1268370/6345c49ed9bccefd4268e0011d8b38c3a42c8807.jpg"},{"name":"It's not cricket","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1268370/c32808dae3d2067062a75e6aae9c82cfb140d71a.jpg"}],"total":5},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1268370?t=1663319888","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1268370/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1663319888","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1268370/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1663319888","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1268370/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1663319888","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Remote Play on Phone","id":41},{"description":"Remote Play on Tablet","id":42},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Dig deep underground by shooting balls and breaking blocks, traversing your way to the planet cores.
