Steven loved to play video games and he always used to wonder how they where made. When he got his first PC he started looking up how to program. He started learning Unity, but he didn't like that way of programing, he wanted something easy for beginner's. After a while Steven started using Unreal Engine 4. He liked the easy viewport and blueprint programing. Steven then thought about putting together a small team to help him make video games. So at school he asked his friends and they all wanted to help. So they called the team &quot;Epic Crazy Games&quot;. But that was to familiar with &quot;Epic Games&quot;. So Steven renamed the team to &quot;Operation Games&quot;.</p></p><br><h1>FAQ</h1><p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Fantasy Shootoff's Frequently Asked Questions</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>What rating is Fantasy Shootoff? </strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Fantasy Shootoff is rated Teen 14+ for Fantasy Violence and Users Interact.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>How often will the game update?</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Fantasy Shootoff will receive regular updates that include improvements, balancing and fixes.
