A PCVR hallucination.</h2>&quot;A Very Dark Ride in the Proximity of the House of Mirrors&quot; is an episodic horror, adventure <strong>PCVR game</strong> where you play as Eve, a little 5 year old with quite the dark imagination. You're a helpless child that's lost, can barely read and has no where to go. Your only knowledge of the world is from your mother and an old television. The only possible people that could help you are hunting for you and your only defenses include a wooden sword, a very large bird with anger issues, and a canon that requires well chewed bubble gum.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Overstimulated imagination</h2>\tDetach your sense of reality and dive into strange places to explore,, solving puzzles, playing games, staying stealthy and out of trouble and sometimes engaging in testy encounters with the locals all while running your fastest and screaming your loudest as you realize you can\u2019t possibly win. Your one friend and follower will eventually stand up for you but you\u2019ll need to be patient. \u201cBFF\u201d, Bird friends forever.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">You\u2019re quite popular</h2>\tTHE.Y and the dummies seem to always be nearby with some actually following and just a little too close to be a mere coincidence. Why is everyone trying to take a picture of you? Avoid the dummies as your only hope is a quick escape before the real crowds come for you.

Everything in VR. There\u2019s no HUD or 2D UI to get in the way of a good view. Your health is displayed by how dirty your clothes are. No maps to guide you as a compass to your next goal will do the job. Don\u2019t be careless and leave it somewhere.
