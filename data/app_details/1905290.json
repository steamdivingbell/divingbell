This 2 hour long symphonic work written for Numina I\u2019d describe as quite operatic in it\u2019s approach; with character leitmotifs, weaving themes throughout numerous moments in the game\u2019s story, and even touching on heavier thematic moments such as grief, loss, life and love.<br><br>A collaboration that\u2019s been a decade in the making, The story of Numina and it\u2019s themes, in particular it\u2019s main theme, the \u2018Hymn of the Harmonious Soul\u2019 is inspired by such universal themes of life, death and the afterlife. Working on Numina is my most authentic artistic effort yet as a composer.
