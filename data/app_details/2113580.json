Tokens can be used to upgrade your pickaxe in lots of different ways. The upgrades vary from increasing your pickaxe damage, your mine speed, the tokens and money you get, as well as various &quot;procc&quot; (programmed random occurrence) upgrades, for example; &quot;Slammer&quot;, &quot;Nuker&quot;, &quot;Key finder&quot;, &quot;Token bag&quot; and more.<br><br>The blocks stored in your backpack can be sold for in game money, which is used to unlock new mines with better blocks in them.

After you unlock the dungeon (for money and tokens), instead of mining in a squared generated mined, you can then instead mine in a big cave area with ores scattered around the place. The ores in here are much more valuable and instead of being stored in your backpack, they will sometimes give you various item rewards when mines. Watch your steps though, because if you fall into any of the pits in the dungeon, everything you had gained in there will be lost.

Each spirit is unique and will enhance certain aspects of the game (while sometimes nerfing others).<br>You can have 1 spirit equipped at a time and most spirits can be upgraded (by mining) for increased effects. The game has 25 different spirits ranging in 5 different rarity tiers. Spirits can be obtained by opening a spirit flask, which can be obtained in the dungeon, and from treasures.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2113580/extras/Treasure.png?t=1666566510\" /><br>Treasures are a great way to give you a little bonus when playing. Treasures can be opened with a matching key, which can be obtained in various ways.

Each planet has a token generator and a money generator, which are upgraded with the opposite currency (money with tokens, and token with money). Upgrading your generator will increase it's capacity and the amount in generates per second. Generators can also be buffed by upgrading a certain <strong>mega upgrade</strong> with <strong>rebirth points</strong>.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2113580/extras/Heart.png?t=1666566510\" /><br>The &quot;Rebirth&quot; system is a way to replay the game with a buff.<br>Once you have reached a certain &quot;level&quot; in the game and mined a certain amount of blocks, you can rebirth.<br><br>Rebirthing will reset most of your stats (except for spirits and unlocked planets) but will give you a 10% money &amp; token income boost as well as 1 rebirth point (RP) which you use to buy permanent <strong>mega upgrades</strong>.
