{"about_the_game":"<strong>Flavor Favor</strong> is a sci-fi visual novel where you take on the role of an android refugee who has escaped from a life of endless work for human corporations. As a free bot, your mortality is the ultimate cost. Without the life-sustaining fumes that bring your system under control, your body will gradually deteriorate. Therefore, enjoy your time while you're still alive. Get to know other androids who share your destiny, and indulge in all of your senses - touch, smell, taste, sight, and sound - before you gradually deteriorate.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Recommend Snacks:</h2>&quot;We don\u2019t exchange money.
