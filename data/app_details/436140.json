{"about_the_game":"Build flourishing cities and the largest monuments ever seen.<br><br>Enjoy an original card game with absorbing gameplay which whisks you back several centuries to the times when people built huge, unbelievable monuments. Work your way up from a small tribe to a flourishing Empire along the Nile. Build the large pyramids which tower above vast cities, win the Gods' favor and become the mightiest Pharaoh. The Gods are known to favor the mightiest one. Can you architect a new, unstoppable Empire of the Gods?<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Enjoy original and simple card game.<br></li><li>Build 12 beautiful cities and monuments.<br></li><li>Improve your character.<br></li><li>Use dozens of bonus and extra cards.<br></li><li>Reach up to 15 achievements.</li></ul><br>Immerse yourself in this unusual card game based on simple math. You are given a set of cards and by using them you can transform one of the four artificial resources - power, wealth, faith and life - into the other. Your goal is to increase the resources to a certain level in a limited number of rounds and finally use the master card. Put your logic to the test in more than 30 stages - while the first ones are easy, the later ones will require you to plan carefully and make use of bonus cards. Listen to the excellent musical score and watch as incredible monuments rise above vast cities.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Competent","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/436140/f3123851e29272d6b02eee75207a2035b4c38422.jpg"},{"name":"Fast","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/436140/9e092477e5a586cf8357bc856df2ede40b326e45.jpg"},{"name":"Smart","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/436140/a9f91d263901e4193ffff282ebc2a6a46680c87c.jpg"},{"name":"Wise","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/436140/a07e70c35a71a6ddc10ae2565a7d85fade656391.jpg"},{"name":"Impressive","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/436140/d06b0586fb1d2f0d660d296f346e5cb5879dfc14.jpg"},{"name":"Leader","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/436140/aa6865f895b82b082c2a215bc56262e8fa3d73ad.jpg"},{"name":"Defender","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/436140/69ad84aea8dd1d463f4fd807f38c241efcf79f24.jpg"},{"name":"Builder","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/436140/9da64637daad0bdda90c6894e0a3ffd1d7825a0c.jpg"},{"name":"Devout","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/436140/ca12427986fdde02623e51aa83ce101c5c759d95.jpg"},{"name":"Versatile","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/436140/ea388c7b4295437a70348b6799d12a1cbedda362.jpg"}],"total":15},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/436140/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1721036622","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/436140/page.bg.jpg?t=1721036622","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/436140/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1721036622","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/436140/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1721036622","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play on Phone","id":41},{"description":"Remote Play on Tablet","id":42},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":437050,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Build flourishing cities and the largest monuments ever seen.<br><br>Enjoy an original card game with absorbing gameplay which whisks you back several centuries to the times when people built huge, unbelievable monuments.
