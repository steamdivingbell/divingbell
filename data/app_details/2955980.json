As a result, many can still be seen working hard across the network.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The DB BR143 v.2 represents a step forward in terms of detail and authentic simulation, with a comprehensive user manual which explains the correct procedures to learn to get the loco in motion and ready for work. This means the loco, and the included Steuerwagen, are only suitable for driving via Expert Controls, rather than the in-game HUD controls. From switching on the loco battery and setting up the ZWS, ZDS and other driving modes, you will find lots to occupy you every step of the way. And once you have mastered the loco, you still have the BDnrzf to get to grips with! The loco also features authentic door controls and fault warnings.  </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A selection of engaging Standard and Quick Drive scenarios are included for the Frankfurt-Koblenz route: </p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">ZSF - P61 - 01: RE to Koblenz in the evening </p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> ZSF - P61 - 02: RB Mainz-Koblenz </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> ZSF - P61 - 03: RB to Bad Kreuznach </p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">More scenarios are available on the Steam Workshop online and in-game.
