Because of the inequality of the armistice agreement, successive armed conflicts began to erupt in some areas. Five months later, the fighting Fox, led by Miguel, launched a sudden onslaught, defeating the headquarters of EAU and advancing towards the Southern Cross at the same time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a horizontal retro arcade-style STG shooting game.
