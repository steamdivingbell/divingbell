{"about_the_game":"Professional assassin turned amateur campaign manager Steve is charged with cleaning up the city by an anthropomorphic rabbit and mayoral candidate from the future named BunnyLord. Now Steve and his expanding roster of dubious heroes must wield their unique skills to shoot, slide, dive, and take cover behind a political platform built on ethics, accountability, and an inordinate amount of gunfire. Eliminate the criminal underworld of the city\u2019s three major districts and persuade undecided voters to your cause, tackling the issues that matter by putting a gun in the mouth of those issues. <br><br>Through the power of ISO-Slant\u2122 technology and a wasted youth, London-based developer Roll7 (OlliOlli) delivers the greatest 2\u00bcD cover-based indie shooter of all-time, ever. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/274270/extras/Banner.png?t=1714393203\" /><br><br><strong>Next Level Shootouts</strong> \u2013 Use reasonable force unreasonably in a dynamic mix of run-and-gun gameplay and cover-based shootouts.
