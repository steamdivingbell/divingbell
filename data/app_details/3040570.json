Feeling low, like happiness, is a normal emotion, and expressing it might help. In Flowence, you can anonymously write about your worries, sadness, or happy moments, and you can also anonymously respond to other players' expressions. This is an online social space without followers, reposts, or subscriptions. Flowence allows players to care for each other through words, reduce loneliness, and be their true selves. Your few words can be very powerful. In Flowence, language is no longer a barrier; AI will translate mails for you, making the world smaller, broader, and more transparent.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3040570/extras/banner3.png?t=1723018461\" /><br><br>Or sometimes you may want to forget about external matters and focus on work or study?
