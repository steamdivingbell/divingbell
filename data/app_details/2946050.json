{"about_the_game":"In 'Darkness Consumes,' you awaken in a mysterious temple with no memory of who you are or how you arrived there. Guided by a helpful NPC, you discover your name, and you've been frozen in time for a millennium. However, your awakening coincides with a dire threat: a malevolent dark fog has emerged from the depths of a nearby dungeon, laying waste to the surrounding town.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, as the only hope to prevent history from repeating itself, you must delve into the heart of the dungeon to confront the source of this darkness. Gather your courage, assemble a party of brave adventurers, and prepare to unravel the mysteries hidden within the labyrinthine depths.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNavigate treacherous traps, solve perplexing puzzles, and battle against hordes of monstrous creatures lurking in the shadows. Along the way, uncover fragments of your lost memories and piece together the truth behind your forgotten past.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut beware, for the darkness is relentless, and ancient evils lie in wait to challenge your every step. Harness the powers of light and shadow, forge alliances with unlikely allies, and confront the darkness within yourself as you journey towards the heart of the dungeon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith its immersive storytelling, strategic combat, and dynamic gameplay, 'Darkness Consumes' offers an unforgettable adventure into the unknown. Will you emerge victorious and save the realm from eternal darkness, or will the shadows claim you as their own?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2946050/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729025593","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2946050/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1729025593","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2946050/a74cfed9eff6a618c21c45ad0fd6765d20eced2e/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729025593","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2946050/a74cfed9eff6a618c21c45ad0fd6765d20eced2e/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729025593","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In 'Darkness Consumes,' you awaken in a mysterious temple with no memory of who you are or how you arrived there.
