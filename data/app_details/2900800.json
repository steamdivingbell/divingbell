{"about_the_game":"Physical Spheres is a physics based puzzle game with retro graphics. The goal is to create chains of similarly colored spheres that connect to positive (+) and negative (-) terminals, at which point the spheres will be removed, and the player's score will increase. At present, the positive and negative terminals are situated  on the left and right side of the current game area respectively, but in future updates there will be more elaborate game areas. After removing one hundred spheres from the game area, the level of the round will increase, along with the speed at which game pieces fall. The game ends after the game area is filled to the point where game pieces can no longer be dropped from their starting position.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2900800/extras/HeaderCapsule.jpg?t=1718724496\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Simple, physics based game play.<br></li><li>Retro, pixel style graphics.<br></li><li>Easy to pick up and play.</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2900800/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1718724496","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2900800/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1718724496","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2900800/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718724496","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2900800/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718724496","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Physical Spheres is a physics based puzzle game with retro graphics.
