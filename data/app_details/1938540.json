Even Simple NPCs react to players' actions and everything a player does affects the world. News spread fast and thus NPCs know a lot about what is happening in the world around them. In Eternal Spectre, the world is changing and shifting, but so are you. The non-linear storyline mechanic gives us the ability to shift the world as the player is going through the story. Choices matter and actions matter even more. In Eternal Spectre, a small action may go a long way. For example, helping an NPC Survive can go a long way as the NPC might open a different path later in the storyline. Side quests are tightly integrated with the storyline to give a proper sense of the world and promote a more cohesive and immersive story.
