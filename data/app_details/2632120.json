Choose from 16 different character designs, with more on the way. In this game, you're free to adopt animals such as cows and cats, dogs and pigs, a mysterious bird, some dead monkeys, literally any NPC that you kill (if you learn necromancy), and even some weird dinosaurs that you have to revive yourself in your conquered castle (that you also have to conquer all by yourself) to help you on your journey. But that's just the beginning. With the power of necromancy, you can resurrect people from the graves you find throughout the game. Some you may have even killed yourself. Help a family one day, and kill them the next. Dig for gold in their basement, rob their graves, and resurrect them as your zombie slaves. The choice is yours. In &quot;The No-Name Project,&quot; there are endless possibilities. Fish to your heart's content, mine for precious gems and ores, and cut down trees if you are into that. You can interact with almost anything in the wilderness, uncovering hidden secrets and lore. And the best part? &quot;The No-Name Project&quot; is updated almost twice a month with new content, so the adventure never ends.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2632120/extras/Befriend_Today,_Kill_them_Tomorrow__1_.png?t=1729690178\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>You start as a NO-NAME, hence the game's name!<br></li><li>Save villagers (or don't), help them and/or work for them (or don't), kill them (or don't), rob their graves (or don't), resurrect them via necromancy (or don't), dig in their basement for gold (or don't), kill their chickens for meat (or don't).<br></li><li>Fish/mine/craft.<br></li><li>Build a boat and upgrade it up to Class S (that stands for Spaceship), then use it to trigger up to 40 random events. <strong>(Since Update 1.9.4.6)</strong><br></li><li>Cut trees, gather flowers, gather rocks, and travel where you want.<br></li><li>Kill a king in order to become a king?
