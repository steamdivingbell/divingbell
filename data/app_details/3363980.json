{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Galaxy Hassle is a story-rich fixed shooter that lets you play as Corelatine Rangers Ralph and Brad, and they need your help to apprehend Dr. Jillkoy, an evil scientist whose goal is to evolve all species to their &quot;ultimate potential,&quot; whatever that means.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Face against the many monstrous creations in Jillkoy's army.

It's good for picking off small amounts of enemies, and you don't run out of ammo! However, you may want to use something with more firepower when those creatures inevitably flood your screen. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Shotgun -</strong> This gun shoots 5 bullets in a spread. While slower, it does a good job clearing out asteroids and other enemies close to you when you badly need some personal space. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Spread Shotgun -</strong> Much like the Shotgun, except now it shoots 9 bullets with an even wider spread! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Seekers -</strong> This gun will shoot bullets that seek the closest enemy (including asteroids!). It's excellent for effortless, long-range firing.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i><strong>Note:</strong></i> All of the guns except for Stock require ammo. You can switch to any of these weapons at any time so long as you have the ammo for them!<br><br><u><i><strong>Co-op</strong></i></u> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Have a friend/brother/sister/dad/mom/dog/parrot/grimtern/jug of milk that wants to play?
