It is said that King Gradlon still stands by the shore, waiting for the city to rise up from the ocean floor and reunite him with his beloved.<br><br>Amelia, the top Myth Seekers agent, is called to Paris - only to discover that the agency has been compromised. She quickly realizes that it might be connected to a mysterious artifact found near a possible location of the mythical city of Ys. <br><br>Join Amelia and scour the alleys of Paris in search of echoes of that legendary cataclysm.
