{"about_the_game":"<strong>Three Kingdoms Shelter</strong> is castle defense base building game.  You take the role of an unknown warrior who will rebuild the Han dynasty from ruin.  The yellow scarves have ravaged the land, corrupt Ministers have rotted the Empire from within and powerful warlords have gain power that rivals the empire.  You must root out corruption and bring your enemies to their knees.  You must decide whether to be prime minister and support the emperor or replace him and be the ultimate Ruler of China.  You build up your palace, defenses and army to defeat all invaders.  You can go adventures to gain powerful weapons and loot, but make sure you leave enough of an army to defend your base.  <br><br><strong>Three Kingdoms Shelter</strong> has rogue like elements eventually your enemies will overwhelm you, but after some time or resources your warriors can be brought back to life.  The palace can be improved much like shelter and base building games.  You must manage your army.  Some heroes are better at gather resources others are better at defending the palace.  You must decide who does what.  This game gives you complete control of where your heroes go.  You gather wood and resources from outside your castle.  Beware, during night, evil creatures roam and seek your destruction, sometimes it is better to stay behind the castle walls.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3200190?t=1726110722","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3200190/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1726110722","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3200190/c4dcaca05608244b07da4d1e7fb6624a53f90dcc/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726110722","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3200190/c4dcaca05608244b07da4d1e7fb6624a53f90dcc/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726110722","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Three Kingdoms Shelter</strong> is castle defense base building game.
