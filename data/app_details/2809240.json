Guide them carefully across the world to advance their own personal quest and help them achieve glory - or at least closure. 4 Characters are unlocked from the start, but there are 8 more hidden out there in the world for you to find, each with their own unique story to play through.

Each of these has a corresponding strength and weakness - for example, <strong>Fire </strong>actions are strong against <strong>Nature </strong>and weak against <strong>Water</strong>. Naturally certain enemies and bosses also favor a particular element, so while your <strong>Fire</strong> deck might crush a group of tree spirits while travelling through a forest, it's going to struggle against a hoard of angry water elementals you encounter while walking along the coast...
