{"about_the_game":"<strong>A NEW TAKE ON THE RTS GENRE</strong><br><br>The creeper is crawling through hills and canyons to your base while you try to stop it in its tracks by building a space station, constructing weapons and structures and ultimately encapsulating the sources of this insidious enemy. In this new take to the tower defense genre, you will have to defend your city against an adversary that comes at you from all directions. In order to defeat the imminent creeper tsunami, you will need to research better technologies, shoot down enemy creeper missiles and capture enough land for collecting energy efficiently. The goo is so strong and corrosive, that the slightest touch would mean the end of any building, even including your mighty city. In this crucial battle against this awful ocean of goo, can you lead your city and your people to the ultimate salvation?<br><br><strong>UNIQUE STRATEGY GAME FEATURES</strong><br><br>Play in a 3D environment where you send construction and ammunition packets to your buildings and fight against a fluid that has the sole aim of drowning your city. Build lightning towers and missile launchers to push back the enemy. Practice defending your zone by building flak towers on strategic points and fending off enemy aerial assaults. Build superweapons to quickly evaporate large chunks of creeper and assist your counteroffensive. Finally capture the emitters using capsules to win the game. <br><br><strong>UNLIMITED GAMEPLAY</strong><br><br>Generate your own maps using the built-in map generator or create new maps using the map editor. Play the creations of other players by downloading user generated maps and  contribute to the growing creeper nation by having your say and rating these maps. Showcase your artistic ability by creating beautiful landscapes and let the world play your masterpiece and give it the rating it rightfully deserves.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1435950/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1635858580","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1435950/page.bg.jpg?t=1635858580","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1435950/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1635858580","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1435950/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1635858580","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>A NEW TAKE ON THE RTS GENRE</strong><br><br>The creeper is crawling through hills and canyons to your base while you try to stop it in its tracks by building a space station, constructing weapons and structures and ultimately encapsulating the sources of this insidious enemy.
