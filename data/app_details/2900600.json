{"about_the_game":"In Anomaly Escape, you find yourself on a spaceship that has activated self-destruction for unknown reasons. Your goal is to fight your way from Corridor 0 to 10 to reach the bridge and deactivate the self-destruct sequence. But beware: Each corridor may contain a deviation, also known as an anomaly. Recognize these and provide the correct response, or you'll have to start again from Corridor 0.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this sci-fi adventure aboard a spaceship, you'll face numerous dangers and puzzles. Stay vigilant and remember every detail, as the spaceship's self-destruction could spell your doom.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the upcoming multiplayer co-op mode, this adventure must be completed by two players. Collaboration and quick thinking are key to success as you fight through the corridors together, mastering the anomalies to save the spaceship.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Good Ending","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2900600/508d8b31f8592b48cf09b5419ba7c8e29007e8b0.jpg"},{"name":"Bad Ending","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2900600/a7b225301d36df60c304f932e5da730e321d1743.jpg"},{"name":"Walk","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2900600/5aefbba4be5da593c8e3641d939b20198cd46878.jpg"},{"name":"Run","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2900600/18a8c8f6e260f00238a4f1aa2a8852c0bafd8074.jpg"},{"name":"Timeless","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2900600/5536b6dece04fd20791d023af199a53a3a228d7a.jpg"},{"name":"Story Datapad 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2900600/335d22a4bdb02e4eefac8fc893cdf0d00c8b09b4.jpg"},{"name":"Story Datapad 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2900600/54235967c3941237fcb8c5d2d478178d35f0833a.jpg"},{"name":"Story Datapad 3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2900600/0ee49f4364317c5b912da7dc213851a6e23bd41e.jpg"},{"name":"Story Datapad 4","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2900600/414fd7eb56a05b8338f8ce3bc6499e1be7ea74c7.jpg"},{"name":"Story Datapad 5","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2900600/aedd6bd68e99c4f18cc691b5e519feaeed822cad.jpg"}],"total":15},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2900600/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1717894228","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2900600/page.bg.jpg?t=1717894228","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2900600/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1717894228","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2900600/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1717894228","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In Anomaly Escape, you find yourself on a spaceship that has activated self-destruction for unknown reasons.
