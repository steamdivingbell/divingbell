{"about_the_game":"Virtual Touch Screen 2 enables you to control your PC with a webcam using precision hand gestures.  If you have been waiting to finally have the computer from an early 2000's science fiction movie, your time is now.  The tool operates like a mirror, showing your hands on screen, allowing you to use gestures such as pinching to click.  With two hands, you can even use multitouch functionality in applications that support it.  The new version is vastly improved from the original Virtual Touch Screen.  Most importantly, it no longer requires exotic depth sensing hardware to run.  The product can run even on budget laptops with built in webcam (see minimum requirements below).  Webcam processing occurs entirely on your own device, so your privacy is protected.  The tool is functional in a wide variety of environments, but having a high quality webcam, good lighting, and a simple contrasting background can greatly improve the experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe standard overlay will show the tracked positions of your hands along with precision gesture activation points.  If you want to see the camera feed, there are a lot of options.  There is an available underlay, which can display your camera behind your desktop icons.  The Holographic Overlay uses AI background removal and partial transparency to create a cool hologram effect of yourself.  Green screens are also supported and can be used as an alternative to the AI background removal or in conjunction with it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVirtual Touch Screen 2 can help content creators add a personal touch to their work.  The audience will be able to see you use your own hands to directly interact with the information, application, or game you are presenting.  What was once an effect which required a large amount of effort in post processing can now be done for real and in real time, suitable for not just for creating videos, but also live streaming.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2588630/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1702365788","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2588630/page.bg.jpg?t=1702365788","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2588630/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1702365788","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2588630/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1702365788","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Virtual Touch Screen 2 enables you to control your PC with a webcam using precision hand gestures.
