{"about_the_game":"Trains &amp; Things is an economic RTS (real time strategy game). We are aiming for a well paced multiplayer focused RTS where you can have games that range from 30 minutes up to a couple of hours. You will be able to play cooperatively or competitively.<br><br>Features<br><br><strong>Multiplayer via the Internet and LAN</strong> is what sits at the heart of Trains &amp; Things. Designed from the ground around multiplayer. I don't know about you but trains are fun, but what is better is trains with your friends (or against them?)!<br><br><strong>Real time economic strategy</strong> means no waiting around for people to take their long winded turns. The battle, er business, waits for no man. As the saying goes, time is money, so take every second to get leverage over the competition.<br><br><strong>Manage a logistics company</strong> by your self or in partnership with your friends. Take out a loan from the bank to build your empire and try not to sink in debt before your rise to corporate domination.<br><br><strong>Build railways</strong> as you extend your reach and your profits.

It all comes down to the creativity of the Trains &amp; Things community.<br><br><strong>Mod support</strong> helps extend a game's life time.
