Little did I know, my first day would become a nightmare. I screwed up, and suddenly, everyone pointed fingers at me, blaming me for something I didn't do. It's not my fault, you know. It's like I stumbled into a place filled with secrets and lunatics. I despise this place, and I'm not too fond of the others either. Survival seems to be my only option now.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2604590/extras/story.png?t=1695993161\" /><br>Hmm... It's kind of hard to explain all the details, but I was forced to start at this new school. It wasn't by choice; my parents practically pushed me into it. A workaholic mother and a creepy father\u2014my family is far from ordinary. But let's not get sidetracked. In this school, all I wanted was to make a few friends, but... Well, you know how that turned out. Did you manage to contact my advocate?

It's like I've never laid eyes on such breathtaking beauty before. And then there's Hitomi, the quiet, nerdy girl. She might be a nerd, but she's intriguing in her own way. Now, Marcel, she's a puzzle. A single look at her, and she ignites a fire within your heart. Her talent, too, is something else, although it pales in comparison to Veronica's. Veronica is on a whole different level; she can master anything through sheer dedication and hard work. But, my goodness, there's something about each of them that's utterly bewildering!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2604590/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1695993161","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2604590/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1695993161","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2604590/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1695993161","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2604590/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1695993161","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"It doesn't contain sexual scenes or sex scenes.
