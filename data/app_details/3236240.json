{"about_the_game":"Have you ever been on a subway? Perhaps you feel a bit scared when the roaring train is swallowed by the pitch-black tunnels? Or perhaps you are soothed by this liminal space where time stops, where there is no day or night?..<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you stay in the underground after hours, you might hear the sound of a train when the last one has already passed. But there is always just the sound. There is no train to be seen. Some superstitious metro workers say it is an ill omen, and try not to listen to the sounds at night. But not everyone believes that it\u2019s real. Do you?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWATCH OUT, THE DOORS ARE CLOSING is a magical realist visual novel, a funny and sad tale about ghosts of a Ukrainian subway, and an exploration of the meaning of life where there seems to be no meaning. Play as Nastya, a musician who makes her living playing on the subway. People have different opinions of her: many ignore her, some like her music, and some others go out of their way to insult her. One day, Nastya gets an opportunity to unlock the hidden powers of her talent as she meets the passengers on the ghost train.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a rollercoaster of emotions and impressions, you will learn about three very different characters: their problems, their hopes, and where they\u2019re headed. With her music and her charisma, Nastya can influence and change the fate of each, if she can only learn how to touch their heart strings. Perhaps she can also change her own fate.
