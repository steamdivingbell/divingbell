The centerpiece audiobook is not intended for young readers/listeners, as the text/audio narration of the book contains descriptions of death/killing, bodily harm and threats, suicide, alcohol and drunkenness, and the use of a tobacco pipe. Profanity and sexual innuendo is mild and infrequent. There are discussions and depictions of religious themes and practices. Two characters possess disabilities - one mental, the other physical - and suffer some mistreatment and threats of harm from other characters. Some minor violence toward a child by a caregiver is depicted."},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2876510/extras/About_Sect._Banners_616px_upstairs.png?t=1711666273\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2876510/extras/Argyle_Manor_About_Sect._Disc._Hidden_Haunt.png?t=1711666273\" /><br><br>Search a 3D haunted mansion, using slide-based point-and-click navigation in the style of old-school adventure games, to find ghosts and spooky concept art<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2876510/extras/Argyle_Manor_About_Sect._Enjoy_a_Digital_Art_Gallery.png?t=1711666273\" /><br><br>Full of animated works of art, by professional artist Clayton Bryant Young and his daughter, game animator and designer Audrey Bryann Young.<br><br>Each piece is animated to rotate, showing first the original flat 2D image, and then revealing an extruded 3D sculptural version on the other side, sometimes with movement and sound.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2876510/extras/Argyle_Manor_About_Sect._Experience_a_Full-Length_Audiobook.png?t=1711666273\" /><br><br>An original ghost story faerietale about the haunted mansion and its characters, with 9 black &amp; white hand-drawn illustrations by novelist Carlene Bryann Young<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2876510/extras/Argyle_Manor_About_Sect._Sneak-Peeks_of_Upcoming_Book_Games.png?t=1711666273\" /><br><br>Books in the bookshelf share a story universe; they will eventually be able to link to their own 3D storybook world.
