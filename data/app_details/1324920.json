{"about_the_game":"What do cats really want?! Sometimes, they can get so annoying that if you would just rebuild an industrial cluster to process huge amounts of data through machine learning algorithms to get an answer.<br><br>Learning Factory is a factory automation game where you will finally answer the ultimate question about your cat. To do that, you need to mine resources and craft components to renovate an old abandoned factory and make it as efficient as possible, so you can build new stuff for your feline overlords\u2026 only to research new technologies and discover new goodies to please them more. Thanks to the marvels of machine learning, eventually you will find out what they really, really want!
