{"about_the_game":"Slay God. Stay God. Stop the Chaos.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat's a King to a God is an irreverent rogue-lite management sim where you play as a begrudging hero who has just overthrown God and must assume the role themselves. It is now up to you to maintain order in the world and thwart the forces of Chaos without getting overthrown yourself. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll die in this choice-focused story that combines the gameplay of Plague Inc. and Reigns, using our unique narrative-based combat system. With a god's eye view of the map, you'll manipulate heroes, monsters, and locations to keep the realm at peace while building enough resources to stop the cycle of Chaos - of gods rising and being overthrown - once and for all.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease note that current screenshots do not represent final look.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2986470/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1720439103","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2986470/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1720439103","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2986470/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1720439103","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2986470/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1720439103","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Slay God.
