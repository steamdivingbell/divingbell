It is a really atypical graphic adventure, but fantastic in all its sections. A game in which art blends with each of the scenes, achieving a truly unusual beauty.\u201d<br>Analizando Mac<br><br>\u201cGRUNND is a point-and-click adventure that doesn\u2019t overstay its welcome, offering a rather surreal and somber experience as you make your way around the island and the town, talking to various strange characters and solving puzzles, all done in hopes of getting a place to stay for the night and finding a way to escape this weird location. The story remains cryptic throughout the game, leaving you with plenty of room to speculate and essentially fill in the gaps based on what you\u2019ve learned about the place and the people in it. Yes, the game still has some issues as pointed out above which would likely be fixed in subsequent patches, but if you\u2019re in the market for a point-and-click game with a bizarre and slightly Kafkaesque theme, GRUNND is one game you\u2019ll want to play!\u201d<br>WWGDB<br><br>\u201cYou might want to be in the right mood to play GRUNND.  Not because it\u2019s depressing per se,  but because the tone consumes you immediately  with the oh-so-slightly melancholy musical score, fancy hand-drawn visuals, and the dulcet tones of the narrator.\u201d<br>Vulgar Knight<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449920/ss_78a1432f9bb3cfe906964a14ff75ff7bc5499d52.1920x1080.jpg?t=1736520989","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449920/ss_78a1432f9bb3cfe906964a14ff75ff7bc5499d52.600x338.jpg?t=1736520989"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449920/ss_742cffb32670d3f83d1844078cc3ab569f5e139c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1736520989","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449920/ss_742cffb32670d3f83d1844078cc3ab569f5e139c.600x338.jpg?t=1736520989"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449920/ss_0f932ca39190715fc98e57580b474c620b2cd410.1920x1080.jpg?t=1736520989","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449920/ss_0f932ca39190715fc98e57580b474c620b2cd410.600x338.jpg?t=1736520989"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449920/ss_234027c40797ab324e02bcfd6b694123be15d987.1920x1080.jpg?t=1736520989","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449920/ss_234027c40797ab324e02bcfd6b694123be15d987.600x338.jpg?t=1736520989"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449920/ss_e3fb766b4fa8f833ba52cf1e9b37853174aa18ed.1920x1080.jpg?t=1736520989","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449920/ss_e3fb766b4fa8f833ba52cf1e9b37853174aa18ed.600x338.jpg?t=1736520989"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449920/ss_2c9b46e38b0687445b320e7b32a8037f43fbb982.1920x1080.jpg?t=1736520989","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449920/ss_2c9b46e38b0687445b320e7b32a8037f43fbb982.600x338.jpg?t=1736520989"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449920/ss_54267d69c9fc731d06cfe4d4158ab165b71b4f33.1920x1080.jpg?t=1736520989","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449920/ss_54267d69c9fc731d06cfe4d4158ab165b71b4f33.600x338.jpg?t=1736520989"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449920/ss_553a0900e8b06438dfc320d3e13605c73359f7ca.1920x1080.jpg?t=1736520989","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449920/ss_553a0900e8b06438dfc320d3e13605c73359f7ca.600x338.jpg?t=1736520989"},{"id":8,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449920/ss_9ee8aa13c2db4619f9dbda4f37c22bf04b89210c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1736520989","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1449920/ss_9ee8aa13c2db4619f9dbda4f37c22bf04b89210c.600x338.jpg?t=1736520989"}],"short_description":"Handcrafted mystery adventure where you travel through a town that appears ordinary until revealing its surreal, twisted nature.
