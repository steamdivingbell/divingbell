{"about_the_game":"&quot;Pathfinder 2 RPG - Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-17: Dreams of a Dustbound Isle<br> <br> A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 5-8. <br> Pathfinders stationed at the Grand Lodge have been experiencing strange shared dreams. The dreams reveal a mysterious island surrounded by dust and shadows. In the dreams, someone is trapped. They're calling for help. And someone--or something--doesn't want them to leave. <br> Investigating the dreams, the Society has learned a way for its agents to enter the strange, shadowy, dreamlike landscape. Fearing the dreams represent a larger threat, and with no time to lose, the Society sends an experienced group to investigate. <br> Given all the catastrophes at Pathfinder Society lodges these days, it could always be a trap. But someone is in there, and they need help. Besides, what Pathfinder would turn down the chance to explore a dream world which may, in fact, be real? <br> Dreams of a Dustbound Isle is part of the ongoing Absalom metaplot arc in the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries. It is the third of four scenarios in the arc, which began with Pathfinder Society Intro: Year of Shattered Sanctuaries and Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-06: Struck by Shadows. The arc will conclude with Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-19: Mean Streets of Shadow Absalom (Levels 7-10; July 2022).
