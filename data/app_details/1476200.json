Visit Hirochi in Rahu to begin.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What happens if I end my VIP subscription?</h2>If your VIP plan ends, the extra benefits go away. But you never lose stuff permanently! If your VIP slots were in use, they become &quot;overflow&quot; slots, meaning that you can't access them, but they're still there. As you free up space, they become visible.<br><br> <br><strong>Inventory:</strong> if your VIP plan ends and leaves your character carrying too much, you'll be &quot;overburdened&quot;. (This is exactly the same as if you had drunk a potion of inventory-expansion, and it wore off while you were carrying extra items.) You'll be able to access the normal number of items, and the rest will be hidden until you make space. As you drop, sell, or otherwise remove items from your inventory, the &quot;overflowing&quot; items appear automatically.<br><br><strong>Transfer slots:</strong> just as with regular inventory, if your VIP plan ends and leaves your transfer slots overflowing, you will only be able to see the regular number of items in the chest -- the rest will be hidden. As you remove visible items, the hidden items reappear one by one. (You cannot add items to a chest while it's overflowing, so all you can do is remove items until it stops overflowing.)<br><br><strong>Character slots:</strong> if your VIP plan ends and leaves you with more than 4 characters, only the 4 most-recently-played characters will be accessible. The others will be hidden. If you choose to delete any of those characters, one of your hidden characters will appear in the now-empty slot. (In Monday's patch we've revised the UI to make it obvious which characters are in &quot;regular&quot; slots and which are in VIP slots. So if your VIP is going to lapse, you'll be able to easily plan and organize which characters should stay visible.)<br><br><strong>Autodidacticism:</strong> Any earned skill levels in Autodidacticism are retained, but you are unable to use the skill until you have VIP again. If your character(s) were participating in an Autodidacticism hangout at the moment that VIP ends, that hangout is canceled.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1476200/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1641260745","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1476200/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1641260745","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1476200/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1641260745","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1476200/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1641260745","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"This game contains fantasy violence as well as references to fantasy drugs and alcohol.
