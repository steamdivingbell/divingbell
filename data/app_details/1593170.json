[...] Conversations between the siblings, whether they\u2019re arguing, comforting, or showing off their individuality, are done extremely well. That also ties into the romance aspect of the game. For each sibling, there are three unique romance options to choose from.[...] There were so many wonderful moments between Alysse and \u00c1ine, and I laughed and even cried when they touched upon the topic of sexuality. Their story felt so fleshed out and raw and real, and the dialogue, no doubt, is the reason for that.\u201d<br>Game Luster<br><br>\u201c[...] I like this kind of magical world. It's hard rather than a lush fantasy, and your spells are from the earth rather than flashy fireworks or ice storms. It feels honest. Feels like an honest day's work.
