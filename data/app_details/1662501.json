{"about_the_game":"Did you know the USSR has its own Sherman? With the Heroic Sherman DLC you will get your hands on the M4 Loza, a Tier VI medium tank, as well as the  legendary commander, Dmitry Loza. This vehicle\u2019s a great choice if you enjoy active assault play and changing your positions. <br><br><strong>Crew</strong>. You'll have Dmitry Loza leading your crew, but why would you want anyone else? <br><br><strong>Firepower.</strong> This tank has good damage per minute and a good rate of fire, and one of the best gun depressions. However, the penetration leaves a bit to be desired, so you need to be quite accurate with your shells and know the weak spots of enemy tanks. <br><br><strong>Protection</strong>. This tank works well as an assault vehicle, but it doesn\u2019t boast impressive armor, so you still need to be careful and perform a lot of maneuvers on the battlefield. <br><br><strong>Speed</strong>. The M4 Loza is practically a clone of the famous M4A3E8 Sherman, but without its mighty Ford engine. As a result of the weaker engine power and additional weight, the Loza Sherman is nowhere near as mobile as the Easy Eight. You can try out the old tactics, but it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll be successful in doing so.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Also in the package: </h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Garage Slot <br></li><li>Crew including a Commander with any zero perk of choice<br></li><li>700,000 credits  <br></li><li>3 Demount Kits </li></ul><br><strong>DLC can be added to your World of Tanks account only once. <br>You\u00a0will\u00a0be\u00a0able\u00a0to\u00a0use\u00a0this\u00a0DLC\u00a0only\u00a0if\u00a0you\u00a0play\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0game\u00a0account\u00a0created\u00a0on\u00a0Steam.\u00a0</strong>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1662501/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738315210","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1662501/page.bg.jpg?t=1738315210","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1662501/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738315210","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1662501/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738315210","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Did you know the USSR has its own Sherman?
