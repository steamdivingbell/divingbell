Between &quot;mediocre&quot; and &quot;great&quot; if you know what i mean here :) but it lacks something. This gamedev product is a plot-orientated action with some wild humor and characters. And now, point by point. Visual. It's ain't bad by any means, but not without rough moments. Like, there's some locations, where the surroundings are too dark (like a neurotic man's dream), or they're too bright like you're looking at the train running at you on its full speed though the night. Sure, there's gamma correction settings and postprocessing presets, but would be better to fix that. Characters' design is decent overall (that's better than characters in my games at least!) they even moving their eyeballs in some cutscenes, holy Christ on a bike... But the other surroundings are not that great, because of the overall blandness of them. Story. As i mentioned before, the plot is interesting to say the least. There's a lot of well woven together plot twists, and a lot of pretty cool missions. Of course i'm not a prim movie buff, but it still was fascinating to follow. And i don't want to spoil stuff here (play this beauty by yourself!), but i LOVED the finale. Loved, but it almost break me in half by its ungodly, undogly, unholy, unhumanly brutal and cruel difficulty... Still, not very much a problem for the Dark Souls players. Missions. They're tailored from the same cloth but with different-colored threads, like there's mostly driving and shooting sections. But driving is the best part of the game. Imagine vibe of riding the 1950's 23 HP rustbucket throught the fields and meadows, listening to the jazz hits from the early 70's on the radio - that's like the next level of awesomeness! (bonus points if you've already did this in real life). Other missions ain't bad too, shooting sections and the bossfights are actually fun. But they're nicely crammed into the plot, so i can forgive them all their cons :) Sound design and music. Well, that's a matter of flavour, fifty-fifty y'know. Found some catchy songs in the last chapters, theme of the second bossfight in Chapter 15 has no rights to be that good (IIRC it was a German punk band named Tollwut), theme of the boat driving in chapter 9 forces me to actually stand up and dance... The music is briliant and fits the gameplay perfectly. Atmosperic, cheerfully. Overall vibe. It's UNREALISTICALLY GORGEOUS. Maximum immersion into the post-soviet criminal culture, with characters' own time-appropriate linguistic accents, shibbolets, quirks and jokes. A lot of easter eggs (and even more ones which you can't get due to the cultural barrier), fun staff, and at the same time, drama.
