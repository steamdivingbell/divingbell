{"about_the_game":"Mithral Gun: Biomechanical is a single-player game of action survival. It tells the story of a dispute between robots and humans at the end of the 24th century, in which players as BIOs of mechanical girls survived in the battlefield.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame play is based on survival and combat. Unlike traditional survival games, players control robots without food and water, they need power and energy; the damage of robots can not be recovered naturally, they need to find materials to repair, but also can make more detailed modifications.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe background of the game is in the period of war between man and robot. As the protagonist of robots and human and robotic forces are in a hostile state, players need to survive in a war zone full of hostile forces, or become friends with one force, relying on other forces to survive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers can find all kinds of weapons and equipment available in the ruins. Weapons themselves have durability settings, each repair will gradually reduce the durability limit, which requires a reasonable arrangement of the use of weapons and material consumption, through a variety of tactical ways to solve the enemy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game contains certain random elements. Every time a player starts a new game, the map changes: for example, the location of the NPC and the safe house changes randomly, and enemies in some areas also differ.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1123520/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1577802515","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1123520/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1577802515","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1123520/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1577802515","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1123520/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1577802515","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Mithral Gun: Biomechanical is a single-player game of action survival.
