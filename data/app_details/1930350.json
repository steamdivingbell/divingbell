{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Saving a Fallen Universe</h2>Every world has fallen, and the gods are gone. But before the gods lost to the great destroyer, they used every last bit of strength to create a safe haven called Elysium for a few heroes to keep up the fight.<br><br>So it\u2019s up to you to avenge these fallen worlds and defeat the immortal god. But unlike any battle before, you\u2019ll fight this one over and over only to lose. <br><br>You believe good will triumph over evil, that it will all turn out okay. It won\u2019t. You may save some souls along the way, but no matter what you do, the Consumer of Worlds waits for you at the end.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">1-4 Players</h2>Fight your way through hordes of demon armies alone or in a group of up to 4 players! The difficulty scales by the party size to keep things challenging!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Customize Ability Colors</h2>Don't like the color of your abilities? Customize the looks of each ability to your favorite colors!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1930350/extras/custom_colors_optimized600.gif?t=1732205893\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Diverse Fighting Styles</h2>Each run is different! Every character was designed to have unique combat styles that you can control based on loot and your choice of talents (120+ talents per character)! Want to turn your glass cannon Ice mage into a frosty tank? The choice is yours!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fight An Eternal Fight</h2>At the end of the run, you\u2019ll take on an undefeatable, unbeatable, undominable boss. See how long you can survive and if your build has what it takes to finally take down the big bad boss.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Collect Loot</h2>Find loot from over a BILLION different rune combinations, allowing new passive skills and bonuses to influence your run! With 6 rarities, and a forge system that allows you to upgrade and reroll specific aspects of your runes, you can create the perfect setup for your chosen build.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1930350/extras/loot_screenshot.jpg?t=1732205893\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Procedurally Generated Maps</h2>Dodge a myriad of specialized enemy skills from fresh encounters that change from map to map. Staying true to the roguelike side of the game you will choose between randomized events on different worlds, randomized shrines with powerful boons that can change your run, and run-specific items to buy from merchants.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Quick Gameplay</h2>Don't have a lot of time to spend on games? Or maybe you're just tired of 90 minute roguelike escapades. Don't worry. Each expedition into the corrupted worlds takes about 30 minutes. Still too busy? Just do one act and head back to base with your new loot.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">11 Difficulties</h2>As you loot and progress from one expedition to the next, you unlock new difficulties (up to 11 total). Higher difficulties not only make the expedition tougher, but they introduce new game mechanics to spice things up. Oh, and you get way better loot too!","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1930350?t=1732205893","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1930350/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1732205893","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1930350/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732205893","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1930350/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732205893","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":1972700,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Saving a Fallen Universe</h2>Every world has fallen, and the gods are gone.
