{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Gridiron Grilling, the player chooses to play as 1 of 5 different meats/cuts of meats: T-Bone steak, Ribs, Lamb Chop, Pork, and Chuck Steak. Each of these characters has their own unique playstyle and unique pool of cards they can use to add to their deck. Each Act will feature a different group from the food pyramid to take on, culminating in a boss fight. At the end of each Act, you are rewarded with a mighty legendary card to fill in the gaps of your decks' weaknesses or push your game plan even further.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">5 Playable Meats</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3076210/extras/Chuck.png?t=1735931707\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Chuck uses his high mobility and poison-tipped forks to dance around the battlefield and defeat his enemies over time while staying untouched.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3076210/extras/Lambella.png?t=1735931707\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Lambella uses her peppermill to strengthen her resolve and damage her would-be assailants.
