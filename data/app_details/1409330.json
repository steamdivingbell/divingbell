At the end of 1989, the inflation rate was close to 5%. During this period, the Federal Reserve has been adopting a contractionary monetary policy and substantially increased the interest rate of short-term Treasury bills from 1988 to 1989, finally suppressing the inflation rate.

According to statistics from the International Monetary Fund, from 1989 to 1994, the average annual growth rate of foreign trade in developed countries was 3.65%, while that in developing countries was 9.59%.
