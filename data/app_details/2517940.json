{"about_the_game":"Century of Steam is a physics-based multiplayer railroad simulator and strategy game. Bridge, cut, tunnel, and plow your way through multiple expansive landscapes across North America and manage the logistics of day-to-day railroad operation to serve each region's unique and dynamic economies.  Experience one hundred years of history behind the throttle as you build, maintain, and run your fleet of highly customizable locomotives and rolling stock, carefully curated from historical equipment built between 1869 and 1969. Discover the sights, sounds, and stories of narrow gauge railroading through a curated digital experience, lovingly crafted with the guidance of historians, museum volunteers, and steam locomotive crews to push the boundaries of railroad games with industry-leading simulation, sound design, and gameplay. One quill of the whistle and you'll be hooked.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2517940/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1693023962","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2517940/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1693023962","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2517940/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1693023962","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2517940/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1693023962","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Century of Steam is a physics-based multiplayer railroad simulator and strategy game.
