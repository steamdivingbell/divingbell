{"about_the_game":"Reflex - A casual sci-fi puzzle game.<br><br>Your homeworld has been attacked devastating all life and it's up to you to fight back. Using the advanced Reflex missile you will infiltrate unknown enemy bases across the galaxy as you track them back to their homeworld.<br><br>In this casual puzzle game, you add components to unknown enemy bases that will reflect, duplicate and split the Reflex missiles. You will need to destroy the power generators, communication systems and weapon platforms across more than 100 levels. Each new world brings with it new technology to utilise and deal with from laser fences, breakable walls, gas vents, laser turrets, and the dreaded teleporters.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1790740/extras/Image1_0.png?t=1683093091\" /><br>Easy to learn game mechanics.
