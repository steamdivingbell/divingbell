{"about_the_game":"Welcome to the lost age of chivalry, where magic and myth is alive, and you are destined to be one of the living legends: Arthur, the son of Uther Pendragon, the Once and Future King of the prophecies.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\tFulfill your destiny and claim your rightful place on the throne of Britannia. Recruit fabled knights to your Round Table: send them to adventures or battles, let them gather knowledge and artifacts, see how they become the most powerful heroes of the realm. Build the majestic Camelot, but beware: there will be enemies, both mortal and otherworldly that will try to destroy you. Send your heroes and their followers to battle with legendary warriors and monsters and see how the folk of the faeries and the saints set against wizards and evil knights.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Real-time fantasy battles:</strong> spectacular fight scenarios on grandiose battlefields, featuring thousands of soldiers and powerful heroes such as Sir Lancelot, Sir Galahad or Merlin. Battles rely on the strengths and weaknesses of the different arms with several tactical possibilities, the abilities of the units and the heroes, monsters and most of all, spells.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Turn-based Campaign Map:</strong> Britannia is represented as a fully three dimensional topographic map where heroes move freely, conquer provinces or find adventures.

There are many possible events and outcomes that all influence the legend itself and determine the ending of the storyline.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Morality Chart:</strong> Every decision in the game will influence the position of King Arthur on the Morality Chart. King Arthur might become a Christian ruler or the Follower of the Old Faith; a rightful or a ruthless monarch.
