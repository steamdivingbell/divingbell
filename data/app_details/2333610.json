{"about_the_game":"Prepare for combat on the high seas or far in the starry skies with RE-D MUSIC PACK 5! Gee-kun-soft is back with another set of excellent orchestral tracks, bringing you 10 new BGMs to choose from. Strings, horns, and drums build off each other to create tunes that leave you feeling small compared to the vastness of the world around you, as if it\u2019s just your hero and their crew in the middle of an ocean or the darkness of space. Let your heroes forge ahead with blaring horns urging them forward, or warn them that time is limited with quick, insistent violins punctuated with heavy drums.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKeep the energy up with the rat-a-tat of drums and choral chanting as your heroes fight off an attack from a powerful foe, or have it playing in the background while they race to escape their floundering ship after a surprise attack blows a hole in the hull! And when there\u2019s nothing they can do to win, let one of this pack\u2019s slower tracks play as your heroes are forced to watch the villain succeed in sinking their ship or taking over the kingdom\u2019s castle. But not all is lost! Let your heroes use that loss to strengthen their resolve and work hard to gather new companions while powerful drums and horns play in the background, and win the last battle to the sounds of spirited trumpets!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach track comes in multiple audio formats, making it easy to add these to your current project no matter the engine. So if you\u2019ve been searching for some music to fill your ship\u2019s corridors and add some dramatic orchestral tunes to cutscenes, check out RE-D MUSIC PACK 5!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* 10 royalty free songs<br />\r\n* mp3, ogg, m4a, wav and looping ogg files included<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTerms of Use:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* This pack is for use in RPG Maker Series or the engine of your choice.<br />\r\n* OK to be used in Commercial projects<br />\r\n* Contents can be edited<br />\r\n* OK for use in games with gore<br />\r\n* OK for use in adult-rated games","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2333610/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1681339549","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2333610/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1681339549","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2333610/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1681339549","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2333610/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1681339549","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Prepare for combat on the high seas or far in the starry skies with RE-D MUSIC PACK 5!
