{"about_the_game":"<strong>Recipe for Disaster</strong> is a management game that challenges you to create and run a highly successful restaurant. Whether turning around the fortunes of failing establishments in pre-set scenarios, or bringing your own vision to life in freeplay mode, you\u2019ll be carefully designing restaurants, hiring and managing the right staff, customizing food menus, and experimenting with ingredients to invent tasty new dishes that will impress your customers. Sounds idyllic, right? Wrong.  <br><br>Blazing a trail through the hectic and stress-inducing world of the food-service industry will be anything but straightforward. After all, this is an industry built around people, and keeping everyone happy, motivated and fulfilled will require nothing short of a miracle! Serious personality flaws and major skill gaps within your team could really disrupt the flow of service, while the volatile attitudes and peculiar tastes of your customers may prove to be the barrier that separates you from those all-important positive review scores. <br><br>With perseverance, savvy management and a great deal of compromise, your restaurant will grow, opening up new opportunities and challenges as you attract ever more customers, health inspectors and food critics through your doors. Expand your premises, improve your staff, and walk the precarious line between gastronomic glory and restaurant ruin.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1492360/extras/RFD-Dream-Team_V2.gif?t=1726567322\" /><br><br>Pick from a pool of procedurally generated hopefuls.
