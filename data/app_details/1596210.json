{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Legendary Hunters</h2><strong> The Hunt is On!</strong><br><strong> <i>Legendary Hunters</i> </strong> is the latest volume in our series of class-focused player supplements for the <i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</i> , this time focused on the intertwined souls who use their connection to overcome challenges and hunt down threats, the hunter and their companion. These two use their skills in the wilderness, tandem tactics and training, and primal magic to protect their domains. <strong> <i>Legendary Hunters</i> </strong> completely redesigns the hunter class granting it more unique, diverse and iconic class abilities centered around their animal companion. The Legendary Hunter and their companion will stand up to any challenge and be a great addition to any adventuring party. Along with the redesigned base class are five new archetypes like the <strong> Outer Hunter</strong> with their arcane magic and evolved companion or the <strong> Phantasmal Hunter</strong> with a connection to beasts both alive and dead, 2 archetypes compatible with <i>Spheres of Might</i> and <i>Spheres of Power</i> , and 6 redesigned and updated archetypes from the original hunter like the urbane <strong> Courtly Hunter</strong> and the <strong> Packmaster</strong> with their coterie of companions. Hunters, rangers, and druids, both legendary and core, can benefit from new feats, for them and their companions, new companion options, and new spells that set magical traps, herbal spells and spells infused into ammunition. Finally, there is a sample character and their companion to show off the capabilities and features the class has to offer.
