{"about_the_game":"Dive into this rhythm-infused, 4-player co-op hack-and-slash adventure where the chords strike harder than swords! Leave the conventional warriors behind; here, your weapons are musical instruments. Obliterate zombie hordes with electrifying guitar riffs, missile-like drumsticks, ferocious bass swings, and piano turrets that blast foes into oblivion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you groove through the apocalypse, collect shimmering Jam Gems to power up your jam meter, readying you to unleash epic performances that decimate the undead! Tear up every highway from LA to Hell across 28 pulse-pounding levels. Are you ready to jam, unleash solos, and save the world from the undead's encore?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShred The Undead is the debut game from the passionate team at Citizens' Loft Interactive, paying homage to beloved couch co-op adventures. The heart-pounding soundtrack is a masterpiece crafted by the gifted team at Citizens' Loft Records (Ben DeUrso, Ian Brenckle and Kamen Ross).","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Four Piece Of Cake","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2484270/541f8726f32e46b2f64bc2ec16325eadcfcd60a2.jpg"},{"name":"Piano Prodigy ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2484270/e4df1012e15d61bf319bb6cbcd97171db7d3dbfe.jpg"},{"name":"Guitar Guru","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2484270/6cdfcdd6a03bbf7e06a9bda6a464eb508cdeabe1.jpg"},{"name":"Bass Beast","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2484270/79d5e150d5ecac892539b67c7f5b0abf1ca4e4d4.jpg"},{"name":"Drumming Dynamo","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2484270/287837164c86499fa2c65c3a431c484711d9c1c2.jpg"},{"name":"50's Enough, Thanks!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2484270/cdfc211568bbc42dbc745f508f93dafd9249937f.jpg"},{"name":"We Can Move Faster Than Their Bullets","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2484270/041aabc122f870eba6604d383a9b3c7fe79b552c.jpg"},{"name":"You're Not Hardcore Unless You Live Hardcore","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2484270/54b1c8de581b0ee09ea5ab01e81d4b8695e0eb86.jpg"},{"name":"Viva Las Victory","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2484270/5238aaa9e9a90eb729ed95c653c2aae63c5e8d1e.jpg"},{"name":"From Whence You Came You Shall Remain","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2484270/cadbe372287711359b4ef10db9080ed3e15b4973.jpg"}],"total":15},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2484270/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730116760","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2484270/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1730116760","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2484270/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730116760","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2484270/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730116760","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Dive into this rhythm-infused, 4-player co-op hack-and-slash adventure where the chords strike harder than swords!
