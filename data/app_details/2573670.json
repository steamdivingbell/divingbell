When I was little, you told me that my mother was a fairy, a star, an alien queen. But I kept thinking, I don't want those awesome moms. I've been thinking... I don't want an awesome mom. I just want an ordinary mom to be by my side every day. &quot;<br>&quot;The last photo, a group photo of you both, may have been taken with the help of a passerby.

But in your case, these duties are clear.\u201d<br><br><u>Life is like a long-lasting song in the wilderness,<strong> re-raising the inner child</strong>, and irrigating the fragrance of the garden with the intimacy of friendship.</u><br>&quot;To be honest, I'm envious of these people because I'm different from them, and I'm missing half of my path. All the while, I\u2019ve been limping along it.\u201d<br>&quot;The storyteller said that our little princess had to be brave, then she became brave. So convenient! Has anyone asked the little princess for her opinion? No! Because she's just a character to be manipulated! \u201d<br>&quot;I used to think that only princesses in bedtime stories deserved certain things: respect, friends, happiness, love... But we were born to enjoy all of this. Rest when you're sick, cry when you're in pain, stop and sleep when you're tired.
