Follow his story as he fights demons who have\u00a0possessed his soldiers and friends, attempting to reach the depths where Hell and Earth connect to stop this demon invasion and save all who are left.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>STORY -</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The story of Commander D.A.-9's journey to the depths of the Earth is the priority of Lof-Ely: The Dark Cave. Help him fulfill his story and reach his inevitable fate. Meet the Anti-Avian Association's D-Squad, whom you'll be tasked with saving as they all face an unexpected threat.

Never underestimate an opponent, one failed dodge can spell your demise.\u00a0</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Turn-based Combat</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Returning to the good old traditions of classical RPG games, Lof-Ely: The Dark Cave has a classic turn-by-turn combat system, where you'll choose what to do in your turn, and respond to the enemies' actions in their respective turn. Unlike classic RPGs, you'll fight mostly with one character, so you must strategize and use every item and tool in your arsenal to keep him alive and deal with your enemies as quickly as possible.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dodge enemy attacks!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">An enemy attack will usually be accompanied by a &quot;dodge key&quot; on-screen, pressing the correspondent key will allow your character to dodge out of the way and spare himself any damage in the enemy's turn.

There are elemental attacks that deal more damage according to the enemy and have diverse costs from dealing less damage to tiring yourself out. There is also a gun, fire it and aim it properly to deal the most damage you can.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Choose a Difficulty for YOU to best experience the game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If you are here for the narrative, characters, and/or puzzles, you can choose to play in STORY mode. In this mode, the game offers more save spots, more loot, and enemy attacks are easier to dodge. Although, if you are here for combat and a classic RPG grind, then CHALLENGE mode might be more to your liking. In challenge mode, enemy attacks are as quicker, save spots are scarce, and defeat is but a few hits away.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>PUZZLE-SOLVING -</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Decipher all kinds of puzzles, from classic skull pushing to interpreting bible verses, we've got all kinds of brain-breaking challenges. No, but really, get ready to push a skull, because you'll be doing that a lot. You WILL GET TIRED of that SKULL. Don't worry, you can get an ending, if you just solve the basic puzzles! However, if you want the cool endings, you might have to put your brain to the test( or look for a guide &gt;:| ).</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Push a cranium to unlock blocked paths!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Maneuver your character to push a cranium across the 2D plane, once the cranium reaches the ritual circle, you've completed the puzzle! But be alert, for if the cranium gets stuck, you might have to start from the beginning by using a heretical stone to return the craniums to their starting position.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Match a biblical phrase with its book, chapter, and verse (Might require either having a bible at hand or, you know, looking it up online).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Read a biblical verse, and correctly identify its book of origin, the chapter, and the number it holds.
