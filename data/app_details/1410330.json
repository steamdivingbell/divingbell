The futuristic metropolis just happens to also be populated with cyborgs, old gods hidden in the depths of a criminal underground, and humans eager to crawl their way to the top, no matter what the cost. <br><br>After a fertility crisis changed the landscape of the city for good, a single company stepped in to help the residents: Life S. Incorporated, a biotech firm that claimed to be able to build life out of raw DNA, creating a fully formed human with thoughts, feelings, and morality of their own. <br><br>Their minds, physical appearance, and personality would be drawn from their parents\u2019 DNA, but the children would be \u2018born\u2019 using artificial bodies. This new generation would be called the S.Humans: a non-aging, tough form of new life. <br><br>Love Shore features two playable protagonists with four storylines and romanceable options, each with their own storylines. Sam and Farah are two completely different characters suffering from the same circumstances: they're S.Humans, one of the 100 cyborgs created by Life.S. before the company vanished.  <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1410330/extras/Sam_Bio_Steam_Resize.png?t=1704344146\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1410330/extras/Farah_Bio_Steam_Resize.png?t=1704344146\" /><br><br><strong>FEATURES</strong><br>LOVE SHORE features 25+ possible endings, 8 different storylines, multiple complex weaving routes and an awesome soundtrack!
