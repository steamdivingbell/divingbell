You will take control of the hero who had a prophetic dream, telling them to leave their country and go to Elyndra. And there will be a lot of work to do - currying favor with the locals, tending to your farm, and saving more than just Elyndra from an upcoming invasion will be no easy tasks!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The story revolves around you becoming a part of the local community during a time when a war brews. You'll team up with 2 other Dreamers, traverse varied lands, repel an invasion, and uncover the truth about the surrounding world. While you may not have what it takes from the get-go, you will grow alongside your companions and the community. You will also grow tomatoes, cucumbers, and such, for you will be given a <strong>plot of land to farm</strong> and support the people of Elyndra. This means that you can play the game any way you want - <strong>you can do both farming and adventuring or focus entirely on either of those!</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game combines the best of titles like the old-school Zelda games with the likes of Stardew Valley while having its own style and identity.
