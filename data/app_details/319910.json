Perhaps he is not the most skilled or fearsome of wizards, but the heroes rely on Amadeus on all things concerning magic and legends. Amadeus has always liked adventures more in theory rather than in practice, preferring the fame and tales of his deeds to the actual doing of said deeds, which often deprive him of naps and holidays with his family.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/319910/extras/pontius.png?t=1725007208\" /><br>The brave protector of the realm with a big heart, Pontius is a champion to anyone in need, regardless of their station. Pontius was knighted by the King himself, and he has a red cape to prove it! He is a frontline hero who is always going headlong first into battle with his trusty shield and sword. In addition to passionately fighting on the side of Goodness and Justice, Pontius has an equal love for good food and drink, and dreams of one day settling down on a simple farm, where he could protect his corner of the world, while growing enormous potatoes and pumpkins. And eat pie.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/319910/extras/zoya.png?t=1725007208\" /><br>Clever and elusive, Zoya gets in and out of tricky situations all the time. She brings her bow and arrows to a fight, but she also has a grappling hook that can be useful in various thiev... situations. Zoya appreciates all the adventures she has had with with Trine, due to all the trinkets she's been able to collect on the way, but she is becoming anxious to get back on her own. Being on call for Trine is nowhere near as thrilling as her old life as a purveyor of rare and precious items.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Sheep Happens","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/319910/9aa5fdde2a16900e21abc28722a0ef0990b8a739.jpg"},{"name":"But It Belongs in a Museum!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/319910/a777f0721c5a54e2494f1f30b4e15b63426f4edb.jpg"},{"name":"I Like Turtles","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/319910/f9168bfc2f6d2e842e7e89a8936bbab3b85b9359.jpg"},{"name":"Stop Busting My Walls","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/319910/f949d01b255f54f263a869ed608c30a5a6c2febc.jpg"},{"name":"Graduated With Honors","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/319910/e2088c009fe4a2a9213dcc6b6cd2a1e9fc8c2fb7.jpg"},{"name":"A Day as a Bookworm","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/319910/d98fe1fb68b1e7fecd4d7d6fd7cf1b234c00228c.jpg"},{"name":"Timber!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/319910/24ea4077af87c3dc74a8500f2f670b022d2c1178.jpg"},{"name":"K.O.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/319910/2198fb7a0a2395dd7a931c5bbe8db3b36a27a28d.jpg"},{"name":"A Friend of \"Poetry\"","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/319910/de40de7dc69dfb127694945b4fb31c06adb00008.jpg"},{"name":"An Itch for the Shiny","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/319910/1809eb2210fbacd7125384030a317d337409427a.jpg"}],"total":28},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/319910/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725007208","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/319910/page.bg.jpg?t=1725007208","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/319910/d7a9a4e44e7d4c295197e68d0f30fdeabebb1018/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725007208","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/319910/d7a9a4e44e7d4c295197e68d0f30fdeabebb1018/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725007208","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h1>JOIN US ON DISCORD</h1><p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/319910/extras/Trine_3_gif_footage_steam_storepage.gif?t=1725007208\" /><br><br>Experience a fairytale world of breathtaking sceneries and face a myriad of physics-based puzzles, wonderful contraptions, dangerous foes and enchanting creatures.<br><br>Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power is a platforming game of action, puzzles and adventure, and the sequel to the award winning Trine and Trine 2.
