{"about_the_game":"Bring civilization to Sproggiwood, a story-driven, turn-based roguelike set in a humorous world inspired by Finnish mythology. Grow your civilization and plunder procedural dungeons with six unique classes. Outsmart mischievous monsters who work together in unexpected ways. No two dungeon dives are alike.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2>You\u2019re a simple farmer from the peaceful island of Clog. One moment, you're tending your grove -- the next, you\u2019re lured through a mysterious portal by a talking sheep. Now you\u2019re the prisoner of Sproggi, a mischievous forest spirit who's built a whole village just for you. You have a simple job: tame the wild creatures that roam the forests of Sproggi's realm...<br><br><br>Watch Sproggi's plans go awry when you discover a rival civilization on the rise to greatness. Will you choose to befriend these curious Mushroom people and stand together, or will you crush them and claim Sproggiwood for your own? Seize the day and civilize Sproggiwood now!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>Sproggiwood distills the roguelike genre down to its core fun ingredients: inspired character classes, loads of interesting loot, and procedurally populated dungeons with monsters and traps that combine to produce totally unique tactical challenges. In Sproggiwood, adventure sessions are compact and chock-full of interesting choices for you to make. Each dungeon dive follows the heroic rise of one adventurer from your civilization. Journey through teeming forests, haunted swamps, teetering cliffs, and glacial mazes to uncover your civilization's whole story.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A wondrous and humorous setting inspired by Finnish mythology<br></li><li>Brain-churning tactical combat vs. an assortment of creative monsters and traps<br></li><li>Six fully unique, customizable classes: simple farmer, brave warrior, merry archer, cunning thief, brainy wizard, and creepy vampire<br></li><li>Procedural dungeons filled to the brim with scrolls, potions, swords, and staves<br></li><li>Town decoration mode with buildings, trees, roads, and villagers</li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Silence the Easy Opposition","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/311720/44af4f71173d953c8232b47f9101d3b86b100609.jpg"},{"name":"Silence the Opposition.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/311720/fb32ab46a143ec0afbba79d1825959b61f6d9220.jpg"},{"name":"Civilizer-in-Chief","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/311720/7ecd0aee75b06fab10279080d412f8ff36adf340.jpg"},{"name":"Civilizer-in-Chiefest","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/311720/a87ea83f5b70cf55f2fd54344925db4233d16f83.jpg"},{"name":"High Fiver","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/311720/307afd91113c4e43445f2bdff9f7a5c7681f2e3b.jpg"},{"name":"Weapon of Mass Destruction","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/311720/bba1796feb1887c8b5cf161d6357bafb49ee9aeb.jpg"},{"name":"Quasi-Pacifist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/311720/6dfb8281a212350daf4492b5b2eead8497317075.jpg"},{"name":"Mirror, Mirror","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/311720/ae2187e7a842052fc66f0248861b8fb52231ca2d.jpg"},{"name":"Et tu, Cloghead?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/311720/4812a8687254fcf9342c68f84d65532aeddd6384.jpg"},{"name":"Savage Jelly Party","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/311720/22263927f0ccbca887d653062ef2c2f440b6206e.jpg"}],"total":19},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/311720/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1691167352","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/311720/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1691167352","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/311720/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1691167352","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/311720/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1691167352","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Bring civilization to Sproggiwood, a story-driven, turn-based roguelike set in a humorous world inspired by Finnish mythology.
