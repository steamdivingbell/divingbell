{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Reverb</strong> is a multiplayer stealth tactical first-person shooter set in a fictional Biopunk universe, where there's a constant struggle for species evolution. Take on the role of a creature at the top of the food chain and evolve into a perfected organism for eliminating competitors. Players will have the opportunity to upgrade equipment, characters, and their own shelter by collecting the main currency - DNA elements. Destroy hostile creatures, harvest resources from their organs and parts, and improve your shelter and yourself. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Invisible to some, visible to others</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">While on the prowl, you'll never be sure if there's no one around you. The main feature of the game is the reverb effect, making players invisible. All players participating in the match are invisible until they take damage. Any damage received or noise made will highlight the player or part of their body, making them a visible target for other players. But don't forget, the creatures inhabiting the Reverb world not only see you in this state but also hear you!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Living Weapons</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Weapons in the game are alive - literally. Each weapon is a living organism that adapts to its owner. If you wield a weapon that belonged to another player, it may not obediently obey you. The more you play with a specific weapon, the more it submits to you and unlocks new ways of use. Improve weapon parameters by literally growing additional attachments on it, such as an optical sight, new muscles for more accurate shooting, and so on. If the weapon is fully obedient to you, leave it anywhere and shoot from it by connecting to it through neural link. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Shelter</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">By collecting valuable resource - RNA, upgrade your shelter. Build corridors using Cell blocks. Construct special chambers that allow you to upgrade your weapons and characters. Take care of them, repair them for more effective enemy destruction. Hang the corpses of defeated enemies as trophies, invite friends to your shelter, share resources, and boast your achievements with other players. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>A World Where Enemies Evolve</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Enemies inhabiting the Reverb world are in a constant state of evolution. Weak creatures become food for stronger ones, which, by consuming everything around, mutate into stronger representatives of the species. By killing creatures around you, players leave their bodies as food for other creatures, thereby influencing the development of stronger creatures. The more players play in one world, the stronger the creatures inhabiting it become.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2514890/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730265352","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2514890/page.bg.jpg?t=1730265352","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2514890/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730265352","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2514890/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730265352","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>MAKE SURE TO WISHLIST REVERB!</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2514890/extras/steam-wishlist.gif?t=1730265352\" /><br><br><strong>Add REVERB to your wishlist!</strong><br><br>Wishlisting <strong>REVERB</strong> is the most significant way to support us as it boosts the game's visibility on Steam and ensures you won't miss its release!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Reverb</strong> is a multiplayer stealth tactical first-person shooter set in a fictional Biopunk universe, where there's a constant struggle for species evolution.
