{"about_the_game":"Core gameplay and highlights<br />\r\n1. As a PVP third-person mecha shooting game, the core gameplay is mainly reflected in firearms. You can win the game by defeating the opponent player by shooting. Because the character controlled by the player is a huge mecha that can fly, and the addition of the z-axis depth and automatic aiming system, the shooting feel, mobile operation and other aspects can bring a unique experience to the player.<br />\r\n2. Destructible terrain and base buildings: Rocks in the wild and buildings in the base can be used as bunkers, but buildings, bungalows and even street light pipes can be destroyed, and some boulders have falling damage, encouraging players to think about how to use the battlefield environment while engaging in fast-paced combat<br />\r\n3. Destructible bodies: All bodies can fly and have automatic aiming systems. Each body can be destroyed by parts (hands, feet, head) and have different effects, for example: hands: weapons fall, heads: The core parts of most mechas are difficult to destroy due to blurred vision for a period of time, etc. However, the limbs are relatively fragile and require players to take advantage of them.<br />\r\n4. Skills and weapons: Each machine has three unique weapons and one ultimate skill. After destroying other people\u2019s body parts, they can pick up other people\u2019s weapons and use them, allowing players to feel the pleasure of using other people\u2019s weapons.<br />\r\n5. Data Tower: Players who occupy the data tower can obtain gains, such as: attack power, blood volume, ultimate energy, etc.<br />\r\n6.
