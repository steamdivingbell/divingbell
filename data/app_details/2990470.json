As a result, part of Shiyuba has now been cordoned off to allow everything to be excavated. After many intense runs, almost the entire population of the city and surrounding area was evacuated. Three groups remain: Bandits; workers at Nexcorp (the largest Aurorium company in the world) and Dissenters, a group that fights against NexCorp and anyone who stands in their way.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SCAVENGE</h2><br><br>Explore, collect, and create an array of diverse items and progress through tiers of loot.
