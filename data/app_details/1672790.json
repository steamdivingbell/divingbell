the '90s while shooting and slashing pixelated enemies in a wide collection of scenarios.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Far away, near death</h2>Explore the unique locations of Aske, a hostile planet inhabited by a variety of bloody creatures such as the cleaver-armed Skeanners, the parasite-infected Headnails, the erratic Meatballs, among other living beings and environmental threats.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">They shall pay with blood</h2>A whole weapon loadout is at your disposal to make sure every corner is covered with the remains of your foes, turn the corpses of your enemies into <i>gib</i> pieces and delight yourself with a bloodbath while wielding melee weapons, firearms and even exotic tech weapons like the plasma gun.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The last echo from humanity</h2>Get wrapped up in the industrial atmosphere of Romain Rope's abstract compositions and feel the oppressing ambience of a long forgotten planet.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Trve retro experience</h2>Enhance the nostalgia with retro mode, a carefully crafted optional setting that emulates the graphic limitations of game engines from the past era.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1672790/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1628958166","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1672790/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1628958166","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1672790/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1628958166","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1672790/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1628958166","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial
