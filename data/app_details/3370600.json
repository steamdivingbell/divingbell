{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Lost Room: Escape</strong> thrusts you into a relentless nightmare where survival is your only goal. Trapped in a cursed, dimly lit apartment, you must find a way out while being relentlessly pursued by a monstrous entity that seems to anticipate your every move. The apartment is a labyrinth of shadowy corridors and locked rooms, with puzzles and hidden clues standing between you and freedom.
