{"about_the_game":"This game is a life simulation and child-rearing game. The universe is under invasion by the evil catfish monsters, causing countless alien planets to fall into war. Many aliens seek refuge on Earth, and players take on the role of an ordinary Earthling wanderer, adopting alien orphans and accompanying them as they grow up. Your goal is to help these children improve themselves, ultimately find suitable jobs, and obtain Earth citizenship. As more children are nurtured and grow up, your fame increases. Despite your children being spread across various professions, you remain a carefree wanderer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame Features:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMulti-Dimensional Parenting Experience<br />\r\nEach child has unique personalities and needs. You must tailor courses and activities to their strengths and interests, helping them grow up healthily and happily.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDiverse Endings<br />\r\nEvery event choice and course progress affects the children's development and career outcomes. Some negative choices will increase the child's darkness value, impacting the story and endings. Whether you guide them toward the light or a different path is entirely up to you. After joining the workforce, children will write letters and provide assistance to you, improving conditions for the next child you adopt. Ultimately, you evolve from an unknown wanderer to a renowned wanderer with children all over the world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVarious Random Events<br />\r\nThroughout child-rearing, you will encounter random events related to daily life, academic progress, social interactions, and more. Each event offers different choices, influencing the child's growth and final outcome.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMultiple Gameplay Mechanics<br />\r\nThe game features cooking, farming, real estate, hoop throwing, running, and more. Different events and gameplay mechanics provide status boosts to the children, enhancing their energy, mood, and four-dimensional attributes. Players also earn money to buy necessities and enroll children in courses.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDiverse NPCs<br />\r\nThe small town is home to various NPCs, including a poetess fleeing from war, an injured yet optimistic gym teacher, and an alien JK girl who ran away from home. Interact with these NPCs to form unique relationships and unlock additional stories and collectibles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProgressively Unlocked Challenges<br />\r\nAs the children grow, the game's difficulty gradually increases. You must strategically arrange studies and activities, balancing consumption and gains, to unlock higher-level courses and challenges, ensuring continuous improvement for the children.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3082930/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1720313182","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3082930/page.bg.jpg?t=1720313182","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3082930/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1720313182","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3082930/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1720313182","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This game is a life simulation and child-rearing game.
