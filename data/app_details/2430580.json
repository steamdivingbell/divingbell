It sold more than a million copies and earned its spot in the top-5 best-selling Intellivision\u00ae games ever. In this space-themed game, players use a laser cannon to destroy incoming meteors, bombs, and other targets. <br><br>In ASTROSMASH\u00ae you control a laser cannon that scrolls left or right along a flat plane to target falling objects, such as large or small meteors, spinning bombs, guided missiles, or an UFO that crosses the screen from time to time at higher levels.

As the game advances, the range of speed increases.<br><br>The game has ten levels, each of which features different objects. Each level is represented by a different beautiful background and amazing background music. Sounds and background music are perfectly synchronized with the gameplay.

The hyperspace option moves the laser cannon to a random location, which may or may not be safer than the starting point. <br><br>This <strong>ASTROSMASH\u00ae </strong>reincarnation is much more exciting, more visually appealing, and somewhat more challenging without straying from the game\u2019s original theme and gameplay. The new graphics are phenomenal and the amazing background music \u2013 compiled by the famous game music composer Tommy Tallarico \u2013 adds incredible excitement to this video game classic.
