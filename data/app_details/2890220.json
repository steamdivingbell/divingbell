Sovereignty will consist of a conquest or advance and secure simulation for players and npc. Factions and races can be destroyed permanently. Factions can be started by players and bots.  Players purchase bots with their own separate account to experience the world. The MMORPG will be an experience about sovereignty and civilization lifestyles using leveling bots(pvp capacity) and players. <br><br>Players and npc work, live, and thrive on rpg elements. The space simulation mostly will focus on npc gameplay with players around as a feature. The bots learns to behave like players. Recent tests show they communicate beyond human communication. Players will be outnumbered by npc accounts as a feature.<br><br><br>Story<br><br>Earth is a harsh place. Elves live next to humans across Earth. Far away from man elves make great cities. The faction of elves sees how most would like to destroy them, so they form many alliances and give birth to many across Earth. Orcs, goblin, trolls,dark elves, tauren, and furicus all try to survive on earth. Location data on factions is a sold commodity and is heavily traded. <br><br>The aliens not from earth and their factions are quite hard to find though many find them and fight them in secret ways. Factions fall hourly mostly due to being weak and not as strong as those with the people who are wise enough to flourish in front of war. War comes and many don't handle it that well. Though the planets have their heroes and great evils.<br><br><strong>*View the Manual for more information</strong></p><br><h1>Roadmap</h1><p>The goal of this simulation is a world where players are not needed to play. They are only needed to purchase npc at prices such as $0.25-$500. The game uses a modified inworld ai for unity that is designed for npc to npc interaction. We are also using the modified inworld ai for npc life simulation interaction, npc warfare interaction, and npc cross communication using its features. NPC will write files and reserve memory. A system based off of learning how it work. If inworld ai proves not capable of working on planets we will use the source code. The simulation is meant to be realistic in all combat methods and social interactions between npc and players. The npc count will be increasing around 2^59,000,000 and more compared to the player count which may be capped at 10,000 to 1,000,000. NPC are meant programmed to showcase various ways to live and various unknown civilizations and there ways of life experienced in simulation which will be automatically recorded using many different\u201cfly cameras\u201d that are programmed to follow npc,players, ectoicus(page #x),endohems(page #x), and apociums(page #x). NPC only know things about their world by participating in the world.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2890220/extras/hughbowen_The_large_hadron_petsrelaor_at_the_LPV_in_Cmir_with_i_ee256a41-1734-4c17-b94b-a4d3cec76615.jpg?t=1718284245\" /><br><br>This simulation is meant to run on a array built using vast amounts of gaming computer parts purchased and fabricated. Array engineering is based on the images seen below:<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2890220/extras/Capture.jpg?t=1718284245\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2890220/extras/Capture2.jpg?t=1718284245\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2890220/extras/Capture3.jpg?t=1718284245\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2890220/extras/Capture4.jpg?t=1718284245\" /><br><br>These images are a electromagnetic induction circuit board. The fundamentals of an array an what will <br>be made for the real time simulation. The array uses electromagnetic induction reactors designed for computer graphics using chemicals and electricity. An electromagnetic induction reactor designed for computing using chemicals, electricity, <br>and magnetism, and plenty of memory for starters. The image will be made into a capital machine size array made using large and or XXL size 3d printers built into a warehouse using polycarbonate filament or resin printing. Arrays will cost $80,000,000- $100,000,000 to buy for other real time simulations and gaming experiences. Footage from the simulation will be prepared into various cinematic films for theater by storing frames to render for post rendering solutions. The first array should be a array with 4 of each gaming computer parts for ultra high end graphics and computing. The first array sits in a component of the large array which would be housed at a generic warehouses on LAN until customers want the application window. A server must be available to host the simulation.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2890220/extras/hughbowen_The_large_hadron_petsrelaor_at_the_LPV_in_Cmir_with_i_718d01dd-af87-4867-8b51-66ab0858c53c.jpg?t=1718284245\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2890220/extras/hughbowen_The_large_hadron_petsrelaor_at_the_LPV_in_Cmir_with_i_8609420f-8015-466a-9637-6f6763bf2a2f.jpg?t=1718284245\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2890220/extras/hughbowen_The_large_hadron_petsrelaor_at_the_LPV_in_Cmir_with_i_a961670b-7ff3-495c-b0e0-c190b7f12379.jpg?t=1718284245\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2890220/extras/hughbowen_The_large_hadron_petsrelaor_at_the_LPV_in_Cmir_with_i_ee256a41-1734-4c17-b94b-a4d3cec76615.jpg?t=1718284245\" /><br><br>Foliage and visual effects are prepared using external applications and methods are not for real time rendering but using in real time rendering using the array.
