I'm a new order picker at AmaZoo. I think my job is to get these boxes to the right place, but I don't have all the instructions, and there are some dangerous things I don't know about here. Can you help me move all these boxes and find my way out? I can't wait for this long day's work to be over.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Puzzle Gameplay</h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3242310/extras/giff_gameplay_Steam.gif?t=1727912243\" /><br><br>AmaZoo is a progressive and varied puzzle game, inspired by the classic video game Sokoban, but in profile view (like the old classic 2D games). In this game, you can solve a multitude of puzzles and put your logical mind to the test, moving and organizing different types of boxes to reach the exit and move on to the next stage. But be careful, some boxes are fickle, and watch your step!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Several types of boxes</h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3242310/extras/boxes.png?t=1727912243\" /><br><br>There are several types of \u2018box\u2019 in the game, each with its own characteristics and mechanisms. As KoKo, you can carry, drop, throw, stack, jump and climb with the box in your hand, and even kick it if it annoys you or gets in your way!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A trapped environment</h2><br>AmaZoo's warehouses are complex and don't necessarily comply with safety standards for humanoids: very high staircases, endless shelves, conveyor belts, compressors, faulty machinery, electrical breakdowns and leaks, etc. Fortunately, some mechanisms still work: switches, automatic doors, cranes and bouncers. Watch out KoKo, you're risking accidents at work!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Chill Puzzle Game Experience</h2><br>Despite the booby-trapped boxes and dangerous environment (otherwise KoKo would be too bored to work.) AmaZoo is a quiet game where you can think and play at your own pace, solo, without hurrying. If you get stuck, you can restart the level or even skip the puzzles and come back to them later using the main menu. And if you like a challenge, you can start again and beat your own record!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3242310/extras/wishlist.png?t=1727912243\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3242310/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727912243","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3242310/page.bg.jpg?t=1727912243","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3242310/ae0ec6f76d713c54c43b1895373b5faa8ae76d69/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727912243","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3242310/ae0ec6f76d713c54c43b1895373b5faa8ae76d69/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727912243","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3242310/extras/helloKoKo.png?t=1727912243\" /><br><br>Hi, I'm KoKo.
