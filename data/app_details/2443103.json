{"about_the_game":"The Sample Engines Bolt-on contains 5 extra sample generation engines to boost capabilities of SFXEngine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProteus is a hyped-up sample player. Proteus is a sample player with variable forwards and backwards speed, and variable loop points. Can be used for crazy effects of all sorts, sounds that play or bounce forwards and backwards, loop, judder, stutter, and lots more. All Proteus samples loop forever.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSample Loop is a sample player with internal, eternal delay. This will play a sample of your choice and keep it looping with a simple delay, rather than using loop points. This can be useful for triggering a regular sound every so often. Take a simple sword-clash, for example, put lots of Sample Loop engines in a row with different delay values and the result will sound like a battle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStereo Proteus is the stereo version of Proteus; a sample player with variable forwards and backwards speed, and variable loop points. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nStereo Sample is a stereo version of the basic Sample engine, allowing separate left/right samples.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nZeitraum is a sample player with a unique electronic tone, and separate pitch and speed control. Zeitraum is a sample effect which permits wild independent control over the speed and pitch of the playback. The results at extreme values can sound tinny, metallic, robotic; ideal for special speech effects.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2443103/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734435892","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2443103/page.bg.jpg?t=1734435892","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2443103/deb25b3e5783bbe33465eef6016bfde810d0dab6/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734435892","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2443103/deb25b3e5783bbe33465eef6016bfde810d0dab6/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734435892","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Sample Engines Bolt-on contains 5 extra sample generation engines to boost capabilities of SFXEngine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProteus is a hyped-up sample player.
