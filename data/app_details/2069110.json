{"about_the_game":"A hidden object game where you must find all the bees to complete each level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2>\u204d 1000+ bees<br><br>\u204d 10 unique artworks<br>\u204d Unlimited hints if you get stuck<br>\u204d Restore a small number of bees to a painting so you can find them again! <br>\u204d Additional bee related objects to find<br>\u204d Music and ambiance for each artwork<br>\u204d Achievements<br>\u204d Use your keyboard to move/zoom in if you have no scrollwheel<br>\u204d 3 save slots<br>\u204d Reset progress entirely and play again<br>\u204d Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Context:</h2>The brief was simple. I commissioned artists to create a fantasy world, and hide as many bees as they can inside it. Now it\u2019s your job to find them all! With 10 art pieces to choose from, and 1000+ bees, you will have a lot of searching to do.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Controls:</h2>Use your mouse to move around the image and zoom in / out. When you find a bee, click it and it will disappear. You can also use WASD to move and the arrow keys to zoom.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Difficulty:</h2>A full range of difficulty is included, but all levels start unlocked, your progress is saved as you play, and you can use hints if you get stuck.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get immersed:</h2>Each painting has its own music and ambiance to help you connect with the world, as you search for all the bees.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Replayable</h2>You can restore a small number of bees back into a painting so you can find them again! It\u2019s much harder when there are only a few bees left (especially randomly). You can also use up to 3 save slots so you can replay without progress loss. Alternatively, you can reset your progress for the entire game if you\u2019d like to start over.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Perfect","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2069110/9a530c592b2175ab7032ee5ff89346a2d8311d6a.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Mechanical Lizard","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2069110/9a74b8b9f0c9632987f1ab113efc6eeffa616ba9.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Pumpkin Garden","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2069110/8406303b0ba028ad222c33a568444021bf8cf5a0.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Bears","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2069110/5c5e108fdd92c227a3d4755a81515c43a8ef6ee9.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Kitchen","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2069110/67d26f2e9eb19a52f28ca6176c813c0b6ec3192a.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Dinosaurs","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2069110/fd9b42defcbb8e0e5595993297107c956270242d.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Costume Party","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2069110/381f9d2f5b137c6bdb5a22c7f9b47176d41dd6aa.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Oceanside","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2069110/69d1da6959f90b39c11ddd10f0f0525bf210cbc4.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Mind Bend","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2069110/605a51267ea01fc08a72513fc8074e03dc0ee1cd.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Space Bots","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2069110/568a01ba3a7bae1390d74bfe58e6ddbcb671a0fd.jpg"}],"total":11},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2069110/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714855290","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2069110/page.bg.jpg?t=1714855290","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2069110/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714855290","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2069110/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714855290","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>\u2b50 Recommended for you! \u2b50</h1><p><br><br></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>A hidden object game where you must find all the bees to complete each level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2>\u204d 1000+ bees<br><br>\u204d 10 unique artworks<br>\u204d Unlimited hints if you get stuck<br>\u204d Restore a small number of bees to a painting so you can find them again! <br>\u204d Additional bee related objects to find<br>\u204d Music and ambiance for each artwork<br>\u204d Achievements<br>\u204d Use your keyboard to move/zoom in if you have no scrollwheel<br>\u204d 3 save slots<br>\u204d Reset progress entirely and play again<br>\u204d Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Context:</h2>The brief was simple.
