As the liberator of the Interworld, you take on the role of the virus led by Raid. The virus moves around floating and can use projectiles to defeat enemies, activate switches and much more. After a linear starting area, a small but nice open world awaits you, in which three dungeons can be found and completed in any order in order to face the dragon. Away from the dungeons, there are many optional upgrades to be found in the world that can be earned through puzzle solving, mini-games, battle arenas, and other activities. By obtaining all upgrades, you will not only make the main journey easier, but also learn more about the <i>Interworld</i> and the story of Raid!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2761860/extras/gcgif2.gif?t=1736846162\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Solve puzzles with skill and precision!</h2><br>The puzzle solving is based on switch puzzles, physics puzzles, agility games and similar elements. All of this is realized via the virus's shooting mechanics. Some puzzles, especially early on, are isolated to one area, but later in the complex dungeons you'll notice that they can be viewed as one big puzzle box where different rooms can influence each other. With GameChanger's dungeons we want to capture the classic &quot;dungeon feeling&quot; from older action adventures and at the same time enrich it with our own innovations.

The same projectiles you use for puzzles are also used to defend against counter viruses. They appear all over the world in different forms and challenge your precision and your ability to react. Sometimes you will even have to compete in battle arenas against smaller portals with large numbers of counter viruses.
