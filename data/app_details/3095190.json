Once renowned for its peaceful nature, flourishing crops and trade with other parts of the kingdom, <strong>Telmara</strong> has been plagued by fear ever since the demonic rift was opened.

Located in the rugged mountains to the east of the kingdom of <strong>Valheron</strong>, the mines were once a major economic center, supplying not only iron, but also rare and precious metals such as silver and gold, used in the manufacture of weapons and enchanted objects.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">However, these mines hide a dark past.

This is an ancient valley which, according to local legends, was carved out by the weeping of the gods after a cataclysmic war between ancient peoples and demonic forces.

This area was once a sacred place, where the peoples of <strong>Valheron</strong> came to pray for the gods' clemency after battles. But over time, the energy that permeated the canyon darkened, and demons unleashed by <strong>the Temple of Ruin</strong> rift began to wreak havoc.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Today, the canyon is a barren wasteland, still echoing with the wails and cries of lost souls.

Today, this temple is at the center of the tragic events shaking <strong>Valheron</strong>, for it shelters the demonic rift through which the demon <strong>Sevarog</strong> began to invade the world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The temple was built when the first kings of <strong>Valheron</strong> sought to seal off dangerous mystical forces. Legend has it that the gods themselves helped erect this structure to imprison otherworldly entities too powerful to be destroyed. Orders of monks and priests once lived here, guarding the magical seals that held back these dark powers.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Over the centuries, however, the temple was abandoned after a war between neighboring kingdoms.
