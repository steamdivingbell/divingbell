{"about_the_game":"Zoom Player represents my life-long quest as an indie developer to craft the most versatile media player and Home Theater experience for Windows.<br><br>What makes Zoom Player the best overall media player? It's the user interface, viewing experience and tweaking options. Lots and lots of tweaking options, tailoring the playback experience to your personal preferences without bloating up or slowing down.<br><br>Under the hood, Zoom Player uses the best audio/video decoding and rendering technologies available to get the job done. Whether it's Microsoft DirectShow framework, the FFMPEG project, LAV Filters, libVLC or the Chromium browser, Zoom Player uses the best playback engine for the task. The flexibility of picking the right media engine for the task means that pretty much every media format can play at the highest quality your hardware can muster. And if it doesn't, I will do my best to resolve any issues in the discussions area.<br><br><strong>What about Control?</strong> If you're scared by long lists, skip to the next paragraph, otherwise know that Zoom Player can be controlled with a Remote Control app; a physical Remote Control; an XBOX controller; a mouse; the keyboard; using a PowerShell Script; Home Automation apps; over TCP/IP; WinAPI; through the Command line; and even with a web browser. Sorry for the long list, but the level of control and attention to detail I designed into Zoom Player is unmatched!

You can choose from several high quality skins, you can adjust the skin and dialogs to look good on any display (regardless of the screen size or resolution), you can tint the skin's color, replace the Home Theater's background image and if you're an artist, create your own custom skins.<br><br><strong>What about Streaming?</strong> Zoom Player has the best IPTV implementation on Windows, providing access to live TV from across the world (caveat below).

Next I wrote the most in-depth documentation for a media player, ever. Every checkbox or setting is explained in great detail. I personally provide support and take requests on Zoom Player's reddit community and review the Steam discussion area often. Every question is answered respectfully and thoughtfully.
