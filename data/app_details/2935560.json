{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About</h2>Roller's Escape is a bite-sized platformer that lets you roll around and take control of a cube that you move towards a goal. Once you reach the goal, the character turns into a sphere, which moves towards another goal by rotating the level to get the sphere to roll.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Playstyle</h2>Avoid dropping the sphere and find the shortest path to the goal with a limited number of attempts. When flipping the cube, you start over if you run out of attempts, so It's important to think about the shortest path to the goal. Depending on the surface area of the path traversed as a cube, you'll either have an easy or hard time rolling the sphere around the level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">More</h2>Roller's Escape is a platformer with light puzzle-solving, problem-solving, and pixel graphics. In addition, a level progression system transports you to the next level after reaching the goal. There are over 10 levels to explore, with each one being more challenging than the last. Will you rise to the challenge and beat all the levels?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2935560/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1717940616","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2935560/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1717940616","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2935560/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1717940616","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2935560/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1717940616","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About</h2>Roller's Escape is a bite-sized platformer that lets you roll around and take control of a cube that you move towards a goal.
