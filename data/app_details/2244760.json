{"about_the_game":"From the dark sinister caves of the underworld to the Christmassy streets of Santa's Village, this soundtrack features the musical backdrop that accompanies Azazel throughout his devilish shenanigans. Listen to The Sugar Plum Fairies from Club I.C.E. perform the most memorable songs like; Azazel's Christmas, the opening title theme; their dancy rendition of Jolly Old Saint Nicholas; the jazz-infused stylings of Jingle Bells; and most notably, their punk-driven take on Deck the Halls, featuring none other than Azazel himself on vocals, swapping lyrics filled with Christmas spirit for hellish stanzas riddled with horror. Can't stomach the traditional cheese of Christmas music every year? This collection of tunes will have you embracing the darker side of some holiday classics.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2244760/extras/Club.gif?t=1701440895\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2244760/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1701440895","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2244760/page.bg.jpg?t=1701440895","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2244760/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1701440895","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2244760/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1701440895","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"From the dark sinister caves of the underworld to the Christmassy streets of Santa's Village, this soundtrack features the musical backdrop that accompanies Azazel throughout his devilish shenanigans.
