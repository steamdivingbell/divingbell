{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Survive</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Running through the woods alone is never safe, but with a group of people seems to quiet the thing down, cause that is your friend... right!? Don't believe anything you see. Survive the night in the forest, collect resources to try and escape. Explore with your friends or alone as you try to conquer this enemy. You will play as a person lost in the woods, with only a flashlight. You will have to work alone or with other people to find resources, make items, and use them to escape, all while being hunted down by a creature. The creature will attempt to stop you, and prevent you from getting away from its grasps, but only at night.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3257620/extras/ss5.png?t=1728020222\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Explore The Woods</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The woods are never safe, especially away from civilization, but even more so when you have no idea where you are.
