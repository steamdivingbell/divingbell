Share your \u201cmods\u201d with the community in the Steam \u201cWorkshop\u201d or on the Discord channel or download the \u201cmods\u201d that most interest you.

Will you steal a victory on the buzzer using your signature play?<br></li><li><strong>Signing players in contract year:</strong> Players in contract year can now be signed for the following season without a transfer fee. However, this option is not as simple as it sounds because some players have a Right of First Refusal clause and their respective teams can activate it to keep them on board.<br></li><li><strong>Signing U18 players:</strong> U18 players no longer have a contract with a salary and clauses and they will stay in their team until reaching senior age.
