{"about_the_game":"&quot;Rock, the Tree Hugger&quot; is a casual arcade-style game where you must &quot;save&quot; humans and &quot;hug&quot; trees all while rushing against an impending forest fire in increasingly harder levels. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe goal of &quot;Rock, the Tree Hugger&quot; is to &quot;save&quot; a certain number of humans and &quot;hugging&quot; a certain amount of tree score. <br />\r\nYou are a rock rolling around colored forests with one goal: avoid the fire; and &quot;save&quot; humans, AND &quot;hug&quot; trees! <br />\r\nYou control the rock by holding down left-mouse button and moving the mouse around. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGreen trees give you normal score. <br />\r\nRed trees speed you up, like taking Methamphetamine. <br />\r\nBlue trees slow you down, like after taking Methamphetamine. <br />\r\nYellow trees give you double score. <br />\r\nOrange trees reduce your size, like working out. <br />\r\nPurple trees increases your size, like eating donuts. <br />\r\nHumans increase your 'save humans' score. Save has apostrophes for a reason... <br />\r\nFire will kill you.
