{"about_the_game":"Control a Pong ball aching to break free of its life stuck between two paddles. Explore a dangerous, minimalist world, armed with simple two button controls: tap a button to change direction diagonally by 45 degrees, and hold down a button to unleash a cathartic dash forward. That\u2019s all you need to solve environmental puzzles and labyrinthine levels. Around each corner is a new challenge that will test your two-button and problem-solving skills. A variety of difficult enemies and bosses help you mark your time as you navigate through 30 levels spread across four worlds.<br><br>qomp2 effectively captures the essence of the original 1972 Pong and its spiritual successor, the 2021 experimental indie title qomp.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Cerebral Puzzling:</strong> The simple, two button controls belie complex and compelling gameplay.
