{"about_the_game":"The nightmare has descended on the starship Starfarer ETOS-1. Dr. Carter, the crew's premier forensic pathologist, is woken from hibernation to investigate the mysterious death of a ground-crew member. Little does Dr. Carter know, but this death will set the grounds for all the horror that is to come. <br><br>As the infection spreads amongst the crew, turning them into grotesque, mindless versions of themselves, Dr. Carter finds that they are not driven to madness. Rather, they can harness the power of the parasite. This comes at a cost, however, as the use of these powers and further exposure to the parasite\u2019s influence on board test not only their strength, but their will.  <br><br>Armed with weapons from the safety-escort military group, Vaga-Corp, and their newfound powers, Dr. Carter must traverse the ship to aid laying the groundwork for a potential escape. But when the expedition is exposed as a myth, full of deceit, greed, and hidden agendas, it is no longer just those infected they must overcome, but also the enemy survivors who want nothing more than to please their own leader.  <br><br>When the fate of the crew hangs in the balance between one tragedy or another, Dr. Carter must be the one who determines the fate of everyone on board.  <br><br>Battle the hoards, resist the call, and uncover the truth of the sinister story behind Necrotic Nightmare. <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3024510/extras/Explore.png?t=1724024932\" /><br>key Features<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Mow your way through the enemy hoards!</strong> This First-Person horror shooter experience places you directly at ground zero.
