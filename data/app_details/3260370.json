{"about_the_game":"A North American classic revs up for Southern California service in Train Sim World 5, as the venerable and robust F59PHR bolsters the roster on Metrolink commuter duties. Take on the Antelope Valley or San Bernardino rush with retro power! <br><br>Derived from the GP59 freight locomotive, the F59PH was designed in the 1980s to deliver new passenger diesel equipment to emerging commuter networks. Kitted out with 3000 horsepower and Head End Power, the F59PH was among the top brass of locomotives, making them a clear candidate to work in tandem with modern cars and capable of handling busy schedules. <br><br>First settling into service in Toronto, Canada, the early 1990s saw a fleet of locos ordered for Metrolink to embark out of Los Angeles and run across their sprawling Californian network. As years have rolled by, so too has technology, but despite two newer diesel types in traffic today, the F59PH hangs on as the F59PHR \u2013 a rebuilt variant which can meet modern emission standards. <br><br>As part of their age, the Metrolink F59PHRs still hang onto their classic white undercoat, a stark contrast to the silver sheen of their passenger equipment. The F59PHR comes accompanied with the bombardier bi-level cars in their grey liveries. <br><br>Multiply your Metrolink experience on the Antelope Valley or San Bernardino Lines with the F59PHR in Train Sim World 5! Take to the rails of any US route in your collection with Free Roam. <br><br><strong>Please Note: For the full experience, we recommend you own Train Sim World 5: Antelope Valley Line which is available as a separate purchase.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2> <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li>F59PHR locomotive in Metrolink white livery <br></li><li>Bi-level cars in Metrolink grey liveries <br></li><li>Climb into the highly detailed, feature-rich, cab of this classic locomotive <br></li><li>Feel the powerful, true-to-life performance and suspension <br></li><li>Learn to drive the F59PHR with accessible Tutorials on the Training Center <br></li><li>Operate passenger trains across Scenarios and in the Timetable of Antelope Valley Line <br></li><li>Also appears in the San Bernardino Line Timetable <br></li><li>Livery Designer, Formation Designer and Scenario Planner compatible.
