For some unknown reason, the sun began to produce gigantic solar flares that literally melted Mercury and Venus in a matter of days. The Earth was no exception and began to heat up as well. There was a general panic. Ordinary people relied on world leaders to somehow resolve the situation. They didn't. Instead, they immediately packed up and flew off the planet with the world's wealthiest class as part of a secret government project. Slowly, the original civilization began to disintegrate into smaller parts until there was almost nothing left.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Over time, the planet was almost completely drained by the constant extreme temperatures. Only a minimum of vegetation remained. Of the few humanity that was left, most people went mad over time and just wandered the world looking for a little water and food. Two hostile factions are trying to restore some sort of general order and help those who haven't gone completely mad. But each in their own way. If you're not loyal to them, you're nothing more than a grain of sand in an endless wasteland. And this is where your story begins.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You start out as a neutral survivor, and your only mission is to survive. How? That's up to you. You can build loyalty to one of the two factions, or you can stay neutral. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. Find out who's on the side of good and who's on the side of evil. Explore the world. Build your sanctuary. Trade. But above all, survive!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2218970/extras/discord.png?t=1734356877\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EARLY ACCESS &amp; COMMUNITY</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Joining us on Discord means being in touch with us. We listen to you. We listen to your ideas, feedbacks and complaints as well! We want to lead our game from alpha state in the straight direction to the stable (1.0) version through all storms. We want to deliver the most enjoyable post-apocalyptic multiplayer game to you. That's our goal. Be there for it. Be here with us.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We do our best, because we are players as well. So this game is not a product of AAA studio, but it's driven by pure desires and visions of how the post-apocalyptic multiplayer game should look like.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2218970/extras/features.png?t=1734356877\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ONLINE MULTIPLAYER (CO-OP)</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Host the game only for your friends or make it available to the public. The game offers a standard P2P model where one player hosts and others can join. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">(The maximum number of players is 200, but the actual number depends mainly on the hardware of the host computer and the connection speed. Most current computers and a solid connection should easily handle 20-40 players, so if you're thinking of co-op with 10 friends, you'll enjoy the game quite easily).</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ONLINE MULTIPLAYER (MMO)</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Do you like real interaction with strangers? Do you like to play PvP or PvE? Join our official public servers that are available 24/7, or discover community servers run by players from our community.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We are working towards running servers for the maximum number of players, i.e. 200. We currently have servers set up for 40-60 players, as the game is Early Access and we see that meeting the demand. When we see that the servers are consistently full, we will start adding more servers or expanding the capacity and hardware.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DEDICATED SERVER</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game is also available in a minified version to run your own dedicated server.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The maximum number of players per world is 200. Keep in mind, however, that a large number of players also requires adequate hardware.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LAN MULTIPLAYER</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">For LAN party lovers, the game also offers the possibility to play completely offline but still enjoy multiplayer with friends. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SINGLE PLAYER</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">For lone wolves who want to enjoy the post-apocalyptic atmosphere undisturbed, we have also prepared this option.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">QUESTS</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">For those who likes to accomplish missions, we have prepared over 100 quests. A player can start a quest by &quot;Asking for a job&quot; certain NPCs in the world.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SKILLS, XPs, LEVELS</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There are a lot of hidden mechanisms in the game that the player can influence using the Skill system. You can thus improve your character to suit your play style as much as possible.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Enjoy earning XP for various in-game activities to increase your level.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MAIN CURRENCY</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There is no more money. Only barter. Hold on.. there is something similar to! All survivors there use rusty nuts. Yeah, just rusty nuts. Or are they some special as well? Bet on it.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TRADERS &amp; TRADING</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There are traders outhere! Meet them randomly in wasteland, or locate them in villages or lonely spots all over the world. Each of them has unique demand and offers, and prices of course! Some of them demand something special, it's totally on you to figure out the way how to obtain the goods of their needs.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FACTIONS &amp; LOYALITY</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You enter the world as a nobody, who is loyal to no one. There are two big areas on map which are under control of two main rival factions. You can go there, but on your own risk, if you're not loyal to them. Otherwise they will protect you if you meet them. You can obtain loyality to certain faction in a few different ways. There are a few more factions you can meet, but it's up to your desire of exploration our world.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">OUTPOSTS</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Outposts are strategically located colonies that are under the control of a given faction. The location is unknown and the player will discover these colonies as he travels through the game world. Now the importance of faction loyalty comes into play, as the defenders of an outpost will attack anyone who is not loyal to their faction. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the Outposts you can encounter rare merchants with a specific assortment of goods for purchase and redemption, among other things, rare loot will be found, and not only from fallen opponents in the case of conquering the Outpost. The defenders are regularly replenished by air transport from the main bases of the faction.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">AIR CARGO DELIVERY</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can find remnants of a wireless network in the world that you can repair to restore the signal. Once you have a signal and the necessary transmitter, you can order a air cargo at your position, e.g. vehicle, building material, battle drone or faction unit.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PROCEDURALLY GENERATED WORLD</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When you create your world, you can choose a size between 9 - 121 km2. Each world has a unique shape based on the seed you specify when creating it. In a procedurally generated world, you will find smaller settlements, larger cities, junkyards, faction outposts, bandit bases, radioactive zones, unbreathable air zones, abandoned buildings, and random merchants.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SURVIVING</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Of course you will need food and water to survive. But that's not enough. There are more challanges outhere. Watch your fatigue or oxygen in your lungs carefully, or you would be dead really fast. Be aware of radiation and intoxication.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BUILDING</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We have many objects that you can build. The first category is functional objects. For example, this is a mattress that allows you to set a Spawn Point - the birthplace where you will appear if you die. Then there are production objects that you have to take care of, and they produce various items or liquids for you as a reward. Another category is for example Defence Objects. You can add defensive units to your base or build a high defensive wall. Of course there are various storage spaces like crates or barrels for liquids.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MODULAR BUILDING</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game offers the option of modular base building, where you have foundations, walls, stairs, a floor and a low fence. This is a brand new feature of the game, which we will gradually expand.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">NPC &amp; AI</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Our world is alive everywhere you go. You will meet strangers and traders, or enemies of course! NPCs are driven by our prototype implementation of Infinite Axis Utility AI, using our prototype of independent navigation in the world (not classic Pathfinding).</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ANTI-GRAVITY VEHICLES</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Vehicles play their own role in the game. Whether you're using them to deliver cargo to earn some extra cash, or just using them to speed up travel or explore the world faster. Each vehicle has a storage space and its own unique characteristics such as speed, consumption, shield, tank size, etc. Some vehicles just need gasoline to run, while others need other special liquids that you'll need to mix.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">INVENTORY SYSTEM</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The UI system where you manage your items. We mainly focus on simplicity and minimalistic interface to not complicate the player experience.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CRAFTING &amp; COMBINING</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Many items in the game are craftable. Some items have special effect on the other item - that we call combining. For example, when you have a bottle full of oil, you can repair/fix your gun with that. Or you can make a melee weapon poisoned (deals intoxication to an enemy), if you apply a bottle with poision on it.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">RANDOM SPAWNING</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We rely heavily on randomization. The world is full of randomly generated game content. Experience unforgettable world travel experiences because you really never know what's going to happen, who you're going to meet, or who's waiting for you behind the next boulder.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DEADLY ZONES</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Explore the world carefully! There are deadly zones outhere as well. We don't want to spoiler here, but we want to aware you of it. Player needs a specific set of equipment to be able safely explore these zones.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GLOBAL DISASTER EVENTS</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Expect deadly disasters driven by randomization. Again, we won't spoiler here, but be prepared for the worst. Player should pay attention to the surroundings during his travels, watch the sky, listen to the sounds and try to learn how to surive thru these unexpected events.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2218970/extras/roadmap.png?t=1734356877\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">UPCOMING UPDATES</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is a list of what you can expect in upcoming updates.</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Quests and missions (random and story driven)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Tuning, balancing and bug fixing</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> AI improvements</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> New weapons</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> New hover vehicles, faction drones, faction transports</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> New enemies &amp; NPCs</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> New buildables</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> New locations on map</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Improving of current locations on map</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> New systems around factions and Outposts</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> New types of global disaster events</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> UI improvements</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Animations improvements</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> The ability to crouch</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Brand new special locations on map</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Brand new in-game systems to scale fun</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> New sounds and atmospheric ambient music</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Achievements</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Leaderboards</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2218970/extras/about_us.png?t=1734356877\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We are a team of 3 people who decided to make a game about post-apocalyptic theme which would have all aspects we're missing in other games we like.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2218970/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734356877","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2218970/page.bg.jpg?t=1734356877","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2218970/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734356877","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2218970/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734356877","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Contains violence and in-game blood."},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2218970/extras/plains_of_pain.png?t=1734356877\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE STORY BEHINDS PLAINS OF PAIN</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Humanity was at the height of technological advancement when this happened.
