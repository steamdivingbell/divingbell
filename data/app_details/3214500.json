This submachine gun was especially valued for its compactness, ease of use, and reliability. In the forested and rural areas where guerrilla operations took place, the MP 40 was well-suited for close combat, ambushes, and surprise attacks on German columns and garrisons. The MP 40 fires 9mm rounds and is equipped with a 32-round magazine, operating in full-auto mode. Since guerrilla squads lacked regular supply lines, capturing German weapon and ammunition depots became a crucial part of their activities. In the game, the MP 40's ammunition can be replenished at enemy ammo crates.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Caract\u00e9ristiques des gu\u00e9rilleros\u00a0: </p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Guerrillas can remain in the enemy's combat zone without penalties.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Ability to carry 5 charges of TNT.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Guerrillas receive a full ammunition load from weapons found on the battlefield.</p></li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3214500/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728390078","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3214500/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1728390078","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3214500/986473564629d5877958bd15c899c518239d08a9/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728390078","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3214500/986473564629d5877958bd15c899c518239d08a9/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728390078","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This pack includes: </p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A premium squad of 5 level 4 guerrillas armed with a captured MP 40 submachine gun (Rank 2, USSR) </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">TNT charge</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">200 gold  </p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> <br>The Soviet guerrilla detachment &quot;Red October,&quot; operating in the occupied territories, made extensive use of captured German weapons, including the MP 40.
