Arrow can now completely pierce combatant body and shields, get stuck in or being deflected by them. Ex: a wooden arrow cannot completely pierce an iron shield and in most cases it will be deflected; an iron arrow will have a higher chance to completely pierce a wooden shield and hit the body behind it.<br>- Add spiked iron shield.<br>- Fix several bugs.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1483010/extras/LogoShort1.png?t=1667558310\" /><br><br>Fight For Eden is a fantasy action-RPG VR game where you will follow the story of a young orc enrolled to fight against the half elves' oppression.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>VR Skills</strong>: Specific actions done by the player in real life translated as impressive skills in the virtual world.
