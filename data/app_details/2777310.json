It was common to say that the planet was alive, but no one took it literally. The first contact between Gaia and humanity culminated in nuclear obliteration.<br><br>The catastrophe split the remnants of mankind into two. Some found shelter in underground data centers of major AIs. The rest would surely succumb to the elements if it wasn't for Gaia. She changed those not yet too far gone, helped them adapt to this new, hostile world.<br><br>What followed were century-long wars between the two races, which ended in an uneasy peace, poisoned air and scorched skies.<br><br>You are the last surviving member of Phoenix, a group that once tried to put an end to bloodbath and restore the world. After a century-long cryosleep, you wake up in a not-so-welcoming environment of thieves and cutthroats from a local grey zone - a small town without rules.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2777310/extras/LocationsCinematic.gif?t=1705512609\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Corporations</h2>When dust settled, AIs rose as the world's new dominant power. <br>After many trials and errors, the came to the conclusion, that people are easiest to control, when they think they are free.<br>They built techno-polices - huge domed cities with breathable air and drinkable water.<br>But whether you hold them as the last bastions of civilization or guarded prisons mostly depends on if you were lucky enough to be born in the downtown.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2777310/extras/RealWorldCinematic.gif?t=1705512609\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">AR</h2>The AR implant was invented to induce complacency among citizens. It hides the sorry state of the city, and even brings back the sunny weather for it's users. Disabling the AR is strictly prohibited, not that most would choose to do it anyway. But a skilled hacker like you might find a way around the veil.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2777310/extras/ARCinematic.gif?t=1705512609\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Matrix</h2>By far the greatest invention of mechanical minds is the Matrix. It's a neural interface to a city-spanning network, which gives people access to a cyber-space of sorts. All the while their brains are being exploited for computing power by the AIs.<br>The place is perfect for corporations, to conduct their shady business, and hackers who risk their lives for loot and glory.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2777310/extras/MatrixCinematic.gif?t=1705512609\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Grey Zones</h2>The grey zones are small human settlements dotted around the globe. Outside the influence of the corporations and barely hospitable enough to survive, these patches of human civilization have only one set of rules - the ones dictated by the local gangs.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2777310/extras/GreyZoneCinematic.gif?t=1705512609\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Children of Gaia</h2>The pitiful remnants of former civilizations aren't the only life that survives in this world. In dark forests, high peaks and deadly deserts lurk those who call themselves the &quot;Children of Gaia&quot;. They are a brand new branch of human evolution, who live in symbiosis with Gaia herself.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2777310/extras/TempleCinematic.gif?t=1705512609\" /><br><br>The world's fractions are locked in a delicate, yet deadly balance.
