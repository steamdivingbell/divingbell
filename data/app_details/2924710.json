{"about_the_game":"Rougelike Bodycam Horror<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the heart of a desolate city engulfed in a relentless zombie apocalypse, you stand as the last survivor of your wiped out team. Last Call thrusts you into the role of the ultimate survivor Korne akin to Hunk in Resident Evil 2's Extra Mode. But here, you're not just fighting to stay alive; you're fighting against the ticking clock of imminent nuclear annihilation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA frantic distress call pierces the silence through your military communication device. A helicopter pilot, bewildered by your survival amidst the chaos, urgently informs you of the impending nuclear strike. Your only chance of survival lies on the (12th Floor) rooftop of the building. But to reach it, you must claw your way through hordes of undead horrors that roam the floors below.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLast Call blends the intensity of roguelike gameplay with the chilling atmosphere of brutal horror. As you ascend each floor, every step brings you closer to the rooftop sanctuary. But with each floor, the challenge escalates, and the stakes become higher. Do you have what it takes to survive the relentless onslaught of the undead and make it to safety before the clock runs out?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChoose wisely from a selection of three perks at the start of each round, each offering unique advantages to aid in your desperate struggle for survival. Whether it's enhanced weaponry, increased resilience, or tactical advantages, your decisions will shape your fate in this nightmarish journey.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExperience the horror firsthand with the innovative BODYCAM Gameplay, immersing you in the visceral terror of the apocalypse like never before. Every scream, every heartbeat, every desperate gasp for breath echoes through the darkness as you navigate the treacherous corridors and stairwells.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWill you emerge as the sole survivor, defying the odds and outwitting the encroaching doom? Or will you become just another casualty in the annals of the apocalypse? The clock is ticking, and every decision matters in Last Call: Last Survivor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFEATURES:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRoguelike Immersion:<br />\r\nEmbark on an ever-changing journey where every floor presents a new and unique challenge. With randomized layouts and dynamic elevator and lever positions, no two runs will ever be alike. Choose your path wisely as you ascend through the treacherous floors, each offering its own set of dangers and opportunities. With the chance to select a new perk in the elevator before each run, strategic decision-making becomes paramount in your quest for survival. Master all twelve floors to unlock the ultimate prize: escape via helicopter and secure your place as the last survivor in the face of impending doom.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nImmersive Bodycam Experience:<br />\r\nPowered by Unreal Engine 5 and Direct X 12 Graphics, Last Call delivers unparalleled realism through its innovative Bodycam Vision. Dive into the heart-pounding action with visuals of the view of a Bodycam Footage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDiverse Enemy Encounters:<br />\r\nFace off against a formidable array of adversaries, including five distinct types of mutated Infected, each equipped with special abilities that will test your skills to the limit. Beware of hordes of relentless zombies whose unpredictable behavior will keep you constantly on edge. Adapt or perish in the face of ever-evolving threats in this fight for survival.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2924710/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731950057","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2924710/page.bg.jpg?t=1731950057","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2924710/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731950057","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2924710/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731950057","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"A realistic Bodycam Zombie Shooter, contains blood, dismemberment and gory violence against Zombies and the Protagonist."},"detailed_description":"Rougelike Bodycam Horror<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the heart of a desolate city engulfed in a relentless zombie apocalypse, you stand as the last survivor of your wiped out team.
