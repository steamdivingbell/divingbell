{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Overview</h2><strong>Odd Night</strong> is a psychological horror game that places you in an endlessly repeating corridor in a Victorian mansion.

You are only allowed to take one picture per loop, so be sure to not waste it. Taking pictures of things that are supposed to be there counts as a mistake and will reset you to the start.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Test your limits</h2>This game tries to put you in stressful situations of varying degrees. Anomalies can be small deviations in the structure of the corridor, but they can also open up completely new parts of the world or, in the worst case, even try to end your run for good.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Esacpe the loop</h2>Every time you clear a room correctly, your current streak increases. Every mistake will reset your streak to 0.
