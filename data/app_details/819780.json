It's about free will and determinism, the thin line between democracy and totalitarian rule, and the basic universal concepts of order and chaos. But mostly, it's about who we are in the dark, and what kind of choices we make. <br><br><strong>Price commitment </strong><br><br><br>So why $1.99 USD? I believe in a commitment to the players, both in quality and in value. I believe that no gamer should ever feel like they didn\u2019t get the value they expected for a game, especially when it comes to a digital product. As a hobbyist dev, I am not bound to shareholders to deliver profits - I make games because I want to. And I release games because I want others to enjoy them. This is something that the wider AAA games industry has forgotten. Instead of draining every last cent with DLC and loot boxes, I create finished games for a decent price. <br><br>If at any point you are dissatisfied, please request a refund.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/819780/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738782709","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/819780/page.bg.jpg?t=1738782709","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/819780/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738782709","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/819780/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738782709","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>A narrative heavy, story-driven RPG</strong><br><br>Enter the role of Maxis Summers, a junior-level researcher working on an illegal AI development project.
