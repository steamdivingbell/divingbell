{"about_the_game":"<i>The Mystery of the Cardboard Island</i> is a cozy game about two genres colliding. By day, you deliver boxes to your neighbors and friends on the island. All is good, calm, but there is something strange going on at the center of it all. By night, your nightmares show the island being burned down by horrible demons: and only you can stop this!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Day: A peaceful Island</strong></h2><br>Explore a contained open world while delivering boxes, doing minigames, chatting with the locals and simply walking around! During the day you'll be able to do things at your own pace. Customize your house and your own look, repeat minigames to beat the locals or even the dev ranking!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2821640/extras/Cardboard_Barco3.gif?t=1711450520\" /><br><br>Deliveries on the island are always a bit special.
