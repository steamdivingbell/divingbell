The winds carried whispers of sorrow, and it was on such a breeze that a wandering wizard came upon the infant. With compassion in his heart, the wizard took the child in, vowing to raise him as his own.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Years passed, and the child grew beneath the wizard\u2019s watchful care. Magic seemed to flow through him, unbidden yet undeniable, as though the stars themselves had marked him. Recognizing the boy\u2019s extraordinary potential, the wizard began to teach him the ancient arts. The child\u2019s mastery came swiftly, his spells imbued with a purity and strength that astonished even his mentor.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Moved by the boy\u2019s boundless promise, the wizard sought the wisdom of Eldaria, an ancient dragon and guardian of the realm. In the glow of the dragon\u2019s fiery breath, the wizard proclaimed his apprentice as his successor, a future protector of the village and steward of balance in the world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">But destiny took a cruel turn. The wizard, weakened by age, grew ill and soon passed into the great beyond, leaving his apprentice to grapple with the weight of his loss. Grief consumed the young mage, unraveling the teachings he once held dear. Anguish turned to resentment, and he abandoned his duty to the village, retreating into his bitterness.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In time, the mage\u2019s once-kind heart hardened. He began to use his magic for selfish ends, manipulating the villagers and hoarding their resources to fill the void left by his master\u2019s death. The village, once awed by his talent, now feared the very power they had celebrated.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">At last, the villagers, weary of his tyranny, rose against him. Retrieving the wizard\u2019s sacred staff, which the young mage had stolen in his descent into greed, they confronted him as one. United by their determination, they drove him from the land he once swore to protect.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3200240/extras/giphy.gif?t=1737738666\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3200240/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737738666","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3200240/page.bg.jpg?t=1737738666","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3200240/7d6aedbe24386af0736dc5051d3e662d175b4b55/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737738666","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3200240/7d6aedbe24386af0736dc5051d3e662d175b4b55/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737738666","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3200250,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3200240/extras/giphy__2_.gif?t=1737738666\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Take in the world of Eldoria as you climb, explore, and solve puzzles in a quest to regain your lost abilities!
