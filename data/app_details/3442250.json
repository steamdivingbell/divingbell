{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>The Null Doctrine</strong> is a turn-based combat/stealth game about an operative who can see things before they happen. Play as Omen, an agent of Sentinel, as she protects her homeworld of Dominion from a deeply-rooted internal threat.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Even the Odds</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As an elite operative, you will be going into the field alone. You will always be outnumbered and outgunned, so choose your equipment and abilities carefully to give yourself the advantage. Make use of your Remnant powers to manipulate enemy attacks - turning your foes' numbers against them.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Perfect Your Strategy</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">No random chance to crit or miss, no hidden abilities, no unexpected outcomes. Every turn begins with giving you perfect information, and every potential action you want to take shows you what it's going to do. If your strategy was lacking (or if you just plain misclicked), simply rewind time - what you saw was merely a potential future which Omen can avoid thanks to her power of Foresight.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Discover Dominion</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Enter the world of Dominion, eternally hunted by an ancient malicious deity known as Nemesis. As you discover more about the growing threat, you'll meet various denizens of Dominion. Develop your knowledge and relationships with the planet and its people.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Configure Everything</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game features an extensive settings menu, allowing you to tinker with a wide array of technical and gameplay parameters. Whether you want to limit how often you can rewind, tweak how deadly you or your enemies are, adjust UI colors, or downscale the game from 8x your resolution, the settings have you covered.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3442250/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736593129","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3442250/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1736593129","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3442250/3024cfb627e6ff4b292df81473dd87f539ee14e2/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736593129","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3442250/3024cfb627e6ff4b292df81473dd87f539ee14e2/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736593129","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Contains violence.
