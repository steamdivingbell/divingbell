{"about_the_game":"Set to the backdrop of a flooded post-apocalyptic Earth, Highwater Pirate Radio features an electric, moody soundtrack of music that perfectly mirrors the somber, oftentimes brutal, yet surprisingly hopeful atmosphere of the world. Vibe on tracks simultaneously sad and beautiful, like The World Ended on a Sunny Day and Hotel Weltschmerz or drift by ruined cityscapes to upbeat electronica. With more than two hours of original music complemented by harmonized vocals and catchy rhythms, Highwater will remain with you long after you stop listening.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2792570/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1710871163","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2792570/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1710871163","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2792570/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1710871163","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2792570/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1710871163","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Set to the backdrop of a flooded post-apocalyptic Earth, Highwater Pirate Radio features an electric, moody soundtrack of music that perfectly mirrors the somber, oftentimes brutal, yet surprisingly hopeful atmosphere of the world.
