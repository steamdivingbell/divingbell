{"about_the_game":"A hidden object game where you must find all the bees to complete each level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2>\u204d 1000+ bees<br><br>\u204d 10 unique artworks<br>\u204d Unlimited hints if you get stuck<br>\u204d Restore a small number of bees to a painting so you can find them again! <br>\u204d Additional bee related objects to find<br>\u204d Music and ambiance for each artwork<br>\u204d Achievements<br>\u204d Use your keyboard to move/zoom in if you have no scrollwheel<br>\u204d 3 save slots<br>\u204d Reset progress entirely and play again<br>\u204d Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Context:</h2>The brief was simple. I commissioned artists to create a fantasy world, and hide as many bees as they can inside it. Now it\u2019s your job to find them all! With 10 art pieces to choose from, and 1000+ bees, you will have a lot of searching to do.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Controls:</h2>Use your mouse to move around the image and zoom in / out. When you find a bee, click it and it will disappear. You can also use WASD to move and the arrow keys to zoom.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Difficulty:</h2>A full range of difficulty is included, but all levels start unlocked, your progress is saved as you play, and you can use hints if you get stuck.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get immersed:</h2>Each painting has its own music and ambiance to help you connect with the world, as you search for all the bees.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Replayable</h2>You can restore a small number of bees back into a painting so you can find them again! It\u2019s much harder when there are only a few bees left (especially randomly). You can also use up to 3 save slots so you can replay without progress loss. Alternatively, you can reset your progress for the entire game if you\u2019d like to start over.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Perfect","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2086180/9a530c592b2175ab7032ee5ff89346a2d8311d6a.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Adventure","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2086180/92f992ea487b3437e380831db831d346bb36ad29.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Rainbow Town","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2086180/3783e88da92372e9970f98523cec5927f7010d18.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Concerned","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2086180/74956a76ea48b4110977644b73260d7258879294.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Station","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2086180/eef19744a9328ccb48ec282513d3149ae9df9652.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Roadworks","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2086180/77a219c173104a68dcd7f38c79e3d127609c2ac5.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Happy Land","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2086180/6e9d8b207a42b1ba6427ed92724cae4927b9989b.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Suburban","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2086180/a97f92d27eb770f494bfaa968c80180b6ddb6fe7.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Motorway","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2086180/c9cc8b6e4a9546e426c33968d96b95c2692813c3.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Alien Base","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2086180/99d3b6ee22e68690707dced3051fb649afe65208.jpg"}],"total":11},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2086180/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714855288","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2086180/page.bg.jpg?t=1714855288","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2086180/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714855288","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2086180/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714855288","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>\u2b50 Recommended for you! \u2b50</h1><p><br><br></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>A hidden object game where you must find all the bees to complete each level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2>\u204d 1000+ bees<br><br>\u204d 10 unique artworks<br>\u204d Unlimited hints if you get stuck<br>\u204d Restore a small number of bees to a painting so you can find them again! <br>\u204d Additional bee related objects to find<br>\u204d Music and ambiance for each artwork<br>\u204d Achievements<br>\u204d Use your keyboard to move/zoom in if you have no scrollwheel<br>\u204d 3 save slots<br>\u204d Reset progress entirely and play again<br>\u204d Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Context:</h2>The brief was simple.
