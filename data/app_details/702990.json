{"about_the_game":"Welcome to CREO World, the amusement park built for CREO employees and families!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nForget your cravings for cotton candy though \u2013 CREO World was not spared from the disaster. The entire park is a death trap, where roaming rescue teams have gone insane and robotic mascots patrol freely, patiently waiting for new visitors to offer a deadly welcome.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCREO World presents a wealth of fresh challenges for players. Originally built to celebrate CREO and its mission, the park is a radically different setting from the rest of the complex, full of branching paths and secrets to discover. Survive the raging mascots and explore the park's attractions, before taking on a fearsome boss in the devastated park. Face this new threat, cutting and equipping 16 all-new weapons, new sets of armor, and new implants to upgrade and further customize the way you want to play.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/702990/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1681396813","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/702990/page.bg.jpg?t=1681396813","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/702990/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1681396813","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/702990/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1681396813","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Welcome to CREO World, the amusement park built for CREO employees and families!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nForget your cravings for cotton candy though \u2013 CREO World was not spared from the disaster.
