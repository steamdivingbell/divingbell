You will have to jump, kick, dash and ram the enemies who will block your path!<br><br>While trying to go up the tower you will find difficulties, as the tower is alive and has the mision to hinder your way up. To avoid it, you will have to set up your own map! Slide, rotate or move the different rooms you find inside the cauldron to get to the orbs. Once you obtain an orb, move around the rooms again to get to the door to the next level.<br><br>If an enchanted tower and heavy horns weren't enough, you will have to run for your life while escaping from an evil shadow. Who is that shadow?
