{"about_the_game":"<i>&quot;You have been chosen to shoulder heavy burdens and great powers. You will be granted an exceptional chance, Rowan Alanna Nightingale.&quot;</i><br><br>When homely nobody Rowan Nightingale gets hit by a car, she doesn't die, but instead is chosen to become an Auran - a being who can make anything happen, on three conditions: she has to be able to imagine it, believe it, and then create it. Taken under her mentor's wing, she travels to other dimensions and learns to harness the power of her imagination, slowly growing more confident in herself. But dark forces are lurking in the shadows, and who better to manipulate than a young, na\u00efve Auran such as her? Soon, Rowan must fight her inner demons - quite literally - in order to save the dimensions from being destroyed. But can you truly believe that you are stronger than the darkest, most evil force in the entire multiverse, when all your life you have believed you weren't worth anything at all?<br><br><i>Aurans</i> is a kinetic visual novel, meaning it is linear and with no choices. It is a story about coming of age, learning to believe in yourself, and finding out what really matters to you. Everything is fully hand drawn, and is the first visual novel project of Pixelsplosion Studios.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2871030/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1711133759","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2871030/page.bg.jpg?t=1711133759","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2871030/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1711133759","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2871030/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1711133759","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<i>&quot;You have been chosen to shoulder heavy burdens and great powers.
