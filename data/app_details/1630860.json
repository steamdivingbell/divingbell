You can execute the traditional commands from the fighting games using the directional pad plus the button to make special moves, super specials or even the final attack. Each character has an element that represents his strength, can be physical or supernatural. You can accumulate up to 2 attacks on the elemental bar. Through this system, it is possible to execute elemental attacks that have different characteristics from the others and bring new offensive or defensive possibilities for the player.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1630860/extras/ELEMENTAL.gif?t=1659965720\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1630860/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1659965720","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1630860/page.bg.jpg?t=1659965720","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1630860/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1659965720","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1630860/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1659965720","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Pocket Bravery is inspired by classics from the 90s, such as Street Fighter, Fatal Fury and The King of Fighters.
