There are no depictions of sexual acts, however other depictions of cartoon violence are present. The game features a random criminal charge being applied to a defendant which the trial operates off of. There are no depictions of sexual assault/non-consensual sex, or self-harm. However, mentions of drugs and alcohol maybe present depending on the charges selected for the player. Due to kangaroo court being an online multiplayer game weapons maybe present during the matches, and non-playable characters may attack other characters in the game, or online characters. Similarly other online characters may attack others, or your own character. When your character is eliminated their body is left in a ragdoll state, and they are turned into a ghost. Additionally, players can freely communicate via voice chat, and through communicating with signs where they can write anything they want. Additionally players can draw on paintings to show other players, and communicate through nonverbal means, so users should be aware of this functionality in the game. At the end of a match on some matches if a player is voted guilty a certain event will trigger which may display violence or killing. In some cases the \"Wheel of Punishment\" can be spun where a random punishment maybe selected for a defendant or another player. In some cases, other events may trigger such as spawning a lion to hunt down players or force players into a duel with the winner living."},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Kangaroo Court is a 4-40 player chaotic, satirical, and humorous court room simulator with trials that range from parking in a handicap zone, to murder trials.
