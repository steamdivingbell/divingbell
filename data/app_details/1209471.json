Stretching for around 25 miles (40 km) on the U.S. Highway 550, it has been said that it's one of the nation\u2019s most spectacular drives. The highway delivers jaw-dropping vistas and stunning backdrops on its winding and often dangerous road.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">So why is this stretch of road named the Million Dollar Highway?
