{"about_the_game":"(5/22/23 - First released version has some glaring bugs! I'm sorry but some sound effects are not being heard on all clients, and some bugs with point capture are present)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDawn vs Dusk is a 3v3, PvPvE, asymmetric, hard-point capture, styled, brawler.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeaturing Unreal Engine 5 and Paragon assets, this game is a re-imagining of what that franchise could have been. There are no lanes, there are no towers to destroy; only three capture pads. <br />\r\nWhen a team captures a pad they get Gold points to spend on card upgrades. Cards change the game by giving health, mana, or damage boosts. Each player receives 5 lives with no respawn timer, so play smart! Last team standing wins!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs of today, May 22, 2023 the game is still a baby.
