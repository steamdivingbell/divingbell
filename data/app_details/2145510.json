{"about_the_game":"Using the power of your shovel, and some magical crystals in the volcano walls, escape to the top of the three levels of the volcano as fast as possible, or be consumed by lava rising steadily from below!<br>Jump off walls and falling rocks to reach higher and higher. Every few seconds, or when touching one of the magical crystals, your shovel will glow with magical power, allowing your little miner to teleport to it, wherever you may have thrown it! Don't get crushed or burned alive!<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2145510/extras/Description_Gameplay.png?t=1667597200\" /><br><strong>Gameplay</strong><br>Shovel Escape is a vertical platformer, in which your goal is to strategically jump to the top of each level as fast as possible, by jumping from one generated rock to another. Avoid the glowing falling magma from above, and don't stall too long or you will be consumed by the lava rising from below. <br>You are equipped with a magical shovel, that allows you to hang off of it for better maneuvering from rock to rock, throw it and destroy magma blocks on your path, and teleport to it. <br>Once you mastered climbing to the top of the levels, try beating the levels while collecting all 30 crystals on your way up for an extra challenge!<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2145510/extras/Description_Controls.png?t=1667597200\" /><br><strong>Controls</strong><br>Move Left/Right - A / D or Left/Right Keys<br>Jump / Walljump - Space (Hold to jump higher!)<br>Throw Shovel - Left Mouse Click<br>Recall Shovel - Right Mouse Click<br>Teleport to Shovel - Middle Mouse or Q <br>Toggle Music Volume - M<br>Toggle SFX Volume - N<br>Restart Game - R<br>Switch Levels (Once unlocked) - 1 or 2 or 3<br>Toggle Crosshair Color - C<br>Toggle Fullscreen - F1<br>Wipe and Reset Highscore - Shift+Ctrl+R (ONLY IF NEEDED)<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2145510/extras/Description_Thanks.png?t=1667597200\" /><br><strong>Special Thanks to the Playtesters:</strong><br>Tobias, Elias, Patrick B, Patrick E, Kai, Avinash, Daniel and Stella","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2145510/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1667597200","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2145510/page.bg.jpg?t=1667597200","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2145510/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1667597200","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2145510/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1667597200","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Using the power of your shovel, and some magical crystals in the volcano walls, escape to the top of the three levels of the volcano as fast as possible, or be consumed by lava rising steadily from below!<br>Jump off walls and falling rocks to reach higher and higher.
