{"about_the_game":"GP40X: The \u201cX\u201d stood for experimental.

Union Pacific operated six of the distinctive and powerful GP40X type, which now is available for Train Simulator service!<br><br>With four axles and a high-horsepower rating, the GP40X was ideally suited to fast duties such as priority intermodal service although, like all EMD \u201cGeeps,\u201d it was versatile and could be employed in virtually any duty. Dressed in Union Pacific\u2019s classic yellow and gray livery, the GP40Xs served the UP from 1978 through 2001 when the last members of the GP40X class were retired. For a small group of locomotives, the GP40Xs on Union Pacific certainly operated with a variety of road numbers through the years, as the units originally carried 9000-series numerals, then 90-series, then 950-series, and finally a couple of the units wore UP 5500-series road numbers.<br><br>Created for Train Simulator by third party programme partner Travel by Train, the Union Pacific GP40X features realistic operating characteristics, cab, controls, and details, including the ability to assign a full selection of authentic road numbers. The Union Pacific GP40X DLC includes a pair of scenarios for the Train Simulator Sherman Hill route (route available separately) and can also be authentically put to work in scenarios on a variety of other popular U.
