Do not imitate any combat or crafting depicted in the project or consider any information as actual knowledge.\r\n\r\nNo information present in the project is inspired or gathered from actual classified military documents or files. \r\n\r\nBeing a physics-based Virtual Reality project, this experience can cause motion sickness in inexperienced users.\r\nThis game can display flashing lights and colors that can induce photosensitive epilepsy or extreme dizziness.\r\n\r\nSome audiences might experience altered perception of reality and time, existential crisis, illusions, derealization, or disorientation when playing for long sessions. These are completely natural and harmless reactions, some reasons for these include the scaling of the character inside of the virtual environment, optical illusions, the dissonance between the movement of the character inside of the virtual environment and the user in real life, etc. \r\nBe aware of your surroundings and avoid trespassing the safe bounds of your play area while using Virtual Reality, take breaks often to hydrate and keep the VR headset and devices clean.\r\n\r\nThis game also offers online multiplayer games and chat, betting and in-game purchases.
