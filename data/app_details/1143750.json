{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">VRocker is a movement app that enables you to enjoy your VR games with more lifelike player movement. With VRocker you \u2018walk\u2019 or \u2018run\u2019 in games by moving your body without the need for any external gadgets.

VRocker runs parallel to other SteamVR games and overrides in-game joystick/pad \u2018smooth locomotion\u2019.

You can fine-tune the movement \u2018feel\u2019 for your liking or you can choose one from the pre-defined options. You can also save user-defined presets for each game.
