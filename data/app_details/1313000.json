{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Grand Theft\u2026 Horse</h2><br>Rustler is an open-world, top-down action game paying tribute to the good old GTA 2 style and gameplay, fusing it with a historically inaccurate medieval setting. Play as Guy, whose parents apparently were too lazy to give him a proper name. Experience feudal injustice, witch-hunting, and join big tournaments. Meet valiant, yet incredibly stupid knights. Complete a wide variety of twisted missions and quests, or don\u2019t give a damn about the plot and bring mayhem in the villages and cities. Choose to go on foot, or by a stolen horse. Fight with a sword or pick a fancy automatic crossbow.
