However, you can expand and embellish your library from level to level. Extensions and upgrades give you more and more opportunities to realize your very own style.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Set up and decorate</strong></h2>A library needs furnishings. Build bookshelves, cozy reading corners and decorate according to your own taste. Turn your own library into a cozy place that people enjoy visiting and spending time in. From level to level, you have more space and more options to furnish everything to your liking.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Extensive and far-reaching stories of the NPCs</strong></h2>The people who live on Lyria have their own stories. Each NPC has a deep background story to explore. Be it their personal fate, goals for the future, inner conflicts or even funny quirks, the closer you get to know the people, the more you will find out about them. Many stories are closely linked to the island of Lyria and open up new quests for you to take on.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Atmospheric and immersive world</strong></h2>The world of Lyria is full of life. The natural beauty of the island creates a friendly and cozy atmosphere that is a pleasure to live in. Nature and magic also play an important role in everyday life. Experience dynamically changing day and night times, changing seasons and a dynamic weather system that lets you dive deep into the world of Lyria. New, undiscovered locations entice you to explore and unlock new areas of the game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3025620/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735622708","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3025620/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1735622708","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3025620/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735622708","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3025620/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735622708","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h1>Got feedback?
