{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">So there we were, minding our own business in the forest. It was kinda idyllic, you know? Peace, happiness, harmony with nature, and OH YEAH, it was extra awesome because, get this, MY MOM IS A WITCH?! Well, I guess TECHnically she is, but she\u2019s more like a Harry Potter witch than a creepy Witch Hazel type, \u2018cause bless her heart, she always uses her powers for good. Anyway, she\u2019s the best, but this is also exactly when things went wrong.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/539400/extras/story2.png?t=1731484522\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">See, all of a sudden the king's guards show up, all stuffy and businesslike, and they say they\u2019re taking my mom to the castle, and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it.

Grab enemy weapons when they drop them or discover hidden treasure stashes. The game has over 130 items and weapons with different unique effects. Here are some of the items you can find:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/539400/extras/items.png?t=1731484522\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Many items and weapons have synergies. Examples:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Drinking a Gold Diet potion allows you to eat gold, but if you find an Appetite potion as well it will boost the effect and enable you to restore a lot of health. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Voodoo Dolls allow you to hurt enemies from a distance, but if you combine it with a high-damage item like a Meteor Staff or a Bomb it can be devastating. The Celestial Smasher hammer does 200 damage per hit. If the enemy is standing over the voodoo doll he's marked with, you can do 400 damage in one hit. For some comparison, the first level boss has 700 HP. This means you could kill it in two hits if you time your attacks properly.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/539400/extras/stats.png?t=1731484522\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There's a status effect that boosts your stats when you have more gold. If you couple this with a Portable Foundry (turn any item into gold) and Avarice (multiply collected gold), you can become very powerful in a short amount of time.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There's a magic potion that increases your stomping damage. Couple that with a Horse pet that triples your stomp damage, and you can kill most enemies in one stomp. Now you just need a weapon that knocks them down. There are a couple of hammers with knockdown attack, or you can use the Violent Sword that has a dashing attack that knocks many enemies down and gives you full rage after every kill. So, you can sweep the enemies, stomp at least one of them to get a kill and thus full rage for another dash. Rinse and repeat until the room is clear.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Weapons also have synergies. For example, you can combine the Enchanter's Warbreaker hammer with the Snake Staff. Use the staff to poison all the enemies and once their health is low, kill them all with the Warbreaker and get many mana points. Mana can be used for more spells, creating potions, bombs and gold.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Another example, you can use the Rogue Sword and the Turret Staff for winning without much fighting. You can create an automated turret in the middle of the room and then use the rogue sword special ability to hide and just watch enemies getting decimated by the turret(s). With a couple of useful pets it can become a pacifist run: a bull (allows you to use the rogue sword in every battle without having to fight to build up rage) and a lizard (gain additional mana point after every battle) would allow you to only have to fight once in two battles.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Heroes with good archery skills can combine different bows and arrows, for example:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/539400/extras/arrows.png?t=1731484522\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Hitting an enemy with an ice arrow would freeze it for a while, but after that passes, he will also be slow and much easier to fight against. Saving special arrows for bosses and difficult enemies is a good strategy.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Pets</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/539400/extras/witch-pets.png?t=1731484522\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Adopt one of 42 different pet companions. Each has a different effect. The Penguin freezes enemies. The Ram knocks them down. The Bat attacks in the air. The Chicken shows you the path with least enemies. The Dog fetches hard to reach items and weapons. The Turtle acts as an unbeatable decoy and the Bird's feathers improve your archery skill. If you find a Wolf to lead the pack and keep them in order, you can adopt multiple pets at the same time.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Always more to explore</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game has permadeath. Once you die, you start a new game. A different world is created on each playthrough. The layout of the levels is different, there are different numbers and types of enemies; and different treasures and items sold in shops. There are many spells the characters can use, and archers have a wide assortment of special types of bows and arrows at their disposal. Because of this, each new game poses a new challenge. You will get a subset of weapons, items and enemies and might need to use a different strategy. Any two subsequent plays could be quite different.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Various ways to complete levels</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There's a big boss at the end of each level. You can beat him up with a melee weapon, petrify him with Medusa Arrows, or use a magic scroll to simply skip the battle and run to the next level. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If you don't have enough money to buy weapons from shops, you can loot it if you can beat the shop's guard. Or you can just steal things and use a bomb or an Escape scroll to run off.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Enemies drop usable items and weapons often which you can then use against them. For example, the Necromancer drops a staff that allows you to raise undead as your servants. This includes raising some of the undead bosses as your allies. If you defeat the king, you can take his scepter, allowing you to summon an army of armored guards to help you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Monsters and bosses</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/539400/extras/witch-0177-level7.png?t=1731484522\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The final game plays over eight areas: forest, battlements, the keep, dungeon, catacombs, desert, hell and the frozen mountain. Each area has three or more specific bosses that randomly show up on different play-throughs.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each area also has a different set of enemies, separated into the following factions:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Goblins</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> King's Guards</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Thieves</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Undead (skeletons, zombies, vampires)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Ice Mountain Clan</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Desert Mercenaries</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Demons</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Animals (wild boars and dragons you can ride, bugs that drop weapon upgrades, bats, hornets, etc.)</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each faction has regular units and special ones that are bigger and harder to beat.

For example, the Necromancer drops a staff that allows you to raise undead as your servants. This includes raising some of the undead bosses as your allies. If you defeat the king, you can take his scepter, allowing you to summon an army of armored guards to help you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Monsters and bosses</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/539400/extras/witch-0177-level7.png?t=1731484522\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The final game plays over eight areas: forest, battlements, the keep, dungeon, catacombs, desert, hell and the frozen mountain.
