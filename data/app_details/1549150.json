Whatever path they take, at the end of the adventure they could find themselves with the use of a complex that contains doorways into other planes of existence, allowing for endless adventures in the future. This adventure is designed for four to five characters of 5th or 6th level, but can be adjusted to work with groups of various sizes. It can easily be dropped into any campaign world.
