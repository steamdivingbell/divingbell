{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Game Overview:</strong></h2> &quot;Chronicles of Virtue&quot; is a tactical RPG where players navigate through a world that has just been introduced to magic, assembling a customizable team with diverse abilities, equipment, and roles. The story follows the player's quest to learn why magic has been introduced to the world and their journey to master it. The player will explore how the introduction of magic to the world has shaped the region, both physically and politically as the power balance has been interrupted by this new force.  The quest includes retrieving lost relics, recruiting allies, and mastering the elemental system as your enemies attempt to do the same. The game targets fans of tactical RPGs of all ages.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><br>Gameplay Mechanics:</strong></h2><br><strong>Combat: </strong>Players engage in turn-based combat using various weapons and magic types. Weapons include swords, axes, staves, bows, and more, each with distinct roles like high DPS, healing, or crowd control. Magic covers eight elements with defined strengths and weaknesses. Characters can wield two weapons at a time, each providing unique spells, allowing for a wide variety of strategic builds. <br><strong>Elemental Map:</strong> Magic is pulled from the environment. As you use spells, that element is depleted in the environment, making other elements stronger and that element weaker.  The player will learn how to use this elemental map strategically to their advantage, to either weaken their opponents or strengthen their favorite spells. <br><strong>Combat Movement: </strong>Players move on a grid-based battlefield, with movement influenced by terrain, obstacles, and height advantages. Special abilities, such as jumping or traversing difficult terrain, add strategic depth.<br><strong>Progression:</strong> Players manage several individual (but connected) level and progression systems, including experience based leveling, element-based spell exploration/research, titles which provide bonuses after collection, and individual spell and ability leveling. <br><strong>World exploration:</strong> Players travel between different areas and have an opportunity to explore many diverse environments.   <br><br>The game emphasizes strategic combat, team/character customization, and a rich narrative.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3223960?t=1736228246","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3223960?t=1736228246","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3223960/aaa304f8a42825c042039d2c468191a4ec640b96/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736228246","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3223960/aaa304f8a42825c042039d2c468191a4ec640b96/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736228246","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Captions available","id":13}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Game Overview:</strong></h2> &quot;Chronicles of Virtue&quot; is a tactical RPG where players navigate through a world that has just been introduced to magic, assembling a customizable team with diverse abilities, equipment, and roles.
