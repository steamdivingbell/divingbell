{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is a retro-style Chinese open-world RPG game set in a cultivation-themed universe, where your only advantages against powerful enemies are time and the wit of a time-traveler. In this world of cultivation, you can take on the role of a protagonist whom you customize, freely developing your abilities, skills, and beast taming. You choose your companions and sect, venture through various secret realms, encounter a myriad of strange and wondrous adventures, complete tasks for different cultivators, and reach the pinnacle of cultivation realms, ultimately changing the impending fate of the cultivation world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In addition to improving your cultivation through combat, you can also grow stronger with the support of various lifestyle gameplay elements.
