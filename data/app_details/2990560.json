While there are tension-building sequences meant to be unnerving, the game does not depict excessive graphic violence or gore.\r\n\r\nThe storyline explores mature subject matter, including supernatural occurrences and disturbing situations. However, it does not contain any explicit sexual content. There are references to alcohol and drug use in certain contexts.\r\n\r\nPotentially unsettling topics such as death, mental instability, and psychological trauma are present, but they are portrayed respectfully without gratuitous detail. There may be some jump scares and creepy imagery/environments.\r\n\r\nOverall, the game maintains a suspenseful and eerie tone rather than relying on shocking visceral content. However, parental guidance is still recommended for younger audiences due to the game's mature thematic elements and unsettling horror overtones throughout the experience."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Abnormal1999 Series</h2><br>Abnormal1999 is a series of independent games developed by QZQStudio, based on science fiction backgrounds such as quantum mechanics and multiverse, and integrates elements of exploration, horror, puzzle solving, and reasoning.<br>The protagonist is a girl named SU, and the story revolves around her and her family.
