{"about_the_game":"Moonlight and Madness!<br>The famed observatory at Asteria Point has long endured upon its mountain heights, yet wars, plagues, and the ravages of time have dimmed its glory to a faint ember kept by a tiny order of faithful monks. When sinister forces stalk the night and even those faithful few begin to disappear, the church sends out a call for heroes to investigate and save this remnant of a wiser and more learned age. Yet all is not as it seems among the high peaks, and secrets grow darker and danger ever deeper with the moon's every rising.<br><i>When Comes the Moon</i> is a <i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</i> adventure for 8th-level characters set in Yolbiac Vale, in the <i>Lost Lands Campaign Setting</i> . This rich and exciting world 20 years in the making has been home to dozens of adventures from Necromancer Games and Frog God Games and produced with their cooperation to be compatible with <i>The World of the Lost Lands</i> campaign guide! It is the second of six adventures in the <i>Aegis of Empires Adventure Path</i> , with each adventure exploring hitherto unexplored areas of the Lost Lands with a combination of horror, intrigue, deadly danger, and the lure of ancient mysteries.<br>While designed for use with the Lost Lands, these adventures are loosely connected rather than following a strictly controlled plotline, enabling you to easily place them into any campaign world. Your heroes can explore at their own pace to discover the secrets of antiquity or be consumed in their seeking as they brave the dark paths of the <i>Aegis of Empires</i> .
