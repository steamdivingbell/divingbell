{"about_the_game":"Combining an atmospheric, psychological thriller narrative with paranormal psychic abilities, stealthy exploration and intense shooter action, Second Sight brings a new dimension to stealth action games, giving players control of a character endowed with incredible psychic abilities. The game offers multiple approaches to completing levels either via stealth, dramatic gunplay, psychic powers or a combination of all three. The ability to psychically influence characters and remotely manipulate objects and individuals provides for a totally fresh gameplay dynamic. <br><br>Second Sight opens with John Vattic, the player-controlled lead character, as he awakens from a coma in a US medical facility where he has been subjected to traumatic surgery and experimentation.
