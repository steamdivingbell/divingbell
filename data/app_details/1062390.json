{"about_the_game":"An original satisfying puzzle game with lots of strategies to discover once you get over the initial small learning hump and mind bendingness.  We're not kidding on lots of strategies involved.  There are a lot of things going through your head when you play it and its exactly what an action/twitch/reflex puzzle game should be.

You need 3 of the same colored triangles facing up and forming a triangle or 3 of the same colored triangles facing down and forming a triangle.  I know this explanation does not fully explain, so check the pictures and youtube.  It is okay to not get it the first few runs and be frustrated, that feeling passes and fun rushes in if you stick with it for a few minutes.<br><br>Here is an example of a Tri being solved:<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1062390/extras/promo.png?t=1558119579\" /><br><br>There is a blue up falling into two blue ups on the right and left.
