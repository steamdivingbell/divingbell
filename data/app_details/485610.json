The player in this game is free to play as they want. Control one player on the virtual field.  Kick the ball high or low, hard or lightly, curve, lob, jump, dribble and perform tricks. Create or find your team and join tournaments. Discover a multiplayer soccer game played by over 1 million players.   </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Soccer Online: Ball 3D is an immersive computer game where you have 100% control over the angle of your kicks. Every awesome goal you score depends only on your skills, but be careful as every mistake you make is also only your fault. The physics is powered by the professional physics engine, which ensures realistic ball behavior like in the real-life soccer. Because this is a physics-driven game, you need to use the geometry of the in-game objects and the physical forces (including gravity) to control them.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Shooting and passing is as easy as clicking one button. Third person camera makes the gameplay very dynamic and unique among soccer video games (some call them football games). It's the first time you can play football like this, very unique and rich experience in the electronic gaming world. At last a game that lets you perform pixel perfect moves and put the ball where you want. It is uniquely satisfying to see how the goal net moves after you score or how the whole goal moves after you hit the goalpost. Open yourself to an atmospheric, magic reality, gain access to a new world where your unreal fantasy of becoming a soccer player will come true. Every competitive gamer will enjoy this.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Not many aaa games offer what you will find in Ball 3D, one of the best Steam games. If you are looking for almost free Steam games, this game may be the best choice.\u00a0This game is a true marvel for soccer fans, offering unmatched realism and endless  fun.  </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Welcome new players!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">After you enter the game, a short tutorial awaits you. It will teach you how to move, jump, shoot, curve and sprint (dash). New players need just 3 minutes on average to learn the basics of the game. You might feel lost and strange when you start your journey in Ball 3D, but the tutorial will help you understand what the game is about. Feel free to train your aim and other moves in the tutorial for as long as you want, you can also come back to it later. It is recommended to finish the tutorial before going online, but don't worry it is short and simple. It will help you massively to improve during the humble beginnings of your career. Your skill will rise quickly after finishing it, you will be far better, so it is worth your time. Tutorial is like a sandbox that lets you play and practice your moves and tricks. After some training you may aim with the precision of a sniper. If you are not sure how to play the game, all your doubts will be gone after finishing the tutorial. Return to it as often as you need. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Bots are ready to play</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If you would like to practice the moves you just learned,  next step in your education may be playing versus bots (AI). You can choose from 4 difficulty levels and decide if you would like to train being the striker or the goalkeeper. Ball 3D is mainly not a singleplayer offline PvE game, but you may decide that it is too early to play with real people and prefer to try the game solo in a calm environment before going online. Once you play a few games with bots, you will feel more confident. Say &quot;hello&quot; to the bots, they never answer a single word, but they always listen...</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When you are new, bots may be challenging. If you will lose against them, there is no need to be sad and cry, you can play with them as many times as you want! Focus, keep trying and you will eventually deal with this steep challenge after a couple games and make incremental progress. They will help you to unleash your hidden potential. Or maybe you think the bots are too easy for your? Don't underrate them! </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Soccer Online</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Explore the world of online soccer! Playing vs bots is so fun, but this is a multi-player esport game. It's time to go online in the cross-platform multiplayer mode and play with other humans over the internet (or local network). We support new players a lot. During the first 14 days you have a beginner status. It lets you play on the special rooms marked as beginners. You can use this time to familiarize yourself with the game by playing with players at your level. If you feel you are too good to play on the rooms for beginners, you can always join the normal rooms available for all players. After 14 days you will turn into an expert and you will be able to play on the 3rd kind of rooms, available only for the experts. Thanks to all this you can always play soccer online with the players at your level. On the expert rooms you will stumble upon highly skilled players (with over 1k hours in the game!), watch them carefully as you can learn a lot from them. Exciting and addictive Co-Op/PvP gameplay is the strongest element of this independent game.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiplayer</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Speaking of rooms. You can play on dedicated rooms or you can join rooms hosted by other players. You can also create your own room. The game offers very advanced and optimized network code, including client side prediction anti-lag system and great dedicated servers in various regions that offer low ping. Ball 3D is one of the most dynamic coop soccer games, yet the network code is able to handle this in a very smooth way making the online multiplayer experience very enjoyable. If you like multiplayer or mmo games you will love it. Try it yourself. On dedicated rooms the decisions are made by voting. Press F1 if you agree or F2 if you disagree. Remember to use sprint to increase your speed and outrun your opponents.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Teams</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Sooner or later you will meet some nice people in the world of Ball 3D, use the chat to get to know them better. You may build a team (clan, guild) with them. Choose a name/tag (FC The Best, AS Best Players, EAS-Vampires, Foot Monsters (FM), Greatest Among Many (GAM) or any other you can imagine) and create it in the user panel, then invite your friends to join the party and become a real team coach/manager. Remember to create some nice-looking shirts for your new club. When you do so, you will be ready to compete in global leagues, cups and tournaments. Your players can dress in these shirts for the match. Wouldn't it be nice to join the elite and win the Ball 3D World Cup Grand Final? Write your own myth, be on top and become a living legend, the undisputed best Ball 3D player on the planet earth (the Greatest Of All Time - GOAT). From zero to hero, fulfill your American dream! It is your destiny to be the best! To achieve this you will need a skillful squad and some effective strategy that will crush the other teams. But remember that the result of the match is unknown till the last whistle, so never idle during the game!   </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You are in the driver\u2019s seat, steering your team to victory. Your duty as the manager will be to form a team (hopefully a dream team). The total number of people in your team is up to you, you can invite 1 friend or 5 friends, 6, 7, 10. Not enough? How about 20, 24, 26 or even more. Your choice is important. You will need players in your team that will play on goalkeeper, defense and attack. Players can switch during the game. Cooperation is the secret formula and the key to success. Your galactic team may try to play positional attacks or it may defend the goal like a tank, lock the penalty area, turn it into a fortress and try counter attacks. Parking a bus in the goal is a sensible tactic too, don't be ashamed to use it, it's ok. Picking the best tactic for your team is like solving a puzzle, you need to be creative and use your head and logic to fit the pieces. It is your role to decide if you want to play with one striker or with two, with three defenders or with four. You may try accurate short passes in tight spaces and technical shots or full power flat strikes from the middle of the field. You may also try individual dribbling, but it is risky, use it at your own risk. Play the first half with one tactic and the second with another. You can easily go from defensive to offensive and vice versa. Some play styles are more dangerous than others. You never know which tactics will be your best bet. Everything is up to you, this is your empire. Your team is like a kingdom and you are the king. Stealing tactics from your opponents is not theft, all methods and tricks are good to win!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Man of the match</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Every move you make during the match is recorded in the form of statistics. Based on these statistics a ranking of players is formed. By the end of the match, the name of the best player will be featured and shown on the board as the man (woman) of the match. Do your best to put your name there (by playing well and scoring points) and become popular! It tastes really wonderful to reach the apex and become the hero of the match.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Replays</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can record all your matches and watch them later. Replays will help you craft your soccer skills into an art. Watching and analyzing matches will greatly accelerate your skill growth rate. You can watch the matches from various cameras, including: TV, Action, Top Down, Follow Player and several others. Remember to record replays and save your &quot;wow&quot; goals so you can watch them later and show them to your friends.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Soccer variations</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This indie game contains many different stadiums and modes. If normal soccer is not enough for you, you can try modes like: Darts, Ping Pong and others. Ball 3D is a super fun and deep co-operative game not similar to any other.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">More than soccer</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Ball 3D is not only soccer, but also other sports for you to enjoy on-line together with your friends. You will be surprised when you will see the other sports: Basketball, Handball, Ice Hockey, Racing, Battle Royale and more. Each of them has their own stadiums and unique rules.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Battle Royale takes place on a circular arena with no escape. Survival is the key to the win in this combat, there can be only one survivor in this clash. Carefully overwatch the entire battlefield and avoid your opponents at all cost or turn into a hunter and hunt your enemies. Fight and beat them (by jumping and falling on them with the force of thunder, it is not a shooter, you don't have guns and bullets, there is no crosshair, the only weapon you have is you). At the same time you need to dodge the ball that is chasing you, just like in dodgeball. In Battle Royale you win only when all your rivals are &quot;dead&quot; (no one is left on the battleground except you). Use your reflex to win this epic war.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The racing mode is like a kart racer, but with discs (the same you control while playing other sports). They can drift and are very fast. During the race you use your mouse and keyboard as a controller.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Soccer Online: Ball 3D is a multi-sport simulation game available on laptop/desktop PC (Windows), Mac/Macbook (MacOS) and Steam Deck (Linux). Absolutely unique soccer sim action game for casual, hardcore and pro players, where not only your realtime reaction skills matter, but also tactics. It mix arcade gameplay with strategy. Randomly clicking the keys like in some clicker games will not give you much, you need to think about your next moves like in chess and then execute them (often in a split second) using your skills. Ball 3D is a fascinating fast-paced, easy to play, hard to master e-sport game with unique mechanics. Great to play in 2024, 2025 and even in   2026. Play daily from monday to friday and on the weekend, all week! It may be a light, relaxing and cozy experience or a harsh and intense one. Unlike many RPG games where you level up your character, here your quest is to improve yourself and write your own story. Here you grind your own skill.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You don't need to be a soccer fan to enjoy Ball 3D! No matter if you prefer golf, tennis, pool, baseball, cricket, volleyball or any other olympic sport, you will still like Ball 3D. Especially that your favorite sport may be sooner or latter added to the game.

It can be played by players of all age, kids and adults, boys and girls. No matter if you are 18, 25 or 50 years old, this game is for you.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Other features</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game also offers Steam Trading Cards and Achievements among many other features not mentioned here. One of the achievements requires you to send some love to other players by sending them a heart. You can buy and sell in-game items for a very cheap price on the Steam Market (cheapest are for less than 0.99  dollars). Get free items (loot inside the boxes) for playing the game (you don't need to pay any money for them, just play and the items will drop as a thank you for your effort) and then put them on sale or go to the market and look for some best-sellers for yourself. You can also gift the items to your friends. Also remember to visit the shop, where you can find paid items and some attractive discounted bundles that offer great value (halloween bundles, christmas bundle, valentine bundle and others).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Ball 3D you have a lot of settings, if your computer is bad, you can tweak the graphics and other settings to get more fps. From the screen resolution, vsync and fov to the quality of the grass. When you change settings in the menu, you will hear chill music from an excellent soundtrack (we hope you enjoy these rhythms). The game is optimized very well and it will work on all computers including low spec hardware. The size of the game is optimized too and it only requires much less than 1 GB of storage.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">But that's not all!

The list of possible celebrations is much longer, if staying on the ground after a goal is not enough, you can go into the air like a bird and enjoy a plane flight celebration. If this is still not enough, then you can celebrate the goal by turning into a gang of farming farmers, cops or drive a police car. And if you are bored, you may ask the other players to create a tower (just jump on each other). How cool and funny is that? When you finish celebrating, you can watch your goal again thanks to the auto-replays.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can use stylized visual shot effects like: shadow, ghost, black trail, white shuriken, fire ball, mystic beam, dying star, glossy sparks, red devil from hell, rainbow cubes, ancient artifact and countless others. They do not affect the gameplay or the power of the shot, but they look really nice and you may always disable them if you want.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can show some emotions to other players by using special emotion items, the list of them is long. Here are some: cute cat, pumpkin smile, jaw, mummy, wolf, angel, crazy kiss, laugh, XD, lol, omg (oh my god), rage, shock, bat and many others.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can use badges to stand out.

Many of them you will get just by playing, the rest is available in the shop.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Soccer Online: Ball 3D is great for streams, if you are a streamer try to play it with your viewers.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Updates</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">It is noteworthy that the game has been already updated over 250 times.

You may try accurate short passes in tight spaces and technical shots or full power flat strikes from the middle of the field. You may also try individual dribbling, but it is risky, use it at your own risk. Play the first half with one tactic and the second with another. You can easily go from defensive to offensive and vice versa. Some play styles are more dangerous than others. You never know which tactics will be your best bet. Everything is up to you, this is your empire. Your team is like a kingdom and you are the king. Stealing tactics from your opponents is not theft, all methods and tricks are good to win!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Man of the match</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Every move you make during the match is recorded in the form of statistics. Based on these statistics a ranking of players is formed. By the end of the match, the name of the best player will be featured and shown on the board as the man (woman) of the match. Do your best to put your name there (by playing well and scoring points) and become popular! It tastes really wonderful to reach the apex and become the hero of the match.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Replays</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can record all your matches and watch them later. Replays will help you craft your soccer skills into an art. Watching and analyzing matches will greatly accelerate your skill growth rate. You can watch the matches from various cameras, including: TV, Action, Top Down, Follow Player and several others. Remember to record replays and save your &quot;wow&quot; goals so you can watch them later and show them to your friends.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Soccer variations</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This indie game contains many different stadiums and modes. If normal soccer is not enough for you, you can try modes like: Darts, Ping Pong and others. Ball 3D is a super fun and deep co-operative game not similar to any other.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">More than soccer</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Ball 3D is not only soccer, but also other sports for you to enjoy on-line together with your friends. You will be surprised when you will see the other sports: Basketball, Handball, Ice Hockey, Racing, Battle Royale and more. Each of them has their own stadiums and unique rules.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Battle Royale takes place on a circular arena with no escape. Survival is the key to the win in this combat, there can be only one survivor in this clash. Carefully overwatch the entire battlefield and avoid your opponents at all cost or turn into a hunter and hunt your enemies. Fight and beat them (by jumping and falling on them with the force of thunder, it is not a shooter, you don't have guns and bullets, there is no crosshair, the only weapon you have is you). At the same time you need to dodge the ball that is chasing you, just like in dodgeball. In Battle Royale you win only when all your rivals are &quot;dead&quot; (no one is left on the battleground except you). Use your reflex to win this epic war.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The racing mode is like a kart racer, but with discs (the same you control while playing other sports). They can drift and are very fast. During the race you use your mouse and keyboard as a controller.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Soccer Online: Ball 3D is a multi-sport simulation game available on laptop/desktop PC (Windows), Mac/Macbook (MacOS) and Steam Deck (Linux). Absolutely unique soccer sim action game for casual, hardcore and pro players, where not only your realtime reaction skills matter, but also tactics. It mix arcade gameplay with strategy. Randomly clicking the keys like in some clicker games will not give you much, you need to think about your next moves like in chess and then execute them (often in a split second) using your skills. Ball 3D is a fascinating fast-paced, easy to play, hard to master e-sport game with unique mechanics. Great to play in 2024, 2025 and even in   2026.

Here you grind your own skill.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You don't need to be a soccer fan to enjoy Ball 3D! No matter if you prefer golf, tennis, pool, baseball, cricket, volleyball or any other olympic sport, you will still like Ball 3D.

You can also gift the items to your friends. Also remember to visit the shop, where you can find paid items and some attractive discounted bundles that offer great value (halloween bundles, christmas bundle, valentine bundle and others).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Ball 3D you have a lot of settings, if your computer is bad, you can tweak the graphics and other settings to get more fps. From the screen resolution, vsync and fov to the quality of the grass. When you change settings in the menu, you will hear chill music from an excellent soundtrack (we hope you enjoy these rhythms). The game is optimized very well and it will work on all computers including low spec hardware. The size of the game is optimized too and it only requires much less than 1 GB of storage.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">But that's not all! After you score a goal, you can turn yourself into a rocket, horse, dinosaur, fish, alien, pirate, hat guy, iron knight, spider, ufo, werwolf, zombie, evil slime, angry log and many other scary but cartoony monsters, plants and wild animals you may know from horror and sci-fi movies, cartoons or from the zoo. The list of possible celebrations is much longer, if staying on the ground after a goal is not enough, you can go into the air like a bird and enjoy a plane flight celebration. If this is still not enough, then you can celebrate the goal by turning into a gang of farming farmers, cops or drive a police car. And if you are bored, you may ask the other players to create a tower (just jump on each other). How cool and funny is that? When you finish celebrating, you can watch your goal again thanks to the auto-replays.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can use stylized visual shot effects like: shadow, ghost, black trail, white shuriken, fire ball, mystic beam, dying star, glossy sparks, red devil from hell, rainbow cubes, ancient artifact and countless others. They do not affect the gameplay or the power of the shot, but they look really nice and you may always disable them if you want.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can show some emotions to other players by using special emotion items, the list of them is long. Here are some: cute cat, pumpkin smile, jaw, mummy, wolf, angel, crazy kiss, laugh, XD, lol, omg (oh my god), rage, shock, bat and many others.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can use badges to stand out. Here are some you can use: wizard, dog, cave, storm, rocks, candy, portal, toxic river, toxic bubbles, loops, dwarf, moon surface, dragon, underground, warrior, hand, elf, heat map, spooky and countless others.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If that's not enough for you, you can make your avatar look better by wearing items like: golden chain, witch hat or shaman hat.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The list of items in the game is very long. Many of them you will get just by playing, the rest is available in the shop.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Soccer Online: Ball 3D is great for streams, if you are a streamer try to play it with your viewers.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Updates</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">It is noteworthy that the game has been already updated over 250 times.
