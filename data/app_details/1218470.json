Each team has its own strengths and weaknesses, you'll not only have to master your abilities, but also learn how to work as a team in order to endure and emerge victorious.<br><br>The overall gameplay in Lightphobe blends match-based shooters and zombie shooter games in a classic point capture mode setting; where both teams must race to capture an objective point. With only one team being able to capture the objective at any given time, Lightphobe is full of chaotic fun as both teams fight to establish their dominance!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1218470/extras/gif-2.gif?t=1730060081\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1218470/extras/image-2.png?t=1730060081\" /><br>The last thing a soldier wants is to be stuck in the dark with lightphobes sitting on their tail! A soldier must protect the target from the oncoming hordes of monsters. This means knowing when it's best to reload, getting a good feel for weaknesses that enemies can exploit, and moving strategically to best protect themselves and the target.<br><br>Soldiers can choose from 5 weapon options for different play styles.

How they go about this is up to them to decide. They could fight head-on and overwhelm the Soldiers with an unrelenting assault, or they could instead opt for a stealth approach and use the blindspots of the Soldiers to sneak around unseen.<br><br>However, that's not all! Lightphobes also possess a natural invincibility in the dark, and must be exposed by a special light source before they can be killed.
