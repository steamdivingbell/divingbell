The initial specification was drawn up by Brush at Loughborough and built at Crewe Works in 1986. Unfortunately, the fate of the type was essentially sealed in the same year, when BR changed their specification requirements after Brush had committed to building the locomotive.<br><br>The new loco rolled off the production line and was dubbed the BR Class 89, boasting 6 traction motors which would power it up to 125mph in service.<br><br>Passenger service on the ECML was rather brief, it was used on London \u2013 Leeds services for only about 3 years before a serious failure occurred, and the locomotive fell by the wayside. It was rescued by some Brush employees, and appeared at some events across the country, but the future looked bleak.<br><br>But then came privatisation, BR and its sectors had been replaced by rail franchises, and the newly formed GNER franchise purchased the sole Class 89 for its own use following a motive power shortage.
