{"about_the_game":"You have levels to beat. You have body to control. Animations aren't just visual, but 100% physics based, so they define how you move through the environment.  Combine animations and poses to move your robot through levels full of obstacles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Genre</h2>The goal is to finish obstacle courses in time, win medals, unlock new content.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Controls</h2>Controls are inspired by controls of real humanoid robot. You\u2019ll switch between full body animations which are assigned to the buttons. Servos in your robot are trying to follow these animations, but they have to deal with gravity, mass and other static or dynamic objects.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Robot Dog</h2>You can also play as a RobotDog in later levels<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Upgrades</h2>You can add and upgrade many functions of your robot. For example you can upgrade  servos, gyro, hands and attach new components to the robot, so it can do new things.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2>Cybermotion has no storyline. However key background is University of Cybernetics where <br>are few students working together in team, trying to finish their final assignment and get degree in cybernetics. They choose to build and program robot that can move like a human in complex dynamic environment. Their Professor of Cybernetics (who is also Professor of PE) is testing their work the hard way and gives them nothing for free. Except for some spare wires and scrap parts...","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Diamond medal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/623380/725028dd40fb1af33c445846f28629a8b59d29e0.jpg"},{"name":"Win 10 gold medals","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/623380/b4635cea3770d38663a2504ae56afef7528737e6.jpg"},{"name":"Win 20 gold medals","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/623380/b0a04adc55c7664cd3edc6b16be8f2be235681ff.jpg"},{"name":"Win 30 gold medals","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/623380/9c472cdd21c0842e8340632602ea499127346f91.jpg"},{"name":"Win 40 gold medals","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/623380/4d4a4f3afa82ab83434990a414ae0d7c080acacd.jpg"},{"name":"Win 50 gold medals","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/623380/658cfb9642a078b0551e8bee08b51ecd3d52c5c7.jpg"},{"name":"Secret Achievement","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/623380/87249a703e9baf034a7bec6e6d33176a66e5c561.jpg"},{"name":"Secret Achievement","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/623380/496e6ffc4b4c3505bef72a13bd1392b66b3ad9a0.jpg"},{"name":"Secret Achievement","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/623380/87249a703e9baf034a7bec6e6d33176a66e5c561.jpg"},{"name":"Secret Achievement","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/623380/87249a703e9baf034a7bec6e6d33176a66e5c561.jpg"}],"total":12},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/623380?t=1707030009","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/623380/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1707030009","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/623380/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1707030009","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/623380/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1707030009","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2739090,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"You have levels to beat.
