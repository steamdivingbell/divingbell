{"about_the_game":"Gather your group of up to 40 warriors and embark on an adventure in this innovative real-time strategy game, where your characters follow a chain of command for their movement (if their superiors move, they do as well). Travel through a unique country (procedurally generated) filled with challenges, while raiding cities and facing guards who will try to stop you. Trade with the nomadic merchant and distribute your items among your team as you best see fit. With every victory, you can add up to 2 of your defeated foes as new members to your gang, increasing your power and allowing you to take on the king and seize control of the area. But be careful: guards are not your only obstacle, so you'll need to develop a good strategy to emerge victorious.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a tricky, simple and rewarding game, where you can either take your time or take it as a speedrun challenge (having your best scores saved based on different criteria). You can manage your team in a pure rational mindset, or you can care about them and protecting your favorite ones. The choice is yours.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Open for business","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1848990/51a552f1a3419fbf63315b43527eaf74ccb44325.jpg"},{"name":"Victory","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1848990/261e26ce65ab5334266f4a48717783e7876e34f7.jpg"},{"name":"Time master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1848990/d260a094f362747fefcde316cc8d3817bb5dbccb.jpg"},{"name":"Wealth master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1848990/ca9f310123dfae9a659f0c16ed343a20417d5a2a.jpg"},{"name":"Visiting master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1848990/ed34adbbce7c19686cfcd27ca28aba70bc7f3351.jpg"},{"name":"Perfectionist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1848990/fb42c9924f9908ca40863c29113c13dffe340da8.jpg"}],"total":6},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1848990/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1683804892","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1848990/page.bg.jpg?t=1683804892","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1848990/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1683804892","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1848990/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1683804892","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Gather your group of up to 40 warriors and embark on an adventure in this innovative real-time strategy game, where your characters follow a chain of command for their movement (if their superiors move, they do as well).
