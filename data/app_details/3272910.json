{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Captain, your vessel has crash-landed on a barren planet! Life support is failing, your only choice is to dig deep and unearth the resources needed to refuel, repair, and re-launch! Send expeditions deep below the planet's surface, but beware of hazards and pitfalls. When your crew perishes, you will need to make the difficult decision to wake the passengers in a bid for survival. Every life pod's hiss is a death sentence for the poor soul within, but inaction will certainly doom us all.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game combines classic mining mechanics with a linear story, meaningful choices, and a clear goal.
