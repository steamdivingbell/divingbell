{"about_the_game":"<strong>Bornholm in the year 2155 is everything Bornholm of today is not.</strong><br><br>Over-populated, industrial and most of all a global power thanks to its unique and innovative non-equatorial space elevator.<br><br>For Born Punk, we didn't try to copy/paste quintessential cyberpunk tropes for our interpretation of the genre. Rather, we took cyberpunk out of its traditional home - cities styled after modern metropolises like Shanghai and Tokyo - and transplanted it onto a Danish island - with all the influences that would likely play a part in the transformatino of a quaint European region into a futuristic mega-sprawl.<br><br>Our 44-page long artbook will show you a lot of our thought processes whilst creating the visual part of Born Punk. You'll find commentary by the developers, Discord conversations, a lot of lore, and of course - art. Concept art, pixel art, time lapses, sprite sheets, portraits and more await you - all presented in a narrative thread that should make it a joy to read. This is not just some concept art from the very beginning of the game thrown into a random PDF. Rather, it's a detailed documentation of our journey, a showcase of our universe, and an insight into the culture at our company.<br><br><strong>Please note:</strong> the artbook will be downloaded directly to your game folder.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2057800/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1656027985","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2057800/page.bg.jpg?t=1656027985","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2057800/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1656027985","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2057800/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1656027985","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Bornholm in the year 2155 is everything Bornholm of today is not.</strong><br><br>Over-populated, industrial and most of all a global power thanks to its unique and innovative non-equatorial space elevator.<br><br>For Born Punk, we didn't try to copy/paste quintessential cyberpunk tropes for our interpretation of the genre.
