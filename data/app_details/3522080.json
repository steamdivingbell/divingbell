{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This DEMO contains Level 1 and Level 3 in their entirety and 3 minutes of Level 5!<br> The Leaderboards and Achievements are not active in this DEMO.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>SHAPELAND</strong> is an easy to play, hard to win SINGLE-PLAYER FIRST PERSON SHOOTER.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You have one weapon, no power ups.  <br>There is no blood or gore, no re-loading, no maintenance, no overt lore, no trade/currency, no crafting, no inventory, no long treks, no grind! <br>Just competition for the Fastest Times and Highest Scores! <br>Something is happening every second in this small OPEN WORLD environment. You are dodging and avoiding enemy shapes while shooting at targets, chasing pick-ups and opening portals and walls. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">MAXIMUM FUN! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You have the ability to walk, sprint, dash, and jump in a low gravity landscape. Learn to take advantage of certain shapes and items to 'fly' thru the level. There are also BOATS that travel on water and sometimes, air. <br>There are 7 levels and a bonus level in this beautiful, addictively RE-PLAYABLE shooter. Fun!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The entire game world is in a 'glass' box divided into quadrants by walls. You open PORTALS and lower WALLS to access new areas and change the landscape to reveal new treasures and portals.   Eventually you find a way to the TOP of the game, <strong>outside the box</strong>, to WIN! <br>ENEMIES and HAZARDS are everywhere and must be avoided. Watch out for the Hunter shapes that come after you! Fun! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Players either try to run thru the world for the FASTEST TIME or use STRATEGY and stealth to get the HIGHEST SCORE and the most TROPHIES. You may also choose to just CHILL, find a safe place and watch the sunset. Fun</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There is a day/night cycle, and some Targets only appear at certain times. Other Targets appear randomly, and some Targets are worth more if they are in a certain place when you shoot them. (for example: Not over water).    <br>As some enemy shapes roam around the playfield, they destroy valuable Pick-ups in their path. So, you need to get to those early if playing for high score.\u00a0   <br>Many Trophies/Achievements are available on more than one level: learn the easiest levels to get them. Fun! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Solving the few puzzles in the game can add substantially to your score but are not necessary to get to the end.    <br>There are TWO ENDINGS for the game, and you can choose either one. The first available ending is for speed players, trying to get the FASTEST TIME. The final ending is for players going for the HIGHEST SCORE.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">  You must SURVIVE while searching for the keys (Eggs) to open the portals and lower the walls. Fun! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If you come in contact with an ENEMY or HAZARDS like DEEP WATER, the round is over and you are transported to <strong>THE ROOM</strong>, where you can see your SCORE and FINAL TIME,  the TROPHIES you've collected and any BONUS AWARDS you have earned.\u00a0 Then you can try it all over again! <br> <br>Mostly it's just a whole lotta FUN!!</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3522080/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1739554243","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3522080/page.bg.jpg?t=1739554243","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3522080/0de9cefb73d1b6619cb803d96cf9c3575ba03696/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739554243","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3522080/0de9cefb73d1b6619cb803d96cf9c3575ba03696/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739554243","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This DEMO contains Level 1 and Level 3 in their entirety and 3 minutes of Level 5!<br> The Leaderboards and Achievements are not active in this DEMO.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>SHAPELAND</strong> is an easy to play, hard to win SINGLE-PLAYER FIRST PERSON SHOOTER.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You have one weapon, no power ups.  <br>There is no blood or gore, no re-loading, no maintenance, no overt lore, no trade/currency, no crafting, no inventory, no long treks, no grind! <br>Just competition for the Fastest Times and Highest Scores! <br>Something is happening every second in this small OPEN WORLD environment.
