{"about_the_game":"Take arms and launch toward the various lands of Riostea! Bonds of Unity is a fast-paced first-person shooter where synergy between different kinds of weapons is needed to take down various-sized enemies. Comes with a challenging single-player experience with brutal enemies, bizarre weapons, and fast movements to provide an intense first-person shooter experience that requires both quick reflexes and continuous shooting. Whether you explore the various lands of Riostea or go straight for a head-to-head fight against bosses, you will constantly unlock weapons and equipment for various actions, such as dealing damage, crowd control, movement enhancement, or buffing other weapons. You can also create your very own gun to use in-game and share it with other players using the weapon creation tool!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGAMEPLAY:<br />\r\nAn all-out shooting experience with no stopping or taking cover. Defeating enemies is the only way to recover health, encouraging an offensive gameplay. The synergy between the guns in your loadout is necessary, as straight-up shooting an enemy might not be viable or effective; you might need to stun enemies, lure them to a trap you've set up, charge a weapon for massive burst damage, or even use the environment's different hazards for your advantage. Think of it as Doom 2016, but with less gore and more spontaneous strategies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSTORY: Riostea, a distant and unusual planet, is made of countless floating islands. No two islands are alike; they all have distinct environments and inhabitants. Utopia, an infamous island on Riostea, is known for its most wanted quirk: blessing its inhabitants with peace. but after centuries of its existence, Utopia has been cut to pieces by greedy leaders of various other islands who want to live upon it all by themselves. Each has taken a piece and fused it with their own island. With no one else having the necessary fighting skills to take down these leaders and reunite Utopia in one piece, this leaves you as Utopia's last and only hope.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2346900/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1682671949","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2346900/page.bg.jpg?t=1682671949","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2346900/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1682671949","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2346900/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1682671949","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Cartoonish violence, contains victims or corpses that show the path to the perpetrator."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Take arms and launch toward the various lands of Riostea!
