The game will feature a full length campaign, a competitive battle mode, and an educational mode for parents and teachers to practice spelling with their children. The core of the game is inspired by 1920's newspaper printing factories, but will take players on a wide journey through a larger world that includes trains, skyscrapers, zeppelins, and hover cars. LetterBound is the perfect mix for those who love playing word games with loved ones on their couch. Whether you're a word maestro or just trying to improve your vocabulary, LetterBound will surely bring a smile to your face!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1386640/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1596600483","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1386640/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1596600483","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1386640/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1596600483","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1386640/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1596600483","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"LetterBound is a cooperative spelling adventure that can be played locally with up to four friends.
