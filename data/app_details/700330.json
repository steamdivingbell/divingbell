These objects, or SCPs, range from mundane-looking items with extraordinary effects, to horrific abominations capable of bypassing the most impenetrable containment methods the Foundation puts in place.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/700330/extras/SL-Banner-3.gif?t=1739746525\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Throughout the game, you will witness the perspective of the 5 different human classes, each trying desperately to survive.

The site is prepared for these breaches, containing numerous emergency measures \u2014 from Tesla Gates able to electrocute anything caught in the blast, to emergency bulkheads able to temporarily hold back threats from a fleeing target, or even the on-site nuclear warhead capable of vaporising the entire underground section of the site.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/700330/extras/SL-Banner-5.gif?t=1739746525\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Despite all the security precautions and safety measures, <strong>Site-02 is not impenetrable</strong>.
