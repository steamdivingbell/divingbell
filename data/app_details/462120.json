{"about_the_game":"Deep Space, 4099AR<br><br>Fill the shoes of the last known Rustwalker, an age old robotic bounty hunter. After an unknown enemy performs the largest prison break in history releasing bounties all across the galaxy, it's your job to travel to each planet to find, stop and capture them all. Explore regions of different planets to acquire resources vital to restore your home, Guild Ship Beta. Working as a hub and your home, this station will be a base of operations from which you'll take jobs, upgrade your gear and use fuel earned from jobs to unlock new areas of the hub. Once planet-side, it'll be up to you to how you take down your foes. Will you sneak in and get your bounty stealthily, or will you go in a flurry of hot steel and gunpowder to take down your target? Bounty hunting is a dangerous job, but so are you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Deadly Combat</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/462120/extras/punching_gif.gif?t=1694204702\" /><br>Use a mixture of melee weapons, ranged firearms and your metal fists to bring down some the ugliest bounties in the galaxy, <strong>dead or alive</strong>.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore the Galaxy</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/462120/extras/Explore.gif?t=1694204702\" /><br>Brave hazardous locations looking for bounties, resources and loot.
