The player is initially presented with a hidden pixel art. The game is played by marking all tiles under which a mine is hidden with a flag(Right Click) and freeing up all tiles that do not have a mine underneath. If a tile containing a mine is revealed instead of being marked with a flag, the player loses the game. The digit displayed in tiles indicate the number of mines adjacent.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Journey Begins!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1945560/aeb7efada38ad1d7ac47e1791e859ce0970fb186.jpg"},{"name":"Frontiersman","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1945560/3e82dff996df6ef788629ba1fe5f23a72c291e6b.jpg"},{"name":"Origins Onearthed","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1945560/13d245a4b997c6bf73fa7b1691426e30eaee705e.jpg"},{"name":"Triumph of Culture","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1945560/44ebea81b9634dbb67d5e151f0d2aa3a750f0330.jpg"},{"name":"Ancient Wonders","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1945560/23355ed76872db82b0168e8f2edc8bbc7faa3e16.jpg"},{"name":"Vast Unknowns","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1945560/aa2f61774419469e1732e833809a236b4a24e97d.jpg"},{"name":"Around the World in Eighty Days","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1945560/a7c12032d71c700a31934fbd71329dd8d797c8ad.jpg"},{"name":"New World Symphonies!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1945560/343db29adecf0bf726283bd06c3a27fd81d2f26f.jpg"},{"name":"First Stroke of Genius!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1945560/3ad9c93f7830a1ead9800ccdc611fd8897ef5711.jpg"},{"name":"Three-thal!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1945560/a48c90c51b6ebc324cf8fe2973b002453ba96d97.jpg"}],"total":16},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1945560/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1717027919","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1945560/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1717027919","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1945560/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1717027919","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1945560/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1717027919","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Enjoy WoM Classic on App Store!</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1945560/extras/wom_mobile.png?t=1717027919\" /></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1945560/extras/Steam_Top_Banner_Translations_010.png?t=1717027919\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1945560/extras/Scroll.gif?t=1717027919\" /><br>Join the growing pixel mines art community in Steam Workshop.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong></h2>The objective of the game is to clear each pixel art of hidden \u201cmines\u201d or bombs without detonation, albeit with help from clues stating the number of neighboring mines for each tile.
