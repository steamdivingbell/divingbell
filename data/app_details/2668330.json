Gnome gods build shrines and cast prayers to maximize the devotion they can spend on their particular flavour of chaos.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2668330/extras/small_gnod.gif?t=1718653392\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Lizards</h2>The lizards are a tricky bunch... Drivers racing for these gods need to be on their toes to anticipate surprise traps and wily tricks. An industrious tribe, lizard gods place pressure plates and scouts to automate the activation of their traps. They also have an affinity for generally messing with the drivers, taking away agency through smokescreens and tricks like reversing the cars controls.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2668330/extras/Floating_Lort.gif?t=1718653392\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Plants</h2>This tribe of sentient plants comprised primarily of mushroom men is terribly misunderstood. One of the most benevolent pantheons in RaceTrap, they devote their energy into cultivation. Gods of this tribe tend to cultivate a fruitful harvest of cards from their deck. Unfortunately, despite their best intentions of beautifying the track, the items they grow tend to harm the drivers more than help.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2668330/extras/mushroombaby2.gif?t=1718653392\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Insects</h2>The insect tribe is one of the most sinister tribes in the land. Drivers unfortunate enough to race against the insect gods should prepare for a harrowing experience. The gods of this tribe like to play with their food. They tend to pin the cars in place with webs, honey or worst of all, giant overwhelming swarms. <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2668330/extras/height_200_moth_god.png?t=1718653392\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gain XP to unlock new cards, items and skins</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">All New Multiplayer Expansion Featuring:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Up to 4 Trappers<br></li><li> Up to 8 Racers<br></li><li> Teams or FFA<br></li><li> Host Public or Private Lobbies<br></li><li> Set your Round Time &amp; Laps<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Coming soon...</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> More GameModes (Role Switching each round / multiple drivers / multiple gods etc.)<br></li><li> Ranked Matchmaking<br></li><li> Designer VR support<br></li><li> More Tribes </li></ul></li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2668330/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1718653392","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2668330/page.bg.jpg?t=1718653392","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2668330/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718653392","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2668330/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718653392","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2668330/extras/Steam_About.gif?t=1718653392\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Welcome to The World of RaceTrap</h2><br>Experience an entire world devoted to the brutal art of racing!
