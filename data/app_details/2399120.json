{"about_the_game":"The protagonist is a cleaner commissioned by a community support center to clean up a trash house in a certain town. There is a rule that garbage must be separated, and when valuables are picked up, they must be sold to second-hand dealers at the highest price possible for the sake of the landlord.<br />\r\nIn this town, there are sloppy landlords who trash one house after another and show you their TVs, but if you stay there for any length of time without permission, you are trespassing. Cleaning up garbage without permission is also trespassing. You may also be sued for illegal dumping if you dump garbage in someone else's yard. You may also be charged with embezzlement if you steal money from valuables in the trash that you sold to a vendor.<br />\r\nThe police who show up in town, the crows that come by the garbage, the amusing conversations with the townspeople, the bugs that are much fewer than in the previous film (Drink Milk Directly), life in jail, and scratch cards to decorate Matsuyori-san's house with many treasures!<br />\r\nGarbage is divided into burnable, non-burnable, bulky, and recyclable garbage, especially recyclable garbage, etc. Leftover food and drink garbage must be eaten or drunk by you, because crows will come to you if you put out food scraps,<br />\r\nSmall trash can go directly into your inventory.<br />\r\nIf the inventory is overflowing, the walking speed becomes slow, and garbage that can be drunk can cause stomach problems or, on the contrary, become an energy drink.<br />\r\nEach piece of trash can be held in both hands, so you can play P0AP?
