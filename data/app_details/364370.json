The government announces their plans deal with monstrous infected by means of nuclear weapons. The plan: to bomb the area and eradicate everything. Lucky enough, there's a fallout shelter in the player's front yard - and enough food and water to last. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow other survivors want in. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPREMISE <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main story begins once the hero has collected enough supplies to last himself in the shelter. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen other survivors show up, the player can decide who to bring into the shelter and who to leave outside.
