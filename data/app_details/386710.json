{"about_the_game":"Join our human adventurer on an adventure! Is this adventurer even a hero? Is he even actually an adventurer? Who cares? Not the Crafting Goddess Joann, apparently!

They have value now? <br>You sure bet! <br><br>You'll have to delve deep into your hard drive's dungeons to create the list of items the goddess has bestowed upon you to create. All the dungeons are randomly generated from the files that you select on your hard drive, with bigger files creating bigger dungeons, and different file types designating different kinds of loot you can find. Items, craftables, and monsters all have generated names with randomly selected adjectives attached.

Things are explained within dialog, tooltips, and in-game manuals.  It is expected that players will at some point in time need to read the manuals to understand more complex mechanics so they may unlock new parts of the game.  Still, it is an easily accessible and expansive experience, but it may not be the most welcoming to players new to the rogue genre.  Within minutes you can already be collecting tons of loot, exploring your hard drive, and of course dying.  The game features practically no story, but many ways to play, and its crafting experience is no more than a glorified fetch quest.  There's plenty to sink time into, and its accessibility emphasizes an ability to play quickly, such as during a coffee break.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/386710/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1666841487","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/386710/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1666841487","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/386710/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1666841487","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/386710/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1666841487","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Join our human adventurer on an adventure!
