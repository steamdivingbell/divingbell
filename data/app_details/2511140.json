{"about_the_game":"Kitchen Confidence<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHave you ever started a restaurant? It\u2019s immensely exciting, fun, hectic, and unbelievably expensive. We want to bring that experience to everyone.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKitchen Confidence is a restaurant management game, with a pinch of humour. The player will get to manage different kinds of kitchens, and to open the restaurant of their dreams. The game aims to give an accurate view of running a real kitchen (restaurants, banquets, food trucks). A management game, which is hectic and fun at the same time. Planning things in advance means a lot, and the player is given the opportunity to create their own solutions, with encouragement toward recycling and reducing food waste. With a story providing continuity, and a world with busy weekends, changing seasons, health inspectors, food critics, sick leaves, surprise dining groups, and everything else to expect in the restaurant business!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2511140/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1690807214","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2511140/page.bg.jpg?t=1690807214","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2511140/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1690807214","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2511140/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1690807214","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Kitchen Confidence<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHave you ever started a restaurant?
