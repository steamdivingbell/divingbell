{"about_the_game":"Troubled Passage is a Roguelike ARPG with a very peculiar combat system based on mouse swipes. This system allows for some interesting combat encounters that feel more engaging and rewarding. The mouse is an extension of your sword. <br><br>You are set to travel across five regions and reach an old port. There you will take a ship that will take you far away. That's all you know for now. But beware, these lands are filled with undead creatures, traps and other nasty travelers. You should always be careful, even if you decide to share the road with a companion.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Character Creation</h2>Choose your character appearance and select a trade. Trades are like character classes that defines with which types of weapons and types of damage your character is proficient with, gaining a buff when using that type of weapon.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combat</h2>Attacks are performed by swiping your mouse in a certain direction (up, down left or right). These swipes will trigger the combat skill that you have assigned to that direction. <br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1796660/extras/ezgif.com-gif-maker__12_.gif?t=1670802691\" /><br><br>There are multiple skills to learn throughout the game for each type of combat:<br><br>Unarmed<br>Onehanded<br>Twohanded (skills are missing at this point of development)<br>Bow (skills are missing at this point of development)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Loot</h2>Troubled Passage loot system is built on the idea that &quot;if they have it, you can have it&quot;. No longer will you get disappointed if a heavy-armored-cool-looking enemy only dropped a knife and an apple. You want that armor! Well, good news! In Troubled Passage, enemies will drop exactly what they are wearing (stats included). You can strip your enemies of everything and claim it for yourself. This means strong enemies equals strong loot.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Companions</h2>From time to time, you will encounter recruitable companions that can help you in your quest. They may be expensive, but they are a great help in dealing with enemies. All companions are randomly generated, and so are their motives.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Rivalries</h2>Companions react to your attitude towards them. If they get mad at you, they can become your rivals and appear later on to seek revenge as a mini-boss battle.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Traders</h2>Visit traders to buy and sell items. Blacksmiths will even allow you to forge your own weapon from a list of components and manage the weapon stats.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1796660/extras/ezgif.com-gif-maker__13_.gif?t=1670802691\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Random Levels</h2>To ensure that each playthrough feels different, levels are randomly generated.
