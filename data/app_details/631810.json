{"about_the_game":"The Galactic Gallery is an aesthetically driven experience exploring intersections between traditional art and the emerging meta mediums of virtual and augmented reality.  It is an art gallery featuring 10 world renowned artists with holographic effects on over 20 unique art pieces only possible in virtual reality. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTraditional mediums are reimagined with effects only possible in a virtual reality and new methods of creating and interacting with art are explored. Paintings and sculpture by these artists are given special treatment to be more engaging in the Virtual environment with custom shaders and bespoke animation \u2013 layers extrapolated to give some paintings depth while others have subtle effects that are only possible in the digital realm. The sound design is specifically tailored for the SUBPAC physical audio device for an immersive experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe artists featured the gallery are Android Jones, Mars-1, Chris Dyer, Mugwort, Mear One, Xavi, Raul Casillas, Luke Brown, Amanda Sage, and Hans Haveron. The artwork was curated in part by Archival Ink Gallery.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/631810/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1516139773","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/631810/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1516139773","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/631810/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1516139773","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/631810/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1516139773","categories":[{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Galactic Gallery is an aesthetically driven experience exploring intersections between traditional art and the emerging meta mediums of virtual and augmented reality.
