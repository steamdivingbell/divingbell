{"about_the_game":"Space Raiders in Space is a wave defense roguelike based around 5 orders: Attack, Defend, Cower, Search, and Build.

With over a dozen defensives, there are many build strategies to explore.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Manage your crew</h2> - Your crew is armed with enthusiasm and a bunch of weapons (assuming you have been looting), but not much intelligence. Issue commands to individuals or the group as a whole, then hope they know how to follow instructions. It's up to you to tell them when to search, what to build, how to fight, and more.
