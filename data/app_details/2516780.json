{"about_the_game":"Crowned Control is a game about a group of knights, lured into an old dungeon by tales of legend. According to the stories, there's a legendary crown in there that grants ghostly powers to the one wearing it!<br />\r\nOf course, every knight wants that crown for themself! Acquiring it will require teamwork, however.  They'll need to work together to get the crown off of the current wearer's head, and onto their own!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur knights are armed with their trusty sword, shining armor and whatever artifacts (or rubbish) they can scavenge from within the dungeon. Hit each other with swords, spill oil to slow the others down or taste some exquisite cuisine in the fine peppers of the underground, to give yourself a speed boost.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther than legendary artifacts, this dungeon also houses a myriad of traps. Our knights can choose to expertly avoid these, or cunningly use them against the one wearing the crown (or their friends, of course).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the end of the day, all that matters is who gets to wear the crown the longest, so employ whatever tactics you need to make sure that person is you!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is made by 5 students from Howest - Digital Arts &amp; Entertainment in the 2nd year of their bachelor in a period of 11 weeks.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2516780/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714418394","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2516780/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1714418394","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2516780/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714418394","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2516780/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714418394","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Crowned Control is a game about a group of knights, lured into an old dungeon by tales of legend.
