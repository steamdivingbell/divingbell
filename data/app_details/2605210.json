By capturing images of a subject from various angles and then analyzing them with specialized software, photogrammetry constructs a mesh of polygons that closely mimics the object's surface. The original textures are then mapped onto this 3D mesh, delivering a digital model that boasts an unparalleled level of detail and realism.\r\n- Computed Tomography (CT) scans offer another avenue for creating detailed 3D models, particularly useful for intricate objects like ship models. Unlike traditional X-rays that provide a 2D view, a CT scan rotates around the object, capturing multiple images from different angles. These images are then processed by software to create cross-sectional slices of the object, which are stacked to form a comprehensive 3D model. The result is an incredibly accurate representation, capturing even the inner complexities that are often missed by other scanning methods.\r\n\r\nUnreal Engine 5 Technology\r\n\r\n- Nanite is Unreal Engine 5's virtualized geometry system which uses a new internal mesh format and rendering technology to render pixel scale detail and high object counts. It intelligently does work on only the detail that can be perceived and no more.\r\nIt offers multiple orders of magnitude increase in geometry complexity, higher triangle, and object counts than have been possible before in real-time\r\nThe Photogrammetry and CT Scan museum assets used in this experience were imported without loss of quality, at the staggering resolutions of 50 to 90 million polygon assets.\r\n- Lumen is Unreal Engine 5's fully dynamic global illumination and reflections system that is designed for next-generation consoles and the latest PCs. Lumen Global Illumination solves indirect lighting. For example, light bouncing off a surface picks up the color of that surface and reflects the colored light onto other nearby surfaces in large, detailed environments at scales ranging from millimeters to kilometers.</p><br><h1>Project Team</h1><p>Aimed at defining what a historical artifact exhibit would be like in Virtual Reality, this special\r\nproject was created by Priam Gvord Studio and the Art Gallery of\r\nOntario (Toronto, Canada), working in cooperation.\r\n- Priam Givord, Project Director &amp; Conceptor - VR Interactive Designer, Priam Givord Studio inc.\r\n- Gillian McIntyre, Project Lead - Interpretive Planner, Art Gallery of Ontario\r\n- Adam Harris Levine - Associate Curator, European Art, Art Gallery of Ontario \r\n- Sherry Phillips - Conservator, contemporary art and ship models (retired) research and content development\r\n- Matthew Scott - Media Producer, Art Gallery of Ontario\r\n- Simon Stephens - Curator of Ship Model and Boat Collections, National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, London.\r\n- Hans Biorn-Lian - Digital Programming and Partnerships Lead, National Maritime Museum\r\n- Catherine Thomson - Manager, Digital Projects, Art Gallery of Ontario\r\n- Sean Guadron - Lead Developer at letscreatesomethingamazing\r\n- Pyramid Attack &amp; Tyler Dillman - 3D Design\r\n- Karen Vanderborght - Interface Design, KRAK Fractured Media\r\n- Candice Dan, Art Collision - Project submission &amp; Synopsis</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>AGO BRISTOL 1775 is an advanced VR immersive application aiming to establish a high-quality standard in the field of Museum Virtual Reality exhibitions.
