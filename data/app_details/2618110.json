You will see a person with a horrified look, and blood and intestines flowing out their body. You will see a person being attacked and ripped apart by Dracula the monster. You will see Dracula drink and slurp the blood from people. These depictions will be animated in a Cartoon style, but can still be very disturbing. In one scene you will see a ghost figure throw themselves off a cliff."},"detailed_description":"In this gloomy and mystifying first-person 2.5D horror survival game, help Sherlock Holmes chase down the murderous Count Dracula, who haunts the city of Rome every night, in order to kill and devour.<br />\r\nYou wake up as Sherlock Holmes in a hospital in Rome.
