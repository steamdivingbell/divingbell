{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BACKSTORY</h2>You are a student journalist who decides to make a documentary about the abandoned \u00abNorth\u00bb cosmodrome, where in the 1990s a series of man-made disasters occurred that caused serious genetic changes in humans and animals, forming previously unknown mutations. Almost the entire population was evacuated, and an exclusion zone appeared on the territory of the cosmodrome along with the nearest settlements.<br><br>Two of your friends, who are well-versed in these places and know how to get to the abandoned spaceport, are going on an expedition with you. They drove ahead, and you followed them in your car. But halfway along the way, a snowstorm began and you did not notice how you turned the wrong way, strayed from other members of the expedition and got stuck in the middle of the forest in the exclusion zone.
