{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">[<strong>Note</strong>: <i>roomscale is temporarily disabled on the Steam version.

The portal back to civilization is down. Can you outwit security, restore the portal, and escape? You'll need to overcome dozens of puzzling challenges by crafting tools, remote controlling drones, rewiring circuits, climbing, playing Match-3 games, and even dancing! With five distinct levels expanding from a single small room to a cathedral-like boss level, Exit Condition One offers a unique and fully immersive experience.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game is built from the ground up for roomscale VR on the Quest. Unlike most &quot;roomscale&quot; games, if you have 2m x 3m of space, it will adapt the in-game area to your physical space, allowing full navigation by walking and climbing, no locomotion controls required. The game also supports all locomotion modes. With full physics integration, almost all objects are interactive, and your hands never &quot;ghost out.&quot; There are no jump scares.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With the launch, we've added collectibles, achievements, a match-3 based shooting mini-game and a leaderboard for that mini-game.</p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"On Your Way","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3390900/ded0c5065940576b0a04eb84487d0a85ebac46ac.jpg"},{"name":"Am I Dreaming","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3390900/103ed459f748c2f369c98de9c1315014c14cbd70.jpg"},{"name":"Up and About","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3390900/edf0a5671aefd3fac1fb9411cb7c91d8d38eb0c8.jpg"},{"name":"Make It Or Break It","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3390900/81631f02329d879996419762baf9c8d7a2dccd6c.jpg"},{"name":"Coffee Break","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3390900/e3383b215ec74f6609de2bf1e3bfa498687d9849.jpg"},{"name":"Fix Your Way Out","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3390900/21c8410f5b08ebcff0b4344865c7c2cf0ba583fc.jpg"},{"name":"You're The Boss","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3390900/946d3aef65ebd3e92d712573d77cdb3ec52d0eb5.jpg"},{"name":"Credit Where Credit is Due","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3390900/140b11653c1d72a5ed147e2caaca49ee12b09292.jpg"},{"name":"Tunnel Run Boss","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3390900/f0413048e63961ba6882318e15febfe78bde0ac1.jpg"},{"name":"Curated Collection","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3390900/8c8c1833b2a74e43fd53d46af8a3b5a7907a0ad5.jpg"}],"total":11},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3390900/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738352266","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3390900/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1738352266","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3390900/9cc92844ad2cbdd221cbe76f949ca31ec1bead98/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738352266","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3390900/9cc92844ad2cbdd221cbe76f949ca31ec1bead98/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738352266","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">[<strong>Note</strong>: <i>roomscale is temporarily disabled on the Steam version.
