You have full control over the <strong>Swipe Animation Time</strong>. In fact, we have also included a <strong>Time to Think</strong> option; when your board is not very full, your eyes will be darting back and forth like a kitty fixated on a laser pointer, and your animation speed will be very quick, however once your game board starts to fill up, the swipe speed automatically starts to slow down so you don\u2019t accidentally fill your board, run out of valid swipes and loose!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ADORABLE!</h2>All game art was made by our very talented artist.
