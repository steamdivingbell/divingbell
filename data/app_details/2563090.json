{"about_the_game":"<br>&quot;HUME INDEX&quot; is a shooting game that can be played solo or in cooperative multiplayer mode. Players take on the role of special agents with unique abilities and are sent to an abandoned cosmos where the Hume Index suddenly spikes to abnormal levels. Their mission is to eliminate mutants and investigate the cause. The longer players stay in the abandoned cosmos, the higher the Hume Index becomes, increasing the game's difficulty and random events. In battles, players need to utilize firearms, melee weapons, elemental reactions, and their special skills to fight their way through the abandoned cosmos and uncover the source of the disaster.<br><br><strong>Game features:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Elemental reactions- Firearms can be equipped with four different elemental effects, allowing players to use their imagination to freeze, ionize, or group enemies together before detonating them all at once.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2563090/extras/elemental_smallerVersionForSteam.gif?t=1713368165\" /><br></li><li>Diverse weaponry- Players can use weapons from traditional rifles and revolvers to modern weapons like explosive-rounds pistols, laser guns, and nail guns.
