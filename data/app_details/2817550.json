{"about_the_game":"Mika's Battle S is a 2D platform action game based on the story of a warrior who has been commanded to defend Sunshineland territory against the attacks from the enemy soldiers belonging to the Rogho Corporation.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2817550/extras/mbr_gif_5.gif?t=1724989629\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2817550/extras/store_page_story.png?t=1724989629\" /><br><br>Mika, one of the best warriors of the Sunshineland which is famously known as the land of sunflowers, has been commanded to defend the Eastern border area of the territory while other members of the group were taking care of the Northern and Western Sunshineland border areas. Rogho Corporation is one of the Evil organizations which toppled the previous Government of Rogholand. They took full control over the territory of Rogholand and its people. <br><br>Since the Rogho Corporation took over the territory there have been reports of border clashes frequently. After a few months of coming to power, they went a bit too far by declaring a war against Sunshineland. So, the Sunshineland warriors, a group of five formidable female super soldiers, have been commanded by the leader of Sunshineland Army to fight against the intruders and to protect the territory at any cost. Rogho Corporation deployed the formidable human as well as robot warriors around the border areas. Moreover, the enemies took a few civilians as hostages. They started launching multiple missiles towards the Sunshineland territory which had reportedly destroyed some of the agricultural fields, a few buildings, and a few sunflower gardens. There were no reports of military or civilian casualties. Most of the civilians of the Sunshineland were taken to the underground Bomb shelters temporarily for their protection.<br><br>You play as Mika, one of the strongest Sunshineland warriors and your mission is to protect the Eastern border area of your territory and defeat the enemy forces while rescuing the civilians.
