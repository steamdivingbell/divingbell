{"about_the_game":"The Bug Butcher is an action-packed 2D side scrolling shoot em up game where peril comes from above. <br><strong>So in a nutshell, pest control with machine guns in space. </strong><br>The core mechanics hold old ties from the classic arcade shooter \u201cSuper Pang\u201d where you shoot vertically, but with modern day twists. You are Harry, a brash and tenacious exterminator who has a knack for decimating bugs. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/393630/extras/TheBugButcher_Banner_IGN_quarterHD.png?t=1447377487\" /><br><br>Harry\u2019s current assignment takes him to the infested futuristic research facility on planet Zoit. The surviving and dwindling number of scientists employed him for his slaughtering skills. Harry\u2019s mission: survive until the decontamination of the building is complete, hoard coins like his life depended on it, and protect the scientists at all costs. Watch out for the spiders they have a particular fondness for rubber encased science/scientist. After landing, you will move from room to room through the facility blasting rockets, lasers, and wielding the power of lighting upwards at anything not human. <br>Ravenous swarms and ferocious waves of bugs of every size will attempt to kill you, but luckily there will be weapon and health pick-ups to aid Harry on his quest. Fierce reflexes are mandatory for survival, but Harry\u2019s brutal power-ups will let the guts fly and make the larva cry! If you love games with humor, perfect platforming, grotesquely cute art, nightmarish bosses, and real personality then The Bug Butcher will suit your fancy.<br><br>The demo offers 6 fully playable levels and you can upgrade all avaiable weapons and powerups.<br>We hope this gives you a good introduction into exterminating bugs.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/393630/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1447377487","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/393630/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1447377487","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/393630/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1447377487","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/393630/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1447377487","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"The Bug Butcher is an action-packed 2D side scrolling shoot em up game where peril comes from above. <br><strong>So in a nutshell, pest control with machine guns in space. </strong><br>The core mechanics hold old ties from the classic arcade shooter \u201cSuper Pang\u201d where you shoot vertically, but with modern day twists.
