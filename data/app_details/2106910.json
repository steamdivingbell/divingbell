{"about_the_game":"<strong>Gods of Defense</strong> is a Roguelike Tower Defense set on a procedurally generated map.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Every run is new</h2>The God stands at the center of the map on top of a Temple. Enemies spawned from the gates will attack the temple. You will build towers to kill the enemies. After every wave you will push the enemy gate farther into the unknown revealing more of the map.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Deck building</h2>Every few waves you will receive Boon cards from the Goddess of Fortune. These cards will give you new towers or extra perks that boost your defense.While you want to collect as many Boon cards, you want to avoid Curse cards. These are invoked by the Evil through the <strong>Corruption</strong> mechanic.<br><br>Some enemies carry corruption trails that infect the towers on the way. When <strong>Corruption</strong> exceeds certain limit, the evil will invoke Curses. You must learn to avoid corruption or to mitigate the consequences of Curse cards. This aspect brings a novel variation to a typical tower defense strategy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Roguelite Progression</h2>When enough enemies have breached the temple, it will fall. Whether you win or loose, you can keep the <strong>Faith</strong> you've earned during the run. You can use it to unlock new towers and boost their abilities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gate Bosses</h2>In each run you will face a number of bosses, once you have pushed the enemy gate far enough. As you reveal the <strong>Gate Boss</strong>, it will go berserk and spawn a torrent of enemies. Each gate comes with its unique challenge. You can choose to engage immediately or postpone it if your defense is not ready for it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Resource Management</h2>The gameplay also involves production and management of resources which aid your defense - Gold, Mana, Prayers, Matter. Each feeds into a different strategic device and opens up numerous possibilities. After you've mastered the art of defense, you will learn to build beautiful Monuments. This will exercise your resource management skills.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Variety</h2>There are 40 battles to play. Each battle happens on a new map every time you play it. You can replay each battle to earn extra rewards and win Trophies by completing challenges. At any point, you have multiple options to make progress. This eliminates the typical grinding.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Extra fun</h2>GoD also features two fun mini-games. A physics based mini-game lets you earn extra faith by using the surplus resources you collected during the run. A jigsaw puzzle that helps you compose the final vision.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Basics Behind","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2106910/0645806fdca4647513f800b88952499764cbb8e6.jpg"},{"name":"First Blood","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2106910/c42470b28e3cf3ca121f7f3b35861adf8b396109.jpg"},{"name":"One down Thirty Nine to go","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2106910/aba82411478258b7b9766091949c68d7631893df.jpg"},{"name":"Flexing Muscles","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2106910/e94a4a57706fd85dadbcdce0e5c02f28f35b70bf.jpg"},{"name":"Taste of Dirt","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2106910/fbf86d696be57fec1ef2ae2edda35e8b44603f70.jpg"},{"name":"Pain Pain Pain Gain","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2106910/7430a7869d85f4ddf3bd04354f0cab6ea62b61fa.jpg"},{"name":"Double Trouble","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2106910/aa69bc42b49375660279d46f164744de2bf79594.jpg"},{"name":"Third degree","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2106910/1f2341126f5d72c06303b2ec61f65547482a1046.jpg"},{"name":"Everyone from everywhere","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2106910/f84174780d74b517c29b0e5ae51ad66c3c1bfc85.jpg"},{"name":"Look Ma what I won","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2106910/d2b82ecba14b6e04602ebeaf9236447202827eaa.jpg"}],"total":40},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2106910/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726746562","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2106910/page.bg.jpg?t=1726746562","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2106910/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726746562","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2106910/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726746562","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Gods of Defense</strong> is a Roguelike Tower Defense set on a procedurally generated map.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Every run is new</h2>The God stands at the center of the map on top of a Temple.
