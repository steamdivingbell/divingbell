These are a central part of the narrative and contribute significantly to the tension and intensity of the story. Immerse yourself in a dark and terrifying world, enhanced by disturbing and eerie elements. The horror is intensified by violent scenarios and a menacing atmosphere. Mild nudity is used to underscore the authenticity of the characters and the intensity of the scenarios. The game briefly touches on the topic of suicide, but only as a minor aspect of the story and is handled with the utmost sensitivity.\r\n\r\nThis game is aimed at an adult audience that is willing to engage with challenging and often dark themes. It is ideal for players who are not deterred by intense and graphic depictions of violence and are looking for a deep narrative experience.\r\n\r\nDue to the explicit depiction of violence and other intense themes, we recommend this game for adults only. Players should be aware that it contains content that may be disturbing or emotionally distressing.\r\n\r\n"},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3010200/extras/Space_Logo.png?t=1718623224\" /><br><br>Space<br><br>is a short, atmospheric horror game where you explore eerie, abandoned structures adrift in the vastness of space.
