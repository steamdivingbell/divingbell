{"about_the_game":"SOF-Raiders is a First Person Shooter with Role Play elements to enhance game play. You start the game in the Tactical Operations Center where you select one of two available missions. Once the selection is made you head over to the armory and select two of six available weapons and load out frag and flash bang grenades as well as health packs. You then proceed to the helipad and mount the mission helicopter to get transported to the target area. After landing you access your data pad to get maps drone views and intel reports for your operation target. Fight your way to the target and complete your mission. The enemy will hunt you down so you need to escape to your exfiltration helicopter and return to the Operations Center and prepare for the next mission. Be aware, your choices will have consequences. There are eight missions to complete to get to the final battle.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1002670/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1550273859","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1002670/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1550273859","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1002670/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1550273859","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1002670/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1550273859","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"First Person Shooter, guns and violence"},"detailed_description":"SOF-Raiders is a First Person Shooter with Role Play elements to enhance game play.
