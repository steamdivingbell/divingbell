{"about_the_game":"<strong>Heal friendships, uncover mysteries, and prepare for impending doom</strong> in <i>The Last Days of Friendship Valley!</i> You play as the Patcher, a goat whose job is to settle arguments and keep communities together. Your new home plans on <strong>putting your conflict negotiation skills to the test:</strong> a deep schism lurks beneath the surface of Friendship Valley, and there are mere days before everything breaks apart. <strong>Make friends with the town's inhabitants, evolve your conversational approach, and try to mend the broken heart of Friendship Valley before it destroys the world.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build Your Conversation Deck</h2><i>The Last Days of Friendship Valley</i>'s unique <strong>card-based tactical Friendship Encounter system</strong> lets you decide EVERYTHING about your Patcher, from your conversational quirks, to your emotional strengths and weaknesses, to the ways you break when the strain becomes too much. Flexible or firm, steadfast or melancholy, patient or explosive; <strong>you decide who you become and how you interact with the world.</strong> When every character has full emotional interiority, a single wrong word can be the difference between success and disaster. <strong>Do you have what it takes to tackle the chaos of interpersonal communication?</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Uncover an Ancient Mystery</h2><strong>Not all is sunshine and rainbows in Friendship Valley;</strong> a mystery that stretches back to the dawn of time threatens to swallow the town. Uncover soul-powered machines, negotiate with fairies, and delve into <strong>deep emotional wounds</strong> in order to reach the truth. What does the floating obelisk in the middle of town really do? Why is there an abandoned building covered in magic sigils outside of town? <strong>Who is trying to destroy Friendship Valley, and why?</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Try to Save the World</h2><strong>You won't be able to do it alone. Fortunately, you have help.</strong> The friends you make along the way will be there to support you in big and small ways alike, from a fresh meal to a trek through the wilderness. Each Friendship Encounter you successfully resolve brings you closer to the goats involved: Friendship Valley is a mistrustful place, but <strong>with time and effort, it can become a home.</strong>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2815700/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1715632247","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2815700/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1715632247","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2815700/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1715632247","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2815700/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1715632247","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Heal friendships, uncover mysteries, and prepare for impending doom</strong> in <i>The Last Days of Friendship Valley!</i> You play as the Patcher, a goat whose job is to settle arguments and keep communities together.
