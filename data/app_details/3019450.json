In Almanach, your decisions are building the history of your world, one cycle at a time.    </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3019450/extras/Text_Titles_Ambitionsv3.png?t=1731694974\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3019450/extras/T_Pitchdeck_Card-Banner.png?t=1731694974\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There are no victory conditions in Almanach! Instead, you get to choose one or more Ambitions, which will be your medium to long term objectives. Ambitions can be competitive or cooperative, and fulfilling an Ambition does not necessarily mean the other players do not get to fulfil theirs. This ensures that no matter the size of your empire in the world hierarchy, you will always have interesting and challenging goals, all the way to the end of the world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3019450/extras/Text_Titles_Simultaneous_Combatv3.png?t=1731694974\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3019450/extras/unit-moves-800.gif?t=1731694974\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Almanach, every player gives their units orders simultaneously, but these orders are only resolved at the very end of the round.

If you want your empire to get good at something, you just need to do it. Want to build the greatest city in the world? Start by establishing your cities on  fertile soil and develop your agricultural knowledge. Want to train the sorcerer supreme? Cast some spells! Basically every action you can take in Almanach will lead your people to develop skills in one direction or another, so your progression will always follow your own choices.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3019450/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731694974","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3019450/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1731694974","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3019450/bbdefd8a45fb158c834e0c27b54d8f86d157862f/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731694974","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3019450/bbdefd8a45fb158c834e0c27b54d8f86d157862f/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731694974","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><u><strong>THIS GAME IS IN PRE-ALPHA.
