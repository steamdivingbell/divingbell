{"about_the_game":"Just outside the gates of Avalon, a 12 years war realizes its climax, the uneasy alliance of seven western kingdoms created the Citadel of Avalon as a mighty fortress. But in the last eight months, the Citadel has become a city of refugees, a city under siege. The Sha'ahoul, under the banner of the Shaman Warlord Mithras, are waging a genocidal war against the Citadel. Take on the role of the Hero in a richly detailed world filled with hundreds of unique NPC`s, monsters ripped from ancient lore, and invading nomadic hordes.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1558990/extras/Steam_pic_avalon_v6.png?t=1728493801\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> BUILD YOUR OWN CHARACTER </h2> Play as a fighter, scout, or mage, and choose from hundreds of pieces of weaponry and armor to customize your character's appearance and abilities.

The game received its portion of technical care and now runs on modern operating systems without any extra shenanigans. The story, visuals, and gameplay are untouched - with all its charm and flaws. Enjoy playing the game on Windows 7 or later, improved stability and widescreen support.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> OPEN-SOURCE </h2>For all the years since the original release, Siege of Avalon had an incredible community around it. Once developers made the game's source code available, many fans put their time and efforts to ensure the game lives. We also want to contribute to the open-source movement.

We want to thank each and every member of the community for their incredible support over the years.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Report to Avarous","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1558990/40ab0145fee7e6bab246421e029ae585e62ef46e.jpg"},{"name":"Sealed With A Kiss","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1558990/40ab0145fee7e6bab246421e029ae585e62ef46e.jpg"},{"name":"Fetch The Herbs","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1558990/40ab0145fee7e6bab246421e029ae585e62ef46e.jpg"},{"name":"What's In The Basement?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1558990/40ab0145fee7e6bab246421e029ae585e62ef46e.jpg"},{"name":"Brothers In Arms","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1558990/40ab0145fee7e6bab246421e029ae585e62ef46e.jpg"},{"name":"Cold Hard Steel","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1558990/40ab0145fee7e6bab246421e029ae585e62ef46e.jpg"},{"name":"Pell's Sorrow","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1558990/40ab0145fee7e6bab246421e029ae585e62ef46e.jpg"},{"name":"Case The Chest","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1558990/40ab0145fee7e6bab246421e029ae585e62ef46e.jpg"},{"name":"Fetch The Amulet","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1558990/40ab0145fee7e6bab246421e029ae585e62ef46e.jpg"},{"name":"Fetch The Chalice","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1558990/40ab0145fee7e6bab246421e029ae585e62ef46e.jpg"}],"total":39},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1558990/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728493801","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1558990/page.bg.jpg?t=1728493801","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1558990/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728493801","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1558990/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728493801","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages: General Mature Content"},"detailed_description":"Just outside the gates of Avalon, a 12 years war realizes its climax, the uneasy alliance of seven western kingdoms created the Citadel of Avalon as a mighty fortress.
