{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Why can\u2019t we learn physics in the same way we learn games?</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Explore the laws of physics like never before in Newton's Fourth Law, where each puzzle is a lesson and every level deepens your understanding of the universe. From projectile motion to quantum physics, Dive into hands-on challenges that bring physics equations to life, inspired by classics like Portal and The Stanley Parable. But who exactly are you and what are you doing in this facility? Who is the mysterious voice guiding and chastising you? \u00a0Learn the rules of our universe, then uncover the mystery that is breaking them.
