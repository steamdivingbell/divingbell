This game will reveal all the secrets of the seabed and show you the real life of a marine life from the beginning to the very end. Plunge into the beautiful and colorful underwater world with a wide variety of fish, learn all its secrets.<br>You start the game as a shark, which already keeps most of the marine inhabitants at bay, but you still have a long way to go to the ocean's most formidable monster. Therefore, try to eat only those fish that are weaker than you, otherwise you will lose. Be careful, some fish can swim very fast and you won't even have time to blink before they eat you!<br>Eat others, gain mass, be at the top of the food chain and show everyone who has the biggest jaws in the ocean. <i>Enjoy the game!</i><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2137600/extras/600.jpg?t=1665479058\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2137600/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1665479058","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2137600/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1665479058","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2137600/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1665479058","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2137600/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1665479058","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<i><strong>Huge Jaws</strong></i> - a game about a shark in the indie simulator genre, made in cute 3D graphics with nice music.<br>Many are interested in the question, what is life like at the bottom of the ocean?
