{"about_the_game":"A cruel wizard must be defeated in the the deep depths of the sea. Travel though an abandoned underwater city made of randomly generated rooms and floors you have to travel down. Each floor contains dangerous aquatic creatures that you and your trusty knife must get through by slashing enemies and grappling around to avoid their attacks. At the bottom of each biome a fearsome creature will block your way that you must defeat. Should you fail, you'll possess a new vessel to try and try again.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ROGUELIKE</h2>Explore procedurally generated dungeons full of hidden treasures, traps and puzzles. Made from hand-built rooms to ensure a fun playing experience and interesting discoveries.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">UPGRADES</h2>During your adventure through the Sunken Shadows, you will find many upgrades, some more rare than others. Each upgrade item gives you 3 choices of ability improvements, new abilities or new rules. Some will change how you approach the game entirely. And there are some upgrades that are really powerful, but come with a curse that you will need to work around to survive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">POTIONS &amp; ITEMS</h2>Find and buy consumable items like potions that will change the way your character or the enemies behave for a limited time. Use this advantage to get the upper hand in difficult encounters or boss fights. Want to have your crystals set enemies ablaze with magical fire? Slow down time to plan your actions strategically?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">VISUALS</h2>The graphic style is inspired by the PS1/ N64 era of games, so we use low poly are and pixel art textures. We combine them with modern effects like particles, shaders, dynamic lighting etc. to give the game a unique art style.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BIOMES</h2>Explore lots of varied biomes with different enemies, traps, secrets and bosses to find. You start in the ruined city, journey onwards to the coral reef and to the Leviathan depths. As you get deeper, the environment and enemies will get progressively more corrupted.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ENEMIES AND TRAPS</h2>Fight through hordes of enemies, each with their own strategies and weaknesses. Avoid tricky traps placed by the builders of the ruined ancient city you're exploring.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CHARACTERS</h2>By unlocking achievements, you gain access to new starting charaters. They come with different items and upgrades and offer a new way to experience the game and build synergies based on their starting gear.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DIFFICULTY MODIFIERS</h2>The game allows you to adjust the difficulty to your skill by offering you new challenges once you've mastered the basics. This comes with increased rewards, but lots of additional peril as well.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SHOPS</h2>Your friendly skeleton shop keeper mysteriously is always one step ahead of you, and willing do take your hard earned gold in exchange for upgrades, health containers or potions that change the behavior of your knife or crystals for a limited time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">UNLOCKABLE SKINS</h2>You can purchase visual customizations using the emeralds you find in chests or for completing hard challenges and puzzles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LEVEL EDITOR</h2>Create your own challenges and custom rooms using the included level editor. Send us your coolest builds and we might feature them in a future update!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DETAILS</h2>The game features a procedurally generated dungeon consisting of hand-built rooms and a level editor for making your own custom challenges.<br>The scope of the upcoming demo includes the first two biomes and bosses of the game. More will come in the full release.<br>More biomes, enemies and bosses are are being worked on, as well as more upgrades, shop items, secrets and mysterious puzzles.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2750120/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1719696896","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2750120/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1719696896","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2750120/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1719696896","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2750120/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1719696896","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Violence with retro-style blood effects, retro skeletons"},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"A cruel wizard must be defeated in the the deep depths of the sea.
