You wake up from a coma that has lasted for centuries, only to find that your once-grand estate is now in ruins. It's time to turn it into a prosperous hotel! It's no easy task, though, as times are tough and resources are scarce. There are shortages of food, supplies, and workforce. Being a blood-thirsty monster doesn't help with customer satisfaction either. Luckily, underneath the estate lies a crypt and a system of caves. By <strong>foraging, farming, crafting</strong>, and <strong>fighting your way through the monster-infested dungeons</strong>, you'll find the resources you need to <strong>restore greatness to your mansion</strong> and <strong>turn it into a thriving hotel business</strong>. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2055770/extras/Header1.png?t=1711207002\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2055770/extras/2.gif?t=1711207002\" /><br>Fix broken furniture, clean rooms, hang wallpaper, install appliances, and make your once-grand estate look presentable.

Or don't! You're a vampire, after all. Suck your guests' blood to regenerate your powers and use their meat to save money on food. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2055770/extras/Header4.png?t=1711207002\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2055770/extras/5.gif?t=1711207002\" /><br>Your guests expect high-quality room service. While ingredients are costly, you can farm, milk the undead cow, collect eggs from zombie chickens, and find wild mushrooms that grow around your hotel. Oh, and when it comes to meat, nobody has to know where it comes from. Follow recipes and prepare even the most extravagant dishes for your guests. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2055770/extras/Header5.png?t=1711207002\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2055770/extras/6.gif?t=1711207002\" /><br>Those dungeons below aren't going to explore themselves. Be careful when stepping into these corridors - you might need a good sword to defeat the monsters that hide in the darkness. Luckily, you can make your weapons from scratch. All you need is a blacksmith\u2019s workshop, a set of tools, and a handful of raw materials. Conveniently, they're located right underneath the hotel's lobby. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2055770/extras/Header6.png?t=1711207002\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2055770/extras/7.gif?t=1711207002\" /><br>Now that you're armed to the teeth with self-made weapons, you're ready to explore the dungeons. They hide many resources that you will need to unlock countless upgrades to your hotel. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2055770/extras/Header7.png?t=1711207002\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2055770/extras/8.gif?t=1711207002\" /><br>Once your hotel grows in size, you will be able to hire employees, your fellow vampires. You might need a cook, a housekeeper, a porter, a receptionist... Whatever task you want to delegate, you can find someone to do it for you. All it takes is good cashflow and a bit of blood to entice them.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2055770/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1711207002","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2055770/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1711207002","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2055770/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1711207002","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2055770/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1711207002","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: General Mature Content, Fantasy Violence"},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2055770/extras/1.gif?t=1711207002\" /><br><br>In Bloody Hell Hotel,<strong> you embody a vampire</strong>.
