{"about_the_game":"<strong>TSW Compatible content released for a previous Train Sim World\u00ae - features may remain unchanged from the original release and may not make use of all newer core features.</strong><br><br>Climb aboard the mighty diesel-hydraulic DB BR 218 and embark on passenger and freight duties from Hamburg and beyond. Explore in a new way with the first true go-anywhere, do-anything German mainline locomotive in Train Sim World\u00ae, courtesy of TSG.<br><br>As the 4th and final main variant of the V160 locomotive family, the DB BR 218 was the pinnacle of 1960s diesel-hydraulic technology and would serve under the Deutsche Bundesbahn as a universal freight and passenger locomotive. With almost 400 produced, the 218 became well known across Germany, being suited to almost any work thanks to its 140 km/h top speed, on-board electrical heating, and ability to work in multiple for tackling heavier tasks.<br><br>Despite their age, the BR 218\u2019s undeniable versatility keeps them in regular use throughout Germany to this day. Many are still employed to work trains away from wires, others are drafted in for additional cover when other equipment is unavailable. Several private companies have also taken stock of surplus 218s to operate and lease them where needed.<br><br>In Train Sim World\u00ae, the DB BR 218 roars into service on the Hamburg - L\u00fcbeck line. Drive this locomotive in push-pull configuration across its famous northerly stretch through Schleswig-Holstein, complete with classic n-Wagens in-tow, or take on additional Dosto passenger and freight duties. Bonus Maintalbahn timetable gameplay also features, utilising the BR 218 and Hamburg\u2019s Dostos.
