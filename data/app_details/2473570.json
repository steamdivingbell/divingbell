{"about_the_game":"The GameGuru Classic Easy Terrain Tool allows you to make beautiful procedural landscapes/terrains for your levels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJust click &quot;Random Terrain&quot; until you see something you like, you can then play with all the parameters to get the perfect landscape, and when you have something you like, use the &quot;Seed&quot; to generate variations of the same landscape.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can export maps (.fpm) directly so they can be loaded into GameGuru Classic to start your level creation with a completed terrain, or export raw Heightmaps (Little Endian) that are compatible with loading into the GameGuru MAX terrain generator for more terrain options.  Additionally, you can export Heightmap In PNG Format, for use in other engines that support Heightmap import.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can use 3 different types of noise to generate the terrain like Perlin/Simplex/Cellular or combine them along with 5 Filter types for effects like &quot;Minecraft Square&quot;/&quot;Center Play Area&quot;/... that will affect how your terrain looks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe tool uses Fractal Fractional Brownian Motion to produce a more natural-looking terrain for more realistic game levels and height data is mapped directly into the map file, so there is no quality loss like you normally have when importing heightmaps.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can fade terrain edges into an Island, and use &quot;Offset Height&quot; with a negative number like -1500 to control the size of the Island. Also, fade terrain into the center play area, so if you want a 100% flat area in the center of the map you can use &quot;Min Height&quot; to set how large you want the flat area, and finally, you can use terrain Painting to manually fade from sand to grass and rock texture paint from height values.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2473570/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1691069358","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2473570/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1691069358","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2473570/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1691069358","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2473570/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1691069358","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The GameGuru Classic Easy Terrain Tool allows you to make beautiful procedural landscapes/terrains for your levels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJust click &quot;Random Terrain&quot; until you see something you like, you can then play with all the parameters to get the perfect landscape, and when you have something you like, use the &quot;Seed&quot; to generate variations of the same landscape.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can export maps (.fpm) directly so they can be loaded into GameGuru Classic to start your level creation with a completed terrain, or export raw Heightmaps (Little Endian) that are compatible with loading into the GameGuru MAX terrain generator for more terrain options.
