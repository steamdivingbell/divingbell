{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Eyes of Hellfire</strong> is an atmospheric gothic horror experience for you and up to 4 of your friends. Based on real Irish legends of the secret society known as the Hellfire Club, in Eyes of Hellfire you and your friends are trapped within the club\u2019s headquarters, an abandoned hunting lodge. Enter the grounds of the Hellfire Club, cautiously explore, co-operate, evade the violent entities within the lodge, and discover what you can while you each attempt to lift your curse. Escape before your soul is lost. Be warned! In these walls something, or someone, is always lying.<br><br>Key Features:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Solve the curse with 2-5 players:</strong> You and your friends play as a small group of unfortunate people who have recently discovered that they have each become a victim of a potentially fatal curse. They have hiked through the thick woods of the Dublin mountains and travelled to the ruins of the Hellfire Club in the hopes of discovering what connects them to this place and what, or who, has brought this curse upon them all.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Cooperate or betray: </strong>You and your team have a common goal of escaping the haunted lodge while also defeating the Antagonist. But you each also have hidden solo objectives. Which will you prioritize? You must succeed at both to win. Use proximity voice chat to plot together with teammates, as well as question their motives.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Character-driven psychosis: </strong>Choose from a variety of characters, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and goals. Your choice will impact what you see in each play session; you\u2019ll have to decide if it\u2019s real or not.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Build your hand of actions:</strong> Each playthrough you start with a hand of cards that equal actions that can be done each turn, limited by your action points. As you explore the lodge, you\u2019ll discover new and better action cards to alter your playthrough.</p></li></ul>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1724030?t=1740604894","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1724030/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1740604894","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1724030/69fd3faeb53f2e72a6767ea9ffb89c496d2de827/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1740604894","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1724030/69fd3faeb53f2e72a6767ea9ffb89c496d2de827/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1740604894","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Eyes of Hellfire</strong> is an atmospheric gothic horror experience for you and up to 4 of your friends.
