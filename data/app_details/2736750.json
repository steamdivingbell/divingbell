Monster taming games are some of my favorite video games and I am excited to be making one of my own. I feel that an underutilized aspect of these games is the relationship that the tamer has with the monster. For this reason, I would like for this game to be primarily a virtual pet experience built into an RPG. If this concept sounds appealing to you, please stick around for this journey. Please feel free to make suggestions and comments as I greatly value feedback. <br><br>I hope that you will enjoy your experience in the DreaMon World.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>- Courier Games","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2736750/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1719843098","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2736750/page.bg.jpg?t=1719843098","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2736750/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1719843098","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2736750/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1719843098","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Welcome to the DreaMon World.</h2><br>You find yourself far from home, trapped in a new world, a place teeming with creatures known as DreaMon.
