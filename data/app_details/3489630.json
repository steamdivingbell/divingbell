{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Distant Lands: Earendel</strong> is a <strong>First Person Clicker</strong> with a world to explore and a story to discover.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3489630/extras/distant_lands1.jpg?t=1739893978\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Based on a future world where a strange and <strong>undefined disaster took place</strong>, we are chosen for unknown reasons to complete the mission of &quot;hiding&quot; stars, cleaning the astral view to watch further and discover new and random stars. You'll have to unveil why we shoot stars, why are we chosen and why everything looks so undefined. Hide stars to obtain money, and spend it on building a village, collect Anialms, and unlock new features. Explore places like The Town or The City to read notes and watch shortfilms someone left behind to understand your roots and the history of the world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">All the models, music, cutscenes, animations, programming &amp; story are made by me. It's been a long and hardworking journey to make a world where everything connects and everything makes sense at the end. This game was inspired mainly by Outer Wilds, even though it's very different, its way to tell the story mixed with the freedom you have to discover it was the first stone of Distant Lands: Earendel.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3489630/extras/Distant_Lands2.jpg?t=1739893978\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Its core gameplay is based on the <strong>3Dfication of the typical clickers</strong>. Get money, buy something that gives you more money, and spend that money to unlock new functions. A simple but fun way to discover new stars, every star has its own peculiar thing. Sometimes you just have to click it 10 times, sometimes it moves, sometimes it has other stars around it...\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The\u00a0<strong>Village System</strong>\u00a0where you obtain passive money is made to\u00a0incentivize the exploration and not to feel like you're losing money if you go to walk. You can also encounter Experience Orbs and Money around. The Experience system works so that the level you currently are, multiplies with the money a star gives. If a star gives you 2$ and you're level 3, you will obtain 6$</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3489630/extras/Distant_Lands3.jpg?t=1739893978\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The art of the game is <strong>very basic</strong>, if you play you will understand why, but I also wanted to make a template where I could create things without the need of them to be <strong>realistic</strong>.

The way the story it's told is multiple, and by that I mean <strong>it's not just notes and static reading</strong>.
