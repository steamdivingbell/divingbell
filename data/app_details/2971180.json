{"about_the_game":"An historically important mainline, the Pf\u00e4lzische Ludwigsbahn was built in sections throughout the mid-1800s. The line originally terminated on the western side of the Rhine at Ludswighafen but was quickly extended over the eastern bank to Mannheim, followed eventually by the movement of the former station to create a seamless through line. <br><br>The line has 2 distinct halves; straight and level tracks rule the way between Mannheim and Neustadt, immediately after which, the tone of the line changes completely. A wall of forest punctuates the start of tight curves and close-up valleys, the rails gradually making their way further west to Kaiserslautern. <br><br>In Train Sim World 5, become a driver or conductor aboard DB passenger services, and explore the sights of this quaint line. Set in the early 2010s, the route features the newly built third track between Ludswighafen and Limburgerhof, and has ruling speeds of 160 km/h. <br><br>Enjoy a unique mix of motive power; employ the BR 425 on Rhein-Neckar S-Bahn services, snake along the rails in the ICE 3M, and shuttle along in the classic BR 111.
