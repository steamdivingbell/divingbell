{"about_the_game":"America's East Coast is home to some of the most beautiful canyons, beaches, mountains, gorges, mountains, and rivers. It is especially famous during the Fall, when the leaves turn to impossibly beautiful shades of red, orange and yellow. This experience will allow you to visit some of these beautiful locations, hear a guided narration, and get up and even walk about a bit! At a time when travel, especially international travel, is so hard, we want to make you feel truly transported. We want you to feel the vitality, the rawness of these beautiful places in the same way you'd feel if you were visiting these places for the first time. New places will be added frequently, even extending outside the United States. Come and be part of this exciting journey with us!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1601810/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1626462415","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1601810/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1626462415","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1601810/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1626462415","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1601810/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1626462415","categories":[{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"America's East Coast is home to some of the most beautiful canyons, beaches, mountains, gorges, mountains, and rivers.
