{"about_the_game":"Do you remember the story of the boy who took magic seeds and grew beans that reached to the sky? Well, this is not that story, although it bears an uncanny resemblance to it. Unfortunately, there are no giants at the top of the vine, and no geese laying golden eggs, but monsters who are desperate to get down and take over the earth. And who rules the world above the clouds? Who must you defeat to save your home? Find out for yourself! Protect the vine with traps and weapons, defeat the bosses and become the saviour of the land!<br><br>After climbing the tendril, we can see in the world above the clouds that at intervals different monsters try to get down to the ground to destroy our village. <br>Monsters start in random groups. The monsters come in waves and try to get down the tendril for a longer or shorter time, during which we have to prevent the monsters from getting down it.<br><br>The first step is to get to know our opponents.

You can see how many points you get for defeating a monster. A maximum of four different teams can attack at the same time.<br><br>The second step is to find out where the monsters are coming to the tendril. For this we need to find our way on the map.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2252940/extras/Map.png?t=1678189841\" /><br>On the map, we can select the attackers and see the route they take to reach the end. If we observe well, we can also see which traps they pass through, so it is worth building traps in these places.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2252940/extras/skull.png?t=1678189841\" /><br><br>It is important that the damage of the traps is different, so build a trap that does the most damage to the monsters passing through. e.g. Lizardmen are most damaged by lightning, so it is worth placing such a trap along their route.<br><br>Of course, we can fight the attackers ourselves. For this, we can use the weapons and armor dropped by the monsters, and we can also find special weapons in the various treasure chests.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2252940/extras/Chest_Weapon.png?t=1678189841\" /><br><br>There are five types of weapons:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Weapon and Shield<br></li><li>Two Handed Weapon<br></li><li>Dual Weapon<br></li><li>Bow<br></li><li>Wand</li></ul>There are twenty-two weapons in the game.<br><br>There are five types of armor:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Helmet<br></li><li>Shoulder guard<br></li><li>Armor<br></li><li>Glove<br></li><li>Boots</li></ul>There are nine armor sets available in the game.<br><br>The game contains seven types of traps.<br><br>Gold found in chests and dropped by monsters plays a big role in the game.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2252940/extras/Gold.png?t=1678189841\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>You can use gold to build and upgrade traps.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2252940/extras/TrapPad.png?t=1678189841\" /><br></li><li>You can open special chests for gold.
