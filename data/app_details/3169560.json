{"about_the_game":"CotfD is a gods strategy game from \u201cCreator Board Games\u201d in which only your tactical skill, your forward planning and the use of your full concentration can bring victory.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou are one of the creators of worlds and struggle for supremacy in all known universes and time planes. Create land masses out of nothingness and make them disappear into it again. Summon an army of loyal fighters and lead them into epic battles. Rain down fire on your enemies with powerful spells, conquer their cities and, in an emergency, let everything sink under the force of hellish volcanoes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhether as a pair in a nerve-wracking head-to-head duel, or as a team that makes the earth tremble. Look for allies in a legendary war between good and evil and be the last survivor on the playing field.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn ingenious three-dimensional playing field, which is created by all players, can be assembled in countless variations to offer yourself and your opponents ever new challenges.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSeveral game variants and additional mods ensure that every round is an adventure and a unique experience. Feel like a god and play \u201cCreators of the first Dawn\u201d exclusively for the Virtual Board Game Room (VBR).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou create land in the first few rounds, which you occupy with your cities and troops. Over the course of the game, these generate the resources mana and clay, which you can use to build more land and cast powerful spells. The aim is to remove your opponent\u2019s main characters from the game. This can be achieved in various ways, but is only final if the opponent no longer has any foot troops. It is therefore of decisive tactical depth when exactly an opponent should be attacked and when a certain spell should be cast.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese game dynamics change depending on the number of players, game variant and mods used. For example, the Armageddon mod puts you under pressure after a few rounds, while others speed up the game and make certain game mechanics more complex. For example, instead of fighting the other gods, it can be wise to build up your own territory so that you can watch the others disappear into the depths of nothingness during the final battle.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3169560/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727680845","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3169560/page.bg.jpg?t=1727680845","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3169560/d6c16c4715d6a51e2fa3617dd58e83cb5408c0ba/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727680845","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3169560/d6c16c4715d6a51e2fa3617dd58e83cb5408c0ba/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727680845","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"CotfD is a gods strategy game from \u201cCreator Board Games\u201d in which only your tactical skill, your forward planning and the use of your full concentration can bring victory.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou are one of the creators of worlds and struggle for supremacy in all known universes and time planes.
