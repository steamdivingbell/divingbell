{"about_the_game":"Madness in the Banaverse is a single player platform game that combines action and comedy with a cartoonish style, taking as its protagonist the famous YouTuber \u201cEl Bananero\u201d, who provides his voice to give life to the character and the most iconic phrases.<br><br>It all begins when the main character is kidnapped by Santa and his henchmen, and during his escape he ends up going through a portal to the multiverse. From there, together with his colleague Andr\u00e9s Di Bono, they will have to go through the various levels of the Multiverse to escape from a false Santa and his minions.<br><br>The goal of the game is to go through the different levels of the multiverse and find a way to return home. To do this, El Bananero and Andr\u00e9s have to travel through increasingly crazy places full of fake Santa's henchmen. Each level has its own challenges that combine environmental contexts with comedy and action.<br><br>The game has more than 11 levels with a variety of environments, each of which follows the concept of madness.
