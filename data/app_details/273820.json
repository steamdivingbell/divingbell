{"about_the_game":"Blast rocks, drill tunnels and force your way through every mountain. At the beginning you have enough time and no major problems. Once the TNT charges are placed you can start the blasting to create the tunnel entrance. The excavated material will be loaded by a shovel dozer on a dump truck and transported to the storage site. As soon as the entrance is cleaned up the huge tunnel drilling machine will march up. But this monster can only start operation if it is supplied with sufficient building material. This has to be delivered by crane and train. You have to steer all vehicles like the maintenance van, crane, tunnel drilling machine or the fire brigade. <br><br>That\u2019s how you\u2019ll create the building site piece by piece before starting the tunnel itself. You\u2019ll need to pay attention to many factors. The tunnel drilling machine has to be kept supplied with building materials. It\u2019s important that you don\u2019t lose track of your tasks.
