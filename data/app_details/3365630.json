You can create combos with certain heroes and selected abilities. For example, by giving a hero the Invisible effect to make them untargetable, you can leave Defender as the only targetable hero. With its special ability to reflect damage, Defender can return all incoming damage to enemies, allowing you to eliminate them and clear the stage without taking any damage.
