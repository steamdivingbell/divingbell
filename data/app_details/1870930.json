{"about_the_game":"Atlas Ablaze is a visual novel that follows a girl named Andi as she discovers how it feels to yearn to know someone the way you know yourself. It's a story about a coming of age, sonder feelings, the acceptance of change and simply owning up to being human.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe's a 16 year old who finds herself falling in love with a young sex worker as she's simultaneously dealing with a sharp decline in her mental health. Her lack of experience in relationships not only affects her love life, but her friendships as well. As she begins to understand how it feels to care for people so much that love becomes your crutch, she also realizes just how many people care for themselves more than anyone else.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nActing as somewhat of a subconscious or an imaginary friend, you can help Andi make choices in her day to day life, influencing the way she interacts with the people around her. There are many different characters you can meet, some of which have secrets to be discovered. If your humor is warped to a point where you can't explain why any of it is funny anymore, living inside Andi's mind might be exactly what you need.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n\u2022This game can be beaten in around 4 and a half hours.<br />\r\n\u2022There are seven different endings, though the same ending may look slightly different depending on less impactful choices the player has made.<br />\r\n\u2022The player can occasionally snoop through Andi's phone, finding extra artwork, reading text messages, etc.<br />\r\n\u2022All of the visuals are pixel art, with chiptune inspired music to match the atmosphere.<br />\r\n\u2022A large amount of the game has a light, pastel color pallet.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Disclaimer: None of the characters, including the sex workers, are meant to be sexualized-","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1870930?t=1729909890","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1870930?t=1729909890","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1870930/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729909890","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1870930/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729909890","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"-Mature language\r\n-Occasionally some humor is used to cope with traumatic events (may be seen as too light hearted of an approach to heavy topics by some players)\r\n\r\nTopics involving:\r\n-Sex/sex trafficking\r\n-Minors who have sex (non-descriptive, no imagery involved)\r\n-Brief mentions of sexual assault (not in detail)\r\n-Drug usage\r\n-Homophobia\r\n-Religious trauma\r\n-Abuse\r\n-Mental illness\r\n-Eating disorders\r\n-Death"},"demos":[{"appid":2857600,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Atlas Ablaze is a visual novel that follows a girl named Andi as she discovers how it feels to yearn to know someone the way you know yourself.
