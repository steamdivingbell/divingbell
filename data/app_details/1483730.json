Blood-splatter effects occur frequently as enemies are killed; some areas depict large bloodstains and impaled heads on spikes. Players can also perform finishing attacks (e.g., decapitation, impalements) that are sometimes highlighted by close-up camera angles. Cutscenes depict additional acts of violence: bound warriors decapitated by swords; characters executed with weapon strikes to the head"},"detailed_description":"Gryphon, a new playable hero has arrived!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter travelling all across Heathmoor learning from the best, a well-known veteran has returned to help bring peace to the land. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWield the mighty Bardiche and utilize Draconite-powered feats as you aid your allies and lead them to victory!<br />\r\nThe Gryphon Hero offer includes:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- 1 New Hero: Gryphon<br />\r\n- 1 Exclusive Ornament<br />\r\n- 1 Elite Outfit<br />\r\n- 7-Day Champion Status (Extra XP, Extra Loot, and More)<br />\r\n- 3 Scavenger Crates with Random Gear","developers":["Ubisoft Montreal","Ubisoft Quebec","Ubisoft Toronto","Blue Byte"],"fullgame":{"appid":"304390","name":"FOR HONOR\u2122"},"genres":[{"description":"Action","id":"1"}],"header_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1483730/header.jpg?t=1681496427","is_free":false,"legal_notice":"\u00a9 2016 Ubisoft Entertainment.
