It's us again, we're making this post so we can tell you guys how we plan to move forward with Thalamus, but first, we want to thank everyone who has supported us after the release. Whether you made a video, bought the game or just recommended it to a friend, from the bottom of our hearts we thank every single one of you. We weren't expecting the game to be as popular as it has become, and we hear your criticism about chapter 1. We are planning on fixing some issues that you all have pointed out, (such as the loud intro) as well as adding a few extra things so that players know why they are doing the things they do in chapter 1. <br><br><br>Once we do this we will put all our effort into chapter 2 and use it to clear up any questions that chapter 1 didn't answer (such as imperium and what it is). We also plan on there being more variation in what you will be doing, such as combat.<br><br><br>We don't have a release date for these updates yet but if you have any problems with thalamus then please let us know, whether it be on our discord or in the steam forums, we will read it and try to fix it.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Thalamus Is a story based game that takes place in France.
