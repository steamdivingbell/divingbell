{"about_the_game":"nullptr is an action puzzle game that requires careful planning and precise execution. Once you're connected to one of the servers ports, you have 20 seconds to hack security systems, reprogram the server, evade sentinel programs and download data. Your goal is to find or create safe routes to download all databases in each server without being traced.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hacking servers</h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1579650/extras/hacking-servers.gif?t=1728650798\" /><br><br>You start each level disconnected from the server and must choose an open port to start your run. Ports are color coded and give you access to different parts of the server and also to different systems. Once connected to the server, you have the option to open more ports by installing backdoors that will give you additional entry points to attack the server.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Connection route</h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1579650/extras/connection-route.gif?t=1728650798\" /><br><br>In order to download the server data, you must build a connection from an entry point to the database. The connection length determines the download time so it is wise to choose short routes. You will also need to evade security systems in your route, like firewalls that will block downloads. The route you take is also important to open gates in some servers. Data nodes included in a route contribute with their color to the connection profile that is used to match and open the gates.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Sentinel programs</h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1579650/extras/sentinel-programs.gif?t=1728650798\" /><br><br>Each server in the game is owned by one of the four megacorporations in the world of nullptr. In order to protect their data, each megacorporation has installed their own sentinel programs whose goal is to trace invaders and eliminate them. Fortunately, you are a hacker and once you understand how each program works, you can manipulate them by choosing specific routes or reprogramming the server using the stack memory.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1579650/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728650798","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1579650/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1728650798","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1579650/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728650798","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1579650/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728650798","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":2771570,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"nullptr is an action puzzle game that requires careful planning and precise execution.
