{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Lead a determined group of survivors through the heart of a crumbling city, where tactical combat meets colony management in a fight for survival. As their leader, you'll directly command fighters in real-time combat while managing a semi-autonomous workforce to build a resilient sanctuary amidst constant danger and chaos.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your colony's survival depends on strategic resource management \u2013 gathering food, wood, and scrap metal from perilous locations across the map. Workers operate semi-autonomously, responding to beacons and waypoints you establish for resource gathering and construction. Under your guidance, they'll build everything from basic shelters to sophisticated defensive structures, creating a stronghold against the threats that lurk in the ruins.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Combat takes center stage with RTS-style tactical control over your fighters. Position your combat units strategically, coordinate group movements, and execute precise defensive maneuvers against both the undead hordes and opportunistic raiders. Your direct command over combat forces adds a layer of tactical depth, allowing you to respond immediately to threats while your worker base maintains the colony's infrastructure. Upgrade your fighters' capabilities through specialized training facilities, and outfit them with increasingly powerful weapons and armor scavenged from the wasteland.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As your colony expands, you'll need to carefully balance resource allocation between defensive capabilities and civilian infrastructure. Construct and maintain specialized buildings to manage critical needs like hunger, sleep, and entertainment, ensuring your survivors maintain high morale. A robust happiness system affects both worker productivity and fighter performance, making community management crucial as your population grows and your territory expands into new, resource-rich areas of the map.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Strategic control points across the city hide unique buildings that can be captured and rebuilt, unlocking powerful advantages for your colony. These structures provide access to advanced technologies like the devastating Flame Turret, specialized training facilities for your fighters, and crucial resource processing capabilities. Securing and holding these positions becomes a key element of your survival strategy, requiring careful coordination between your combat forces and worker base.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The ultimate challenge reveals itself when your expansion uncovers an ancient bunker \u2013 a mysterious structure that could hold the key to humanity's survival. This discovery shifts your mission focus: while maintaining your colony's defences and continuing resource operations, you must strategically deploy your forces to breach the bunker's defenses. This final objective will test your ability to balance offensive operations with base defense as increasingly intense waves of enemies assault your position.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Every tactical decision and resource allocation shapes your colony's fate in this unique blend of RTS combat and survival management. Your success depends on masterful control of your fighting force, efficient worker management, and the strategic development of your colony's infrastructure. Lead your survivors, build your legacy, and discover if you have what it takes to survive the end.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3327210/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732835265","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3327210/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1732835265","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3327210/843be47c0ddd97c31c7840e606692fec8b8b8742/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732835265","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3327210/843be47c0ddd97c31c7840e606692fec8b8b8742/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732835265","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Lead a determined group of survivors through the heart of a crumbling city, where tactical combat meets colony management in a fight for survival.
