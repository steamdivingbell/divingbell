{"about_the_game":"This is a legend of a hero's adventure on the dark island.<br />\r\nDarkness envelops the island, and our hero tries again and again to challenge the fierce dragon on the island. As you boldly explore the entire island, the hero grows stronger and stronger, collecting new CARDS to form different character decks, and using decks and items to defeat increasingly powerful enemies. Each enemy guards some resources that the protagonist is free to judge are needed to decide whether to attack or avoid the enemy. At the end of the game the dragon will be destroyed and out of the darkness, but this is not the end. As you destroy the dragon over and over again, you'll find that each time you explore it, you'll find new islands, different enemies, CARDS, stores, etc. Each adventure is a new experience, and as you get more difficult each time, you'll collect more new CARDS and items (kept in the gallery). As a result, you can choose to take on different gameplay options: you can take on higher and higher levels of difficulty to enjoy the adventure, you can also aim to collect different CARDS, you can also trade with various merchants on the island, it's a fun experience any way you want. If you wish you were the hero who destroyed the dragon, let us begin!
