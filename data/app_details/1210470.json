{"about_the_game":"The Adventures of Bluke Bifton is a hand-drawn, episodic adventure game set in a world of absolute absurdity. Journey across the once-peaceful Isle of Flungo in <strong>Chapter 1</strong>, crafting alliances (or making enemies) with a wide cast of strange, fully-voiced characters. With a major focus on interactions and choices, every decision you make impacts your journey. It's time to meet some new friends, make some unexpected choices, and stand up against some violent, quite-possibly-insane foes!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore the Isle of Flungo</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1210470/extras/BLUKEGIF2_2.gif?t=1689865163\" /><br>The Isle of Flungo is open to explore, whether it be on foot, or by (extremely run-down) vehicle. As Bluke, you'll navigate varying locations in a side-scrolling, point-n-click perspective, able to click on any object or character of interest to engage with it. Then, hop into the Munchmobile to take a road trip throughout the overworld - featuring optional objectives, a shop, and plenty of weird interactions!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Make unpredictable choices and be met with equally-unexpected consequences</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1210470/extras/BLUKEGIF3.gif?t=1689865163\" /><br>Want to take on the role of a pacifist?
