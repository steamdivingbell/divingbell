{"about_the_game":"Call Center is the most realistic job simulator you'll ever play. And for that reason - don't buy this game. That is, unless you want to know what its really like to work in a real call center. This will be the most boring game you'll ever play. Every 2 hours you get a 15 minute break. So that's kind of cool. But there's a million other things you could do with your time than play this game. There are two endings.. so that's something?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2544410/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1706216376","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2544410/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1706216376","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2544410/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1706216376","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2544410/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1706216376","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Call Center is the most realistic job simulator you'll ever play.
