{"about_the_game":"&quot;Pathfinder 2 RPG - Adventure Path #204: Stage Fright (Curtain Call 1 of 3)<br> <br> Rumors abound that an old enemy, a dangerous foe you defeated at the culmination of your first huge adventure, has come back.

How dangerous could it be, helping to produce an extravaganza based on your own heroic legacy? <br> Stage Fright is a Pathfinder adventure for four 11th-level characters. This adventure begins the Curtain Call Adventure Path, a three-part monthly campaign in which a group of adventurers help to produce an opera based on their own prior adventures while simultaneously facing a new threat that only the most powerful of heroes can stop. This adventure also includes information about theatrical traditions of Golarion as well as an entire potential cast of diverse actors to help bring the new opera to life, several new magical items to discover and operatic abilities to master, and several new monsters from the whimsical to the truly horrific. <br>  This product is not a PDF or accessible outside of Fantasy Grounds.
