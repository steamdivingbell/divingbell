A \u2018toxic\u2019 workplace has transformed the once happy employees into dark and dangerous creatures. The office waits for a hero. You! Become the Box Knight and bring light back to this dark place. <br><br>By day you're just a normal office worker, but when the clock hits 5pm on a Friday you become the Box Knight - Protector of the office realm. Fighter of evil beings, deliverer of beers, wine and non-alcoholic beverages to your fellow workers in need. A champion of \u2018culture\u2019 in the now blighted workplace. <br><br>Level by level, department by department you liberate the office of the toxic scourge that has plagued the once great company.
