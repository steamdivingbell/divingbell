{"about_the_game":"Ia Drang, November 1965. The deafening whip of chopper blades indicates that the first large-scale helicopter assault ever attempted is underway. The battle begins with touchdown at LZ X-Ray. It ends five days later and no one is quite sure who has won, or what lessons were learned. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFive major battles from the Vietnam War will test your jungle combat command skills, as you harness airmobile forces, artillery and air strikes in a cat and mouse game of guerilla warfare. Battle simulation includes detailed challenges, including a day-night-cycle, weather, terrain, supply lines, formations, unit organization and experience, and more. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nConflict in Vietnam is a classic real-time simulation game from the 80s designed by Sid Meier and Ed Bever.

Sid Meier, one of the most well-known and prolific strategy game designer-producers, collaborated with historian Ed Bever to make the games incredibly historically accurate.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1703060?t=1643669273","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1703060/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1643669273","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1703060/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1643669273","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1703060/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1643669273","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Ia Drang, November 1965.
