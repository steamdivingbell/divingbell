{"about_the_game":"<strong>The Garden Pinball</strong><br>What could be more relaxing than being in the fresh air taking care of flowers? If it were not for those nasty bugs that can destroy the entire harvest!<br>Sow the flower seed and water your new flower regularly until it is fully grown and can be harvested. Chase away the bugs that want to stop you from harvesting. If you don\u2019t do that, the flower will wither away and all your efforts will have been in vain. <br>Constantly fill your water bucket at the well and ensure a steady supply of new flower seeds so that, one day, you will have harvested every flower at least once, in order to bind them into a precious bouquet. But beware: the bugs will certainly strike back!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/729620/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1667032797","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/729620/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1667032797","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/729620/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1667032797","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/729620/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1667032797","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>The Garden Pinball</strong><br>What could be more relaxing than being in the fresh air taking care of flowers?
