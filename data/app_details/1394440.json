{"about_the_game":"In 1972, as a freshman in college, Steve Allen was introduced to Pong, the first commercial arcade game. He and his college roommates, Tommy Walker and Howard White, began their video game journey and met many of the industry's biggest names, including Jerry Lawson, the inventor of cassette tapes, Nolan Bushnell, the founder of Atari, and the developer of ET Aliens. Warsaw, Apple's founder Steve Jobs, and many more, are writing their own legendary stories in this glorious virtual world, but things are far less optimistic than Alan thought, and a video game winter is about to sweep across the country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is the third indie game I've developed in the narrative genre, Game Over, and is based on the famous Atari Shock event.  The story will be told from the point of view of a game developer throughout the Great Depression, from its beginning to its end, and how it affected him personally.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game has three forms of presentation, a narrative form, a form of acting out the story with the game and playing the game in the game.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1394440?t=1734526442","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1394440/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1734526442","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1394440/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734526442","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1394440/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734526442","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"In 1972, as a freshman in college, Steve Allen was introduced to Pong, the first commercial arcade game.
