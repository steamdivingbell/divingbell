{"about_the_game":"Tank DLC give access to most massive class of robots, Tank! This race is considered to be tough and brutal. He is bigger than the rest, he has more health and armor, but he is slower. His ability, Charge, compensates for this feature. Skillful player will be able both to run away and to catch up the enemy using this ability. In opinion of the pros, this class may seem even swifter than the Scout. Knockdown ability of the tank leaves no chance for his opponent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe tank is perfectly armed! His weapons are different from those available to soldiers and scouts. Modest amount of ammunition is a drawback. But this disadvantage is compensated by most destructive Weapons: extra-heavy Grenade launcher, bombarding opponents with tons of grenades; Magnet, literally sucking enemy\u2019s health and armor; and, of course, double-barreled Sniper Rifle. The tank is suitable for fans of tricky and tough game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/353571/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1540318376","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/353571/page.bg.jpg?t=1540318376","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/353571/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1540318376","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/353571/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1540318376","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Tank DLC give access to most massive class of robots, Tank!
