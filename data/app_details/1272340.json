{"about_the_game":"Escape to Sidious is a classic space browser game with a modern twist. At ETS you start the game with a city. You expand them in real time, strengthen your economy, achieve technological edge, trade, forge alliances, expand your fleet to plunder other settlers and take-over or fund new cities to expand your empire. The gameplay is known to many, so what makes ETS special? We have continuously developed ETS and expanded it with many modern elements:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\tYou can work off daily missions to get rewards<br />\r\n\tYou can solve quests, that explain you how to play and provide ressources at the same time<br />\r\n\tMany little helpers, which make playing easier. E.g. a combat simulator or a fleet planner<br />\r\n\tAn existing diplomacy system that ensures fairness.<br />\r\nThese are just the biggest highlights, but of course there is much more to discover in-game, such as a teleporter or, in addition to the trading center, a black market that fully integrates player trading into the game. Everything has been integrated into the game so carefully that it doesn't look as if it's overloaded. ETS is exactly what you are looking for. It offers the full charm of a classic browser game and appears intuitive and modern.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1272340/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1666984724","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1272340/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1666984724","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1272340/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1666984724","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1272340/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1666984724","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Escape to Sidious is a classic space browser game with a modern twist.
