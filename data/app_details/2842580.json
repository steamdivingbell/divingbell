{"about_the_game":"<strong>ReCoil is a 2D Top-Down Shooter with a unique twist to it's genre.</strong><br><br>Your armour is too heavy for you to manage, but you need it to survive. You will have to use the recoil of your weaponry to navigate each level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay:</h2><br><strong>Recoil:</strong><br>The recoil acts as a double edge sword. It allows the player to have complete control in movement. However, when using your arsenal, it may become challenging to balance the need of ammunition for facing enemies, and escaping dangerous situations. When firing your weapon, your player character will be thrown directly behind him with a great amount of speed and acceleration. But this will use your depleting supply of ammunition, which will be needed to survive. There are also 3 different weapons in ReCoil, each with there own gimmicks and variations of knockback. This allows for even more freedom whilst playing.<br><br><strong>Levels:</strong><br>There will be 12 uniquely designed levels in ReCoil to play. Each level has a timer at the bottom of the screen counting down until the clock reaches 0, allowing progression to the next level. Some levels are not only harder to beat, but also require a larger period of time that the player needs to survive in before accessing the next level.<br><br><strong>ReCoil is a short, free game created by Sisyphus.</strong>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Shotgun","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2842580/071092582ecf4eccd7054f7dabdf2654136fd9d0.jpg"},{"name":"Rifle","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2842580/50974221b1516241b6f0c73c5d0a18dccadba94f.jpg"},{"name":"Blast Cannon","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2842580/135b634e91b2a7bcd539db79407720c7c31ef6df.jpg"},{"name":"A Sisyphean Task","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2842580/1d566362cba15116f4418eaca80904758be4419b.jpg"},{"name":"Boulder","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2842580/750277aafc0f9f6f30c35b1df1337b80f366a590.jpg"}],"total":5},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2842580/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728937279","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2842580/page.bg.jpg?t=1728937279","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2842580/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728937279","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2842580/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728937279","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>ReCoil is a 2D Top-Down Shooter with a unique twist to it's genre.</strong><br><br>Your armour is too heavy for you to manage, but you need it to survive.
