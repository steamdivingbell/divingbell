{"about_the_game":"Introducing &quot;Save the World&quot;, a thrilling sci-fi story about Ekiya, a young woman living in London who's struggling to make ends meet with her roommate, Sarah, in a world where all that matters is how much money  you make.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter a break-up and recent job change, Ekiya's life takes an even more  drastic turn when she's kidnapped by aliens. Their leader introduces  themself as Xen and explains that they are space travelers with the  objective of saving the worlds they encounter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nXen asks Ekiya about the problems on Earth and all Ekiya does is  answer seemingly innocent questions about the world including the uneven distribution of wealth. Little does she know, her answers will soon influence the fate of the entire world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe  following day, Xen makes a proclamation: every day a progressively increasing number of the wealthiest individuals on Earth would be killed.  At first, there are attempts to fight  back.  However, the superiority of the aliens' technology quickly becomes clear.  The world is completely at their mercy-- and perhaps,  Ekiya's.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nXen seems to trust her judgement and continues listening to Ekiya's  advice.  Can Ekiya change Xen's mind?  Convince them to leave?  Or, if  it comes to it, can Ekiya discover a way to destroy Xen and the rest of  the aliens?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is exactly what Agent Castillo from MI6 asks her to do.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs Ekiya, you must decide what to do.  Do you prioritize humanity  or will you look for a more peaceful way to settle things?  Maybe this  is your chance to better the world.  Instead of destroying the aliens,  perhaps you can use your influence to inact even more radical changes--  changes that will potentially help more than yourself and your roommate.  After all, what have the rich ever done for you besides ignore your suffering?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith four different endings, two love interests (Xen and Sarah), and a story full of unpredictable and  thoughtful moments, &quot;Save the World&quot; is  a game that you won't want to  miss.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Jackpot!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2280370/b739f63ae747cc54bbfb6bef3de3efd3975ad136.jpg"},{"name":"Finally Free","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2280370/9b457fa19fdd97cae08cf60d3bb0138961970cc6.jpg"},{"name":"I'm Sorry","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2280370/8e4e6a5e026eb1c449200664a882d028cf38ea9b.jpg"},{"name":"Space Travelers","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2280370/c41ccdef20df998b3777db244f7e8eb3b8956840.jpg"},{"name":"It Wasn't My Fault","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2280370/a14cfeecc9241cef3284d9cfa00782a6e19d1ee7.jpg"},{"name":"Aww Cute!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2280370/d883719d0755fbf37a36fd7d8ae8b3e8a2f5bf04.jpg"},{"name":"Pure Bliss","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2280370/38049fce098c4a5e9935a3a3bdbabc0a475e5f08.jpg"},{"name":"Heart-Shaped","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2280370/2e95d16ad4ed0ca025069d8a1e9d89230871173b.jpg"},{"name":"Bubble-bath","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2280370/ba228521c6fcea97e3461357d649ae6874f6b799.jpg"},{"name":"New Kind Of Love","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2280370/83d2499d2aca1d18a82da7e9bddbf53359fdf841.jpg"}],"total":15},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2280370/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1713618887","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2280370/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1713618887","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2280370/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1713618887","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2280370/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1713618887","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Introducing &quot;Save the World&quot;, a thrilling sci-fi story about Ekiya, a young woman living in London who's struggling to make ends meet with her roommate, Sarah, in a world where all that matters is how much money  you make.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter a break-up and recent job change, Ekiya's life takes an even more  drastic turn when she's kidnapped by aliens.
