As time passes, the distinction between good and evil fades. <br>The player's task is to restore order eliminating rebels and their leaders.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Setting</strong></h2>The rulers of the planetary system try to maintain peace and suppress the first symptoms of smoldering disturbances. But on one of the minor colonized planets, a rebellion ignites. The Barons cannot let the fragile peace of The Union collapse and allow the return of the conflagration of war. <br> <br>In the system, Interceptors are the law. It is their duty to ensure that the rule of law is always upheld.<br>They exist to prevent another war. Despite the fact that they had previously fought on the other side of the barricade, they were able to unite.
