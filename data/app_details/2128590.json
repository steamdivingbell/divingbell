While this system entails some inherent risks, it has proven to be extremely efficient.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Energizing and recycling bullets</h2>The <strong>Bullet Tower</strong> shoots basic bullets that don't carry much energy. It is, therefore, desirable to energize them in <strong>Energy Towers</strong> before they hit batteries. It is also useful to recycle bullets that do not hit any battery in the <strong>Eco Tower</strong>. This earns the company <strong>Eco Credits</strong> and keeps environmentalists at arm's length.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2128590/extras/charging.gif?t=1711809277\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Changing bullet direction</h2>Due to the complicated layouts of our factory floors, it is often necessary to change the bullet path to avoid an obstacle. This can be achieved by <strong>Bend Towers</strong> that change the bullet's direction by 90 degrees.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2128590/extras/bending.gif?t=1711809277\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Splitting bullets</h2>Building multiple <strong>Bullet Towers</strong> to increase the number of bullets in circulation can be quite expensive. So here's an alternative: <strong>Split Tower</strong> takes an already existing bullet on the input and splits it into three bullets with reduced energy.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2128590/extras/splitting.gif?t=1711809277\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fusing bullets</h2>To create the most powerful bullets, it is necessary to utilize the <strong>Fuse Tower</strong> that fuses the energies of three incoming bullets into one. The combined bullet has very <strong>high energy</strong> and pierces through batteries instead of being destroyed. This way, only a fraction of the energy will be used for charging, and the rest will pierce through.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2128590/extras/fuse_and_pierce.gif?t=1711809277\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Routing bullets</h2>The <strong>Junction Tower</strong> is quite versatile and can be used in various situations. It can chain bullet streams, fuse them, and perform complex bullet-routing tasks. Furthermore, the routing direction can be switched when hit from the side with the lever.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2128590/extras/switching.gif?t=1711809277\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"It Is About the Journey","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2128590/9ef7ece72cf94e858ccef4f47729fa56957cef4b.jpg"},{"name":"Taking Shortcuts","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2128590/fa39321888101c596bb852c341bcbac5d4926e42.jpg"},{"name":"Holy Trinity","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2128590/08a86cc5e5bcda0cb0d20b1b21c3b91200f4587e.jpg"},{"name":"Population 512.01","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2128590/64fc1478dfe241dd72b1816746994a219d0e6146.jpg"},{"name":"Fourth Element","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2128590/e98120bdd4a4fb56dc19b4d4de5aa0e69cc79f49.jpg"},{"name":"Straightforward","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2128590/1ddcf76c4fd802154c1baeb8e1671ae93d930907.jpg"},{"name":"Apprentice","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2128590/20f3df8d5b14c275bcc8d18d9a4029154d9cbb3a.jpg"},{"name":"Arcadia","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2128590/53826d7801697176aa0f30aa1bba06bcc73d3ea9.jpg"},{"name":"Shangri-La","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2128590/6dc1c1b6b702f7b745092b391d59f62354bb47dc.jpg"},{"name":"Elysium","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2128590/6710d3476084ee06b2e6ebc174d5fce675699bc4.jpg"}],"total":51},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2128590/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1711809277","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2128590/page.bg.jpg?t=1711809277","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2128590/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1711809277","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2128590/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1711809277","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2212030,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>ATTENTION ALL FUTURE EMPLOYEES!
