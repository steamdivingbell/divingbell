{"about_the_game":"You are the heroic Alf, in the throes of struggle and adventure. The Demon King has torn apart the world and reversed its gravity, causing everything to be upside down.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWithout a doubt, the world has gone mad. However, this madness brings opportunities and chances. Your fight is more than just a battle, it's a quest to set right a world flipped on its head due to a reversal of gravity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe path forward is steep, and each step you take might lead to a major setback due to failure. But don't fear. Learn from the missteps, evolve, and take the next step forward.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlf understands that to tackle new challenges, you must progress boldly, even in uncertain circumstances. The destination is the defeat of the Demon King, but it is the journey to this destination that matters most.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you progress, the game, titled &quot;Fantasy UP!&quot;, presents a journey of reaching new heights while gaining magic and experience. The challenges become more difficult as you progress towards the final showdown with the Demon King, but the higher you climb, the greater the risk of falling becomes. However, once you fall, you can rise stronger.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is challenging and tense, but that's exactly the point. To reach the Demon King, you need to overcome fear and frustration, and progress slowly but surely, keeping calm all the while. It is the journey towards the destination that matters most.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe average time to complete the game is between 30 to 60 minutes. Those who love a world combined of action and RPG will find much to enjoy here. Everything hinges on that first step. Are you ready, Alf?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2520760/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1692143854","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2520760/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1692143854","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2520760/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1692143854","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2520760/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1692143854","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You are the heroic Alf, in the throes of struggle and adventure.
