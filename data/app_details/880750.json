Overwhelm your opponent with hosts of agile Frigates, swarms of Strike Craft or just with the immense firepower of a single huge Titan.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Open files for modding</h2>Tinker, change and customize the game to your heart's content, adding new or modifying existing starships, factions, troops, technologies to the game. Re-enact some of your favourite sci-fi tv shows, movies and books moments right in the game.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/880750/extras/gif_2_finale.gif?t=1726824910\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Lucky Colonist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/880750/42dc569dfe105ff4f8d87af65c286504513d9115.jpg"},{"name":"Happy Marine","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/880750/b1c9b55c47bf12c7ada7d506c40290cab23d14df.jpg"},{"name":"Efficient Commander","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/880750/f5a5e6856f3191cc478b3acea55d1eec09aca4ef.jpg"},{"name":"Seasoned General","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/880750/d0d880ab17494f222cbb300fcb621af3589d0c46.jpg"},{"name":"Brilliant Admiral","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/880750/15c8840a9d6eb663f6d7e984964b8224d71d0065.jpg"},{"name":"Competent Captain","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/880750/25e329b605938fea8bab6b514bef95d83ab05c01.jpg"},{"name":"Elgathi's Equal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/880750/b3325c7a76c44efd343917fa7dfa4af21e05850d.jpg"},{"name":"Expand with gusto","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/880750/82130cd1d48e4360bd2029a3355b739579883ba7.jpg"},{"name":"Experience with awe","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/880750/70a1e6c40f4f8a7229cdaf8b1f7145f0477a2afb.jpg"},{"name":"Way of the blaster","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/880750/77c432398ca95affee78f700c10bb5236f624a41.jpg"}],"total":55},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/880750/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726824910","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/880750/page.bg.jpg?t=1726824910","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/880750/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726824910","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/880750/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726824910","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Talos Arena Update</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/880750/extras/AstraExodus_spotlight-TalosArenaUpdate.jpg?t=1726824910\" /><br><br>The Talos Arena Update is a free, massive update for Astra Exodus.<br>It includes:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Battle Simulator</h2> Play battles right from the main menu.
