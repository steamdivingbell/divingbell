Consuming some wakefulness value can release the dream barrier, greatly increasing the firepower value and providing protection against attacks in the barrier.

When releasing the token, the boss will hold the shield, and the shield will not be damaged during its existence. Attacks on the shield will reduce its duration.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">At the end of the symbol card time, if it has not been hit by barrage attacks/body attacks, it is considered as &quot;symbol card full avoidance&quot;, otherwise it is considered as &quot;time end&quot;.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Break the token before the end of the token time. If it does not lose health, it is considered a &quot;successful collection&quot;.

Although the density and difficulty of the barrage are higher than most N and H, if the barrier mechanism can be fully understood and utilized for bomb evasion and firepower coverage, it is enough to break these epic talismans.
