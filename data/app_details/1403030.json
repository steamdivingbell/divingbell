Most resources require tools to harvest, be it an axe to chop down a tree, a shovel to dig up a plant, or a pickaxe to mine a rock. There are common resources like wood and stone but for more advanced crafting recipes you may have to scour the world for rare biomes and materials such as the bog providing vital peat and bog-steel.
