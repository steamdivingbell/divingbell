{"about_the_game":"In this turn-based strategy game set in the fantastic world of SpellForce, take up the mantle of your master as the heir to his mysterious wizard\u2019s tower.  <br>Study a multitude of spells to cast over the lands around you, summon fantastical minions and train mighty warriors to roam the world. Fight in fast-paced but tactical turn-based battles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore the Realm of Eo</h2> Win over mighty heroes to go on adventures for you, find useful artefacts and ingredients or bring back riches. <br>Seek out talented apprentices to expand your domain and workers to gather a wealth of resources for you.   Unearth the secrets inherited from your master and follow his quest to tap and unleash the ultimate source of magical power \u2013 the Allfire!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Face powerful foes </h2>  <br>Among the other mages, there are those who would oppose your rise to power. You will have to face  great armies  and even greater ambitions of your rival Mages. Can you survive the struggle for domination? <br>To expand your domain, you will need to control sources of Allfire, so you can fill your grimoire with new magical spells, craft mighty artefacts, and expand and improve your tower.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Choose wisely</h2> Become a Necromancer creating dozens of powerful undead, an Alchemist concocting potions and explosive vials for use in battle or an Artificer crafting glyphs and magical items to furnish your troops with. Bolster your might with over 60 spells and more than 100 different troops from lowly goblins to majestic griffons.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Leave your mark</h2> Befriend cities, harvest resources, and expand your domain. Fill your grimoire with arcane knowledge to best your rivals as you vie for sources of power. Hunt arcane artefacts and unearth the long-hidden secrets of the Shapers or take control of mythical locations to absorb their power.  Improve your tower and furnish it with new rooms to grow your dominion, with upgrades ranging from a necromancer\u2019s crypt to the mystical crystal chamber.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tower on the fly </h2> Your immense magical sophistication allows your tower to levitate from the ground and travel the lands. <br>On your path to exploit the sources of magical power on Eo, you will face New Purity fanatics, hostile granite dwarves, and bloodthirsty orcs. Encounter undead, demons, and monsters as you explore forgotten ruins or help a village haunted by ghosts.  <br>You might even need to face the other wizards\u2019 armies of minions and best them in battle so you can march on your competitors\u2019 towers and reduce them to rubble. Or perhaps you might find a way for you to appease them and profit from their knowledge? <br><br>SpellForce: Conquest of Eo lets you dive into a rich world, filled to the brim with magic and adventure.
