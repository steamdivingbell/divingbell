{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BeatWeaver</h2>The BeatWeaver is a rhythm design tool. Based on your choices, it generates rhythmic patterns you can play with. It\u2019s made up of three parts The BeatForm Circuits, Step Sequencer and the BeatWeave list.<br><br><br>The BeatForm Circuits send BeatForms \u2013 or \u201cnote clusters\u201d \u2013 to specific locations in a bar through up to 3 preset paths. To see where these paths lead, just follow the highlighted path.<br><br>A simple 8-step sequencer opens the paths from the BeatForm Circuits to the BeatWeave List. Click any of the steps to activate them.<br><br>The BeatWeave List shows every possible combination of your chosen note clusters in one bar. Each one of these patterns can be inserted into the Arranger.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Maps</h2>Why have 256 unique rhythm patterns organized in a badass map-wheel-gizmo-thing you can interact with to make beats? Well, why not have 256 unique rhythm patterns organized in a badass map-wheel-gizmo-thing you can interact with to make beats?<br><br>With the BarForm and BeatForm Maps, you have every possible combination of rhythmic patterns in one 4/4 bar neatly organized and grouped together.<br><br>Take these musical examples: You make house music and want a steady Kick pattern. Why not just get that in one click? You want your chorus section to feature hi hats on the off-beats, just one click. You want some driving double-bass in your metal tune, one click.<br><br>The idea is simple: all these patterns exist in your music, you just haven\u2019t used them yet. But when you want to, they\u2019re always only one click away. What\u2019s more, when you\u2019ve created a beat, the Maps help to create slight variations very easily- it\u2019s all about how the patterns are organized in the wheel. So take a look around it, you\u2019ll notice that all the patterns are surrounded by similar patterns.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/268122/extras/barform-map.png?t=1447359708\" />","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/268122?t=1447359708","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/268122?t=1447359708","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/268122/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1447359708","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/268122/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1447359708","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BeatWeaver</h2>The BeatWeaver is a rhythm design tool.
