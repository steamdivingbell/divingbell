{"about_the_game":"The climate crisis is hitting humanity with increasing force - but now you're hitting back. Dodge, fight, and level up, and live to see another day. Utilize the full arsenal humanity has at its disposal to show the endless swarm of natural hazards who's boss.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClimate Survivors is an action-heavy arena survival game. Until the timer hits the year 2100, hordes of monsters - symbolizing climate hazards like droughts and floods - spawn and try to attack you. The higher the carbon counter and resulting global heating grow, the more vicious the monsters and their attacks will become. You defend yourself by dodging and automatically firing back at them - first with a simple starting weapon, but you can upgrade your arsenal with every level-up.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven more, through your choices, you can affect carbon levels and dynamically change the challenge of the game and the future of the world. Discover all the options we have at our disposal to tackle the climate crisis. From low-carbon energy to sustainable food and even whale poop. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a first concept demo that will steadily be developed further and receive new content (like the not yet included whales). This is a very early stage of what we will deliver as full game, but we want to be open to interested players as soon as possible to engage with you and the ideas you may have. So, let us know what you think, what's missing and what cool ideas you might have.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd in case you're wondering: We use the terms climate crisis and global heating instead of climate change and global warming, as they more accurately capture the severity of the situation.","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3081190/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727026014","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3081190/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727026014","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The climate crisis is hitting humanity with increasing force - but now you're hitting back.
