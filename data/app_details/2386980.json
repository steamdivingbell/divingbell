{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If you are looking for a fun and easy way to create amazing 3D art, you should check out Curvy 3D 5, the latest version of the popular sculpting program for Windows. Curvy 3D 5 lets you unleash your creativity and turn your sketches into stunning 3D models in minutes. Here are some of the awesome features that make Curvy 3D 5 the best choice for beginners and professionals alike: </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u2022 <strong>Drawing is Fast</strong>: Forget about complicated tools and menus. With Curvy 3D 5, you can draw shapes directly in 3D space and see them come to life instantly. You can refine your models by adding more strokes, or use the powerful merge and boolean tools to combine and cut shapes. You will be amazed by how fast and easy it is to create complex and organic models with Curvy 3D 5. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u2022 <strong>Painting is Easy</strong>: Curvy 3D 5 gives you the freedom to paint your models with vibrant colours and textures. You can sketch and paint directly on the surface of your models, adding details and effects with a variety of brushes. You can also import images and use them to sculpt your models with the innovative image inflate tool. Whether you want to create realistic or stylized models, Curvy 3D 5 has everything you need to make your models look amazing. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong> Sketch based modelling</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u2022 With Curvy 3D 5, you don't need to worry about polygons or vertices. You can simply draw an outline and watch it transform into a smooth and round 3D model. You can then draw more outlines to adjust the shape and add features to your model.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Volumetric Merge</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u2022 One of the coolest features of Curvy 3D 5 is the ability to merge separate shapes into a seamless skin. This way, you can create complex models from simple parts, or add details like ears, horns, or spikes to your models. You can also use the boolean tools to cut holes or carve patterns into your models. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Sculpting by Painting</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u2022 Curvy 3D 5 lets you sculpt your models by painting on them with different brushes. You can create bumps, grooves, wrinkles, or scales on your models by simply dragging your mouse over them. You can also smooth, pinch, inflate, or flatten your models with ease. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Easy Curve and Mesh editing</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u2022 If you want to tweak your models further, you can use the soft move tools to shape curves and meshes by dragging them with your mouse. You can also rotate, scale, or bend your models to achieve the desired pose or expression. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Image Based Sculpting</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u2022 A unique feature of Curvy 3D 5 is the image inflate tool, which lets you create 3D models from images. You can import any silhouette or greyscale image and use it to sculpt your model with different styles. For example, you can create armour pieces from images using the heightmap, bubble, bevel, or extrude styles. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Adaptive Subdivision Sculpting</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u2022 Curvy 3D 5 automatically subdivides your meshes as you sculpt them, adding more detail where you need it and keeping the overall triangle count low. This way, you can create high resolution models without sacrificing performance or quality. You can also simplify your meshes if you want to reduce the polygon count. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Speed Sculpting</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u2022 If you want to create a quick basemesh for sculpting, you can use the draw lathe tool to draw a profile and turn it into a 3D shape. Then you can use the quick merge all tool to fuse all the shapes into a smooth skin ready for sculpting. This is a great way to create organic models like animals or humans in a matter of minutes. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Exporting</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u2022 Once you are happy with your model, you can export it to OBJ format and use it in other software for animation or rendering. Curvy 3D 5 supports UV mapping and texture baking, so you can preserve all the colours and details of your model.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Curvy 3D 5 is a powerful and intuitive sculpting program that will help you create amazing 3D art in no time. Whether you are a hobbyist or a professional artist, you will love using Curvy 3D 5 for your projects.
