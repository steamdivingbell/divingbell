{"about_the_game":"Unsure is an immersive, first-person, asymmetric horror game where players take on the role of cult survivor or demon. Four to six survivors, trapped in an abandoned asylum by a satanic cult, have been offered as sacrifices, and the demon must be sated. Once the cultists have summoned their demon, one of the game\u2019s many possible killers, the hunt begins. To escape, survivors must evade the demon while searching the labyrinthine asylum for one of the hidden keys that will unlock an exit. For each survivor, there is one key and one exit. Upon finding a key, survivors must determine which one of the doors the key unlocks. When a survivor escapes, that exit is permanently locked behind them. The trick? One of the hidden keys is faulty, meaning that in each game, at least one door will not open, and at least one survivor will be sacrificed.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2207920?t=1671935218","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2207920/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1671935218","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2207920/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1671935218","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2207920/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1671935218","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Game has horror elements, including jumpscares, blood, and gore"},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Unsure is an immersive, first-person, asymmetric horror game where players take on the role of cult survivor or demon.
