{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> This is a shooting game from the perspective of God. There are three differences from traditional 2D games: </h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 1. In this game, there is a setting for half height cover. This type of cover can be used to block enemy bullets when crouching behind it. But when I stand up, I can shoot my bullets from the direction of the cover. Because this is a 2D game, it is not possible to visually present the difference between a half height cover and a full height wall. However, the game allows players to easily understand whether they are facing a half height cover or a full height wall through a war fog. Or because this is a 2D game, it is impossible to show whether the character is in a standing or crouching state. The game has added a foot circle to remind the character to be in a crouching state.<br></li><li> 2. The health points in the game are always in an automatic recovery state. In this way, when you be hit, you only need to find a cover where you can dodge and stay for a while to see your health fully restored. Therefore, in this game, you cannot use the method of repeatedly consuming enemy health commonly used in battle royal games to kill enemies. The effective way to kill an enemy is to got an angle where there is no cover available and shoot the enemy at once, and you may need to cooperate with your teammates to achieve this.<br></li><li> 3. In this game, there is a function to push and aim the lens from a long distance, which means you can't see yourself on the screen. This feature makes it possible to sneak attacks from the enemy's side at a long distance. In order to cooperate with this system, one-direction radar is also provided in the game. The so-called one-direction radar refers to the radar that can only display enemies within a 120 degree angle of view in front of you, and other directions are blind spots. In this way, everyone in the game can use the enemy's blind spot for planned sneak attacks and movements.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> About gameplay: </h2>At present, the game only implements a melee map, where all players engage in their own battles in one scene without a team. In the scene, there is a nuclear bomb room. When players enter and activate a nuclear explosion, they will kill everyone outside the nuclear bomb room in 2 minutes, and will also receive killing points corresponding to the number of people killed.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Regarding the ultimate production goal of the game: </h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 1. The game will create a single player game mode to teach players to use the actions and weapons in the game.<br></li><li> 2. The game will also create a multiplayer sandbox survival mode, in which each player has their own camp and can go out to explore and collect materials to build their own camp. The world map is randomly generated and changes every few weeks. The camps established by players themselves also have the opportunity to appear as duplicate on the world map.<br></li><li> 3. Interaction between players and other campsites. Players can use the money in the game to make payments and use various facilities in others' camps. Players can also post missions to other players in their own campsite tavern.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Characteristics of the game: </h2>No level up, no upgrade system for attacking monsters, no synthesis system.<br>Because the author himself does not play the game of fighting monsters and upgrading, and the ultimate goal of this game is to allow the author to explore and adventure in an unknown world, there will not be anything in the system that requires a lot of learning costs to understand.<br>In order to allow the author to explore the unknown, the terrain and towns in the system are randomly arranged and combined using player built campsites.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1924670/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1723719904","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1924670/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1723719904","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1924670/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1723719904","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1924670/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1723719904","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> This is a shooting game from the perspective of God.
