In retaliation, Ixona placed a curse on the ancestor. Whenever twins were born into his family line, one would grow up to be good while the other would become evil.<br><br>At present, the protagonist learns that his twin brother, Alex, is going to suffer the curse. Boris, their uncle has died and left them with his Waxworks, as well a crystal ball, through which his spirit communicates with his nephew; the protagonist learns that he must rid the family of Ixona's curse to save Alex. He must use the Waxworks to travel through four locations in different time periods: Ancient Egypt, a zombie-infested cemetery, Victorian era London and a mine overrun with plant-like mutants. Within each location, he is to defeat his evil twin who takes the shape of a villain.<br><br>Eventually, the protagonist learns that the only way to break the curse is to prevent it from being cast in the first place. After defeating the evil twin four times, the protagonist is given four artifacts: the High Priest's amulet, the Necromancer's ring, Jack the Ripper's knife, and a vial of the Plant Monster's poison; the final level is unlocked, and takes the protagonist back in time to confront Ixona. Following Boris' instructions, the protagonist uses the artifacts to kill Ixona before she can place the curse; as a result, the curse is erased from existence for every afflicted generation of the protagonist's family line.<br><br>After the curse is undone, the protagonist finds Alex unconscious in a corner of the Waxworks and revives him. Upon waking, Alex recalls a strange dream he had, in which he witnessed Ixona's death. However, in the dream, right before she died, Ixona muttered another curse which transformed the protagonist into a demon; the dream's meaning is never made clear, possibly hinting at a potential sequel. The game ends with the brothers leaving the museum.<br><br><strong>THE PRESENT AND TIME TRAVELLING</strong><br>The game is divided into five different time periods: The present in 1980, Ancient Egyptian, Medieval Transylvania, Victorian England and Industrial Mine.<br><br>In each time period, the player needs to collect items, solve puzzles, avoid deadly encounters and engage in combat with various opponents. In times of need, the Player may turn to Uncle Boris' crystal ball for help. The main objective is to defeat the four evil twins and collect their special items in order to undo the family curse.\u00a0<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/788670/extras/Wx_exhibit.jpg?t=1645366675\" /><br><strong>THE FOUR ERAS OF WAXWORKS</strong><br>Uncle Boris had built a Waxworks with recreations of some of history's most fiendish murderers and monsters. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/788670/extras/EgyptTab.jpg?t=1645366675\" /><br><strong>The Egypt - 3100BC</strong><br>You will journey to the mysterious land of the Pharaohs to explore the Great Pyramid where you must defeat the vicious High Priest in order to rescue a beautiful princess. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/788670/extras/DraculaTab.jpg?t=1645366675\" /><br><strong>The Graveyard - 1454</strong><br>You will enter an unworldly graveyard in Romania to confront and vanquish the evil Necromancer and his rotting, mindless horde of zombies.\u00a0<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/788670/extras/RipperTab.jpg?t=1645366675\" /><br><strong>The London - 1888</strong><br>You will have to tread the dark, menacing streets of 1888 London to confront the murderer, who solicits the call girls of Whitechapel St. and brutally murders and mutilates them.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/788670/extras/MineTab.jpg?t=1645366675\" /><br><strong>The Mine - 1934</strong><br>You will descend into a treacherous iron mine to battle a huge mutant plant with an insatiable appetite for human flesh.
