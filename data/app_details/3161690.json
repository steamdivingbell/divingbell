{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DESCRIPTION</h2>In The Grove, you play as Stewart, a seasoned outdoorsman who can never seem to quench his desire for exploration. One day, he decides to go on a camping trip in a large forest, dense with trees and wildlife. This area appeared to be kind of dead and desolate, but he figured it would suffice. He finds a small clearing and sets up camp for the night. Stewart begins to notice odd feelings of unrest and starts hearing random sounds of leaves rustling nearby. He would randomly see movement from the corner of his eye or far off in the distance. Stewart decided to venture out from his campsite to investigate.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FEATURES</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A dark, immersive atmosphere that will transport the player right into the shoes of the protagonist</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A rich, detailed world with plenty for the player to discover and explore</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>An environment that will constantly keep the player on their toes</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A masterfully made soundtrack that will further immerse the player into the world</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Extensive lore that continues to reveal itself through discoveries that the player makes</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Intense puzzle-like sequences that require the player to think on their feet</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Multiple unique endings based on the player's decisions</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3161690/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737852399","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3161690/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1737852399","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3161690/844ae7af303ae09befed3738073f04ffcae74289/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737852399","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3161690/844ae7af303ae09befed3738073f04ffcae74289/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737852399","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"The Grove contains a moderate amount of blood and grisly imagery.
