The Nimble Sharpshooter DLC lets you expand your tank collection with an unusual hybrid of the engineering efforts of two nations: the M4A1 FL 10, a Tier VI French medium tank. The blend of a French AMX 13-series turret on an American M4-series hull results in a maneuverable and fairly mobile vehicle that is capable of delivering decent amounts of damage in no time thanks to its 4-round autoloader. However, its increased mobility inevitably results in less armor, so try to avoid direct combat as much as possible.  <br><br><strong>Firepower:</strong> The M4A1 FL 10 can burst four shots in less than 6 seconds, dealing 135 average damage per shot, which means 540 damage per full clip. With decent penetration, these snappy shots can be very dangerous for any unfortunate enemy that gets caught in the reticle. Adding good aiming time and a fast shell speed results in a potent support vehicle that is able to support allies by quickly unloading the magazine and moving on to another engagement.<br><br><strong>Speed and Protection:</strong> The huge and powerful engine inside the tank gives it reasonable agility, but at the same time, requires a bigger hull to carry it. In the case of the M4A1 FL 10, good maneuverability doesn\u2019t come together with great concealment values, as the overall size of the tank is quite large. This means that you will be a bigger target, so use your mobility to your advantage and don\u2019t let enemies line you up for the perfect shot. With excellent traverse speeds, you can also expect to out-turn many vehicles, which makes circling and destroying lone unsupported enemies a viable tactic.<br><br>The M4A1 FL 10 can be especially menacing toward the end of the battle, when all enemy vehicles have already taken some damage and don\u2019t have a lot of HP to spare. The ability to flank the enemy, quickly snap four shots, and reposition for the next attack can be devastating for the enemy team.<br><br>The tank comes with a 100% trained crew and a commander with Sixth Sense, as well as some additional treats\u2014projection decals to decorate your vehicles for Christmas, the Winter Wonderland 2020 2D style and two unique crew members, Ada Sugimura and Elsa Andersen, each with Brothers in Arms as a zero perk and enough XP for one extra skill of your choice.
