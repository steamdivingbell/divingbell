{"about_the_game":"Many many years into the future, humanity has created and used warp drives. However, due to the recency of the technology, it still has many flaws. You are equipped with experimental engines and a warp drive, and you are tasked with finding the wreck of the EV Triumph, a large exploratory ship which lost contact on its journey through deep space. The reason was unknown, but you suffer the same fate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBrace for a journey into the unknown. Explore a massive wreck and salvage materials to get out of your time-limited survival situation as quickly as possible. Every decision you make could mean the difference between life and death: Resourcefulness and strategy will be tested as you scavenge for supplies, and your ever decreasing oxygen levels keep you on your toes.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Escape","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2528640/7d0ab0ece8f59741460a1fcf96c2e81b45fc6dc5.jpg"},{"name":"The End of Everything","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2528640/16ebfe8e07812db4a2b3572e81d75d5e37fe5c9a.jpg"},{"name":"Last Breath","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2528640/392a06b3c813e0e705fc96d8a70d9f03371a4d23.jpg"},{"name":"Collector","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2528640/8a00748820f9d2f6d7efe70b10ecfe6873601149.jpg"},{"name":"Rescue","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2528640/127f5675af7d0c450b32446644c1beab5e83e112.jpg"}],"total":5},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2528640/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1717504912","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2528640/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1717504912","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2528640/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1717504912","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2528640/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1717504912","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Many many years into the future, humanity has created and used warp drives.
