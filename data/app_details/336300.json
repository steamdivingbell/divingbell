{"about_the_game":"Hearthlands is a medieval/fantasy city-building real time strategy game in which you take a role of a king in a procedurally generated world. You can not control your subjects directly; instead you focus on city-building, resource management, diplomacy, heroes, magic and other things a <br>typical king deals with on a daily basis.<br>The game is very flexible: you can build up a powerful realm and rule the lands with an iron grip, or establish a humble fishermen village. Or create a trading empire. Or found a small, but well-defended outpost or raider's camp. Or become a host of a wizard's manor.<br>All characters, from a hauler to a hero have their own minds and behavior patterns.
