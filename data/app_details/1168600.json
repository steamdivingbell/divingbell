Challenging for die-hards with the deep weapon mechanics, time-based medal system and unlockable secrets.<br><br>The perfect game to play for a few minutes to kill some time, as well as to make it through the entire night again because you want that gold medal, break that record or achieve that highest rank.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2><br>Since the day she was built everyone knew that one day she would be capable of great things. Her talent and drive earned her respect and admiration from both people, aliens and robots, young and old. Despite her undeniable specialness, she always remained modest and friendly.
