{"about_the_game":"Impromptu Trip is a relaxing casual game. It is a role-playing game with a top-down perspective. In the game, you will play a girl who is tired of urban working life and suffers from long-term stress. You take an unexpected trip decisively. You come to a small island with beautiful scenery, enjoy a different life on the island, and make friends with different characters.<br />\r\nOn the island, you can experience many different extreme activities, such as bungee jumping, rock climbing, and downhill biking. You can also try to complete various tasks of the island residents to obtain rewards and unlock more stories.<br />\r\nThe whole game has no clear main line. It is a very casual RPG game. It is more like a large summer theme park. All you need to do is to find all kinds of fun things on the island, and then find the content you like and go there. Experience these contents, I hope you can relax and have a pleasant experience in the game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2196840/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1705240895","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2196840/page.bg.jpg?t=1705240895","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2196840/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1705240895","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2196840/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1705240895","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Impromptu Trip is a relaxing casual game.
