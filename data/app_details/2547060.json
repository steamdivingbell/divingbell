{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Legend of Ghost Mountain</h2>  Has options for creating heroes, a history and gazetteer of the Central Empire, the <br> Face the Inevitable Plot Point campaign, Savage Tales, and a bestiary of various foes. <br> Ghost Mountain is a sacred site containing a physical gate to the underworld, and the Ghost Wardens who reside there are dedicated to making sure the souls of the dead pass peacefully through to the afterlife. But something has gone wrong. The dead rebel in unprecedented numbers and commit atrocities against the living. Only the Ghost Wardens can set things right. This is the story of those heroes as their trials and deeds become legend. <br> The Ghost Wardens draw magical power from strong emotions. Rage. Fear. Joy. Disgust. Sorrow. Only a handful of candidates pass the harrowing trials to harness these emotions--a process that turns their hair white. Those who succeed are privy to mystical martial arts techniques. Here the styles aren't based on the movements of animals but the feelings that drive human triumphs and tragedies. <br> <br> Legend of Ghost Mountain includes a ten-chapter Plot Point Campaign. Plot Points provide a structure for Game Masters to tell big stories but leave room for individual adventures (Savage Tales or your own custom creations) between the major beats. The players must make world-changing decisions and lead the battle against a literal army of the rebellious dead. In <br> Face the Inevitable , the Ghost Wardens are tasked with finding a magic mirror some say will reveal why wailing ghosts and savage demons suddenly ravage the land. It's up to the heroes to investigate these horrific incursions, battling bandits, monsters, and strange forces along the way. Eventually, they're thrust into the far more savage world of Imperial politics-and must either earn the Emperor's support...or replace him! The action culminates in a trip into the netherworld itself, where the Ghost Wardens must face their most terrifying foes yet to save the Empire! <br>  &quot;","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2547060/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1691547835","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2547060/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1691547835","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2547060/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1691547835","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2547060/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1691547835","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Legend of Ghost Mountain</h2>  Has options for creating heroes, a history and gazetteer of the Central Empire, the <br> Face the Inevitable Plot Point campaign, Savage Tales, and a bestiary of various foes. <br> Ghost Mountain is a sacred site containing a physical gate to the underworld, and the Ghost Wardens who reside there are dedicated to making sure the souls of the dead pass peacefully through to the afterlife.
