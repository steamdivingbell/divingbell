{"about_the_game":"**This current version is for an exhibition at Denny Dimin gallery in New York from May 23-June 30, 2019**<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis software is morphable to what you want it to be. It can be a small database of games, a downloadable art show, a simulation, a moving painting, an album, an existential crisis, a talisman, a play, a meditation, a spell, a forest, a distopian nightmare, a joke. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe amount of interaction and exploration is not a ton. If you explore and play through everything it would take maybe an hour or so at most. <br />\r\n-There are small games and walking sims to play on machines in abandoned buildings.<br />\r\n-You can chat with other players in the multiplayer mode and see if they are human or machine<br />\r\n-There is a band and a small secret lair<br />\r\n-There is no beginning or end<br />\r\n-There is no winning or losing<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd there is an infinite, dramatic cycle of accumulation and destruction: <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHit the number 3 key. You can choose the perspective of 3 NPC actors or a stage overview. They are acting out an absurdist play. They are the sole survivors of a human apocalypse. They are trying to procreate to start civilization over again but they\u2019re having a hard time. They are sending emails to nowhere, gossiping, meditating, taking naps, cleaning up. They\u2019re collecting artifacts around the stage and building a machine. When the machine is done it generates an AI and then blows up. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo see what the NPCs do you can leave the simulation on at a party, in a room while you are doing other things, etc. It could run for many hours and you will see, read and hear different things. <br />\r\nIf you have a few computers you can link them up and see different perspectives at once. With multiple channels of the atmospheric sounds it becomes a sort of instrument or generative album as well. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore you download, I encourage you to download the 100+ page manual which I am giving away for free. Click the \u201cView the manual\u201d on the right hand side of this page and download it. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMusic by:<br />\r\nGlamour Lakes - glamourlakes.bandcamp.com<br />\r\nX-Coast - soundcloud.com/x-coast<br />\r\nRipCD - ripcd.bandcamp.com<br />\r\n<br />\r\n******************<br />\r\n-This is not for everyone. If you\u2019re looking for some fun, addicting type game with slick mechanics do not download this.<br />\r\n-Play in single player mode, start a server or join a server. LAN works but usually from the .exe directly rather than from the app inside Steam.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Shooter","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/789380/9ad0b32065fe536cedf0d869f74d92f3e6bcd07c.jpg"},{"name":"Secret Lair","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/789380/3651f5752067d7f11c2b33fad646349183fc67f1.jpg"},{"name":"Two Hours","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/789380/7c3243bd52230a9a14f7d952b7df1b6e2ef1d86f.jpg"},{"name":"Stacked City","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/789380/8c66eeef407b90cbe67814cbcb0cb74241b1d2a5.jpg"}],"total":4},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/789380/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1667026592","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/789380/page.bg.jpg?t=1667026592","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/789380/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1667026592","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/789380/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1667026592","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"There is some language that might be offensive.
