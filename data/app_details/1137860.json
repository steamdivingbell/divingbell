This wouldn\u2019t be so bad, except for one crucial detail: the tower is burning. That means you\u2019ll have to jump, glide, and dash your way past hungry ghosts, hungrier spiders, flying bombs, perilous traps, and more to avoid getting roasted by the encroaching wall of fire! Legend also tells of larger, more dangerous beasts lurking within the tower\u2019s innumerable floors, so stay on your guard\u2026<br>You won\u2019t have to rely on your wits and feathers alone, though: magic potions have been left strewn about the tower, and drinking them will grant you wondrous powers, such as fiery breath, lightning blasts, or even invincibility! The monsters who inhabit the tower have a strange fondness for bottles, so you\u2019ll have to fight for them, but the struggle is well worth it. Then, if your goose ever gets cooked, you can keep track of your furthest distances on the leaderboard and try to outlast your past self, or even compete with your friends! How far can you make it? How tall is this tower? Will it ever end? What\u2019s an ordinary chicken doing in a place like this? Who knows?!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1137860/extras/Aboutdevelopment.png?t=1670243812\" /><br><br>This game was developed as a student project at DigiPen Institute of Technology and was created for educational purposes only.
