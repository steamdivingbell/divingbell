{"about_the_game":"The film noir stealth game. Calvino Noir is the exploratory, sneaking adventure through the 1930s European criminal underworld. Architecture meets Noir as you become unwillingly entangled in a revolutionist plot. Sneak through sewers, across rooftops, and past guards in this dark and mysterious journey. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay as a disparate group of low-lifes, loners and last-chancers as they fight for the future of a city sliding slowly into the gutter. The characters of Calvino Noir exist in a moral universe which knows only shades of grey. Some are broken souls, some are merely damaged - but all are fighting to forge a future in an ugly world ruled by those whose hearts are cruel and dark.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough inspired by the futuristic dystopian visions of Deus Ex and Blade Runner, Calvino Noir is a throwback to an era that could easily be from Earth's past. The game is heavily noir influenced, but at the same time progressive, reflecting a somewhat modernist take on the classic genre.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCalvino Noir:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Seven levels splits across three acts<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Fully voiced rich and immersive narrative<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Stunning visual style inspired by classic film noir cinema<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Explore a richly detailed and atmospheric world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Co-ordinate multiple unique characters with a range of skills<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Use stealth or brute force to face those that stand in your way.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Handled Like A True Scrambler","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/316890/b53cf14928f29d89d2349c4f1d87222484c56db4.jpg"},{"name":"A Long Night Ahead","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/316890/0671308f05a2400a52e99f8888daf449364bc50c.jpg"},{"name":"Unbroken Stillness","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/316890/740e6f9769771b981f96da0060ad480ce6901dd6.jpg"},{"name":"Repairman","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/316890/13d0ab807c468a1a40a342cabb1b6ffafdf230a9.jpg"},{"name":"Cornered","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/316890/11f002a767a14786309a1bf7a39bb7fc2d3812ad.jpg"},{"name":"Dishonest work For Dishonest Pay","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/316890/015c532112e4831653fd163b10e3a2ecc0a42192.jpg"},{"name":"Parting Ways","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/316890/c86d4f4cf1430d5068a4178a7b10936bdaff0643.jpg"},{"name":"Sabotage","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/316890/c31fca379a760f4091a44df3e740a393b7fe6446.jpg"},{"name":"Take A Bow","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/316890/bde21fb2b60a660d2d58892e2068250655201322.jpg"},{"name":"Calvino Noir","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/316890/1b597c526d92de730ad78cc1c6b487441b4c0e64.jpg"}],"total":40},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/316890?t=1627575969","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/316890?t=1627575969","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/316890/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1627575969","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/316890/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1627575969","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"The film noir stealth game.
