Each Dragon has a special ability called Dragon Rage, as well as having a dedicated Dragon deck. Each Deck consists of 56 cards featuring new Events, Enemies, Strangers, Objects, Followers and Places. Dragon cards run the risk of a character encountering a stronger than normal enemy, but the rewards you may gain are also of greater value.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dragon Tokens, Sleep Tokens &amp; Crown Token</h2>At the start of each of their turns, a player will draw a Dragon token at random. Dragon tokens are split into Special Effects and Dragon Scales.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Special Effects:</h2><strong>Dragon Strike:</strong> The player who draws the Dragon Strike token will draw two additional dragon tokens and resolve them in the order they are drawn.  <br><br><strong>Dragon Slumber:</strong> The character who draws the Dragon Slumber token places a sleep token on a Dragon of their choice on the board in any region. If there are no Dragons on the board the token may be placed on any enemy on the board.<br><br><strong>Dragon Rage:</strong> Dragon Rage is encountered when a player draws a Dragon Rage token on their turn.

When a Dragon becomes the King, one of its Tokens is placed onto the Space the character that drew the token is on. The other two tokens are discarded. Play continues as such and the Dragon King will change frequently. <br><br>Dragon Scales can be claimed by characters if they defeat an enemy dragon. Claiming dragon scales offers characters two powerful effects:<br>If a character encounters an Enemy or Draconic Lord, each dragon scale the character has that matches his opponent adds one point to his attack score.<br>If a character is about to suffer Dragon Rage they may discard one dragon token that matched the Dragon Lords to cancel the effects.<br><br>Once a player reaches the Crown of Command, the Dragon King cannot change.
