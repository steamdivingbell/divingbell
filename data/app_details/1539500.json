{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Treasury of Winter</h2>Treasures to Warm a Hero's Heart!<br>The <i>Treasury of Winter</i> brings you three dozen magical items ideal for any 5th Edition campaign but especially suited to adventures into the icy lands of the north, where frozen fey and winter witches rule a cold-hearted kingdom and seek to spread their wintry reach across this world and beyond. Even beyond the general themes of frost and fey, these treasures draw upon Russian myth, legend, and folk traditions, with a dash of technomagical toys and terrors too! This tome contains treasures of great value to those braving the long cold polar night, like the <i> radiant censer, foxfire stole, hoarfrost halter,</i> and <i> sledge of the great bear,</i> as well as those who exult in wielding the fury of the fantastic frost for themselves, like the <i> diamondice dagger, blizzard bottle,</i> and <i> hoarfrost halter</i> . You will find items that draw deeply upon Slavic folklore, like the <i> servant samovar, gorynych scale, bogatyr blade,</i> and <i> icon of timeless faith</i> , alongside the curiously modern trappings where magic and the marvels of the modern age intersect, like the <i> wire tangler, phosgene flail, invader's bugle,</i> and <i> pelisse of the light brigade.</i> Even if your players just enjoy the wild whimsy of the winter wonderland, they will delight in treasures like the <i> feyfrost brush, dancing reed flute, snowstone scepter,</i> and many more they will find in the <i>Treasury of Winter</i> .
