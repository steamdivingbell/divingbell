{"about_the_game":"Some say that &quot;Cracked&quot; is too hard, that it's impossible to beat. Those are probably the same people who would say there's no way that some nerdy kid who was captain of the debate team and drove a Dodge Omni with 183,467 miles on the dash could ever outshine Johnny Redmond and his perfectly waxed cherry red C3 Corvette to become homecoming king on that cool October night in 1982.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey probably also claim that his slow dance with Jenny\u2014the head cheerleader, homecoming queen, and mayor\u2019s daughter\u2014never happened, and insist that it couldn\u2019t possibly have unfolded into a passionate night of romance and rebellion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey\u2019d probably also say crazy things like, &quot;James, please stop lying about what happened at homecoming; you're embarrassing yourself. We were all there. We know you had one sip of the punch then ran out to the dance floor and started wobbling around like an off-balance egg and yelling 'Someone must have spiked the punch; I'm usually never like this,' until eventually one of your wobbles went too wide and you accidentally smacked Jenny in the face. Then you curled up into a ball in the middle of the dance floor and started crying, begging Johnny not to hit you in retaliation. Nobody spiked the punch that night, James.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWell, maybe they were right about everything else, but not this time, not about &quot;Cracked.&quot; This time I'm the master of my own destiny and no egg's wobble will stop me.
