I'm EerieAdv, an indie developer. I'd like to introduce you to my game, SCP-087, a first-person horror game descending into the chilling abyss of a dark platform staircase where each step teeters on the brink of unimaginable dread! <br>Do you possess the courage and wits to navigate this authentic SCP atmosphere and withstand the bone-chilling nightmares that lie in wait?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What is the game about:</h2>Step into the shoes of an intrepid investigator from the SCP series!! You'll embark on an unknown platform for investigation, prepared for the horrors that lurk just beyond your sight. <br>SCP-087 descends at a fixed angle over 13 steps, shrouded in suffocating darkness where strange noises and odd items occasionally drop, unsettling even the most seasoned explorers.The air grows heavier with each step, and the oppressive silence is broken only by whispers of unknown terrors lurking in the shadows. Your senses must remain on high alert for unexpected jump scares and the sustained psychological tension that grips you relentlessly. <br><br><strong><i><u>WATCH OUT THERE!</u></i></strong> Mysterious creatures may cross your path; your best strategy is to evade or avoid them, as direct confrontation proves futile. <br><br><strong><i><u>EXPLORE IN DIM.</u></i></strong> Ensure you maintain a light source, as SCP-087 absorbs excess light, rendering sources brighter than 75 watts ineffective.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2>* Sustained and intense psychological tension.<br>* Unexpected jump scares.<br>* An authentic atmosphere of SCP.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3063220/extras/SCP-087-7.jpg?t=1735547078\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Designer's comment:</h2>This game isn't very big. When I first started to try to create a horror game, the inspiration of SCPs hit me. When I was a student, a friend told me the horror stories about SCP-087, pushed me to explore the stairwells of our school (luckily didn't find anything in the end :-)) Since then I got to learn and fall in love with the stories of the SCP Foundation. So with little hesitation I decided to use SCP-087 as my first horror title,  and had already started to visualize myself exploring it as a foundation staff member (so it had to be a first-person game). And of course, SCP-087-1 would definitely be in my game. You will see if you try it out ;-)<br><br>If it wasn't for a strong love for the idea, I probably never would have taken the step to develop a game independently. But if an indie developer is overwhelmed by passion, he will turn a deaf ear to outside feedback and needs and make a terrible game. That's why I need more feedback from you guys, please let me know if you have been impressed by the horrific atmosphere of SCP-087 in the game. Also leave a message if you have any suggestions pls! Tell me what I need to improve in my game, as I have plans to make subsequent horror games of other SCP-housed objects. If you guys have any other SCP shelter objects that you wish to experience, let me know as well. PS: I'm personally interested in SCP-096 and SCP-002, but I'm more interested in knowing if you guys have any more recommended shelter objects.<br><br>The game will release in July 2024. If you're interested in it, please consider wishlisting SCP-087 on Steam! I'd truly appreciate it and it really helps. <br>Thank you for your attention:-)  Hope you enjoy the game!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Join Discord:</h2>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3063220/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735547078","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3063220/page.bg.jpg?t=1735547078","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3063220/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735547078","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3063220/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735547078","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence or Gore, General Mature Content."},"detailed_description":"This game is created by <i>@<u>EerieAdv</u></i> with YAHAHA Horror Game Kit and YAHAHA is assisting the creator with packaging and publishing the game based on their request.
