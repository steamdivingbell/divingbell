It\u2019s a casual and chill sandbox experience for players of all ages who want to care for their very own virtual pets in a surprising, unique, and stress-free environment. The dogs start out relatively normal, but mutate and behave in surprising ways as the game progresses and their evolutionary lines advance.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1424330/extras/fly_steam.gif?t=1729780562\" /><br><br>Dogs have highly variable bodies controlled by a simulated genetics system.

As you play, you'll gain access to more and more objects and decorations. String together rooms and decorate them however you\u2019d like.
