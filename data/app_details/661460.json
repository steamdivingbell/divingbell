{"about_the_game":"Thin Judgment sets you in front of a conveyor belt. Many things appear on the line. Ranging from spare change and suspiciously clean food, to gold bars and sentient little-paper-people that have a tendency to explode.

If you have weak fingers, be warned.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Conveyor</h2><br>Earn your wage by collecting spare change or collecting paper people with your tube. Feel free to analyze and prejudice which paper people you collect, as each of them has their own social status and gender. There are over 50 different social statuses and text-based events may occur based on the balance/imbalance of roles and genders. There are some malicious roles as well, so be careful not to let destabilizing people join your perfect little-paper-society. Use money to purchase shipments of basic items.<br><br>Earn resources by collecting gold bars or letting the paper beings endure a slow and agonizing death in the furnace that\u2019s at the end of the conveyor belt. Letting paper people die doesn\u2019t have any considerable implication, but letting gold bars go into the furnace will make your employers very upset with you.
