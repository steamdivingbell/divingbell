{"about_the_game":"NOWGUN is a grid-based roguelite arena game where survival depends not just on combat but on how you use your limited movement. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the game:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWaves Aren\u2019t Just About Fighting: To clear each wave, you simply need to use up all your movement. Yes, you could survive just by running away from enemies, but don\u2019t expect to make it to the later waves that way!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFace the Enemies or Flee?: While fleeing can keep you alive for a while, eventually you\u2019ll need to confront your enemies and grow stronger. The deeper you go, the tougher they get.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTwo Ways to Attack: You have two options when it comes to attacking enemies \u2013 ranged or melee. Every attack happens after you\u2019ve made a move on the grid, whether it's yours or the enemy\u2019s.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRanged Attacks Cost Moves: Ranged attacks require your character to change positions, costing valuable moves. The more efficient you are with your moves, the more enemies you can take down in a wave. Efficiency is key!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPower Up with Each Wave: After each wave, you\u2019ll unlock a number of chests equal to the number of levels you\u2019ve skipped during that wave. Inside, you\u2019ll find powerful items that let you grow stronger for the battles ahead.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBonus Loot: Defeated enemies may drop chests with items that grant additional stats, making you even more formidable as you advance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Ultimate Goal: Push yourself to see how far you can go in the ever-toughening waves. How long can your enemies stand against you?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3165800/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726609382","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3165800/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1726609382","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3165800/a6273a9c749caf0abe68658b14b31c2229962ce9/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726609382","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3165800/a6273a9c749caf0abe68658b14b31c2229962ce9/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726609382","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"NOWGUN is a grid-based roguelite arena game where survival depends not just on combat but on how you use your limited movement.
