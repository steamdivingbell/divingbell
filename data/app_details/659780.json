Since then, the game added, quests, missions, abilities, level ups, enemies, and a whole story to go along with this simple puzzle idea, with it's unique art style, to help shine a new light on what was once dark. Without having done this, the game would be a small, unfulfilling project that really brought nothing to the table. This all wouldn't have been done if the community hadn't giving the game a chance.
