{"about_the_game":"Jack, a man of a mystery business, finds himself whisked away to a place that's simply out of this world - quite literally, as it's floating in a dazzling nebula. Confused and bewildered, he's left with no choice but to take things to new heights or forever be a Jack stuck in a box. As he climbs he obtains new abilities and meets some truly odd characters that change his life and his climbing game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChallenge is at the core of Axium's Box, drawing inspiration from titles such as &quot;Getting Over It&quot; and &quot;Jump King&quot; in a fully 3D environment with stunning, cinematic graphics. If you relish in a good dose of pain, frustration, and mind-bending obstacles with a constant stream of paradigm shifts, then this game is tailor-made for you.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game offers a unique and varied experience with the potential for anywhere from 4 to 40 hours of gameplay, depending on your level of skill. You'll experience a roller coaster of emotions, from triumphant cheers as you conquer difficult obstacles to despondent cries as you fall short and go tumbling down. It will be a true test of perseverance and determination.<br />\r\nAs such it is also sure to create some of your fondest memories and provide both, butt-clenching entertainment, and, heart-felt belly laughter, to any watchers. <br />\r\nAxium's Box will put your skills and willpower to the test, and I hope you have the time of your life playing it. Good luck, and have fun! - LordMaddog.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2338440/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1677597430","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2338440/page.bg.jpg?t=1677597430","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2338440/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1677597430","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2338440/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1677597430","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Jack, a man of a mystery business, finds himself whisked away to a place that's simply out of this world - quite literally, as it's floating in a dazzling nebula.
