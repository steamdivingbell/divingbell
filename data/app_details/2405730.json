{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">NMO is a thrilling multiplayer (3 to 6 players) game where one player, the impostor (Ox), lurks in the shadows to deceive and neutralize the Operators, while others take on the role of Operators, working independently or cooperatively to identify and eliminate the Ox hidden among them. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>=== Operators ===</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Embark on an adrenaline-pumping adventure within the winding corridors of the Ark, only to find yourselves trapped during a routine check!
