{"about_the_game":"This playable demo allows the player to create a game, select their party members' classes, names, and look (the love interest's class cannot be selected at start). The user can play through the first two scenes (the opening scene and in the Green Mountain Village including an optional side quest). A single playthrough of the demo takes about 30 to 45 minutes, but user can play through the demo multiple times with any classes they like to get a feel for what each class offers.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1998480/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1654151963","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1998480/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1654151963","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1998480/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1654151963","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1998480/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1654151963","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This playable demo allows the player to create a game, select their party members' classes, names, and look (the love interest's class cannot be selected at start).
