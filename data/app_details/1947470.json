The spread of severe rabies and sarcoptic mange necrotic in nature began to appear in the news. It quickly became apparent this new disease would massively impact society.  Rioting broke and paranoia of being infected spread like wildfire. In an attempt to contain the disease, severe government lockdowns were put in place which only fueled the fire resulting in civilians turning against each other sparking global civil wars.  The pandemic continued to spread and nations turned on each other in an attempt to find the origin of the virus.  Neighbors turned on neighbors, family on family.
