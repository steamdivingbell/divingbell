{"about_the_game":"<i>Traveling through the desolate wastes you approach the mining colony. You hear nothing, but a funny feeling creeps down your back. Like you are being watched. Turning a corner, you find the corpses of some of the unfortunate inhabitants of the colony. One of them has an odd, scaly mask glued to his face. When you touch it, it starts to move and vanishes quickly in a dark corner.<br><br>Now you know what happened here... Creeps! That leaves you no choice, really. You will have to find them all, and kill them. Because you cannot allow even one of them to live and escape!<br><br>Now go, and be a hero!</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">An action-packed DLC</h2>In The Ripley Run only your number of kills count. Face off hordes of Creeps with your repeater crossbow, a Ring of Detect Life, and a stack of explosive potions. Kill the Visitor Queen to finish the run and double your kills. <br><br>The real challenge of the Ripley Run is to carefully manage your resources and learn where to look for more in the overrun mining colony. Unlock several achievements to improve your character from the start and you just might set a really high score.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/639030/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1568472047","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/639030/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1568472047","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/639030/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1568472047","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/639030/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1568472047","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<i>Traveling through the desolate wastes you approach the mining colony.
