{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>If you ever loved the GB version of <i>Pok\u00e9mon</i>, <i>Nobunyaga's Ambition</i>, <i>Sangokushi Taisen</i>, or <i>Onimusha Soul</i>, then you definitely can't miss this game!</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game adopts the classic <i>Pok\u00e9mon</i> top-down pixel style with four-directional movement, offering a nostalgic gameplay experience. The hero training system is inspired by <i>Nobunyaga's Ambition</i>, featuring five-stage leveling, skill inheritance, and enhancement mechanisms. The battle system focuses on the dual-city siege combat of <i>Sangokushi Taisen</i>, with the addition of ultimate skill triggers to make every battle unpredictable. Meanwhile, <i>Onimusha Soul</i>'s high degree of freedom in city building and resource management provides players with limitless creative possibilities. As the game evolves with the times, although some elements may differ, the essence and core excitement of these classics remain faithfully preserved.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In this world that blends the Three Kingdoms and Sengoku eras, recruit your loyal companions, build an unbeatable faction, and rise to become a legendary ruler!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game content</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Recruit your favorite heroes</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3257720/extras/\u62db\u52df\u82f1\u96c4.png?t=1728358582\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Build your own territory</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3257720/extras/\u5efa\u8a2d\u9818\u5730.png?t=1728358582\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Organize your own team</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3257720/extras/\u7d44\u7e54\u90e8\u968a.png?t=1728358582\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Conquer cities in other territories</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3257720/extras/\u653b\u514b\u57ce\u6c60.png?t=1728358582\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Get more resources and explore more of this world.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3257720/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728358582","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3257720/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1728358582","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3257720/a4ff48ab88351c5c57a2f21e8c376f937062d6dc/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728358582","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3257720/a4ff48ab88351c5c57a2f21e8c376f937062d6dc/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728358582","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>If you ever loved the GB version of <i>Pok\u00e9mon</i>, <i>Nobunyaga's Ambition</i>, <i>Sangokushi Taisen</i>, or <i>Onimusha Soul</i>, then you definitely can't miss this game!</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game adopts the classic <i>Pok\u00e9mon</i> top-down pixel style with four-directional movement, offering a nostalgic gameplay experience.
