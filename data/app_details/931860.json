With the support of the local Maya population, Sydney Hunter must now find all seven pieces of the Haab calendar, defeat Kukulkan, and return peace and balance in the Maya civilization.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u2022\tPlay through a challenging single-player campaign inspired by Maya gods, culture, and history. <br />\r\n\u2022\tUnearth two different endings!<br />\r\n\u2022\tEnjoy 8-bit style graphics accompanied by an awesome chiptune soundtrack.<br />\r\n\u2022\tBattle against 13 powerful Maya gods and mini-bosses. <br />\r\n\u2022       Turn scan lines on/off feature.<br />\r\n\u2022\tCollect relics &amp; weapon upgrades to increase your chances of survival!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Everyone Gets a Trophy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/931860/77267dab56ad155a4f809528bfe5e15739e3a381.jpg"},{"name":"I am Batman","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/931860/1c9faafaf5b82f0b2ed943bd9a4b72dba984a887.jpg"},{"name":"Who you gonna call?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/931860/e699f0ba5dbdf8f29da6f4352410c0acd6ed1689.jpg"},{"name":"Weezing on your grindage","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/931860/5060fd64f0f3ce66d5446ba11b784779a6e40db4.jpg"},{"name":"It had to be snakes?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/931860/1a4ca2d8e99f5ef20ad7c62427b4e6f0824b112f.jpg"},{"name":"Jenny Jenny","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/931860/38bdd0c7620e042b7b2ae6eb261a29e3708eebc9.jpg"},{"name":"To Bee or not to Bee","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/931860/89347d4764f813512971ca16361b43e3bbd12c11.jpg"},{"name":"Blessed The Rains Down In Africa","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/931860/01b49f52189b245c02024aec03a1d2c03002967d.jpg"},{"name":"Meow Mix Meow Mix","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/931860/a558a254be664a88cb354e29adf6a92173d4f22e.jpg"},{"name":"Simon Belmont Would Be Proud","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/931860/6941c0bd9424b50d4b5a8b0412dc9d84cfea70ae.jpg"}],"total":29},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/931860?t=1667003402","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/931860/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1667003402","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/931860/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1667003402","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/931860/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1667003402","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Sydney Hunter and the Curse of the Mayan is a love-letter to 8-bit action adventure games with challenging platformer gameplay and a huge number of Maya-inspired bosses. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou play as Sydney Hunter, adventure supreme, who by sheer luck manages to get trapped inside a massive Maya pyramid.

If Shovel Knight was the Federico Fellini who brought us back to the 8-bit era making it so palatable to please modern palates, Sydney Hunter is the Martin Scorsese who shows it for what it really was.&quot; - <br>8/10 \u2013 icrewplay<br><br>\u201cThere isn\u2019t much here to complain about. What players get is a charming, funny, and challenging platform game that feels like a combination between an Indiana Jones like adventure mixed with elements of exploration and Mega Man like gameplay, minus the blaster. It\u2019s a title I absolutely loved digging into and I feel anyone that\u2019s a fan of retro games definitely deserves to check this one out.
