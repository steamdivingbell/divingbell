{"about_the_game":"Outfit, crew and command your submarine to save what's left of humanity beneath the seas of a ruined earth. Man your sub's systems and take aim in this real-time strategy epic! Inspired by FTL, this subnautic student project serves as our first 2-semester release. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Subtension, YOU get to man the helm and run your own submarine through missions in deep waters. Do you have what it takes? It won't be easy, as you come across all sorts of different problems requiring different solutions. Defeat enemy vessels and upgrade your sub. Your choices dictate your path in this story-focused experience with multiple endings. Will you be able to reach port? It's all up to what kind of captain you'll be. With this &quot;submarine simulation roguelike-like&quot;, you can do it all with your submarine and crew and you traverse the deep sea. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nKey Features:<br />\r\n- Ship Customization. Not every ship floats the same, and reflect your captain capabilities by designing a ship fit for the job!<br />\r\n- Over 20 fully unique ship systems<br />\r\n- A fully voice acted, deep engaging story with twists, turns, and surprises.<br />\r\n- Think you've figured it out? Try again with different choices to experience multiple endings to the story<br />\r\n- Fully integrated achievements<br />\r\n- Rich gameplay experience and atmosphere<br />\r\n- Steam remote cloud<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSubtension was created by 40 people across two teams at the University of Michigan's WolverineSoft Studio, a student games studio undertaking semester long projects. It is an educational case study of Subset Game's FTL: Faster Than Light, and takes inspiration from its game mechanics as well as other games in the genre. Work on this project took place between May and December 2022. This project represents the studio's first 2-semester long project, the prototype produced by the Summer team can be found here on our steam page.","achievements":{"total":0},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2251660/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1680021304","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2251660/page.bg.jpg?t=1680021304","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2251660/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1680021304","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2251660/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1680021304","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Outfit, crew and command your submarine to save what's left of humanity beneath the seas of a ruined earth.
