Access a variety of computer systems for personnel control, engineering repairs, tactical command, cargo manipulation, communications, navigation, power allocation etc. Repair and upgrade your ship systems with a detailed parts database containing dozens of components. Observe your crew as they move between decks or get stuck and take injury at locations with broken decks. Monitor their stats including artificial intelligence, fatigue, health and a variety of other attributes. Personnel move to a myriad of ship locations including their quarters, the galley, bridge, engineering etc. Watch your marines spring into action as they go in search of escaped prisoners or engage in combat with intruders that board your ship. Evacuate your personnel from decks that are subject to radiation due to reactor core breaches or quarantine your away teams that come back with infectious diseases. Clone dead officers from stored DNA signatures or hire marines and engineers at starstations. Stock up on rations or watch your personnel die of hunger. Assign your combat pilots to fighters or your marines to all terrain vehicles based on skill. With access to this complex ship, an awesome array of weaponry and a dedicated crew, the decisions you make can mean the difference between life and death as you assume full command control of your ship and crew.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PLAY IT YOUR WAY</h2><br>Most games lock you into a linear plot and if you manage to break free and finish the game, you have no choice but to shelve the game and go in search of another to fill the void. In this game you decide how you play, short term, long term or forever. The choice is yours and the variations are endless. With three unique modes of play, you can choose to either wander the universe as a Commander in Earth\u2019s galactic force, Galactic Command, carrying out your duty of maintaining law and order in allied territories or explore the vast reaches of space. You make your own rules but step out of line and face a court-martial or worse, make a bad decision and your crew die. Decide what you want to do, where you want to go and how you\u2019re going to carry out your goals. Do you invade a planet today or join an NPC controlled force as they attack an enemy station deep in hostile territory? Do you mine for valuable Iridium or do you destroy hostile assets for experience points that eventually lead to increase in the ranks? You can also join a campaign in the Advanced Campaign Mode scenario consisting of a series of missions that are directly affected by the ever changing universe. You can either follow the mission path or ignore orders and move on to the next task in the campaign. To get you going and hone your combat skills, enter Xtreme Carnage and take on space and planetary hostiles as you familiarize yourself with the operation of your fighters. The choice is yours, either way, one day, you\u2019re going to die. You may as well die with a medal and for a good cause.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1755420/extras/bc3k_tt_poster_616x868.jpg?t=1632255159\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1755420/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1632255159","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1755420/page.bg.jpg?t=1632255159","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1755420/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1632255159","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1755420/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1632255159","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1755420/extras/bc_compendium_616x192.jpg?t=1632255159\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE BATTLECRUISER SERIES</h2><br>In celebration of the 25 yr anniversary of the first release, this compendium contains all 4 games in the Battlecruiser 3000AD series which was first released in 1996. <br><br>Each game is based on the last patch released for it, and is preserved in its original format.
