{"about_the_game":"In the demo of Don\u2019t freak out you can only test the first level and do nothing with the coins yet. But in the full version the levels are designed extra hard and they get harder with each level. You can collect the coins that you can use in the in-game shop. The next levels are unlocked by completing the previous level or by purchasing the level for free with the coins you can collect in the level.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1735020/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1680283562","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1735020/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1680283562","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1735020/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1680283562","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1735020/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1680283562","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In the demo of Don\u2019t freak out you can only test the first level and do nothing with the coins yet.
