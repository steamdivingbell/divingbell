{"about_the_game":"As you come home from a long journey to see your son once more, you discover he is gone. A castle has been presumably summoned from thin air and it has a dark, gloomy presence to it. With this castle appearing, all the colours also disappeared, leaving everything looking lifeless. You hear a woman's voice in your head, beckoning you toward the castle. After grabbing your ancient shield and trusty boomerang you go towards an adventure that you simply don't know how will end. All you know is that you are going to save your son, no matter what it takes.<br><br><u><i>Gameplay:</i></u><br>The Search for a Colour Palette (TSFACP) has 7 levels in total, each ending with a boss at the end. Inspired by the classic Castlevania games from the 80's, you have to fight your way through monsters, unknown creatures, and beasts in order to get to your final destination: the castle. <br><br>At your disposal you have a boomerang that you can throw and also hover in the air with, knives you can pick up throughout the levels and throw at enemies for additional damage, and a holy shield with which you can block damage and jump on top of enemies. You also gain experience from killing enemies, making you even stronger...be careful not to kill too many though. Use all of these tools to your advantage, because there are some platforming challenges to be had in your adventure!<br><br><u><i>Credits:</i></u><br><strong>SeventyFour Productions</strong> - Programming, graphic design, spritework, cover art, mechanics<br><strong>Bro.
