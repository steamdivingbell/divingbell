Time to set up shop in an idyllic small town in a medieval land filled with fairy tale magic, Discworld-esque comedy, and pop-fantasy cliches. Start small, and grow your business as your fame reaches new customers. If you think running a store is easy and somewhat dull - think again! This is no mundane supermarket. This is an establishment of miracles and wonder! Fill your shelves with magical merchandise and adjust the prices for optimal profit, while making sure your quirky clientele can still afford it.

Master the alchemical arts and brew potions worth their weight in gold. Fill your grimoire with formulas for useful concoctions through research and experimentation. Each ingredient has its unique properties - mash them in the mortar, mix with water and spirits, boil them in your cauldron while stirring carefully. Your elixirs will make a good coin when sold in your shop, but there's even more money to be made on custom orders.

But they're even cheaper if you grow them yourself! Fill your backyard with plants and mushrooms that hold all sorts of arcane qualities - from relieving bad gas to unraveling the fabric of reality. Make sure to always keep some extra planters of all sizes if you come by a rare seed while browsing your suppliers wares. Do you have a green thumb?
