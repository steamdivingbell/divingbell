{"about_the_game":"Roboloop is a puzzle game where you program a loop of commands to help a pair of robots navigate a factory floor. Use logic, deduction and intuition to guide your robotic friends to victory! More specifically, you will program a series of up to six directional commands (up, down, right and left) that will repeat in a loop until both of the robots have reached the exit, one of the robots is destroyed by an environmental hazard, or the robots get stuck in an infinite loop. The core challenge is that the single command is shared by both robots, the \u201ccode\u201d you write needs to be robust enough that it will be able to guide both robots safely to the exit!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRoboloop is currently in development and is set to release Fall 2024. The release version of Roboloop will consist of:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Many different level types and hazards to challenge your Robot programming skills<br />\r\n-Over 100 different hand crafted levels<br />\r\n-An endless mode featuring an infinite number of procedurally generated puzzles","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2911010/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1712880136","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2911010/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1712880136","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2911010/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1712880136","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2911010/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1712880136","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":2911020,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Roboloop is a puzzle game where you program a loop of commands to help a pair of robots navigate a factory floor.
