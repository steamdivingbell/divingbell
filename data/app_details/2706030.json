{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Dungeon Twist</i> is a <strong>turn-based tactical game</strong> full of deep strategic choices and crazy twists (...pun intended).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Join a gang of filthy rogues and raid the Shifting Dungeon, finding your way across loot, dead ends, and pesky hazards. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Trick your opponents, grab the <strong>Treasure</strong>\u2026 and <strong>get out alive!</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Master the system in <strong>PvE matches</strong> and challenge your friends in <strong>free-for-all multiplayer raids</strong> for 2-5 players.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Build together!</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Use Tiles to build and twist the game map turn after turn. The whole Dungeon is at your disposal: open new paths for your character or wall up opponents according to your plan.

You can accumulate wealth by pillaging around and discovering Rooms, but most of all... you can just rob other players. Be careful though: the dungeon will crumble to the ground as soon as someone escapes with the Treasure, burying everyone still inside.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Choose your Rogue!</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each playable character can drastically change your approach to the raid, thanks to their unique skills and wacky personality.
