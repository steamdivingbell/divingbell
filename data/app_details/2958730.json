{"about_the_game":"Play as Arya: junker, ship jockey, and fighter. Lacking working thrusters, her ship is equipped with her latest contraption, the Rope Tool \u2014 a grappling hook and an industrial stapler bolted together.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHijinks ensue.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSwing through the corpse of an asteroid mining gold rush. Gather rockets from the rubble of all-consuming corporate rivalry to propel yourself to blinding speeds. Launch those rockets to take down abandoned drones or set off the industrial explosives left lying around. Everything in this physics-led zero-gravity world is an opportunity for chaos and speed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe forces you're up against are stronger than you, more advanced than you, richer than you. They will knock you down, knock everything you've scraped together right off of your ship. But they can't keep you down. You always come back.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2958730/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736364655","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2958730/page.bg.jpg?t=1736364655","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2958730/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736364655","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2958730/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736364655","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Play as Arya: junker, ship jockey, and fighter.
