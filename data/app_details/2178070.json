{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Decades after the Shimu people were forced to flee their homeland due to the invasion of a mysterious force known as the Withered, the Shimu have returned to reclaim their rightful home: the fantastical island of AGHASBA. As junior architect, it\u2019s your job to rebuild the villages of your once-mighty civilization as well as nurse Aghasba\u2019s once-thriving ecosystems back to life.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">EXPLORE THE ISLAND OF AGHASBA<br>Traverse varied terrain, scale colossal mountains and gaze out upon jaw-dropping vistas, all brought to life in a vibrant, high-fidelity art style. Befriend strange and memorable creatures, learn the storied history of the Shimu people and uncover the dark origins of the Withered.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">REBUILD THE SHIMU CIVILIZATION</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Build sprawling settlements and watch them come alive as they\u2019re inhabited by members of the Shimu tribe.

Craft weapons, armor and elixirs before venturing into the Withered Lands and battle bloodthirsty Withered monsters, gradually ridding the island of the Withered plague.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">INVITE FRIENDS TO YOUR ISLAND</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Once you build your villages and grow your ecosystems how you want, it\u2019s time to show them off!
