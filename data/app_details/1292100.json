Half an hour here, 10 minutes there...have a ponder and come back to it, sleep on it.  TraptionBakery is made to amuse, baffle, perplex and interest you for weeks.<br><strong>TOP TIP: move the levers <u>slowly</u>...and adjust your view to see anything the lever moves. </strong><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1292100/extras/traptionbakery_drawings_selection.jpg?t=1604503371\" /><br>When you're not in a puzzle solving mood just zoom-way-in, look around and marvel at all the crazy upcyclepunk things.
