In addition to being good at swords, the player's magician swordsman can unlock a variety of different skill growth routes, and Light Rogue Elements are integrated into the traditional ARPG gameplay. Different from the 2D shooting and horizontal action of the Rogue-Lite games, &quot;Mulite &quot; pays more attention to the collection of equipment and the planning of skill routes. In more and more random explorations, players can explore the unique game system and get rid of the fettering of evil forces.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Scenes</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1168800/extras/scene1.gif?t=1690651665\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1168800/extras/scene2.gif?t=1690651665\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1168800/extras/20191211144008.png?t=1690651665\" /><br><br>Elaborate pixel-style maps, different styles of scenes, each challenge is different.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Battle</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1168800/extras/magician.gif?t=1690651665\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1168800/extras/BladeStrom.gif?t=1690651665\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1168800/extras/meteorites.gif?t=1690651665\" /><br>The EA version has 70 skills and 7 talents, which can provide a refreshing and diverse combat experience.
