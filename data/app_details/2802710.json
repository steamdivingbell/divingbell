Secure your throne among the cosmos' architects. Or dare to go beyond, using your newly found wisdom to break the chains of reality and forge a new existence.  What the Four Sages are unaware of is your ability to perceive Cosmic Whispers: insights into the very essence of existence. The question remains: Can you decipher all of them by analyzing their patterns or unlocking their ciphers? The secrets they unfold could grant you powers surpassing the Sages themselves.
