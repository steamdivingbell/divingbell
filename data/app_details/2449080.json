It's a pleasure to meet you all here!<br>The initial inspiration for &quot;Tyrant's Endgame&quot; came from an indie game called &quot;Tiny Civilization&quot; on Steam. When I first played &quot;Tiny Civilization,&quot; it sparked a great sense of inspiration in me, and I immediately had the idea of creating a variation of the game. After careful consideration and deliberation, I decided to use 302 Studio's flagship IP, &quot; Dungeon No Dungeon,&quot; as a foundation and incorporate a series of original game mechanics revolving around auto-battle chess gameplay, drawing from the basic mechanics of &quot;Tiny Civilization.&quot; This idea was also recognized and supported by the developer of &quot;Tiny Civilization,&quot; Xiren.<br><br>Although the road ahead has been challenging, we have never regretted embarking on this journey. If a game isn't well-received, we'll use the experience gained from failure to make the next game better. As long as we can survive, we will do whatever it takes to persevere and eventually create a game that everyone will enjoy and appreciate. Please remember this sentiment, and I hope that ten years from now, we can meet again!<br><br>I would like to extend my advance wishes for the game's great success! <br>May you all have a joyful gaming experience!<br>Wanzi</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>&quot;Command a battle on the chessboard.
