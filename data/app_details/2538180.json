{"about_the_game":"<strong>\u201dArcade FC\u201d is an arcade soccer game with skill-based gameplay, fast-paced graphics, responsive controls, accurate ball physics and that retro vibe. </strong><br><br>As a modern \u201creboot\u201d of football games of the 80s and 90s, it offers the same addictive \u201ceasy to learn, hard to master\u201d gameplay, enhanced with accurate ball physics, retro-style, high-resolution graphics, powerful AI, and numerous match modes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Brilliant Ball Physics</h2><br>The game's advanced physics engine has been meticulously crafted to deliver a level of realism and fluidity that captures the essence of classic arcade soccer gameplay like never before. Countless hours of testing and fine-tuning have resulted in an experience that pays homage to classic arcade soccer titles while introducing new dimensions of realism and excitement.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Classic Arcade Gameplay</h2><br>Arcade FC brings back the beloved, easy-to-pick-up gameplay of the 90s arcade soccer era. Enjoy fast, fluid movement and intuitive controls that allow you to focus on the most important aspect: scoring goals and having a blast! <br><br>The game is designed to be maximum fun, not an accurate simulation \u2013 never wait for any animations to finish or be held back by scripted events.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Local Multiplayer</h2><br>Invite your friends over for some classic couch gaming! Arcade FC supports local multiplayer, enabling you to challenge your friends to intense 1v1 matches or form teams for action-packed 2v2 showdowns. Relive the excitement of playing side by side with your buddies as you create unforgettable gaming memories.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Skill-based Gameplay / Responsive Controls</h2><br>Arcade FC is all about skill and precision. All your beautiful dribbling, passes and goals should be a direct result of you controlling the game, pressing the right buttons at the right time and for the correct amount of time, rather than random effects or pre-scripted events. The more you play, the better you get! <br><br>Your skill, accuracy, and timing are key \u2013 random elements are kept to an absolute minimum.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\u201cEasy to Learn, Hard to Master\u201d</h2><br>Simulating the numerous player movements, feints, tricks, dribbling and kicks, which are part of real-life soccer, leads to overly complex controller layouts with lots of buttons to use and dozens of combinations which are hard to master, requiring a lot of practice and making soccer simulations quite hard to pick up. <br><br>Arcade FC is different. I do not even try to simulate the complexity of the Beautiful Game. Rather, I concentrate on the essentials: dribbling, passing, and kicking. That is why Arcade FC only uses (about) 3 buttons and one analogue stick.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gamepad Support</h2><br>The game is specifically designed for analogue sticks and 2+ buttons. <br><br>While I grew up with digital one-button joysticks \u2013 and loved them \u2013 today, I consider them a limitation. <br><br>So, I designed Arcade FC to make use of the 360\u00b0 analogue sticks and consider separate buttons for shooting and passing a bare minimum. <br><br>I am aware there are many retro fans who would not touch a soccer game which cannot be controlled properly with a keyboard and a single button only \u2013 sorry, Arcade FC is not for you, then\u2026<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Strong AI</h2><br>A powerful and challenging AI is paramount for single player matches or co-op matches against a CPU-controlled team. As the goalies (for now) are always CPU-controlled, their AI code is especially important to me: a strong and plausible goalie behavior is crucial in matches of human players against each other: It is very frustrating if one\u2019s keeper concedes a goal in a buggy, implausible way \u2014 so that is something I try hard to avoid. <br><br><strong>I really hope to create a fun, worth-to-play arcade soccer game with that old-school vibe!</strong>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2538180/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1691077446","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2538180/page.bg.jpg?t=1691077446","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2538180/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1691077446","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2538180/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1691077446","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>\u201dArcade FC\u201d is an arcade soccer game with skill-based gameplay, fast-paced graphics, responsive controls, accurate ball physics and that retro vibe. </strong><br><br>As a modern \u201creboot\u201d of football games of the 80s and 90s, it offers the same addictive \u201ceasy to learn, hard to master\u201d gameplay, enhanced with accurate ball physics, retro-style, high-resolution graphics, powerful AI, and numerous match modes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Brilliant Ball Physics</h2><br>The game's advanced physics engine has been meticulously crafted to deliver a level of realism and fluidity that captures the essence of classic arcade soccer gameplay like never before.
