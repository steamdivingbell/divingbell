The Ba'Am's anger intensifies as he grows increasingly impatient of becoming. Any sentient being made aware of Ba'Am - even in the slightest way - must spend the entirety of its life devising a method to help summon or create him, thus becoming consumed as a slave to the mere thought of him as well as his terrible might. Hence, the grips of doom wreak havoc before and after he materializes. The source of the initial spread of his name remains a mystery. Nonetheless, word is rapidly spreading throughout the galaxy of Ba'Am's emergence. Some civilizations are aware of the impending fate of their world; Some civilizations' world leaders keep the situation a secret and actually work toward summoning Ba'Am in an attempt to utilize him for their own nefarious desires. This is the call to action of the Zodiac Angel.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1432280/extras/emergence.gif?t=1602297440\" /></p><br><h1>&quot;Zodi&quot;</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1432280/extras/tunnelglo4k.png?t=1602297440\" /><br>The Zodiac Angel, Zodi, hails from the Alpha Centauri star system, born into a familial lineage of prestigious intergalactic liaisons. Although Zodi is usually a morally straight diplomat, due to the austere nature of current events, Zodi's decisions are primarily amoral, as her sole mission is to stop the Ba'am. Any adversaries hindering this mission will be destroyed with impunity. Armed with an arsenal of weapons and gravity-altering abilities, Zodi's mission is to locate and assemble the Eightfold, beings that yield esoteric knowledge of how to construct, operate, and advance civilizations technologically. Historically, whenever a planet's dominant creature had evolved to develop intellectual capacity, Secret Societies formed and imprisoned all members of the Eightfold who have since been unwillingly harnessed of their knowledge, specifically of technological advancements and of the best social mechanisms to reign over one's home planet and own species.</p><br><h1>Bosses</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1432280/extras/beelz4k.png?t=1602297440\" /><br><strong> Agent Beelz</strong><br>Chief of the Men In Black and longtime feuding rival of Zodi's sect; Agent Beelz manages intergalactic affairs, including upholding peace treaties, on behalf of Earth. Though outwardly he appears human, Agent Beelz is of the Hominus reptilia class of species.
