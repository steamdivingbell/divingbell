{"about_the_game":"The General Electric U25B, as it first rolled out of GE\u2019s Erie (Pennsylvania) factory, was destined to be one of the most significant diesel locomotives in North American railroading history. It was the U25B \u2013 introduced in 1959 and nicknamed \u201cthe U-Boat\u201d \u2013 that set General Electric on a long path to end the locomotive market domination of the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors.<br> <br>Now, the ground-breaking and much-admired, 2,500-horsepower, four-axle General Electric U25B \u2013 together with its six-axle (C-C) U-Boat sister, the U25C \u2013 comes to Train Simulator Classic in the liveries of six legendary BNSF predecessor railroads! <br> <br>General Electric had long been a fixture in railroading, but it was the innovative U25B, which mated the company\u2019s potent FDL-series four-cycle, 16-cylinder diesel power plant with GE\u2019s time-proven electrical equipment which took General Electric head-long into the competition for sales of North American mainline diesel locomotives. <br> <br>Rated at 2,500 horsepower, the new U25B quickly became a major player in the diesel \u201chorsepower race\u201d of the early 1960s. In 1962, GE sent a quartet of U25Bs on a barnstorming tour of the U.S., and the railroads signed on. During the next four years, through February 1966, General Electric would construct 478 U25Bs for sixteen Class 1 railroads.<br> <br>With curved carbody and long, low nose (a few early U25Bs were constructed in high-nose configuration), the U25B was as stylish as it was innovative. If anything, the U25Bs popularity among railroads was exceeded by its appeal to train-watchers, who welcomed both its distinctive style and the pounding cadence of its FDL diesel power plant.<br> <br>In 1963, a six-axle, six-motor sister, the U25C, joined the GE catalog and through 1965 seven buyers inked orders for 113 six-axle examples. The U25C\u2019s largest purchaser was Northern Pacific, and three of the famed \u201cHill Lines\u201d (all soon to be merged into Burlington Northern) were buyers of the U-Boats. In addition to Northern Pacific, Great Northern acquired 24 U25Bs and Burlington Route (CB&amp;Q) sampled both the U25B (six units) and the U25C (12 units). When created in 1970, Burlington Northern thus inherited a robust U-Boat fleet of 82 locomotives.<br> <br>Masterfully created for Train Simulator Classic by accomplished developer DTM, the General Electric U-Boats in this remarkable DLC wear Burlington Northern, Great Northern, Burlington Route, and Northern Pacific liveries. The Frisco (St. Louis-San Francisco), which rostered 24 U25Bs, was merged into Burlington Northern in 1980 and Frisco\u2019s red/orange-and-white U25Bs are included in the pack as well. Burlington Northern merged with Santa Fe in 1996 to form today\u2019s BNSF and thus joining this pack\u2019s U-Boat menagerie is also the classic blue and yellow U25B of the AT&amp;SF!<br> <br>The U-Boat locomotives for Train Simulator Classic are rich in authentic operating features, deliver road-specific details, and are equipped with advanced air brakes. Also included in this extraordinary DLC are steel cabooses in the liveries of five BNSF predecessor railroads, plus a diverse selection of boxcars, gondolas, covered hoppers, cement cars, and Thrall coal gondolas, many in multiple liveries.<br> <br>The DLC includes four scenarios on the Train Simulator Classic Marias Pass route and is Quick-Drive enabled. With its extraordinary variety of locomotive liveries and equipment, the pack will be an ideal way to realistically put General Electric\u2019s landmark U-Boats to work on a variety of superb Train Simulator Classic routes. <br> <br>The locomotive that helped change the face and history of North American railroading \u2013 the remarkable General Electric U25B \u201cU-Boat\u201d (along with its six-axle sister, the U25C) \u2013 is now available for Train Simulator Classic!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2><br>The U25 Loco Add-On includes 4 career scenarios for the Marias Pass route:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The Scrap Train <br></li><li> Woodchips<br></li><li> The Grain Train<br></li><li> Cement Train</li></ul> <br>More scenarios are available on the Steam Workshop online and in-game.
