The story was engaging, the visuals were stunning and the ambience was perfect. You constantly felt under threat due to the sound of doors opening and closing, foot steps and banging that would sound like it was right behind you. Being defensless and only having the option to run and hide to escape the threat only makes the game more scary. All in all this is a great horror game.\u201d<br />\r\nBeta Tester<br />\r\n","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552030/ss_6c30863d46633da11e0a44562606952cb92549f2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1613465031","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552030/ss_6c30863d46633da11e0a44562606952cb92549f2.600x338.jpg?t=1613465031"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552030/ss_d35b79905f4627c3c08ee014d30a6bba47758caa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1613465031","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552030/ss_d35b79905f4627c3c08ee014d30a6bba47758caa.600x338.jpg?t=1613465031"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552030/ss_47028c9ee0771e36b3c330bcdd6e2a727bbb9369.1920x1080.jpg?t=1613465031","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552030/ss_47028c9ee0771e36b3c330bcdd6e2a727bbb9369.600x338.jpg?t=1613465031"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552030/ss_692a72961ff6e86efab9bb93e77e45b83487d391.1920x1080.jpg?t=1613465031","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552030/ss_692a72961ff6e86efab9bb93e77e45b83487d391.600x338.jpg?t=1613465031"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552030/ss_c1c409ab5b454b1b0e91518fa0f9493bcafc290f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1613465031","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552030/ss_c1c409ab5b454b1b0e91518fa0f9493bcafc290f.600x338.jpg?t=1613465031"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552030/ss_cb06a8c900d42fc1e8cfc56aa666ee0692615862.1920x1080.jpg?t=1613465031","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552030/ss_cb06a8c900d42fc1e8cfc56aa666ee0692615862.600x338.jpg?t=1613465031"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552030/ss_34079f01b61971d3a08a67c34bd99fc7a69ad426.1920x1080.jpg?t=1613465031","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552030/ss_34079f01b61971d3a08a67c34bd99fc7a69ad426.600x338.jpg?t=1613465031"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552030/ss_6ba15758ff021193b6fc425d3e1a9b548bdc95c7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1613465031","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1552030/ss_6ba15758ff021193b6fc425d3e1a9b548bdc95c7.600x338.jpg?t=1613465031"}],"short_description":"Cassidy is set in modern times where you're taken to a Manor that has gone through a horrific event in the 1950's.
