{"about_the_game":"You are a humble slime that has recently found refuge for you and your family in a small village.  Everything seemed peaceful...until a gigantic wurm, thought to be a myth, emerges from the deep underground and devours the entire civilization in one enormous gulp!<br><br>Separated from your family, you awaken inside the beast's maw, and discover the corpse of a knight wearing a suit of armor.  After imbuing the corpse with your slimy essence, you are able to deftly maneuver around the hostile creatures that lurk around you, as well as fight back with your stretchy, toxic appendages!<br><br>Your family must be deeper inside the belly of this beast.  Will you be able to fight your way through and rescue them before it's too late?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Take Control of Slime Knight!</strong></h2>The slightest touch of your gooey essence will damage almost anything it touches.
