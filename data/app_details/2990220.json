Great question, Up Down All-a-Round's controls are relaltivly simple but are hard to master. You use WASD to move around and the mouse to look around, R to reload and space to jump but they are other controls to take into a count! You control your gravity left and right with the shift left and right buttons which are set to Q and E by default, and control your gravity going up and down with the shift up/down button which is set to the left shift button by default. If you are shifting your gravity left or right and find yourself stuck to a wall, you need to press the stop button which is defaulted to tab. To stop shifting your gravity left or right.<br><br>Master the gravity manipulating abilites and you will have a great time!","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2990220?t=1721610951","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2990220/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1721610951","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2990220/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1721610951","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2990220/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1721610951","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Up Down All-a-Round is a fast paced online pvp first person shooter, where you control your player's gravity up and down and all a round!
