{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Take control of a major sea port to efficiently control the flow of containers and make deliveries to waiting vehicles. Sounds simple? Well, you've got to offload containers from ships via giant cranes. Load the containers onto waiting tractors. Move the containers to the storage yards. Then dispatch drones to deliver containers to waiting trucks, trains, and planes. You'll find yourself getting into a rhythm and flow as you click to deliver containers to waiting vehicles with perfect timing.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Earn money by upgrading your port. Buy vehicles, cranes, storage, trains, planes, and bridges. Buy new buildings that unlock additional vehicles and abilities. Get ridiculous upgrades like <strong>drifting</strong> for your tractors and <strong>trolley lines</strong> in San Francisco.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>How many plates can you keep spinning at once?</i></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2649940/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738622026","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2649940/page.bg.jpg?t=1738622026","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2649940/b89e3e7a989e1ad337121fe28757c9ba282ce5cc/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738622026","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2649940/b89e3e7a989e1ad337121fe28757c9ba282ce5cc/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738622026","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Take control of a major sea port to efficiently control the flow of containers and make deliveries to waiting vehicles.
