{"about_the_game":"<strong>Offendron Warrior</strong> is a retro arcade that combines shooting and defense, inspired by Williams Electronics' 1981 classic 'Defender'.<br><br>Your objective is saving Offendron civilians in the planets from the group of enemies, who are trying to spread a virus that turns Offendrons into mindless killing machines and eventually destroy the whole planet.<br><br>Each planet has 10 civilians. If you managed to save all of them from 4 waves of attack, you'll go to the space and fight with lots of enemy fighters. After that, you'll jump to another planet to save another 10 civilians. But if you lost all civilians, you'll have to prepare a hopeless survival from your infected friends in space!<br><br>Offendron Warriors can transform into Interceptor or Offender. In Interceptor mode, you can fly very quickly to save Offendrons or fight with enemy fighters. In Offender mode, your thrust speed significantly decreases but you can fire your laser much faster  and you can fly up or down much quicker. (Manually pressing the button fires the laser faster than just holding it.) Offender mode is recommended for fighting with large amount of enemies or doing preciser movements.<br><br>You can also use Smart-missiles and Hyperspace jump. Smart-missiles automically searches and destroys the targets, and Hyperspace jump allows you to jump half-length of the map to escape from dangerous situations. But don't overuse it, or you'll might destroy yourself!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Synopsis</h2>Somewhere in the space, there were robotic aliens called &quot;Offendrons&quot;.
