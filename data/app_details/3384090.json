{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Welcome to Plastic Battlegrounds, the newly commissioned sandbox toy-based battle simulator that includes objective based modes, where your plastic soldiers engage in intense set piece battles. Set up the battlefield with an ever growing list of units, vehicles, emplacements, and environment hazards then either join the battle as a plastic soldier or be life sized and tower over the chaos. Drive fast moving toy jeeps or pilot drones armed with explosives and machine guns. Blow up toy brick fortifications and tear apart your virtual living space in ways you absolutely cannot do in real life! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In sandbox mode, setup battles by placing units, setting up spawners, and make combat scenarios unique to each play session. It's what you could previously only imagine toy soldiers doing, but now they are truly brought into action! Try the experimental Conquest mode where you are tasked with holding the majority of capture points to achieve victory over the enemy team. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game is very early in development, there is much to be done and the toy war has only begun. Join our Discord community linked in our website to keep up with development news - see you on the battlefield, soldier!</p>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3384090?t=1738958773","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3384090?t=1738958773","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3384090/13733fc17112dbc7eedd78c3e74f3781fcadf10e/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738958773","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3384090/13733fc17112dbc7eedd78c3e74f3781fcadf10e/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738958773","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Welcome to Plastic Battlegrounds, the newly commissioned sandbox toy-based battle simulator that includes objective based modes, where your plastic soldiers engage in intense set piece battles.
