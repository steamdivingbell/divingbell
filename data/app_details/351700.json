Still in development [since 1992] , with regular updates adding major features as well as applying tweaks, UnReal World is a game about survival in harsh, realistic conditions. It\u2019s a survival game that existed before the flood of early access craft \u2018em ups, and it offers a more complete and compelling vision than anything else in the genre.\u201d<br>RPS: The best RPGs on PC in 2019<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s an RPG about wilderness survival, with borrowings from the roguelike ocean, and an enormous amount of things to craft. It\u2019s also, quite possibly, the best example of its type. Two decades of development have paid off and UnReal World has the most intricate procedural worlds to explore and perish in.\u201d<br>Rock, Paper, Shotgun<br><br>\u201cThe animal AI for instance is incredible, and you only notice it once you play another game like it.
