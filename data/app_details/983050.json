This Monitor Ping application improves upon that in several ways:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Ping multiple locations at once with a simple click (it saves locations)<br></li><li>Has a graphical interface that you can scale in size to give an immediate, visual representation of latency<br></li><li>Can alert you if packet-loss exceeds a certain threshold<br></li><li>Can alert you if real-time latency exceeds a certain threshold<br></li><li>Provides an ongoing log-file of packet-loss and excess latency<br></li><li>Tracks packetloss in an ongoing fashion<br></li><li>Has options to enable the tracking graph size (eg, 60 seconds of history vs 60 minutes)<br></li><li>Is visually pleasing<br></li><li>Can 1-click export the graph into an image (PNG)</li></ul><br><strong> Won't this use up a lot of bandwidth? </strong> <br>Not at all!  Each monitor uses approx. 32 bytes of traffic per second in/out.  To put that in perspective, you can poll a server 32,000 times before it uses even 1 MB in/out. By comparison, just watching a single second (1 second) of 1080p video on Youtube uses roughly 100,000 times more bandwidth than each monitor you have running. <br><br><strong> Why would I use this? </strong> <br>This is a great way to decide &quot;Is it me?&quot; by doing the following:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Set up Monitor #1 to be your router (ie, 192.168.0.1 / 10.0.0.1 or such).<br></li><li>Set up Monitor #2 to be your next-up hop of your ISP (do a tracert to determine this).<br></li><li>Set up Monitor #3 to be something typically very reliable.  I suggest 8.8.8.8 or google . com<br></li><li>Set up Monitor #4 to be an online game server you typically play on.</li></ul><br>Now let's say you're getting drops from your favorite game server, or experiencing lag.  Just by looking at the Monitor Ping app, you can now confirm some very important information. <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Is it between your PC and your router (such as bad wifi?).  Well, just check Graph #1 and that will answer it.  No packetloss + steady latency = not a wifi problem.<br></li><li>Is it your connection between your home and your ISP such as a cable model issue?  Well, cheeck Graph #2 and that will answer it.<br></li><li>Is it your ISP backbone?  Well, Graph #3 will help answer that.<br></li><li>Is it the actual game server's network?  Graph #4 will help that.</li></ul>This application is a great first step in determining network connectivity issues, as well as just having an overall monitor to see how things are operating.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">RECENT UPDATES</h2><br><strong> New Alerts System! </strong> <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/983050/extras/AlertUpdate.png?t=1558884422\" /><br><br>You can now receive alerts/notification of packetloss as well as high latency by the following methods:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Windows task tray icon alert<br></li><li>Audio alert<br></li><li>Log-file entry of the alert</li></ul><br><strong> Support For 25+ Languages! </strong> <br><br>The application now supports all supported Steam languages!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/983050/extras/LanguageSupportUpdate.png?t=1558884422\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Monitor Ping User","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/983050/390eac33ebe07a01f495852fba5f198856c8957b.jpg"},{"name":"Features: 1x1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/983050/1b04c2fa7c2dee6fc3e5b25312ce8d6ded034c50.jpg"},{"name":"Features: 2x2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/983050/78f248857c224af44e04720c3dae155f2c1b22c9.jpg"},{"name":"Features: 3x3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/983050/2ac3d7f5caa263ec0acfcf21258a7ad80df6c535.jpg"}],"total":4},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/983050/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1558884422","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/983050/page.bg.jpg?t=1558884422","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/983050/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1558884422","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/983050/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1558884422","categories":[{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Stats","id":15}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/983050/extras/monitoryourping.png?t=1558884422\" /><br>Sticky Apps :: Monitor Ping is an application to view your network connection to multiple systems on the Internet.
