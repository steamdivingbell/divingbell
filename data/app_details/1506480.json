In my early teens, I first discovered this game when I was browsing images of our Lord and savior, Jesus Christ. I was masturbating to his most glorious, divine, and sensual image. Most of his illustrations depict a man with well-defined cheekbones, a great bulbous nose, white porcelain skin, and furry eyebrows that could tickle my feet sour. The mere thought of his soft skin touching my legs and that tempestuous mouth moistening my toes stammered a deep moan from my lips, cut only by the light shivering of my body. I bit my lower lip, as I imagined myself kneeling against Jesus Christ, then lifting Christ's garments and kissing the space between his legs. He would look to the heavens, as he'd struggle to submit to the pleasure and temptation of my devilish tongue. His eyes rolled above and his eyelids spastically told me I was doing my seduction well. I massaged his ankles. I rubbed my thumbs against the penetration of his lower joints. He grasped at his robe and told me to hurry. I noticed something bumping against my forehead...his erect penile blessing. As I sped up my wank, I positioned my teeth to accept his invitation. I was near my climax. &quot;Holy Mary Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of your death. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, blessed are thou amongst women, and blessed are the fruits of thy womb Jesus.&quot; As his name escaped my lips, cum spread amongst my legs, not unlike the power of his almighty name. It was a blessing, to have the imaginative sense to blow off Christ's penis and do so with the eloquence of his proverbs.<br><br>I thought the religious perversion was over, until I awoke to the sweet scent of incense and became aroused. The stimulating connotations of such a sacred sensation became exemplified by its connections with the Buddhist faith. My own rampage for sexual encounter and experience became insatiable by only one submission to Jesus Christ, but that Buddha, in all his glory, came to me in this episode of lust. I began to imagine rubbing through the flabby skin of his man-boobs and sucking it harder and faster until his nipples became hard enough to cut the tongue that grazed it. I was only merciful to have rode on his lap and rub his bald head. I ran my fingers through the contours of his ears and knew that the 2nd climax would produce a wetness that transcends that of which its definition could allow. I became restless in my voice. So much so that I began rubbing my armpits and smelling the succulence of its foul odor. I was turned on.<br><br>After climaxing a 2nd time, I began having visions of a larger, greener, and more muscular build. At first I thought it was somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me. After all, I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed. The L on her forehead told me that I was a new prophet. I was to be the next Isiah, Muhammad, or Shirley Temple. Sexier than the Pope ever was.<br><br>This game would be my life; my devotion is to purely follow the sacramental beliefs explained by the writings in this game. It is the bible or quran of this day. As I look to these religious texts, still encrusted by the ejaculation fluids that discharged as I read through them, I see how this game shall echo stronger through the anus of time, and last longer, farther, and harder beyond it.<br><br>I hope that my story may have convinced you of devoting your life into the texts of this game, a religion to be heralded.</p><br><h1>Pleasures of Poop</h1><p>New, sad, and sinister things are happening to the icons of trash.<br><br>\u201cThe grossest thing I've ever seen on steam.\u201d<br>\u201cAbsolutely disgusting.\u201d<br>\u201cThis nauseating \u201cgame\u201d has to be seen to be believed.\u201d<br>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m having a stroke\u201d<br>\u201cIt\u2019s spreading like cancer.\u201d<br><br>These are all authentic and genuine comments made about this game.
