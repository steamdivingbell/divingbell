All the while, take part in a rich story about overcoming loss and adversity through togetherness and collaboration, where you and many friends come together to grow from hardship and find new purpose, and rise up against an inscrutable force that's cursed Edingir and isolated its inhabitants since its inception.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEdingir Odyssey is still in early development, but you can follow and support the project! A playable demo will be coming soon, as well!
