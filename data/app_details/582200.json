{"about_the_game":"&quot;The Physiology of the Eye&quot; is an interactive VR platform, that features two modes. It starts in a real-time automatic training mode that guides you through our visual content. Then, at any time in the application, the user can push the &quot;Mode&quot; button on the VR controller and switch to our interactive training mode. This allows the user to choose which areas they need to focus on and learn at their own pace. This includes a new labeling system which allows you to expand each label to find out more about the exact 3D piece you have selected and to get an in-depth understanding of each structure. <br><br>These new labels also have audio clips attached to them so you can hear exactly how to pronounce the various parts of the model. Even in Chinese. This application also includes an assessment system to judge your learning comprehension with our interactive testing system. It will also provide you with a final GPA at the end of the course.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Quotes:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><i>&quot;...facilitates learning through active engagement in the content and allows learners to apply content in ways that quickly and effectively solve challenges and create new opportunities.&quot;</i> <strong>- Charles H.
