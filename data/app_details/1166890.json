Following a brutal massacre of your kin in a witch-hunting frenzy, you stand alone as all of Skoroz's followers lie dead, captured, or missing. Severely weakened and hopelessly outnumbered, you are the wrathful deity's last hope for claiming revenge. With an entire kingdom mobilized to bring your rampage to an end, you must explore, hide, and fight through a medieval world on the brink of collapse as famine, pestilence, and warfare rage across Avencia. Blessed by the eldritch powers of your vengeful god, can you bring about the downfall of the realms of men?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1166890/extras/Output3.gif?t=1726296151\" /><br>Necrofugitive takes place in a Medieval world rife with unrest, civil war, and superstition. With multiple factions fighting for control over the Kingdom of Avencia, the opportunity to cause chaos and mayhem is yours for the taking. However, with a hefty bounty placed upon your head, your enemies are numerous beyond reckoning and will relentlessly chase you down if you are sighted.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1166890/extras/Output5.gif?t=1726296151\" /><br>To fight back, the Prisoner wields an arsenal of deadly shapeshifting abilities.

Each soldier is unique, with differing personalities that alter their decisions during combat. Rather than just charging into certain death, soldiers can identify and retreat from danger, form defensive positions, organize ambushes, and even obey the direction of a commander. Your enemies are also studying you - the longer you spend in a fight, the more they learn from your attacks, allowing them to effectively counter you. Using a wide variety of abilities during combat helps keep your enemies guessing!<br><br>Necrofugitive also features hand-drawn animations and dynamic lighting effects to bring the world of Avencia to life. From collapsed dungeons to sun-kissed forests, the world is made to feel as authentic as possible. Inspired by the numerous crises of the Middle Ages, special care is taken to create a game with vibrant characters, setting, and gameplay that puts you in the perspective of being a rampaging monster of legend.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1166890/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726296151","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1166890/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1726296151","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1166890/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726296151","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1166890/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726296151","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Animated violence and blood"},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":1340560,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<strong>Playing Necrofugitive with a gamepad is highly recommended!</strong><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1166890/extras/Output4.gif?t=1726296151\" /><br>You are a shapeshifting cultist of Skoroz, the eldritch god of chaos.
