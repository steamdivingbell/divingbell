Draining blood from your foes fuels your vampiric agility - Chronostasis. This unique skill allows you to sow despair in the hearts of your enemies - using it causes your foes to freeze in place while you and your fellow vampires execute attacks with unimaginable speed.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Control Multiple Vampires</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1578940/extras/2_vampires.gif?t=1736180556\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Hunting in Vampire Clans becomes even more strategic as you control up to three vampires at once, each with their own unique set of skills. Before heading into battle, you'll decide on the best tactics and specializations for your vampires. Players can switch between vampires at will, issuing commands to the others. The Chronostasis system makes managing multiple vampires more intuitive, allowing you to slow down the time and plan out your attacks with precision.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Stealth or Combat?</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1578940/extras/stealth_or_combat.gif?t=1736180556\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Not every battle needs to be fought head-on. The shadows are your greatest ally. Use stealth and your trained bats to stalk prey or eliminate enemies in a group, one by one.
