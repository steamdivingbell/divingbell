What attracts them is a beautiful lake, shining intensely in mysterious shades of light blue colours. Underneath lies a broad and branched cave system with meter-high stalactites, underground lakes and huge rock halls, which hides behind the karst-spring. Yet none of the tourists have ever been underground, inside the cave. For over hundreds of thousands of years, this has been uncharted territory.
