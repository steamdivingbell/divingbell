{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DISCLAIMER:</h2><br>When I created this game, my intention was to deliver a sci-fi themed sandbox RPG that would eventually grow into a space sim. Based on initial feedback and requests, I have decided to add new features to give you more content while I finish the seasons. These features include multiplayer content, a campaign, different scenarios/game modes, and various miscellaneous features such as abilities, mini-games, and audio playlists. The status of these features will be visible on the community page.  These features should be considered as early access features. The sandbox (found in the scenarios menu by selecting the party games tab and choosing the sandbox game mode) is where most of the stable features will be found. This will still be continually updated, but my focus is on fixing stability issues with the requested features.
