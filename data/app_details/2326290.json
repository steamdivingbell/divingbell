{"about_the_game":"RedSpace Ops is a 3D adventure learning game designed to teach players the fundamentals of space operations. In this immersive experience, players join teams to execute realistic space missions, controlling various spacecraft capabilities, communicating via specialized signal sets, and utilizing advanced terrestrial technologies. RedSpace Ops enables players to \u201cChair-Fly\u201d space missions, helping them grasp the complexities of the local space environment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSet within the local cis-lunar arena, the game will soon feature a timeline extending back to 1877, allowing players to explore the space domain and understand the intricacies of Research, Experimentation, and Demonstration (RED) Space capabilities. Players will interact with RedSpace controllers, who employ a variety of sensors to detect and track small objects in the vast darkness of space. These controllers will identify objects without breaching warning zones, report on their behavior, and, when necessary, execute dynamic space control measures to mitigate threats to the domain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers will engage with RedSpace Ops at three levels of play:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n   -     Tactical Level: Players directly control their spacecraft and its sensors, following precise C2 instructions to avoid threats and gather data on the space environment. This is a \u201cdriver\u2019s\u201d perspective, exemplified by the Space Cowboy ADR module, which serves as a minimum viable product.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n   -     Operational Level: Players manage their assigned spacecraft constellation, allocating resources, and overseeing logistics, including the launch of alert and spare spacecraft. This level focuses on operational movement and asset management, emphasizing team collaboration.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n   -      Strategic Level: Players plan their research, funding, and time investments, developing new mission areas to prepare for future challenges. They will track R&amp;D progress and make strategic decisions based on intelligence gathered from missions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first RedSpace Ops module, Space Cowboy, challenges players to capture and remove space debris, reducing operational risks and preserving the orbital environment. The goal is to collect and either dispose of or repurpose debris to earn the funding needed for tanker refueling. Future versions of Space Cowboy will explore advanced techniques like sorting and powderizing debris for 3D printing in orbit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChairFly represents the operational level of RedSpace Ops. In this module, players take tactical control of a space asset while simultaneously acting as the mission commander for a space campaign. This allows players to \u201cROCdrill\u201d the execution of a fiscal year campaign or OP ORDER timeline, helping to identify capability gaps and inform acquisition requirements for decades to come.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe strategic component is captured by Ascendant Space Strategic Sim (AS3). AS3 is a real-time strategy game where players guide their nation\u2019s efforts to develop the solar system and become the ultimate superpower. Players manage personnel, research, production, and operations in a simulation modeled on current events and the geopolitical competition among Russia, China, and the United States. AS3 offers valuable insights into the future possibilities of a thriving space economy and highlights the consequences for nations that neglect space domain development and protection.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe vision of RedSpace Ops is to provide an immersive educational experience that teaches players the foundational concepts of space maneuver warfare. The ultimate goal is to foster an understanding of the speeds, distances, power requirements, and lethality of the local space environment and the manmade systems within it. As players progress, they will gain a deeper appreciation of the complex systems and technologies necessary for successful space missions. Upon completing this gaming series, a new generation of warfighters will be inspired and motivated to pursue careers in the Space Force or the commercial space industry.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFuture Space &amp; Building Games Features:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n      -     Explore the cis-lunar environment and experience the unique environmental effects of local space.<br />\r\n      -     Upgrade your sensors to enhance space situational awareness and communication speed.<br />\r\n      -     Compete against other teams to test and hone your space skills.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2326290/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725293377","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2326290/page.bg.jpg?t=1725293377","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2326290/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725293377","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2326290/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725293377","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"RedSpace Ops is a 3D adventure learning game designed to teach players the fundamentals of space operations.
