{"about_the_game":"This is the demo for Grid Clash VR with one Arena:<br><br>Everything in this game is about real body motion. No shooting/moving by just pressing a trigger. To walk or run - you have got to actually run(in place) - to attack you have got the actually throw the discs. To evade a shot - you actually have to duck or move to the side. <br><br>Your primary goal in this game is to shoot the ball through the opposing teams goal ring. To stop the opponents you can slice them with discs you can spawn at any time. In short you could describe this game as mixture of basketball and dodge ball (but with discs) in arenas full with obstacles and hiding places. <br><br>This game is build around a very advanced &quot;run in place&quot; motion system that translates your movement into virtual movement. Ideally after some time in the game and getting used to the system you should forget that you are actually just running in place when moving. <br><br>In the long term there will be Leagues/Stats/Rankings added to this game. My hope is that this will become the first real team based VR sport - that actually feels like doing sport!
