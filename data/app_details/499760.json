Walk, run, jump, climb, shoot, throw, swim, and swing. <br><br><strong>Key features</strong><br><br>-Various forms of world locomotion, including teleporting, arm swinging to walk, climbing rocks and trees, and grapple hooking around like your favorite wallcrawler. Choice in movement designed to maximize flexibility and provide comfortable options for all players.<br>-A deeper look into the characters of Red and the Huntsman, exploring their thoughts and motivations beyond the context of the fable.<br>-A forest playground from both character's past, completely open to exploration and traversal.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/499760/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1471566338","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/499760/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1471566338","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/499760/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1471566338","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/499760/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1471566338","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Redswood VR is a virtual retelling of the Red Riding Hood story.
