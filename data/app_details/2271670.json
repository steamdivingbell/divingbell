{"about_the_game":"Fill your interstellar epic with star-speckled space backdrops and huge battleships ready for combat with the Last Boss Pack Vol.5! Gee Kun Soft\u2019s latest pack continues to be inspired by sci-fi, this time upping the battler sizes to contain entire armies! 10 space battleships are ready to be used in your galaxy-wide games! Give your starship troopers marine-inspired exploration and spacecraft carrier ships while your heroes travel to the far reaches of the galaxy in a red-detailed aerodynamic rocket. Green ships with 4 powerful dishes that can blast messages into the distance, long purple serpent-shaped ships, and heavy-duty shield crafts can be friends or foes, depending on who your heroes decide to team up with!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach ship also comes with a matching sprite, so you can have your heroes travel in style when they\u2019re racing for the next planet. And 12 backgrounds (in 2 sizes, 816x624 and 1000x740) are the perfect backdrop for space battles and setting the scene when your heroes reach a new area, whether they\u2019re floating above a calm planet, dodging trash in a shattered space station, or pausing before joining into a laser-filler battle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack also includes 64 bonus images to add even more excitement to your cutscenes! Each spaceship is in its own section of space and comes in multiple variations of combat readiness. Show the serpent ship shooting anything that gets close with 6 turrets along in back right before your heroes have to dive into battle with it, or set the mood with a destroyed medic ship shedding chunks of burnt metal when your heroes arrive too late to help!
