{"about_the_game":"David Payne and Mirco Pecorari drew from many full-scale and model aviation influences when designing the Commander mPd\u00ae 1.4m sport airplane. They wanted it to stand out from the crowd while having the pilot-friendly flight characteristics of traditional sport planes. This updated and upgraded version is all that and more! Easy to take off, fly, and land, it's the perfect &quot;next step&quot; after a trainer. In the hands of experienced pilots, it's also capable of higher speeds and high-energy aerobatics. The 3S and 4S compatible brushless power system, combined with a light wing loading plus factory-installed metal-geared servos and flaps, gives the Commander mPd 1.4m a wide flight envelope. It's smooth and predictable, with power to spare for performing rolling circles, knife-edge flight, and beyond. While you fly, the exclusive Spektrum\u2122 Avian\u2122 Smart Lite ESC can provide a variety of real-time power system related telemetry data including motor RPM, current, battery voltage and more \u2013 with Smart and non-Smart batteries \u2013 via compatible receivers (including the Bind-N-Fly\u00ae Basic version's AR631) and Spektrum AirWare\u2122 equipped transmitters. The Bind-N-Fly\u00ae Basic version also offers the handling benefits of AS3X\u00ae and optional-use SAFE\u00ae Select technologies. An innovative Hands-Free Servo Connection System automatically plugs in the aileron and flap servo connectors when you install the two-piece wing with just 4 bolts. The Commander mPd 1.4m arrives factory-finished in an exclusive Aircraft Studio Design trim scheme and requires no glue for assembly. That means you can have it ready to fly in less time than it takes to charge a battery!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis model is equipped with Horizon Hobby and Spektrum exclusive AS3X (Artificial Stabilization \u2013 3-aXis) and optional-use SAFE (Sensor Assisted Flight Envelope) Select technologies, and when SAFE Select is turned on using the mode switch (B on the Spektrum InterLink DX controller) it offers:  <br />\r\n  <br />\r\nPitch and Bank Angle Limits  <br />\r\nThese envelope limits keep the airplane from rolling or pitching upside down.  They also prevent excessive climb or dive angles.  <br />\r\n  <br />\r\nAutomatic Self-Leveling  <br />\r\nThe airplane instantly returns to and holds level flight when the sticks are released and in the center position.  It\u2019s also helpful for keeping the wings level during takeoffs and landings.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759320/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1710982482","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759320/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1710982482","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759320/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1710982482","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759320/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1710982482","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"David Payne and Mirco Pecorari drew from many full-scale and model aviation influences when designing the Commander mPd\u00ae 1.4m sport airplane.
