Uncover the sinister transformation of innocent evacuees and their carers into monstrous beings, The Chosen and The Rejected. These mentally and physically corrupted beings, once people, are now in thrall or completely mindless, as they relentlessly seek to hinder you, toy with you, or simply tear you apart.

You will have to feel around cabinets, tables, and even the floor, to find the tools you need to complete your escape. Unable to adequately fight in your current state, and with your enemies being the very people you considered friends and wards before this all happened, the only way out is with delicate navigation and caution.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2463020/extras/UIHeal.gif?t=1727536518\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Each Step Into The Unknown</h2>Your pain and intoxication will be in a fine balance as you attempt to stem the pain of your eye wounds and any other injuries you sustain with what medical assistance you can find. Brace yourself for a terrifying descent into darkness and the unspeakable horrors that await in Bucknowle Manor. You're a veteran of the Great War, and even blind you're tough, you may get one chance to throw them off if they reach you, but you can't defend yourself forever.
