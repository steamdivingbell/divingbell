{"about_the_game":"A brain twists and turns, pure ASCII character style puzzle adventure game!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a bizarre adventure.

This is. What kind of game is it?<br />\r\nTo put it simply: uninhibited dialogue + \u201c\u5947\u602a\u7684\u5927\u5192\u9669\u201d(pit) + \u201cinside\u201d(puzzle)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame features:<br />\r\n1. The game screen is simple and rough<br />\r\n2. A little weird plot<br />\r\n3. The traditional way of thinking of going straight up and down will make your step difficult.<br />\r\n4. There are no tips and strategies available in the game, and you should have the spirit of never giving up until you reach your goal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWarm tip: the game is hard core, there are 7 chapters in total. There is no dead end in the game. No matter what you choose, you can play normally. Normal game time is 20-100 hours. It's a game that makes you feel like you're always on the brink of survival. The design of the riddle is ingenious, This is a good game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome questions about the game:<br />\r\n1, &quot;no archive&quot;:<br />\r\nHi, there is no need to return,  believe in your choice, all the way forward, you can finally reach the end..<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2. &quot;No strategy&quot;:<br />\r\n&quot;Strategy is impossible, this life is impossible to have strategy&quot;, chat and laugh.. Because this is not the kind of nonsense game that can be passed by clicking the screen randomly. Although the game is a bit strange, except for the opening prologue, the rest of the game is to control the movement of characters through the direction key. It is a traditional 2D horizontal puzzle game, which only needs to try and think more. It is a lot of challenges for non intelligence factors and intelligence factors. After their own efforts to pass the game, what kind of experience will it be!!! I don't know! I don't know! I don't know!
