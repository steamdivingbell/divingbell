{"about_the_game":"FTX Trees HD is a complete overhaul of FSX: Steam Edition\u2019s auto-generated tree textures, lending new immersion to your flight simulation experience! <br><br>Developed for ORBX by Scott Armstrong, these tree textures are double the resolution of default trees, resulting in greater detail, and are derived from high-resolution photographs of real trees for maximum realism. They have been hand-edited and colour-matched to give a top-quality flight sim experience. New, optimized tree models reduce the burden on your system when flying over most dense-tree areas, with a negligible change in VAS compared to the default. <br><br>Low-level flying takes on a new sense of realism that truly must be seen to be believed; skimming over treetops, over forests and along rivers has never felt so real! Your favourite airports will see a major upgrade too, as the surrounding vegetation takes on a new lifelike appearance. Airliner pilots also benefit, as approaches, departures and taxiing will be greatly enhanced by more realistic vegetation. <br><br>Whether you are new to flight simulation and upgrading FSX: Steam Edition for the first time or are a seasoned veteran, FTX Trees HD is designed for maximum compatibility and will upgrade all of your auto-generated trees worldwide.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tBreath-taking new auto-generated tree textures <br></li><li>\tDouble the resolution of previous auto-generated trees for greater detail <br></li><li>\tAll textures created from high-quality photos of real trees </li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/379565/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1537258361","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/379565/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1537258361","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/379565/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1537258361","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/379565/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1537258361","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"FTX Trees HD is a complete overhaul of FSX: Steam Edition\u2019s auto-generated tree textures, lending new immersion to your flight simulation experience! <br><br>Developed for ORBX by Scott Armstrong, these tree textures are double the resolution of default trees, resulting in greater detail, and are derived from high-resolution photographs of real trees for maximum realism.
