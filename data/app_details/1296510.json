Limited to just a few key components, it\u2019s proof that it doesn\u2019t take large teams and inflated budgets to provide singular interpretations of what it means to feel truly afraid behind a keyboard or controller.\u201d<br>4.5/5 \u2013 Rue Morgue<br><br>\u201cFor the $7 price of admission, Dread X Collection provides a breadth of different experiences, each having a distinct vision from its respective creator. If you\u2019ve enjoyed previous games from any of the developers involved, this collection is well worth your time. Even if you haven\u2019t, this release introduces many new creators you should probably be aware of. Finishing all the unique horror games here will likely take you around 10-15 hours, which ensures you get more than your money\u2019s worth. This collection just further proves something I\u2019ve known for a long time; you don\u2019t need huge teams with massive budgets to create the types of horror games that make you feel a palpable sense of fear from behind a controller.
