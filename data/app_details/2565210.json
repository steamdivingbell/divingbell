{"about_the_game":"The high peaks of the mountains fascinate us with their unexplored mysteries for most of us. Well, have you ever dreamed of riding a bike on these peaks? Mountain Bicycle Rider Simulator makes that dream come true. This bicycle game offers the cycling experience and the impressive atmosphere of the mountains.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game, which has a unique place among bike games, transports us to another world with realistic graphics in a snowy mountain environment. All these details allow us to go beyond a rider game experience. We are impressed as if we are cycling on a real mountain, enjoying this extraordinary experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are three different bike models in total in this simulation game. However, only the first bike is unlocked when you start the game. To access other bike models, we encounter a slightly different mechanic than we are used to in the rider games category: Money packs hidden in mountainous terrain! Collecting these packs enriches your cycle game experience and allows you to try new bike models. We also encounter checkpoint missions in the game. These missions bring your adrenaline to the top by forcing you to pass through certain points in a limited time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMountain Bicycle Rider Simulator offers a different experience for bike lovers than BMX games. There are BMX bikes and mountain bikes in this game, which adds a different excitement. Instead of acrobatic movements with BMX bikes, we try to stay balanced on the challenging roads of the mountains in this game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThanks to the game's open-world structure, you can discover the beauties of nature and the bike riding experience. While walking freely on the slopes of the mountains, you can look at the animals you encounter and enjoy cycling in their natural habitats. This natural habitat makes the atmosphere of the game even more impressive. The game in this simulator games category stands out with its realism and richness of detail.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBicycle games have always been popular in the gaming world. However, Mountain Bicycle Rider Simulator offers a simple cycling experience and shows you what it means to cycle in the harsh mountains. This game offers a unique experience for nature lovers as well as for cycling lovers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMountain Bicycle Rider Simulator is for you if you want to enjoy cycling in the mystical atmosphere of snowy mountains. This unique game, in the category of bike games and simulation games, is waiting for you. It appeals to a wide audience in bicycle and simulator games categories. Are you ready to meet this game where you will collect unforgettable memories while pedalling towards the top of the mountains?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2565210/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1693993657","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2565210/page.bg.jpg?t=1693993657","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2565210/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1693993657","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2565210/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1693993657","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The high peaks of the mountains fascinate us with their unexplored mysteries for most of us.
