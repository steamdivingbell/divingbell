SOL CRESTA takes the docking and formation strategies of classic shooting games Moon Cresta and Terra Cresta and elevates them with the \u201cfree-form docking\u201d system. The flagship Yamato, composed of the fighters Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, and Susano can utilize various attacks depending on how the three ships are aligned. Docking, splitting, and reforming the ships as needed is the key to defeating the invading armies of Mega Zofer.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Story</strong><br>Humanity faced a crushing defeat at the hands of the Mandler Army during their last invasion of the solar system. Losing the moon and being driven from Earth, they were forced to retreat all the way to Laomedeia, the 12th moon of Neptune. With the last of their hope, they formed the solar recovery squad SOL CRESTA, and placed the fate of the solar system with the Yamato, a cutting-edge docking ship.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1575640/extras/Store_1_en2.gif?t=1721358406\" /><br><br></li><li><strong>Free-Form Docking</strong><br>The Yamato, standing against the evil of Mega Zofer, is composed of 3 fighters.
