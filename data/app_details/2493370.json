{"about_the_game":"&quot; <br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> <br>  D&amp;D Classics: 9439 Adam's Wrath (2E)  </h2>  <br>   <br> <br>  <br>  There are some things that mere mortals were never meant to know. . . . In the domain of Lamordia, Doctor Victor Mordenheim created Adam? cobbling the creature together from parts of human corpses. Now, years later, Adam wants revenge. Adam wants Elise, Victor's wife. Adam wants Victor dead. The player characters' ship founders on the coast of the domain of Lamordia. A vicious storm leaves them washed ashore, cold and hungry on the ice-bound Isle of Agony. . . . Then the terror begins. The adventurers embark on a journey of fear that leads from certain doom on the frozen island to a strange new life a Schloss Mordenheim. To return home they must challenge Adam himself and discover a portal? a gate that might lead homeward. Adam's Wrath is intended for a party of four to eight characters of 5th to 7th level. Carefully designed to allow a Dungeon Master to launch from any campaign world or Ravenloft domain, Adam's Wrath is an adventure your characters will never forget? if they survive!  <strong> WARNING: It has been reported that some of the maps in this scan file are missing...
