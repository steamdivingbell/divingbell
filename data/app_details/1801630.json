{"about_the_game":"Highblast is now in its 3rd version. Hope you enjoy and thanks for playing if you have! We really appreciate it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story Context</h2><br>HIGHBLAST is set on a planet in a distant solar system. You work for the local star system defence force. They prevent any 1 group of people from completely controlling a planet. You are helping to free a planet from an evil civilisation who want to take all the resources for war against other planets. You must infiltrate enemy bases to perform reconnaissance and weaken the enemy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Basic Game Mechanics (Not yet complete and coming soon)</h2><br>Enhance your robot soldiers by equipping various arm mounted or arm replacing weapons. Examples include a anti-drone radar, a flamethrower and a rail-gun!<br>If a robot is disabled do not worry, you have backups! You will be able to upgrade the number of robots you can deploy in later game versions.<br>Once all enemies are destroyed you return to the ship and leave for orbit to do repairs and upgrades.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Custom Maps (Unavailable)</h2><br>You have the freedom to create your own maps and share them with others on the Steam Workshop with Highblast's <strong>Level Foundry</strong>. The map pieces snap to a grid. And new pieces and fixes are being worked on all the time! We are also considering procedural maps for infinite replayability!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Early Development Disclaimer</h2><br>Highblast was originally released as a first game and was very very.... <i>Indie</i> in it's lack of everything. But we liked the concept an wanted to make something similar with <i>a lot</i> more content and a cool story. So if it seems far from finished, it is. And we (2 to 3 people in our free time) are constantly working on new stuff and fixes for old stuff.<br>WE WILL NOT NEGLECT THIS GAME UNTIL IT'S DONE! :)<br>Please enjoy and watch Highblast grow!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"What have you done?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1801630/d082017ed4a39f8aa8fba2de5ace5faddbbf78d1.jpg"},{"name":"Flight","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1801630/39b259e0577263fdbf98c7ed1527751ff87b8767.jpg"},{"name":"Hello World!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1801630/6f1e27d829ca30b9e7ed5b293e345918a52d9721.jpg"},{"name":"The Ground Is Getting Closer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1801630/71b7321d6a8b0a533e12c32c10fd2e12e37161f6.jpg"},{"name":"commit -all","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1801630/0f95a251aee0ae95cc3cf07e97ee14a276f5f1bb.jpg"},{"name":"Foundryman","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1801630/c3211042166cf6915cfea78a7ac74878df803955.jpg"}],"total":6},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1801630/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726982093","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1801630/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1726982093","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1801630/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726982093","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1801630/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726982093","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Stats","id":15}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Highblast is now in its 3rd version.
