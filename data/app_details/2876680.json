{"about_the_game":"In Fluxed you play a man who has invented a Time Watch, who travels back in time to stop terrorists from detonating a bomb in a building in New York City, which started World War 3 and thus destroyed most of humanity. You travel back to floor 27 of the building, 2 minutes before the bomb is set to explode. Your Time Watch has 3 more uses, meaning you get 4 loops of the same 2 minutes in which to find the 3 terrorists, find the code, and diffuse the bomb. There are two modes, one with paradoxes enabled, and one with paradoxes disabled. It's not complete until you have finished the game in every loop, and in both modes; but it gets harder to avoid your past selves seeing you and causing a paradox the more past selves you have walking around! Play in VR, or PC, and try for the high scores!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Won - Paradoxes - 1st Loop","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2876680/2f645d6e146d4e060968332ecec3eddf5686e27b.jpg"},{"name":"Won - Paradoxes - 2nd Loop","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2876680/463fdf6267742671320f2e9a770dda506745acb9.jpg"},{"name":"Won - Paradoxes - 3rd Loop","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2876680/84b3de166eef55d7cb98d8d986e2949bf10f6f87.jpg"},{"name":"Won - Paradoxes - 4th Loop","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2876680/02d57cf34a29bea8c387b6a5565f19927390257e.jpg"},{"name":"Won - No Paradoxes - 1st Loop","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2876680/7838b2b66ad1be4f04c95bf56d721b54ca7be19d.jpg"},{"name":"Won - No Paradoxes - 2nd Loop","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2876680/588b7fd0a9ebe247fdaf6b8091dd720a7e73c48d.jpg"},{"name":"Won - No Paradoxes - 3rd Loop","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2876680/92686d276e3a610e90b6883f9051be9949aa3084.jpg"},{"name":"Won - No Paradoxes - 4th Loop","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2876680/d944d5058871bb2058bb6ea143b6ab75c9064b17.jpg"}],"total":8},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2876680/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1716566510","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2876680/page.bg.jpg?t=1716566510","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2876680/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1716566510","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2876680/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1716566510","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Supported","id":53},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In Fluxed you play a man who has invented a Time Watch, who travels back in time to stop terrorists from detonating a bomb in a building in New York City, which started World War 3 and thus destroyed most of humanity.
