{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Looters Inc is a 4 player physics-based co-op heist game, where you and your friends break into houses, clinics, banks and more to steal valuable items. Nothing is safe, even the people.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Key Features:</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Procedurally Generated Maps:</strong> Each burglary attempt is a new experience, as rooms and furniture are randomized. Maybe the next house you target will only have bathrooms!</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Agressive NPCs:</strong> The home owners will not take your thuggery lying down. They are violent and they work together. You might lose some of your fellow robbers in action, but sometimes, sacrifices must be done.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Multiple Escape Vehicle Upgrades:</strong> You will start with a rusty old truck, with a small flat bed. But do not worry, using the money you steal, you can upgrade to better machinery. Better vehicle = More space for stolen goods.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Don't Forget Your Tools:</strong> Choose between a variety of tools to help your robbery go smoothly. From a &quot;Silent Window Breaker&quot; to make sure you don't wake up the residents, to a &quot;Baseball Bat&quot; to put them back to sleep if they do wake up, you will find tools for every play style.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Bonus Items:</strong> Experience the satisfying rush of opening a safe and finding a $1000 box of jewelery! Or the grief of finding a 1$ trash bag. Maybe the odds will be in your favour next time around.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Local and Online Co-op:\u00a0</strong>Team up with up to 3 more looters in local or online multiplayer. And remember, robbery is more fun when done with friends!</p></li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3435180/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1739378290","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3435180/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1739378290","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3435180/ab3eece19a0259c3d2f1d1f79df386d192940434/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739378290","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3435180/ab3eece19a0259c3d2f1d1f79df386d192940434/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739378290","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Looters Inc is a 4 player physics-based co-op heist game, where you and your friends break into houses, clinics, banks and more to steal valuable items.
