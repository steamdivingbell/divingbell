{"about_the_game":"Robin of Loxley the Legend of Sherwood is a stealth game, your mission is to retrieve as much loot as you can through the levels avoiding guards and security cameras. You cannot harm or knockout the guards, so you will need to find a way to slip past them unnoticed, also you can distract the guards by making noise or by footsteps, doing so they will investigate the source of the noise you made, changing temporarily their usual patrol route, you may take advantage of this and slip past them and get access to guarded areas that otherwise are not accessible without being detected. Remember that if the guards will spot you they will start shooting at you and other guards will arrive very soon as reinforcements, you may try to escape them but this won't be that easy, so be careful and try to stay undetected.<br><br>Your mission is to retrieve as much loot as you can, that is: purses with gold, chests and special items worth gold and usually well guarded.<br><br>When you complete a level, you will get some end level points evaluating your performance during the level, and the next level will be unlocked on the map.
