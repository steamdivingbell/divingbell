What surrounds you are the walls of an ancient temple. Your only guides are mysterious shrines. Your only ally is a friendly robot - the suit support unit. You make your way out of the temple to find out that its builders have long been forgotten. Humans have settled over the ruins of the old empire. Fierce monsters roam across the land. Dangerous insects lurk in the shadows. Ancient rusty automatons keep digging towards the core of the world with the same relentless persistence they had on the day they were abandoned. In the middle of all of this is you - the last guardian of a mysterious ark, with your only weapon - the bombs that your suit produces.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1018860/extras/DwarfAndShrine_1.gif?t=1616689989\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1018860/extras/Fireball-Combat.gif?t=1616689989\" /><br>Bombing Quest stays faithful to the classical bomberman battle mechanic - you fight on a grid, where you plant bombs, which explode in four directions. Once inside a grid, you need to think strategically on where and when to plant bombs to damage the enemies without damaging yourself. As you progress through the game, the enemies will get quicker, smarter and will also develop more diverse attacks and behaviour, which will require you to react and adapt quicker. You will find components and gadgets to upgrade your battle suit to be able to produce more bombs with greater power, increase your health and speed, give you new abilities and so on. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1018860/extras/BattleGif.gif?t=1616689989\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1018860/extras/Fireball-World.gif?t=1616689989\" /><br>It's divided in biomes and is semi-open - meaning you walk freely and chose where and when to battle, but you need to progress with the story to unlock the next biome.
