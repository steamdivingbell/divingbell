The Fiefs were divided into two Realms, separated by a great chasm. Those who were in the South Realm were known for their battle prowess and powerful warriors, whereas those from the North Realm practiced the arcane arts to get things done. The two realms were connected by the Askar Bridge, a large highway that kept goods, services, and ideas flowing between the two Realms.<br><br>Then calamity struck. A disagreement between the North and South caused the champion of the North, the Blitz Mage, to attack the South. The South had its own champion: the Old Codger, who bravely fought back. Although the South put up a valiant fight, all was lost when the Blitz Mage seized control of all 10 pieces of The Conductrex \u2013 a powerful magical artifact. This gave the Blitz Mage enough power to cast a giant pall of darkness across all the land, transforming all the people into mindless monsters and dooming the island forever.<br><br>The Old Codger battled on, and managed to fight his way to the Blitz Mage despite the droves of monsters along the way. He reached his enemy and the two fought \u2013 but the Blitz Mage won. Gravely wounded, the Old Codger still managed to break apart the Conductrex once again, spreading its pieces across The Island. It was all he could do before he dragged himself to a ship and fled the island...<br><br>It was there, on the ship, that he managed to sire a line of heroes, from which you, your siblings, and your cousins are born.

Each Fief has multiple levels, each with a miniboss, and finally a Lord that has been transformed into the most horrible of creatures \u2013 a huge boss monster.
