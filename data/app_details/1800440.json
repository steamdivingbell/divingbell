{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Space Storm is an action-packed 2D game in which you control a futuristic spaceship to fight against enemy fleets. In dicey situations, you have the option of teleporting to another location to avoid dangerous attacks.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your aim is to destroy all opponents in a wave without being destroyed yourself. After you have defeated a wave, a mothership appears that spawns more enemies. There are enemies that chase you and even some that shoot a fireball at you when you destroy them! What's more, the enemies become more difficult to hit with each level - some turn into tiny dots that require extreme precision.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game comprises a total of 50 levels that become increasingly challenging. Your skill, quick reflexes and tactical thinking are required to master the challenges. Will you survive the star storm?
