What\u2019s it like to wake up after a year of cryostasis and single-handedly fix up the ship with hundreds of unconscious people aboard? Eliminate a series of failures not only on board, but also in your own head: memory  blackouts, recollection mirages, and strange visions. And don\u2019t forget, all ship resources are running low:  movement capability, air, energy, freedom, and common sense as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWeapons are not gonna help.
