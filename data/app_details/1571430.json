{"about_the_game":"Ten 2 ten Poker is a 2 player turn based card game where the players take turns building poker hands. If you already know poker, learning Ten 2 Ten Poker is super simple! You don't have to worry about counting cards because all cards that have been dealt are always face up.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach poker hand you build is worth a certain amount of points. The player with the most points after 5 rounds wins. You can play by yourself, with a friend by creating/joining a private room, or against a random player with the Quick Match option.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach player is dealt 10 cards each and 2 community cards are placed in the middle. During each of your 5 turns you must select 5 cards to build a hand. This is where the strategy comes in. Will you play it safe and select a full house or will you save that 3 of a kind for the next round to see if you can build a 4 of a kind worth a ton of points? These are the types of the choices that make Ten 2 Ten Poker a fun and addicting card game.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Win a practice game","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1571430/4122e4c6e07b57c8fcb741f1f75aaf16955afe7f.jpg"},{"name":"Win 5 practice games","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1571430/3d96da7738817c2d853c9c7f8aaf72c41fc45e84.jpg"},{"name":"Win 20 practice games","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1571430/bf2ea87ecff45610395d74be96900585826746e7.jpg"},{"name":"Win 100 practice games","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1571430/f086d597cad1316665055eaad22ddaa51ffdcbcb.jpg"},{"name":"2 Pair","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1571430/468a8a7a13a4cd9583f3ffd651e76dc6af54b9fe.jpg"},{"name":"3 of a kind","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1571430/a46bdeccbb8b366955e53ecb8a7d7afc79fc376b.jpg"},{"name":"Straight","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1571430/c2ffa823403474d76ca99ed374e93bf1cde54065.jpg"},{"name":"Flush","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1571430/708315e6a9c89b5ddaf4850235b6094b44a00b85.jpg"},{"name":"Full house","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1571430/289bad4381addbaefbaaf7aaf0f03ff62ae19b68.jpg"},{"name":"4 of a kind","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1571430/05ce829cff6f3b413214506e6798688675e6ea55.jpg"}],"total":21},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1571430/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1657771225","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1571430/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1657771225","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1571430/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1657771225","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1571430/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1657771225","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Ten 2 ten Poker is a 2 player turn based card game where the players take turns building poker hands.
