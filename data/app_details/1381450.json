{"about_the_game":"Dreadful Shadows is a 3rd person team Survival Horror Brawler. Teams (8 Hunters vs 2 Creatures) Must battle against the clock to Either Save or Destroy the given village respectively . Set in an alternative timeline of our Victorian Era, hunters will have magic, guns, traps, stakes, weapons and all sorts of gimmicks to &quot;Hunt&quot; the Creatures of the dark, all while trying to stay alive, keep allies alive and read spells of protection for the village. After 5 spells have been read on the map the player must escape before the blood moon cleanses the map.<br />\r\nAlternately if you find yourself as a creature of darkness, you'll get to attack the Hunters with a variety of custom attacks, spells, grabs, stealth take downs and death animations. As a creature you'll have a set time to attack the hunter players the best you can until the blood moon is activated,  in which one of the creatures will be spawned into the dreaded Skin walker/ Wendigo/ Shape shifter... It has many names, and will leave you broken in a fight. Capable of throwing bones, breaking you in two, charging you with its horns, or knocking you 20+ feet with one blow in Combat. No hunter is a Real match for this Abomination.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1381450/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732550389","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1381450/page.bg.jpg?t=1732550389","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1381450/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732550389","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1381450/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732550389","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Game has Guns and mild violence"},"detailed_description":"Dreadful Shadows is a 3rd person team Survival Horror Brawler.
