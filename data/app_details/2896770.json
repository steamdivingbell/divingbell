{"about_the_game":"A 2.5D adventure game where you control a magical fish, seeking to revive the ocean where he lives and was destroyed because of human action, by collecting polyps (baby corals) and then planting a piece of coral reef, the cradle of the ocean. Once all pieces are reborn, the only thing left is to find the Protector of the Ocean, a being capable of preventing the ecosystem from being destroyed. The magical fish, named Coralium, is capable of learning skills from other fish as he unlocks new zones to move through the ocean by defeating obstacles on each level, some are invader or natural predatores, some other are man-made.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2896770/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714172122","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2896770/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1714172122","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2896770/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714172122","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2896770/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714172122","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"A 2.5D adventure game where you control a magical fish, seeking to revive the ocean where he lives and was destroyed because of human action, by collecting polyps (baby corals) and then planting a piece of coral reef, the cradle of the ocean.
