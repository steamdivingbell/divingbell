This is a simple game that resembles the famous bowling, only in the role of the skittle, we have squares in the center of the cube, and ball instead of inertial rotation flies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd so, to play in spaceball you need a few friends who like to bet on glasses and a computer mouse. Pushing the ball to the target is done by pressing the right mouse button, and pulling with the wheel of your mouse or &quot;Q&quot;. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy breaking new and new squares in a cube a space ball, get points and become the king of a cubic galaxy.
