War rages continuously on 3 diverse real world combat zones, where you engage the enemy as both pilot and co-pilot/gunner. <br>The main attraction of this add-on is to increase the importance of missions played in the desert areas. The main focus was on demonstrating the growing threat from Iran and the intervention of the United States and Russia in the region. However, battles against time also move to two other places - to Afghanistan, where, after a short period of peace and quiet, terrorist groups and the ice deserts of Antarctica have come to light again.<br><br>Regardless of the chosen location, the player has to choose the side of the conflict.
