Your goal is to overthrow the mega-corporation by hacking into their systems. With only a computer and AI software named F0-N1A5, you begin your mission.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecome familiar with each level layout to traverse individual tiles on a cube face. Avoid all potential setbacks by creating strategic paths.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSolve over 30 intricate levels with increasing difficulties and obstacles. Watch the story unfold as you reach the end to discover the truth behind the madness.  <br />\r\n <br />\r\nKey Features:  <br />\r\nVisual appealing retro aesthetics and graphics.  <br />\r\nRich audio content and ambient sounds.  <br />\r\nMinimalistic interface and graphic design.    <br />\r\nIntriguing characters and mysterious storyline.  <br />\r\nMini-Map for level overview.  <br />\r\nDynamic obstacles and environment.  <br />\r\nPolished control scheme and movement.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1705760/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1679692510","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1705760/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1679692510","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1705760/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1679692510","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1705760/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1679692510","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In a fictional portrayal of the early 1980s, the U.S is under authoritarian rule.
