{"about_the_game":"Fight on the front lines of the war between humanity and the hideous Blobs. (Not that anyone has actually seen a Blob up close, but everyone knows they have tentacles. Surely they\u2019re hideous!) Go on stealth missions, run alien blockades, and investigate mysterious planets, &quot;aided&quot; by Lloyd, your insufferably obnoxious shipboard computer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChoice of the Star Captain is the hilarious interactive science-fiction novel where your choices determine how the story proceeds. The game is entirely text-based--without graphics or sound effects--but powered by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor example, suppose Lloyd has just informed you that your ship will crash land on the jungle moon of Cygnus Delta in 93 seconds. What will you do?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA) Call upon your elite piloting skills to escape the moon\u2019s gravity well.<br />\r\nB) Invite Lloyd to land the ship himself, if he\u2019s so smart.<br />\r\nC) Make the prudent choice, and try landing on the moon\u2019s surface instead of attempting a risky escape.<br />\r\nD) Spend the last 93 seconds of your life gleefully smashing Lloyd\u2019s screen with a torque wrench.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHumanity needs you, Star Captain! Will you defeat the Blobs and come home as a war hero? Will you uncover the secret that sparked the Blob invasion? Will you serve as ambassador and convince the Blobs to spare the human race? The choice is yours.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/648510/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734038759","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/648510/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1734038759","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/648510/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734038759","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/648510/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734038759","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":648520,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Fight on the front lines of the war between humanity and the hideous Blobs.
