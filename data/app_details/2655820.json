Your choices will either lead you deep into the mature content during the evil playthroughs, or to their reduction as you help those around you.\r\n\r\nThe game is set in a future fictional world, post-WWIII. The characters can either succeed in overcoming their trauma (good endings) or fail and dive deeper into extreme end of their trauma (bad endings).\r\n\r\nThere are no visual depictions of extreme violence or gore (such as high amounts of blood or bones), and the mature subjects are depicted in a non-extreme and non-glorifying way as a storytelling device. The game includes the topics and mentions of death.\r\n\r\nThe sexual content is non-explicit and presented through textual descriptions with imagery, or story implications. There are no explicit sex scenes, outside of what would be expected of a vanilla dating simulation such as dating, kissing, stimulating scenes and light touching.\r\n\r\nDepending on the selected playthrough, the intensity of the content will vary from vanilla (hero-type) content with a lower frequency of violence and corruption behaviors, to the evil playthrough with higher levels of harm, substance abuse, and morally corrupt behavior."},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2655820/extras/banner.png?t=1700095739\" /><br><br><strong>Story Overview:</strong> 2046.
