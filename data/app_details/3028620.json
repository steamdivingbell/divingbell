{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>About This Game</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game utilizes cards as the main gameplay element, combining the intense excitement of tower defense with the extreme challenges of survival gameplay. It's not just about repetitive card stacking and building, nor is it simply turn-based monster fighting and leveling up. You can experience the high degree of freedom, exhilarating battles, and intense real-time strategic deployments!  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game's completion time is approximately 10 hours. Regarding gameplay features: </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">    <strong>Challenge Mode</strong> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">  Interesting Tower Defense Terrain:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Five distinct types of maps, with a total of 100 battle levels. Each map type comes with its own gameplay mechanics, and nighttime levels are particularly dangerous, so be careful! </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">  Various types of cards:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game offers over 200 cards for players to enjoy! Among them, there are nearly 100 battle cards and over 20 zombie cards. You'll unlock various cat heroes and battle cards with different abilities across different levels. Each card has its own characteristics, and you'll need to make strategic decisions and place them appropriately when fighting different types of zombies. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">  Strategic Challenges:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The selection of battle cards before each level could be the key strategy for your success. In the game, you can freely place cards, and their positioning is crucial when fighting zombies. The combination strategy of multiple cards also needs to be deployed wisely. Typically, a combination of attack and defense cards is a good option. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">  Exhilarating Battles:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Different battle cards have varying attack ranges, effects, and battle special effects. Come and see which weapon feels the best to use! </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">   </h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">  Day-Night Cycle:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Daytime levels allow you to clearly see all movements on the battlefield, but the darkness of nighttime levels increases difficulty and creates a sense of tension. Can you conquer the level with low visibility? </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">  Full Star Completion:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Can you complete the task of collecting all the fish snacks in each level? You can replay the levels where you haven\u2019t collected all the fish snacks to achieve full star completion. Be a perfectionist and achieve great feats!  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">    <strong>Survival Mode</strong> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">  Daily Exploration:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can use cat cards to interact with various scene cards encountered randomly through exploration, obtaining different resources to complete daily collection tasks. Leave behind important resources and sell temporarily useless ones to accumulate wealth. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">  Card Construction:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Once you have enough resources, you can build various battle cards in the shop to defend the Tree of Hope. We have cat-building cards that can train cats with different abilities, functional building cards that improve the quality of cat life and increase wealth accumulation, defensive cards that can block and delay zombies, and weapon cards that deal various types of damage to zombies. Which battle cards to prioritize depends on your strategy. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">  Sneaky Enemies:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When night falls, zombies with various abilities will roar in from all directions. With a common goal to attack the Tree of Hope, they will try to turn the Meowx planet into a zombie planet. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">  Tactical Deployment:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can train cats with various abilities to create your own Meow Sea tactics. Alternatively, you can build high walls to tightly surround the Tree of Hope, adopting a conservative and cautious approach. Or, if you believe that offense is the best defense, you can go all out and build weapon cards. The optimal strategy is up to you to discover through practice. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">  Gameplay Upgrades:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Once you have enough wealth, you can upgrade the Tree of Hope. As it grows, cats will be able to explore a broader world and gather more precious resources. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">  Mysterious Merchant:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">He is a mysterious merchant wandering the Meowx planet. After a certain time, he will arrive with his magical cards. Although he loves the Meowx planet, he also loves money, so remember to prepare enough gold coins to trade with him before he arrives. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">  Encyclopedia:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can check the card and zombie encyclopedia to learn about the characteristics of over 200 different cards in the game. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">  Highly Replayable:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Occasional failures are a good way to test and optimize strategies. Even after successfully completing levels, you can start again and experiment with various new tactics\u2014whether meticulous, interesting, or outrageous. Everything is possible; it\u2019s up to you to create!  </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">  Climate Challenges:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Encountering bad weather will increase the survival difficulty for cats. During these times, you need to prepare in advance by building necessary functional buildings to help them through tough situations. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">  Plague Outbreak:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Viruses don\u2019t appear without reason. When cat plague spreads in the village, cats will begin to die one by one, and you will need to cure the plague and save the village. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">  Complex Battle Terrain:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the new levels of the level mode, there will be special gameplay elements with different battle terrains. You will encounter events such as traps in the forest, monster attacks from the lake, and more. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">  Random Events:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Perhaps you\u2019ll be ambushed by zombies during daytime exploration, or you might experience a rare encounter that grants you a precious rare card. You may also come across a temple and gain magical powers.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>About U</strong>s</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Hi there!
