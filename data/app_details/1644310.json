{"about_the_game":"Markus Ritter - The Lost Family is an homage to old point-and-click full motion video games from the 90s.<br>This Demo was developed as a fan project made by two people over the course of one and a half years.

Markus is a young man without any ambitions in life just living from day to day.<br>However he is haunted by nightmares that don't make any sense. The only reoccuring thing is a young woman in a white dress. Who is she? And why does she seem so familiar... <br><br>Are they really just dreams? </strong><br><br><br>In this short adventure, play the first chapter in Markus's quest to become the person he was always supposed to be.<br><br>Just some important hints: Always look to the book in your mobile (right mouse click). You will also get a sound when a new task is added.
