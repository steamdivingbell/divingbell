{"about_the_game":"Zero Page is a single-player survival horror puzzle game that dares you to survive the horror of solving puzzles by yourself in space. If that wasn\u2019t horrifying enough, you\u2019re also going to have to solve them on a deserted spaceship using the only piece of equipment that still works: a personal computer from 1981. But with a little bit of BASIC and a lot of high-stakes debugging, you might just live long enough to find out why you\u2019re alone, why you\u2019re in space, why you\u2019re on a dying ship circling an unknown planet, and why that ship wants to kill you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Back to BASIC</h2>Find out if you're smart enough to not die in space, armed only with a machine that struggles to count higher than 256 \u2014 a highly accurate recreation of a classic 1980s personal computer, complete with floppy discs and a joystick.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Game About Thinking (The Thinking Man's Shooting)</h2>Put that laser gun back in your space pants. You\u2019re going to have to program your way out of this problem, by writing code that actually physically changes your environment.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Also a Game About Action (The Action Man\u2019s Thinking)</h2>You won\u2019t just be sitting at an old computer \u2014 well, you will, but not fictionally. In addition to programming, you\u2019ll also get your hands dirty resurrecting an ancient spacecraft \u2014 patching critical holes, pressing important buttons, and bringing systems back online so they can start keeping you alive again.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1752240/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733275169","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1752240/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1733275169","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1752240/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733275169","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1752240/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733275169","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Zero Page is a single-player survival horror puzzle game that dares you to survive the horror of solving puzzles by yourself in space.
