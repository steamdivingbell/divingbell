Use her voice to ask your butterfly companions to assist you with activating totems, opening doors, clearing ruble, lifting/carrying items, and so on. Aside from basic movement, you will have to rely on always having a butterfly around you to interact with the puzzles.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2428410/extras/puzzles.gif?t=1729505138\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">HEAL, PROTECT AND NURTURE</h2>Your butterfly companions might get attacked, trapped or injured. It is your duty to keep them out of danger and use Coco's voice to shoo away any hostiles. Mistakes happen, and that's okay! That's because her voice has healing abilities and can help out those in need. Don't be shy to share your meows with other plants and creatures as well.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BEWARE OF THE SHADOWS</h2>When there is light, there are also shadows.
