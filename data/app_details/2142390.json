As a member of the group, you'll need to gather resources, fortify your defenses, and be on the lookout for any signs of treachery. Keep your eyes open and your wits about you, because the traitor could be anyone. But beware, the zombies won't wait for you to figure out who the traitor is. They'll keep coming in waves, and each one will be more difficult to fend off than the last. You'll need to work quickly and efficiently to stay alive.
