{"about_the_game":"Delve deep into the darkness of a mysterious mansion and puzzle out a way to escape the horror that lies within. As Alex Young, you awaken to find yourself trapped in a dark room - and your only guide: a cynical voice on the other end of a portable radio. As you move from room to room, solving puzzles and rescuing others like yourself, team up with everyone from a self-important conspiracy theorist to a detective with secrets of her own. It quickly becomes apparent that there is something truly rotten lurking at the heart of this place. But who - or what - lurks in the shadows of this mansion, monitoring your every move? <br><br>Inspired by the look and feel of classic horror games, The Tartarus Key serves up a mystery filled with twists and turns, and more than a few deadly surprises. Rely on brains over brawn to help Alex survive, but beware - not everyone might make it out alive.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1760600/extras/TTK-GIF-Office-Steam.gif?t=1726491480\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features: </h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Escape a deadly mansion filled with dangerous traps, and rescue Alex\u2019s fellow captives\u2026 or fail, and leave them to a grisly fate<br></li><li>Uncover three different endings, and dig to the heart of the mansion and the strange secrets it and your captors hold<br></li><li>Solve puzzles and challenges reminiscent of escape-the-room games in a variety of unsettling and bizarre scenarios<br></li><li>A tense, atmospheric adventure that relies on puzzles and plot instead of combat or chase sequences</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1760600/extras/TTK-GIF-KeyArt.gif?t=1726491480\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Team:</h2><br>Leonor Parra: Founder of Vertical Reach and the artist making The Tartarus Key as atmospheric and unsettling as possible.
