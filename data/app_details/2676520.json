{"about_the_game":"<strong>Gameplay:</strong><br>The game &quot;I'm a Rocker&quot; is basically a point &amp; click adventure that uses elements of the hidden object genre to unfold the story.

There's also a different aspect, and that's collecting CDs. This doesn't affect the plot, but getting them all will earn you a Steam Achievement. The story is not completely linear, some things can be done in a different order.<br><br><strong>Background:</strong><br>We are after a nuclear war, somewhere in the USA. Life is not kind to you, and your prospects are certainly not looking good. You're a metalhead, a member of a &quot;different&quot; thinking group, listening to &quot;different&quot; kind of music, a member of a rebellious subculture, who always has a slightly different opinion on things than society expects. In many ways, of course, you are the same as everyone else. You want to live a normal life, as much as possible, and you want to have fun. But in this world? You realize that your life might not be very long, so you want to go to one last concert of a famous metal band. The problem is, it's in another city not too close by, and you'd need a functioning vehicle to cross the wasteland. Maybe a partner wouldn't hurt either.
