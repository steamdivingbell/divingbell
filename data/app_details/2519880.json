It takes inspiration from Valve's games, with its use of environmental story telling and pacing between enemy encounters, striking a balance between combat and atmosphere. Think the atmosphere of a slow-burn horror inspired walking simulator fused with movement and combat options of a shooter...<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2519880/extras/features.png?t=1694756401\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2519880/extras/Prolgue_Combat_2.gif?t=1694756401\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2519880/extras/Dot_points.png?t=1694756401\" /> One level featuring combat between the military and mutants in the world of Entropic Decay.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2519880/extras/Dot_points.png?t=1694756401\" /> A preview of the horde mode, featuring waves of enemies (including soldiers) that gradually get more difficult as waves progress. Includes a custom soundtrack.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2519880/extras/Dot_points.png?t=1694756401\" /> Use time dilation to outmanoeuvre enemies and dodge projectiles- including bullets! Time dilation also allows for altered movement, dashing multi-directionally to evade enemies and dodge projectiles, and a double jump to reach places not achievable otherwise.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2519880/extras/Dot_points.png?t=1694756401\" /> Projectile based ballistics system.

They react to grenades, can hear you, take cover, flee, and throw their own grenades. The mutated work in packs, can hear you running and will roam the area you were last seen. The military will shoot the mutated on sight, but taking them down is no easy task, even for the well trained.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2519880/extras/Dot_points.png?t=1694756401\" /> A variety of mutated to fight against - Currently there are over ten different mutated to contend with.

The signal is tracked, and the crash site investigated on impact. A mineral is found. Astrobioligist's are amazed to find a living pathogen inside the mineral. The pathogen is extracted and experimented on, and the findings indicate aggressive cell growth when in contact with other organisms....dead or alive. Rapid cell mutation causes a rabies like disease. Anything infected with the pathogen becomes a hive-minded aggressor to everything not infected. The pathogen spreads and envelopes the world. Civilisation becomes an overgrown, decaying husk of the nature we once knew. The decay and despair is juxtaposed with beauty, as plant life flourishes due to the pathogens effect on cell growth, and everything man-made returns to nature, but rises again with a twisted skew. The last bastion of humanity are elitist's, deploying the military to kill anyone on sight who aren't in uniform. Military death squads roam in packs, taking orders for food and protection from the pathogen, while trading their humanity. <br><br>You awaken in a facility, fumbling for hazy memories of before the place you find yourself in.... Journey through a world foreign to all but the mutated, and find a place free from decay and entropy at any cost...<br><br>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2519880/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1694756401","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2519880/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1694756401","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2519880/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1694756401","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2519880/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1694756401","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence or Gore, General Mature Content, and some non sexual nudity."},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2519880/extras/Prologue-wishlist.png?t=1694756401\" /><br><br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2519880/extras/WhatIsEntropicDecay_New.png?t=1694756401\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2519880/extras/Prolgue_Combat_1.gif?t=1694756401\" /><br><br><br><strong>\u201cThe definition of entropic is having a tendency to change from a state of order..to a state of disorder...&quot;</strong><br><br>Entropic Decay is a lovingly crafted linear first person shooter driven by narrative, puzzles, combat arenas, and horror sequences.
