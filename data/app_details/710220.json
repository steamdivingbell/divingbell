Fast-paced with a primary focus on gunplay rather than bullet hell, DreadStar gives you incremental ways of not only pushing through content, but also improving your ship and its loadout (such as experience, leveling and skill points). <br><br>If you\u2019re struggling with a sector, you can warp over to Redbeard\u2019s Burrow to spend credits, upgrade your ship and return to where you failed.
