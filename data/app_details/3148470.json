{"about_the_game":"You have 24 hours before this land reaches it's doom. Use your limited time to:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Explore:</strong></h2>A small but dense and frequently changing world, with 4 distinct biomes, each with its own set of points of interest where you will encounter all kinds of creatures and constructs to fight. Knowledge about this land is the key to success, and the more you play, the more accustomed you will become to what enemies you may encounter in each area and what resources you gain from defeating them. Conquering the terrain and mastering the ability to quickly plan routes towards the equipment you desire is one of your main goals across every playthrough.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3148470/extras/SteamGifs0.gif?t=1733842842\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fight:</h2>The diverse inhabitants of this land, each located in different parts of the world. Graze enemy attacks to regain health and use your expansive arsenal to fight back. Challenge grand bosses which will test your skills of memorizing their attacks and knowing what weapons to use for each situation.
