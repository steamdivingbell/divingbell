{"about_the_game":"Scholar is a spelling game with RPG elements. Level up your hero as you spell words and unlock new skills. Fight powerful bosses at the end of each level and get that loot. <br><br><strong>Flow</strong><br>In Scholar, Flow is your both energy and health. Casting a word, as well as taking damage reduces your flow. Use your skills, equipment and upgrades to reduce flow costs or completely neglect them. In some cases even regenerate and fill your entire flow with one special word. <br><br><strong>Three Skill Trees to Explore</strong><br>Choose your way between path of Flow, Experience and Guardian. Will you focus solely on your exp gains or will you maximize your damage output? Mix them to your liking to enjoy your journey. Reset them any time and try out new strategies. <br><br><strong>Loot</strong><br>After you complete every run enjoy your new loot. Try harder difficulty runs to obtain better quality ones. Common, rare,legendary and set items all await you! Use multiple items of the same set to unlock special abilities. Finishing higher difficulty runs will also give you better rolled items. Look out for glitched items which roll with extra stats. Even a common item can be an exciting addition to your armory if you can find a glitched one!<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1824260/extras/custom4.png?t=1652441364\" /><br><br><strong>Augments</strong><br>As you spell words you'll start to run into augmented letters.
