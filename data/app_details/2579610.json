{"about_the_game":"The Archduke Set DLC draws heavy inspiration from Gothic plate armor of the 15th century, paired with an elegantly etched polehammer. This DLC features one of the most intricate designs inspired by our history. The armor set will shine thanks to the newly added third pattern variation, which unlocks different metal tints for each piece. Adorn yourself with the luxurious fluted sections and explore never-before-seen configurations with the new sash, serving as a skirt substitute. Stand out with the ornate sallet in either the medium or heavy variant, enhanced with additional deer antlers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Includes:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Archduke Polehammer<br></li><li>Archduke Arms<br></li><li>Archduke Pauldrons 1x1<br></li><li>Archduke Pauldrons 1x1 with rondels<br></li><li>Archduke Pauldrons 1x2 with rondels<br></li><li>Archduke Pauldrons 2x2<br></li><li>Archduke Pauldrons 2x2 with rondels<br></li><li>Archduke Rondels<br></li><li>Archduke Cuirass<br></li><li>Archduke Gauntlets<br></li><li>Archduke Leggings<br></li><li>Archduke Mail bevor<br></li><li>Archduke Sabatons<br></li><li>Archduke Sabatons with spurs<br></li><li>Archduke Sallet<br></li><li>Archduke Sallet with antlers<br></li><li>Archduke Sash<br></li><li>Archduke Heavy sallet<br></li><li>Archduke Heavy sallet with antlers</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2579610/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728986316","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2579610/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1728986316","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2579610/bd54599c152908ab1e20486bf59463089b1042a6/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728986316","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2579610/bd54599c152908ab1e20486bf59463089b1042a6/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728986316","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Valve Anti-Cheat enabled","id":8},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Remote Play on Phone","id":41},{"description":"Remote Play on Tablet","id":42}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Archduke Set DLC draws heavy inspiration from Gothic plate armor of the 15th century, paired with an elegantly etched polehammer.
