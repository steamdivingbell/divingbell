My name is Emily and I just lost my job. So I decided to chase my dream and try to make it as a writer. I have the support of my wife Cleo, and enough savings for a month. After that, we'll see what happens. But I know I can do it! I just need to stick with writing and submitting short stories each day.</i><br><br><strong><br>The top selling game now finally comes to Steam!</strong><br><br>You play Emily, a struggling writer, trying to make it in the big bad world of short story publishing in this life sim/rpg hybrid game. The key element to this game is the happiness meter, you want to keep Emily happy enough that she doesn't give up writing. You walk around your house, interacting with different things to get ideas, and writing short stories. <br><br>Try not to get too distracted, or you will get sad that you hadn't written during the day, making your happiness meter go down. Get too sad, and it's game over. She gives up and gets a new job doing something far less fun and stressful. When you're done getting ideas, you can go to her computer, write the stories, and submit it for publication. But be careful! There are distractions on your computer as well, and if you spend too much time on social media instead of writing, it could be game over as well. The only thing that makes her happy is writing and publishing, and yet..why is it so hard to write?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2141470/extras/sayhicleo.gif?t=1664559378\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2141470/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1664559378","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2141470/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1664559378","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2141470/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1664559378","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2141470/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1664559378","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2141470/extras/explore.gif?t=1664559378\" /><br><i><br>Hello!
