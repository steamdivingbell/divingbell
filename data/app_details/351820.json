{"about_the_game":"In 2097, the mining of minerals and other natural resources is completely automated and controlled by supercomputers. The planets that are mined for 'Iberium', an essential mineral to control pollution on Earth, are called Z.A.R.; Zones for Artificial Resources.

A single soldier, Colonel Hermit, is sent to deal with this threat. <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Explore vast, open, low-gravity terrains whilst gunning down hordes of enemies.<br></li><li>Enjoy the CD-quality audio soundtrack.<br></li><li>Destroy your enemies with a variety of weaponry.</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/351820/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1569521985","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/351820/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1569521985","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/351820/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1569521985","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/351820/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1569521985","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In 2097, the mining of minerals and other natural resources is completely automated and controlled by supercomputers.
