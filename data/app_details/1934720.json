Two unique, well-balanced factions face off in intense battles where base-building, resource management, and commanding units will shape you into either a powerful commander of the Iron Hand or a fearless general of the Resistance.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Engage in ground and aerial warfare, utilize upgrades, special abilities, and devastating superweapons to dominate the battlefield. The focus is on large-scale battles where armies clash. Build a mighty base or strike fast to outmaneuver your opponent. With multiple tactical and strategic approaches, the choice is yours.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Red Chaos features an extensive multiplayer mode, offering countless hours of fun against both friends and strangers worldwide.

The Untainted Garden was chosen as the site for the new world government, and there, they built a formidable fortress.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Refugees, seeking a fresh start, fled to this sanctuary, only to be betrayed by politicians who established the Iron Hand regime.

This oppression and the growing sense of despair fueled resentment and unrest among the people.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Amidst this discontent, former generals, soldiers, and rebellious citizens formed a resistance. United by a common cause, they vowed to fight against the Iron Hand and free the land from its tyrannical rule. Though their resources were limited, they used their military experience and skills to build a formidable fighting force.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The resistance worked to gain the people's support and expose the injustices of the Iron Hand. They sought to recruit civilians to strengthen their ranks, but they had to proceed with caution, as the Iron Hand controlled a fortified city and possessed vast resources.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The struggle between the Resistance and the Iron Hand became a war of sacrifice, deception, and strategic warfare.
