{"about_the_game":"<strong>Short summary:</strong><br><strong>World Annihilation Operations Parts I-IV</strong> is a set of <strong>4</strong> short experimental games examining the impact of audiovisual and narrative contradictions within fictional worlds. Each game showcases a vastly different world with various mechanics, and is the result of a research-based creative process meant to discover technical operations, inspired in each case by a unique act of creation and able to generate contradictions/impossible figures within initially logically &quot;possible&quot; worlds. <br><br><strong>Some overall primary features:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Four unique experiences around 12-20 minutes each.<br></li><li>Varied, dynamic and often unexpected audiovisual effects.<br></li><li>A progression in ways of approaching contradictions and impossible figures in games, from an observational stance to a linear exploration format with light puzzles, a narrative approach, and an engaged discourse.<br></li><li>A timing system for speed-running Parts II-III-IV (see related achievements). </li></ul><br><strong>In-depth description:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Part I: Fly freely through a 3-D scene of a strange city in the middle of the desert, while various audiovisual events occur.

Impossible figures may emerge from the <strong>superposition</strong> of unexpected elements within the fictional world.<br></li><li>Part IV: Experience a metaphorical rendition of the life of an unknown creature attempting to escape its fate in the food industry.
