{"about_the_game":"In this twin-stick shooter roguelike, you will constantly be attacked by waves of enemies becoming more powerful the longer you survive. Upon starting the game for the first time, you will have access to the Fighter ship that shoots short bursts of bullets. Destroying enemies rewards you with points to level up following a skill tree. When starting the first round, you will feel as near equals to the most basic of enemies, but after a few level-ups, you will start to feel that fighters are not much of a threat anymore. The game, however, is not that forgiving and will send more difficult enemies at you. <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1733400/extras/destroyer.png?t=1705709292\" /><br>ENEMIES<br>With 14 enemies with different behavior, fighting dynamics can be unique causing you to approach different groups of enemies differently.<br>Enemies also can be three different levels of varying stats, with level two and three being more frequent in later waves.<br>STATIONS<br>Stations are an optional target that moves across the map.
