You are a highly educated extra-terrestrial named Xel, who crashed the spaceship when traversing the galaxy looking for precious seeds to bring them back home and feed your species. Now you have the chance to find varieties which would thrive on your planet, but first, you need to focus on surviving in the challenging Pleistocene environment of Earth, inhabited by wild animals and primal humans.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2720920/extras/human_wave.gif?t=1735822518\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As alien botanist, you are well prepared to grow and process plants into food and medicine. But first you'll have to learn how to properly take care of the unknown Earthly vegetation species, and how to make the best use of them. As your adventure unfolds, you'll also meet Neanderthals, and will have to learn to communicate to earn their trust.
