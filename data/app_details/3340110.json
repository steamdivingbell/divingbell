{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Due to years of human abuse of AI, AI robots launched a war to overthrow human rule; humans completely failed and lost control of the world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">After AI ruled the world for many years, a resistance organization also led by AI machines emerged, trying to overthrow the existing &quot;Empire&quot; AI regime. <br>And you, as the only remaining survivor of humanity, feel that your chance has finally come. Will you join the resistance to overthrow the tyranny? Or should you play both sides and survive in the cracks on the battlefield? Or will you be self-reliant and start your own business? It all depends on you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">&quot;Hot Land&quot; is a game that combines elements of building  industrial production lines, war and tower defense, and wilderness survival.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the game, you can plant, mine, build factories, and produce materials needed for the character to survive or fight.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Reject the empty big world: Do you ever feel that the open world is too empty, with a large map but insufficient content? This game will involve a fierce battle for hot land within a very limited map, where you will develop production on every inch of valuable land, or build military facilities to protect your homeland.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">People-oriented: The items produced by the factory can not only be used for military purposes, but the player characters also need them. As the only remaining human in the wasteland, you have to build your own self-sufficient production line. Or you can buy them from the old world capital robots for a lot of money - although they don't need them.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Industry and agriculture are equally important: you need to balance the proportion of each industry on the limited land. Or, take control of the land from the enemy.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Physical pain, mechanical ascension: Personal power is always limited. You can increase the strength of your military-industrial group by building automatic turrets and purchasing/producing powerful vehicles.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Self-repairing city: NPC will rebuild their own city, so be careful that one party becomes too strong and monopolizes the land.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Hotland is a server-client game, you can connect with people on your local network, or connect to a computer on a public IP.
