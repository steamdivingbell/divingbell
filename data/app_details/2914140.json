{"about_the_game":"Face off against other champions or monsters with your backpacks, automatically firing off their contents as your character fights. Foods are eaten, potions are drunk, swords are swung and shields are raised for protection. Gain more items for your backpack after each fight; these items synergize and combine together, making you all the more powerful! Having prepared, start the combat and lay back; watch the cute and sexy girls fight it out in a polished, dynamically changing, gorgeous 2D environment.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Melee Mode (PvP)<br>Compete against other players over multiple rounds, while adding to your backpack, both making it bigger and also filled to the brim with stashed armors, weapons, consumable items and other stuff! As you purchase items from the shop every turn, everything you put in your backpack will activate on its own dealing damage, blocking opponent's attacks or buffing, healing you. On top of that certain items make each other stronger when placed next to each other! While other items can be combined to be crafted into a new item.<br></li><li>Arena Mode (PvP)<br>In this battle royale mode, you clash with 9 other players over multiple rounds. Losing all your health will result in you being eliminated. Round after round expand your backpack with stuff while keeping an eye on other players' build. Can you be the one to come out victorious?<br></li><li>Scenario Mode (PvE)<br>A campaign mode where you progress through the world, and choose your path! Each tile features a different challenge. Tiles can hold threatening monsters, but also ways to recover health, purchase items, or scavenge for treasures. Improve your character with ever more stuff during your adventure and face the last boss at the very end!<br></li><li>Shop Draft Modifications<br>The shop drafts new items each round. Round after round, buy items from the shop to upgrade and expand your equipment. Every other round, you will be offered to pick from various shop modifications that allow you to shift the odds in favor of what you are building towards.<br></li><li>Environment Rules<br>Each game plays in a different zone and thus has differing effects applied on the fighters. Adjusting your strategy to the current environment will allow you to gain an edge over your opponents!<br>Ultimate Powers<br></li><li>Learning of your opponent's spec, you may choose to use your ultimate power to tilt the odds in your favor. You can only use your ultimate power a limited amount of times so make sure to use it strategically!<br></li><li>Preparations<br>Before you enter the next fight, you can inspect your next opponent's inventory and prepare accordingly; adjust your items and decide to use your ultimate power that fight or save it for later.<br></li><li>Mastery<br>As you become an experted fighter, you may hone your expertise even further by striving for mastery! To defeat an opponent while staying at maximum health? Or destroying them before the start of the timeout period? Collect as many such masteries as you can and reap the special rewards they yield, giving you something to brag about!</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2914140/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733332802","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2914140/page.bg.jpg?t=1733332802","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2914140/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733332802","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2914140/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733332802","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Face off against other champions or monsters with your backpacks, automatically firing off their contents as your character fights.
