{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u201cThorny Times\u201d is a tactical RPG with strategy elements, set in a fantasy medieval kingdom. With your small but desperate mercenary squad you explore the strategic map, complete quests and defeat enemies. Each of your fighters has a personal inventory and a development tree. But mercenaries will not fight for free - to maintain a powerful army, you will need a lot of gold. And to do this you'll have to wrest villages and castles from local feudal lords.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combinatorics solves everything</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Which archer is better - an archer who shoots a lot of arrows or a slow gunner who pierces armor? What will a humble novice become - a powerful healer or a witch who paralyzes enemies? There is only one development option for everyone. Form your unique squad with a view to synergy.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Puzzle battles that will make you sweat</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Even with a strong army, not all battles can be won. How about an enemy cannon that kills your hero on the first turn, or ghosts that are invulnerable to physical weapons? Combine fighters and equipment items to suit each specific enemy.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A mix of adventure and strategy</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can't just go on an adventure and forget about economics. Troops require money, and money brings possessions. Capture castles and hold them to have a regular income, and defend your villages from enemy raids.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Many different stories</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Which one will you be the hero of? The story of a provincial nobleman's son who becomes a legendary warlord? Or about a mysterious message found in a chest on the shore? Or about a ruthless war between two kingdoms? These and many other stories await you.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Extensive scenario editor</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can create the scenario you want for yourself - from a merciless massacre with many enemies to an adventure with lots of text, a non-linear plot and multiple endings.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2182610/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736823419","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2182610/page.bg.jpg?t=1736823419","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2182610/5dce274c9b4210ec20ca1ff2de8543f33623dca9/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736823419","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2182610/5dce274c9b4210ec20ca1ff2de8543f33623dca9/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736823419","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u201cThorny Times\u201d is a tactical RPG with strategy elements, set in a fantasy medieval kingdom.
