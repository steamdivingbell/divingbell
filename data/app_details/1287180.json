We played this game vary often and I miss playing it with her. After all this social distancing is over that is what I plan to do... I was just expecting it would have been over sooner... hopeful thinking I guess.\r\n\r\nI do wish that I could have added muti player, however I do not think that I ever will, I hope that families can play this game as a fun way to pas the time together... though in this modern day that is happening less and less often.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>When me and my sister were young, we would play this game to pass the time.
