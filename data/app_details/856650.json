{"about_the_game":"Pylon Racer is an experiment.

No HUD overlays, no ribbon in the sky to follow, no chase plane views. Fly it the way a pilot would, then watch the TV replay afterwards.<br></li><li>Insanely difficult. It is the <i>&quot;flappy bird&quot;</i> of flight simulation. There is no rookie mode to nurse you around. You will have to practice the turns repeatedly until you are in full control of the airplane.<br></li><li>Accurate simulation of a modern aerobatics plane. <br></li><li>Pure test of pilot skill. No upgrades, especially no in app purchases. Your time only reflects your skill as a pilot. I hope that combined with leaderboards for time and penalties it will foster a community that race each other for the top spot.<br></li><li>Fast stable game-play. Down to the minimum spec, my testers have all managed a guaranteed 60 fps. I feel so strongly about this aspect of gaming, that I will report bad frames as part of your results. In a game this fast, even a single slow (30 fps) frame will through you off balance. Combined with a 1000 fps joystick and flight model simulation, it is the smoothest simulation experience you can get.</li></ul><br><strong>From a developer perspective:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Trees. With 4 million individual leaves in the world, and more than half of them visible in a single frame at times, it was a chance to prove that 3 dimensional trees have a place in flight simulation.
