{"about_the_game":"Slurkum is a fantasy themed survival game designed to provide a unique experience. Explore a map of vast proportions with many points of interest, filled with a plethora of various monsters based on AD&amp;D lore. Towns, villages, ancient ruins and unholy places strewn across the map in various realms.<br><br>     Develop your skills and reputation at a casual pace, claim land as your own for your housing, speak with townspeople for quests and goods to trade.<br>Resources are plentiful through mining, hunting, monsters, and crafting throughout the land, and each region has it's own unique points of interest and monsters. Housing can be used with a land claim, factions can be joined for Order/Chaos conflict, capture bindstones for faction teleport networks.<br>     <br>      Game server environment is loosely based on key elements of popular mmo and simplified for a more casual gaming experience in that genre. Using a purely authoritative server architecture, Slurkum is made with the admin / host in mind, as well.
