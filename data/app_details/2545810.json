{"about_the_game":"You are an infinitely jumping cube, that doesn't mean that the challenges in front of you become any easier however, sometimes it is hard to stop yourself and sometimes you go too far, but can you make it just like you were before, in one piece?<br><br>This game was made in about 3-4 weeks. Floating Cuboid has you go through 20 levels filled with all kinds of challenges that you have to get through. You can jump an infinite amount of times while mid-air but you cannot stop your horizontal momentum. Watch out for death blocks because they will certainly be your doom.
