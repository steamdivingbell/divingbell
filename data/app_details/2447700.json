{"about_the_game":"<strong>God Brawl</strong> is a revival of the classic god game genre, with a campaign that will see you fight your way across many realms, gaining followers and wiping out rival gods. Use your powers to create land for your followers to build and expand, send them to capture shrines and worship you, and use their belief on deadly powers to destroy the heretics and their false gods. Beware, your rivals will not be complacent, your followers and your existence is in danger!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2447700/extras/godbrawlmeteor.gif?t=1728938217\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gain followers</h2>Raise land from the seas and flatten mountains to give your people a place to live. Your followers can only build on flat healthy land. Bigger settlements will have higher population capacities, extend your influence further, and have bigger maximum garrisons, The more followers garrisoned in a settlement the faster new ones will be born.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Capture shrines</h2>In order to survive and collect belief from worshippers, you must capture and hold shrines. The shrines are your gateway to the realm, and each one holds a godly power that you may unlock. You must hold all of a map's shrines to banish rival gods from the realm.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Use godly powers</h2>Use your god powers to sink, burn and explode the heretics away. You'll have some tough choices to make, like should you destroy those heretics with a meteor, or a volcano? God powers cost mana, which is dutifully generated for you by your followers. Best to keep an eye on their welfare, to make sure you don't run dry.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Command your followers</h2>Use commands to send available followers to capture settlements and shrines from rival gods, or to extend your influence into their lands to use your god powers. Your enemies will be seeking to do the same to you! Capture all of your rivals' shrines to declare victory.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Campaign</h2>The campaign will see you travel across multiple realms, battling enemy gods for control. You may encounter the occasional ally along the way, who will need to be politely vaporised when no longer needed. Maps will have different combinations of shrines and god powers available, as well as a few different biomes.<br><br><i>God Brawl is developed by a solo developer (me) and is under active development.
