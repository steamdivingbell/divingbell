For protection against radiation, micro-meteors and the harsh environment, underground lava tube caves are proposed for living and working areas. Lava tubes have water-ice for oxygen for breathing, hydrogen for rocket fuel and water to drink, and some have livable temperature environments. But bad computer code, or a computer virus has affected the robot dogs' artificial intelligence (AI) making them attack humans. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGrab your electro-magnetic pulse (EMP) gun to eliminate armed robot dogs with bad AI, reset computer to stop bad AI virus and rescue your team in a Lunar lava tube cave. Learn about Lunar lava tubes and how they may become the home for future astronauts on the Lunar south pole, and how AI can be a threat to humans.
