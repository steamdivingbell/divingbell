Bring back a little rest and relaxation into an angler's life.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Back to the island</h2>In your pursuit of fishing accomplishments you will do a lot of travelling. Since those ideal aquatic specimens that you need for your list live in all kinds of environments, you'll need to be ready for distant trips. From tropical islands to temperate rivers to harsher, colder climates \u2013 it's an opportunity not only to boast a broad range of fish but to also get in touch with nature.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Fine Catch</h2>Speaking of nature and fishing accomplishments, you're out in Angler's World to net that next impressive trophy. And these come in all shapes and sizes \u2013 from sweetwater to marine, small to large, and the duller to the more colorful, the game offers you the opportunity to encounter different species of fish.
