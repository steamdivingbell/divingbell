You are to lead a group of those humbled by impending dread: build and develop your settlement, gather resources, and protect your people from monsters that lurk in the dark. Take care of the settlers, make them learn crafts and military skills so their next sunset is not their last. Over time, you will have to leave the lands you developed and look for the new ones...
