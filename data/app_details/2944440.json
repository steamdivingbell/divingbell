{"about_the_game":"Gyras: Rogue is a Spinning Top RPG with in-depth customization, exciting battles, and crazy platforming. <br><br>Create you own gyra and follow the story as you gain enough reputation to challenge and take down increasingly powerful rivals and uncover the dark secrets of the most elite gyra players.<br><br><strong>Gyra Customization</strong><br>Each gyra is created from multiple parts that all influence your stats and abilities. Mix and match pieces to create the ultimate top, but beware, different challenges might require different approaches. Gyras also have various active skills that can change your gameplay. Choose your favorite abilities like Slowing down time, jumping, blocking attacks and more.<br><br><strong>Multiple Game Modes and Arenas</strong><br>In addition to the basic one-on-one battles, Gyras: Rogue includes parkour maps and survival challenges, all of which can take place in different arenas with potentially over-the-top (and under) elements : speed pads, bumpers, hammers, pits, tubes, fans and different physical properties are all used to make every event different. Sure you can beat that guy, but can you do it while spinning on ice with wind at your back ?<br><br><strong>Rivals-Based Progression</strong><br>You start as an amateur Gyra player investigating rumors about the top champions, but to challenge them and learn more you need to climb the ranks! Every champion on your path comes with their own sets of challenges you need to complete and requirements you need to fulfill before being able to challenge them and proceed to the next.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2944440/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727982211","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2944440/page.bg.jpg?t=1727982211","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2944440/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727982211","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2944440/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727982211","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Gyras: Rogue is a Spinning Top RPG with in-depth customization, exciting battles, and crazy platforming. <br><br>Create you own gyra and follow the story as you gain enough reputation to challenge and take down increasingly powerful rivals and uncover the dark secrets of the most elite gyra players.<br><br><strong>Gyra Customization</strong><br>Each gyra is created from multiple parts that all influence your stats and abilities.
