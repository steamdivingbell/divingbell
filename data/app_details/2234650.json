{"about_the_game":"Reclaim the lands of Zotenhold<br />\r\nLong ago - Zoten a courageous warrior,  had claimed the lands of eternity and life had flourished. Until corruption began to gloom over the shores. The evil that spread was given a name by Zoten. The Movalkin. Fierce and relentless, they swarmed in hundreds, even thousands. The lands of eternity were soon called Zotenhold.  Zoten's dominance against the Movalkin forced the creatures to seek stronger power, and thus evolved.  Corruption and darkness spread and civilization soon ceased to exist. To let those were alive sail across the seas to seek new life, Zoten remained. Swept into the ruin and shadow of evil some believed he is still fighting to this day. You have sailed back across the seas to take your revenge upon the Molvakin and reclaim what was long ago known as the lands of eternity. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSurvive and Conquer <br />\r\nSent from your homeland across the seas - You and your fellow warriors must harvest the lands of Zotenhold to build great fortresses against the Movalkin. Every night at dusk swarms of the Movalkin will seek to destroy what you have created. Give it all you've got. Raise your shields and hammers - for the enemy is not known for their power but their numbers. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCo-op Online Multiplayer PVP<br />\r\nHost your own server or join public listed servers. Create your set amount of players up to 10 players. Join our dedicated server with up to 100 players. Group up and build with other warriors. Horde your loot and share with your friends to conquer other fortresses to see who will be the strongest warrior in the lands of Zotenhold. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOpen world Procedural map <br />\r\nEvery game is different - Spawn in the grasslands and work your way into the harsh biome in the lands of Zotenhold. Travel across the ruins of Zoten, the deep forests, savannahs, deserts, oceans, beaches, and the rarest biome of them all - the scorched plains. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBuilding and Farming<br />\r\nCurrently four tiers of building and hundreds of items to craft. Start with nothing but work your way up from cloth to legendary armor wielded by only the strongest of warriors. Farm low - mid - and high tier crops. Slay the Movalkin to loot chests with all types of loot. Be unique and build your fortresses from scratch or raid enemy players.  Store your items and build walls to increase your defenses and keep our enemy warriors.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2234650/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1706569669","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2234650/page.bg.jpg?t=1706569669","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2234650/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1706569669","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2234650/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1706569669","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"Characters in underwear.
