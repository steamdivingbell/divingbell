{"about_the_game":"The Weapons Pack is a collection of weapons not normally issued to Helldivers. The weapons are both ultra modern experimental weapons and tried and true workhorses in new formats.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Weapons Pack contains:</h2>\u2022 PLAS-1 \u2018Scorcher\u2019: The first ever Helldiver issued plasma weapon. This primary weapon fires bolts of superheated plasma that explodes on impact. Super Earth scientists have gone to great lengths to ensure that the weapon is safe and reliable to operate, though this adds some limitations to the weapon such as lacking a full auto fire mode.<br>\u2022 M-25 \u2018Rumbler\u2019: The \u2018Rumbler\u2019 is a heavy portable mortar firing three round bursts of 80mm grenades. Though heavy and prone to ammunition shortage, the rumbler has the capability of firing at a variable distance, allowing the user precise control of where the shots land.<br>\u2022 AC-22 \u2018Dum Dum\u2019: The AC-22 is a 20mm cannon commonly found in the Helldiver arsenal, though usually mounted on vehicles. This is a shoulder carried version allowing for Helldivers on foot to carry a very powerful weapon that is excellent for taking out medium armored targets.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/395238/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1717620925","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/395238/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1717620925","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/395238/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1717620925","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/395238/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1717620925","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"The Weapons Pack is a collection of weapons not normally issued to Helldivers.
