{"about_the_game":"BITGUN is a top-down action roguelite with lots of blood and guns. Go on missions and kill hordes of zombies. Guns break quickly, make sure you bring enough ... but not too many because if you die, you'll lose everything. Dodge zombies jumping at you or crawling out of the ground and fight your way towards the zombie boss.
