{"about_the_game":"This scenery package adds more high resolution aerial images to your Aerofly FS 4 Flight Simulator for the United States of America regions to further enhance the ground image resolution in areas further away from any airports. Currently Aerofly FS 4 offers airports at the east and west coast of the USA. This DLC is ideal for VFR back-country flying if you have a bit of free disk space and a decent internet connection. The images are stored offline, no constant internet connection is required.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2011821/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1680680588","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2011821/page.bg.jpg?t=1680680588","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2011821/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1680680588","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2011821/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1680680588","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"This scenery package adds more high resolution aerial images to your Aerofly FS 4 Flight Simulator for the United States of America regions to further enhance the ground image resolution in areas further away from any airports.
