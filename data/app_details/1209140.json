Thanks to this technology, Bitard was able to infuse the consciousness of certain people with whom he had family ties. Now, with the help of this machine, Bitard will have to get through a huge amount of opposing force, headed by Zhmih himself. He will have to climb to the very top of the great tower in which Zhmih settled, and steal the last hope for the restoration of peace in the country, called &quot;Peace Data&quot;.
