{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Run and gun your way through a procedurally generated overworld. Collect loot as Zombiehood challenges you to manage random weapons, ammo, and artifacts while fighting through hordes of increasingly stronger zombies. With death comes a new beginning, as the map resets. However, progression continues in the form of experience points and money, which can be used to build your character stronger between runs.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>INTENSE COMBAT</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Combat in Zombiehood is deceptively deep. Enemies have certain weak points, armor, and resistances forcing you to stay on top of your game. Locational damage can bring about new enemy types as you shoot off limbs and heads. Movement is tight and weighty and non-commit dodges let you stay quick on your feet. Massive weapon variety keeps things interesting.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>EMERGENT ROGUELITE SYSTEMS</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Systems in Zombiehood build on top of each-other. As you collect dozens of weapons and upgrade your stats you'll discover artifacts. Artifacts shape the way you play by providing random gameplay modifiers that stack. Find synergy between these modifiers with the right weapons to create overpowered builds that blast through enemies.<br> <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3003120/extras/gif_zealot.gif?t=1736006311\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>INFINITE MAP VARIETY</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Maps are comprised of biomes, which are comprised of different level pools. These are randomly drawn and generated with each run, such that no two runs are ever the same. A fog of war covers the map, and you'll have to navigate through it to the final boss. Along the way you'll find shops to restock and heal, as well as random events that can help you or hurt you...</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>NEVER ENDING BATTLE</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Completing a successful run unlocks new &quot;skull difficulties&quot;. These difficulties stack up to 5 times, letting you face enemies up to level 50. Bigger enemies means bigger rewards, which allow you to upgrade your character in pursuit of peak min-maxxing.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3003120/extras/gif_dual.gif?t=1736006311\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong><br>KEY FEATURES</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Procedurally Generated Levels:</i> Every death brings a new map and a novel set of challenges.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Randomized Gameplay:</i> Navigate through levels with randomized weapons, ammo, and abilities.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Unyielding Zombie Hordes:</i> Employ strategic thinking to survive against relentless zombie waves.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Artifact Synergy:</i> Discover and stack artifacts to modify gameplay and create powerful builds.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Meta Character Progression:</i> Use experience points and money to build a stronger character between runs.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Dynamic Difficulty Scaling:</i> Unlock and challenge higher difficulty levels for greater rewards.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3003120/extras/gif_slomo.gif?t=1736006311\" /></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3003120/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736006311","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3003120/page.bg.jpg?t=1736006311","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3003120/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736006311","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3003120/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736006311","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":3029290,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Run and gun your way through a procedurally generated overworld.
