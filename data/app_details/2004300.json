It appealed to veterans of the strategy genre, while the intense, non-stop action of the battles brings the game close to being an action title, making it equally accessible to fight junkies like us.\u201d<br />\r\n84% \u2013 Retro Gamer (February 2006)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cThis game offers an excellent war simulation and many trials will be necessary before reaching a winning strategy, even at the easiest level.\u201d<br />\r\n83% \u2013 Tilt (May 1984)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cThe graphics and overall presentation are excellent ...
