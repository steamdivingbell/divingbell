Kovacs as part of the film team was brought on to score the game. Only knowing the concept of the game and one simple graphic, Kovacs was tasked with composing and recording a track in two days that would reflect the player\u2019s experience of floating and flying in VR space for the first time. Using a vintage Prophet 5 synth, he created the STRAYLIGHT title track - a slow-developing and ungrounded synthwave track, that is reflective of the unique experience that is the STRAYLIGHT game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2297400/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1675120266","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2297400/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1675120266","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2297400/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1675120266","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2297400/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1675120266","categories":[{"description":"Additional High-Quality Audio","id":50}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"With the soundtrack to <strong>STRAYLIGHT</strong>, players are treated to completely original, progressive synthwave tunes by award-winning composer, songwriter and VGM artist, Rob Kovacs aka 88bit.
