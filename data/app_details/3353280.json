{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Follow along with Zivraye on an adventure through the subvirtual! The story of Subvirtual is analogous to the creation process, such that closing the Infinity Chest at the end is akin to completing the MagiRouter -a device used to communicate from the Zivraye universe to many many others.

Cubes can be dug up (uncovered) using the VR shovel hand and flagged using the VR flag hand. Cubes uncovered, which are not bombs, will show either a number or will be blank. Blanks mean no bombs directly surround that cube; while numbers indicate how many bombs border that cube. Use this information to uncover all non-bomb locations and you win the match!
