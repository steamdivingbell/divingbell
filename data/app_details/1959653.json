{"about_the_game":"CONTAINER PRODUCTS \u2013 20/40FT DRY VAN CONTAINERS<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome months ago, when I was walking around a large shipping terminal in Waigaoqiao, Shanghai, I saw many colourful containers stacked together - which came from all over the world - looking like towering blocks of beautiful skyscrapers. From that time, I planned to make and place these cool iron boxes into my favorite simulator, making our experiences more awesome and more realistic. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, you will get a total of 10 styles of 20ft and 40ft dry van containers in your railroad world.
