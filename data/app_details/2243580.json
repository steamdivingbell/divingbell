{"about_the_game":"Food Fight: Culinary Combat is a third-person shooter based on the classic Atari game Food Fight. Charley Chuck is back, and this time the world is bigger and better than ever before. Enter the Atariverse, where you\u2019ll meet developers of the original Food Fight, as well as characters from classic Atari games like Centipede, Yars\u2019 Revenge, and more! You can also practice your skills at the shooting range, check out Atari artifacts in the museum, or head over to Antonio\u2019s for a slice. The real meat of this feast is the combat. Fill your fork with multiple game modes, like the winner takes all Buffet Brawl, or the floor-destroying Crumbling mode. That\u2019s not all! Find circuit boards to unlock fully playable Atari arcades. Get new outfits for your characters and customize their look.
