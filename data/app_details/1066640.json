{"about_the_game":"Inspired by the likes of MechWarrior, Armored Core, Pacific Rim, and more,  Soul Tech: Millennium is a fast-paced action packed, story-driven, (none-turn base) 3D mecha - shooter with 2-player split-screen versus. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe base BETA-DEMO includes 15 missions of the 50 to 55, 8 of the 40+ opponents you can face in the BATTLE GROUNDS, and all the base features of what is to be expected in the final release such as  a sort of &quot;email&quot; system in the game that helps further drive the story and character development, all with voice overs.<br />\r\nThis is a BETA-DEMO so some levels are subject to polish and to be further &quot;flushed out&quot;. Some character animation, special FX, UI, and other certain aesthetics are subject to polish. We welcome all feedback!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can also customize your Soul Tech's body parts and weapons color individually.<br />\r\nWith a nifty added detail to not just RGB values but how &quot;battle worn&quot; you look, to how, well, &quot;polished and shiny&quot; you are. You can also further enhance the stats most important to you with a stat modifier feature. Customization goes beyond your Soul Tech as you can, of course, key bind your controls to your liking - we take it, firing all those weapon won't always be so easy for everyone.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1066640?t=1555599094","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1066640?t=1555599094","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1066640/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1555599094","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1066640/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1555599094","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Inspired by the likes of MechWarrior, Armored Core, Pacific Rim, and more,  Soul Tech: Millennium is a fast-paced action packed, story-driven, (none-turn base) 3D mecha - shooter with 2-player split-screen versus. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe base BETA-DEMO includes 15 missions of the 50 to 55, 8 of the 40+ opponents you can face in the BATTLE GROUNDS, and all the base features of what is to be expected in the final release such as  a sort of &quot;email&quot; system in the game that helps further drive the story and character development, all with voice overs.<br />\r\nThis is a BETA-DEMO so some levels are subject to polish and to be further &quot;flushed out&quot;.
