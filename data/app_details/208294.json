At the outbreak of World War 2, the design was amended to allow cheaper and speedier production, and the Hunslet Austerity tank was born. Several works were charged with producing the J94 including Hunslet, Andrew Barclay Sons &amp; Co, W.G Bagnall, Hudswell and Clarke, Robert Stephenson's and Hawthorns and the Vulcan Foundry. Incredibly, the J94 continued in production for the National Coal Board almost until the end of British main line steam, with the last being produced for the NCB in 1964.
