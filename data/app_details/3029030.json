{"about_the_game":"A hectic fast-paced wave arcade game all about reflexes and using your time right!<br><br>Tucus is awoken in the middle of the night by the cries of his farm cows! In a rush, he races to the fields to defend his homestead from pesky wolf-like UFOs who really, and I mean REALLY like the taste of cows. Defend your farm with your trusty shotgun till the break of dawn, and save your farm from total destruction!<br><br><strong>DEFEND</strong><br>Turns out not just aliens want a piece of your farm! Defend your plants from the hungry rodent who always comes back, destroy abduction UFO\u2019s before they zip away with your cow, and dodge UFO bullets that can hurt you in several different ways.<br><br><strong>GROW</strong><br>Quickly grow your alien wheat that falls off destroyed UFOs! Shoot these invasive plants to encourage them to grow. Be quick, as they will die if you dont hit them in time.<br><br><strong>EAT</strong><br>Who knew running around like this would make you hungry? Eat your mature crops to stay full. If you go hungry, you lose! <br><br>Reload your gun by chasing down the ammo chicken to regain ammo. However, chickens gotta eat too! Keep them fed to keep a steady supply of ammo.<br><br>In order to clear waves you must harvest a certain amount of milk. Hungry cows don't make milk, so feeding them is the way to go!<br><br><strong>REPEAT</strong><br>So you beat a wave? Not bad. Could've done better. Beating waves faster and keeping more cows alive grants you a better rank. Try to get the best score possible!<br><br>Tired of your regular cows? There are over a dozen special cows to unlock which grant you special abilities to use against your invaders!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3029030/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731257879","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3029030/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1731257879","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3029030/f14162c4e7431ef008ae31ac9c23efcce552dbb1/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731257879","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3029030/f14162c4e7431ef008ae31ac9c23efcce552dbb1/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731257879","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A hectic fast-paced wave arcade game all about reflexes and using your time right!<br><br>Tucus is awoken in the middle of the night by the cries of his farm cows!
