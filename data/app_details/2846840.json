{"about_the_game":"<strong>Life in a faraway Galaxy</strong><br>Embark on an adventure to carve out a piece of the galaxy for yourself. Purchase property on a planet, and build your habitat. Interact with cities and its citizens, or rough it out on a world whose only population is you. Strive to increase your quality of living, to help pursue your goal of acquiring power and wealth. Experience the full breadth of a lifespan, as you develop your characters, make connections, reproduce, and rise through the ranks of career and society. <br><br><strong>Create your Legacy</strong><br>Create characters from a variety of species, give them unique personalities and have them work together toward a common goal. Watch as your characters live together and work, fostering friendships, rivalries, and families. Life is fleeting, so making sure you strategize each generation's right can ensure the longevity of your legacy. You may also create multiple legacies in the same galaxy, shaping it and affecting one another in their own ways.<br><br><strong>Build your Headquarters</strong><br>Purchase and settle land on a variety of planets, facing their biomes bravely. Choose to settle near civilization, and certain elements like acquiring food, water, and power are easier, but resources and privacy are scarcer. In the wild frontier of the galaxy, choosing to live on a planet whose only population is you brings different challenges, but untapped spoils are yours for the taking. <br><br><strong>Grow your Power &amp; Wealth</strong><br>Accumulate credits through careers, crafting, or piracy. Gain power by getting involved with politics, making connections and building your influence over your city, your planet, to the galaxy itself. Live life as simple to as grand as you desire, or even try to make your way in a galaxy your other legacies have improved or ruined in their own mission.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2846840/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730938425","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2846840/page.bg.jpg?t=1730938425","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2846840/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730938425","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2846840/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730938425","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"Synthaar is a simulation where one can go a pious route, or a more salacious route in order to gain money and power. Illegal fictional drugs and chemicals may be crafted by the player to sell for profit. \r\n\r\nCharacters may engage with violent behavior using guns or melee weapons with basic animations and the display of a dead character should they be killed. Characters are low resolution pixel characters with details of violence minimal, however blood may be spilled in combat encounters. \r\n\r\nSexual intercourse is present in the game as a means of pleasure and procreation, and does not show any explicit acts or nudity. Characters are without genitalia and all sexual acts are done through implication rather than animation under bed blankets, or other means of obfuscation."},"detailed_description":"<strong>Life in a faraway Galaxy</strong><br>Embark on an adventure to carve out a piece of the galaxy for yourself.
