{"about_the_game":"Warfront Defenders will attempt to take inspiration from the famous last stands of World War II and turn them into tactical games playable on small dioramas. <br><br>The first level of this game is based upon the Battle of Westerplatte, the first battle of WW2. Made in collaboration with the Museum of Westerplatte to derive inspiration from the actual event and design the level based on the actual maps from the period. Though this is not a chronological account of the battle, the gameplay and the tactics are heavily inspired by the proceedings of the historical battle and its challenges are designed to remember the defenders of Westerplatte.<br><br>Battle of Westerplatte was unique in many ways, and this game will try to reflect on that. Players can expect that they will be outnumbered, and outgunned, but not out of tactics. Also, expect enemies with brains, they will react to your strategies and apply counter-strategies to break down your defenses.
