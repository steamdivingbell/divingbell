{"about_the_game":"Radioactive is a turn based strategy game of nuclear war. The idea is simple: pick a Missile Silo, set the angle and range to your target and click Fire. Missiles will creep across the map of the world to destroy the enemy, so the game is a mix of turn-based and real-time play. An ideal game for several people, up to four players can take it turns to play.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis demo is a non-playable showcase of a game played by four computer opponents. It is designed for you to test the game engine on your PC to make sure it works, and to watch a game being played.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2334970/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737721514","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2334970/page.bg.jpg?t=1737721514","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2334970/3f411bb4f9a20988d943f7d4867a7f00bc3d7589/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737721514","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2334970/3f411bb4f9a20988d943f7d4867a7f00bc3d7589/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737721514","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Radioactive is a turn based strategy game of nuclear war.
