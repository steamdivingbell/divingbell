{"about_the_game":"The Pan Engines Bolt-on contains 2 extra stereo pan engines to boost capabilities of SFXEngine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDelay Pan is a stereo pan effect. This effect applies a delay to the left or right channels of the sound to create the illusion of a stereo pan, a psychoacoustic effect known as the Haas Effect. The effect is common in pop songs and gives a feeling of space to a panned sound. Delays longer than a few milliseconds can sound more spatial than panned and this effect is often used to add stereo space to otherwise mono effects. A delay of 50 or more milliseconds can add a lot of space to stochastic looping sounds such as rainfall or rivers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMono merges audio channels. This engine will make a stereo sound monophonic by mixing the channels. This effect is also commonly use to remove vocals from a stereo song because by mixing one channel with the inverse of the other channel, central sounds are removed and vocals are usually centrally panned. You can use this engine to render a mixed wave of your choice to mono using the Left or Right render options.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2729270?t=1734436124","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2729270/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1734436124","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2729270/3d963d3512070fd2f7753476aa32baedd9510edf/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734436124","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2729270/3d963d3512070fd2f7753476aa32baedd9510edf/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734436124","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Pan Engines Bolt-on contains 2 extra stereo pan engines to boost capabilities of SFXEngine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDelay Pan is a stereo pan effect.
