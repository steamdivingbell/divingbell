{"about_the_game":"Rocket Escape is an innovative 2D platformer about rocket jumping your way to the goal. Despite being around in gaming for a long time, rocket jumping is usually relegated to a side mechanic. However, we believed that rocket jumping could be so much more. Featuring mechanics such as slow motion/rocket time, speedrunning timers, black hole rockets, and more, Rocket Escape is an expansion on the time-tested concept of rocket jumping. We at Compact Square Studios have been working on Rocket Escape as a passion project over the last few years, and we are excited to be able to release the game on Steam and share it with the world.<br><br>We look forward to seeing how you approach and enjoy the game!<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2201680/extras/pickuplaunchersmol.png?t=1670204722\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Platforms and Scaffolds","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2201680/be872c686e30c68af4dd16b36a4c9604f25fac38.jpg"},{"name":"A Rusted Wasteland","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2201680/cd792e4378bb9c141357b6800ffe69744ed176d3.jpg"},{"name":"Global Horizons Orbiting Space Terminal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2201680/7a0100c06f994e66da81e059416f8ec6ab7da2d4.jpg"},{"name":"The Truth","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2201680/e134626753f7af39b817f8781b3653738a590c6f.jpg"},{"name":"Lore Analyst","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2201680/bb404e97447d925bbc51418d2c77e9d6232e5e46.jpg"},{"name":"Curiosity","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2201680/f4e437c6824b61e12385e0c9779b7b864028ba55.jpg"},{"name":"Lack of Motivation","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2201680/2f766d6913501b4494527a9ad2411b4f90cfc477.jpg"},{"name":"Wow, that was quick!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2201680/145c2766f9c8def950d22f55b95f46fd5ebb198f.jpg"},{"name":"Creativity","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2201680/d7398d54b0ce9cd7c74e9ec6912f535e394ffbbd.jpg"},{"name":"What.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2201680/469d07c336b80790aa0691f2cdc9611b6085c508.jpg"}],"total":12},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2201680/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1670204722","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2201680/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1670204722","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2201680/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1670204722","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2201680/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1670204722","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Rocket Escape is an innovative 2D platformer about rocket jumping your way to the goal.
