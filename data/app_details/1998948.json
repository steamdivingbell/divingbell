Neilston station followed close behind, opening in 1903, with the branches between there and Newton acting as a through route for coal trains. While the days of freight are long gone, both branches remain a core part of the Strathclyde commuter network to this day.<br><br>It\u2019s your job to take charge of the diverse services across this route; hurry commuters from the leafy suburbs and densely populated towns on the south bank of the River Clyde, up into the iconic Glasgow Central station.<br><br>Take control of the instantly recognisable \u201cPEP\u201d in the form of the BR Class 314 EMU, adorning ScotRail\u2019s Saltire livery, and go to work on a variety of services. Shuttle between Glasgow, Newton and Neilston, and call at stations along the entirety of the Cathcart Circle in both clockwise and anti-clockwise directions. Take things for a turn by running services from Glasgow to Glasgow, and bring trains in and out of Shields depot and Neilston turnback siding.<br><br>Choose how you want to play; drive trains, ride around as a passenger, complete the route tasks, or simply pick a vantage point and watch the action unfold.
