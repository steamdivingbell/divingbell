{"about_the_game":"Mills of Morris takes you on a puzzle adventure, where storytelling is just as relevant as progression. Explore the Meadow of Riddles and find out why Morris is so eager to become a human, throwing his frog life away.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Inspired By A Classic</h2>Every puzzle you\u2019re seeing relies on the core rules of the antique gem, Nine men\u2019s morris. Originally, it is supposed to be a two-player board game, but Morris was tasked to create so-called \u201cmills\u201d of disks that share a color.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\u2026 the Wizard Won\u2019t Stop There!</h2>On top of the inspiration concept\u2019s mechanics, you\u2019ll find yourself facing a rich set of assets, creating challenging scenarios!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Step By Step</h2>Morris - just like most of us - cannot solve the toughest puzzle with elements he hasn\u2019t even seen yet. Levels are progressively designed with growing complexity, while leaving room for guided and freefall learning.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Non-Linear Adventure</h2>Morris, if he so likes, is allowed to free roam across the Meadow, the game\u2019s Hub. Of course, if he doesn\u2019t solve all the tasks, the wizard won\u2019t grant his wish! However, he may follow an order of levels he prefers, or revisit some later.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Visual Experience</h2>Frogs can\u2019t read, right? But frogs can interpret visuals. The world focuses on guiding your journey without much text, letting the world speak for itself.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">You, the Creator</h2>Step into the shoes of the Wizard and create your own levels using the Level Creator tool! Every single asset is available at your disposal - it\u2019s time to get creative!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Share With Your Friends!</h2>You may upload the levels you create, and let the entire world play them! The leaderboards display completions with the best times and the least amount of moves.
