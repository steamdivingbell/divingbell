{"about_the_game":"Alma is an interactive narrative that captures the tension of work-life balance for healthcare workers. Play as Alma, a caring mother and pediatric nurse, who must tend to both aspects of her life. Alma is a story of self-care and the struggle to find balance in an imbalanced life. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlma must make consequential choices on how to spend her limited compassion. Throughout the game, Alma may choose to spend her compassion on her patients or her family. Be careful! If Alma uses her compassion too early in the day, she won't be able to spend compassion on important choices later.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nResponding to texts also costs compassion. Throughout her workday, texts will come in on Alma's phone, and she will have to decide whether to deny her current patient her compassion, or use that compassion for her relationships at home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlma will also occasionally have the option to be honest with people. While this may damage some work or home relationships, it will give Alma a much needed release and re-fill her compassion! Will you unload the stresses of being a single mom onto your boss when she asks how your night was? Or will you bottle it up in order to improve your chances for a raise?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlma's demanding job and stressful home life will provide many difficult trade offs, how will you handle them? Will you be able to leave every patient throughout the day feeling better? Will be able to stay close enough with your daughter? Will you have any compassion left over for yourself after a long workday? Play Alma today to find out!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1602190/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1703016318","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1602190/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1703016318","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1602190/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1703016318","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1602190/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1703016318","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Alma is an interactive narrative that captures the tension of work-life balance for healthcare workers.
