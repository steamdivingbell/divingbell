{"about_the_game":"Unbox Tactics is a rogue-like, turn-based tactical game that challenges you to strategically lead your party through procedurally generated dungeons. Each character is unboxed with unique abilities, and it's up to you to form the ultimate party to tackle an ever-evolving array of enemies and obstacles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you progress through dungeons, you\u2019ll earn gold and resources by defeating enemies and clearing challenges. These resources allow you to unlock and unbox new characters, each bringing distinct skills and combat styles to your party. Additionally, you\u2019ll encounter various items during your runs that can be combined to create powerful synergies, enabling your party to overcome tougher foes with enhanced tactics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeyond the immediate dungeon-crawling experience, Unbox Tactics offers meta-progression in the form of permanent upgrades. Between runs, you can invest in long-term upgrades that enhance your characters or provide your party with extra advantages for future attempts. This system allows you to grow stronger with each run, even if you fall short, ensuring that every attempt brings you closer to victory.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2873290?t=1735915315","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2873290/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1735915315","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2873290/d8cbba049843e4e83c84dc1a0e2f27650be24a95/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735915315","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2873290/d8cbba049843e4e83c84dc1a0e2f27650be24a95/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735915315","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Unbox Tactics is a rogue-like, turn-based tactical game that challenges you to strategically lead your party through procedurally generated dungeons.
