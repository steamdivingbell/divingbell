Enter dungeons to find 2D side scrolling levels where you hack and slash monsters to vanquish the evil bosses. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA unique action battle system where your hero moves through the level automatically and you use your skill and timings to attack, defend, reflect, and jump over dangerous obstacles. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe unique idle level grinding function is back.
