{"about_the_game":"Silence in Space is a point &amp; click game with science fiction and horror themes. It presents the story from the standpoint of the character Alan Blake, who is a galactic mercenary who captured, on the radar of his spaceship, a spacecraft drifting in space. He tries to contact it, but without success decides to go on board to see what happened. Arriving there, he encounters strange situations and begins to investigate what happened to the crew. The game was produced as a tribute to classic point &amp; click games such as Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis and Yahtzee Croshaw's horror saga. In addition, it has movie references and classic science fiction series, such as Aliens, Event Horizon, Doctor Who and Stranger Things.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"System Online ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/598600/0ce09da0817c57db5cf5d3a6e74d67121b16e311.jpg"},{"name":"Acess Allowed","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/598600/00b16b438ea063c75421ac908b531cde1087957f.jpg"},{"name":"The Code!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/598600/a1dee849f76a471fa81439f9fb9ba19f7cb3f4ba.jpg"},{"name":"Hackerman!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/598600/28643e74ae964c7e2594551778501fd2edbaa1e7.jpg"},{"name":"The Crack!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/598600/0b8554b9e7da0259b658f8069891218c130f9e71.jpg"},{"name":"Upside Down","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/598600/27c6bc5ad9aee8b47db55b6dfb637e49769c98d5.jpg"},{"name":"The Lost","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/598600/ebc5abb21e23e1d64e89b4f5d5490346ea9262e9.jpg"},{"name":"Search for the past","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/598600/05e222e2ff0fd2a243bda43ad86c248f111bce6a.jpg"},{"name":"The Cube","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/598600/ca556773f3e9744e823284c537cb794bf629f5df.jpg"},{"name":"The Thing!!!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/598600/9a29cb986c924e0c6ac9924ecbaba1a6cfbad03d.jpg"}],"total":15},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/598600/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1666988087","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/598600/page.bg.jpg?t=1666988087","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/598600/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1666988087","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/598600/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1666988087","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Silence in Space is a point &amp; click game with science fiction and horror themes.
