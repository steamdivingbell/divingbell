{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>RAVEN</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>STORY</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Raven is a renowned and respected doctor, committed to his profession despite his young age. He has cured many patients and pushed the boundaries of science and medicine. However, one day, he is unable to save someone he holds dear\u2014his wife\u2014who succumbs to a fatal illness. Despite using all his medical knowledge and experience, he loses her. This failure devastates him, not only as a doctor but as a person. The absence of his wife becomes an ever-expanding void, and the pain of this loss begins to consume his mind.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As days and weeks pass, reality begins to blur for him. No matter how hard he tries, he cannot accept the loss of his wife. Day and night, under the suffocating shadow of grief, he searches for a way out. He has tried every possible solution to ease his pain: meditation, therapy, medication... but nothing fills the growing dark void inside him. All that remains is hopelessness.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">One day, an old friend offers Raven an extraordinary suggestion. The friend shares a story about a mysterious figure who claims to be able to bring the dead back to life. Raven knows this claim is likely pure fantasy, but his overwhelming grief has driven him to the edge. Turning to this dark path that science would never accept has become his last hope.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">His friend tells him the name of this person, and that he lives in a remote village deep in the forest, in an isolated house. Despite thinking it\u2019s absurd, Raven feels an inexplicable pull toward this dark path. His deep yearning for his wife drives him to defy reason and take the forbidden road. He surrenders himself to this last chance, filled with a mix of desperation and hope, and sets out on his journey.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As he drives through fog-covered forest roads at dusk, Raven's mind is filled with questions. Is he doing the right thing? What if this person is just a charlatan? What if they are telling the truth? The further the road stretches, the darker it becomes, and the fear and hope inside him become tangled. As he heads toward the isolated, eerie house in the forest, Raven\u2019s fate is uncertain. Will he reunite with his wife, or will he find himself trapped in an even greater nightmare?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With his eyes fixed on the road ahead, Raven realizes he is about to make one of the hardest decisions of his life. Now, far from the cold light of science, he is stepping into a journey on the edge of darkness and the unknown.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>ATMOSPHERE</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game takes you through various eerie locations, from an old house to a desolate cemetery ruled by silence and mystery. With every step, you'll physically feel alone, but the presence of darkness and the unknown will ensure you never truly feel isolated.

In this dark world, where science's boundaries no longer apply, every choice you make will reshape your fate.
