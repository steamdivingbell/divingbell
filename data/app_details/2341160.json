{"about_the_game":"Harvest Uranus is a cross between action roguelite, farmsim and puzzle game. Embark on quests from opposing factions or choose a life of a freelancer, grow toxic plants, experiment with breeding, pesticides, flamethrowers, laser katanas, waterguns and other ridiculous tools; explore various planets and fight aliens while trying to earn money to travel to the next planetoid so you can get closer to your dream.<br><br><strong>Why?</strong><br><br>This is the question every person who happens to be born, living, or forced to end their life in the 22nd century is asking themselves.<br><br>While humanity fought over territory, property, and its own self-esteem, \u201cdomesticated\u201d plants slowly domesticate humanity. Closely controlling humanity's development and political actions, they rapidly increased crops population. But the moment wheat, corn, and rice united in The Herbal Collective... they were being domesticated by cows.<br><br>Now the cow overlords have discovered their two-faced nature and in a matter of hours have turned the world into a vast Cow Benevolent Dynasty in which plants and mankind had a very minor role to play - being the hardworking hands and dainty food of their lords.<br><br>This game is about suffering. And about madness. It takes a madman to escape the quiet collective farms of Venus and go to Uranus to try your luck, putting your life on the line for a little ephemeral freedom. But it's already happened, so enjoy growing toxic plants that will blow your mind for a pile of garbage, credits, and a roll of toilet paper.<br><br><strong>Key Features:</strong><br>- Get assignments from Cow Benevolent Dynasty or The Herbal Collective to grow plants and defend your base on the colony<br>- Explore planets, find new gadgets and find a way to get the hell out of here<br>- A New Chance: failure is not the end. There are many like you on the orbiting ship: just wake up the new adventurer and start your journey from the beginning","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2341160/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731969462","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2341160/page.bg.jpg?t=1731969462","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2341160/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731969462","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2341160/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731969462","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Harvest Uranus is a cross between action roguelite, farmsim and puzzle game.
