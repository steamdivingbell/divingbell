It's finding that one cave behind a breakable wall, leading to a powerful upgrade. It's looking at the undiscovered parts of your map and theorizing what could possibly be located there.

Sometimes they will simply join you as you progress through the world. Other times, you will need to actively perform specific quests in order to gain their trust.
