{"about_the_game":"Live your Top Gun dreams and battle fighter jets and choppers with Fighter Plane Pack Vol.1! Gee-kun-soft is back with another set of military-inspired vehicles, this time offering up 10 aircrafts with sleek shapes and ready to launch missiles. With static battlers, character sprites, and midair backgrounds for each vehicle, you\u2019re ready to literally take your games to the next level, thousands of feet above the ground!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBattle streamlined fighter jets, armored dual-prop helicopters, sci-fi drone jets, and more with this pack. Each battler comes with 2 versions, one for in the air and one for on the ground, so you can use them for more than just battles! Have a cutscene show off a fighter jet resting on its landing gear before a sudden attack forces your players to jump into action, or have the helicopter\u2019s blades stop when a powerful attack leaves it inoperable in battle. Let your players control a jet\u2019s character to fly around for on-map combat, or have them plan out a safe trip while controlling a transport plane full of supplies passed enemy lines.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack also includes bonus images with each vehicle placed in its background ready to use as a cutscene picture! Show one of the hi-tech jets blasting lasers before your heroes\u2019 base camp is destroyed, or after a poor choice force your players to watch the burning wreckage of a helicopter hang in the air for a moment before it plummets back to Earth.
