{"about_the_game":"\u201cI can give you that which you desire most. Your humanity.\u201d This was all that was promised to Callum R\u00f6ttwell in the mysterious email he received out of the blue one day. It was enough though for him to uproot his life and travel to the city of Starhaven to start anew. As an angel from a small town, he has to adapt quickly and learn how to interact with those he's never encountered before- demons. Especially since he must share a bedroom with one in a cramped apartment. Throughout this journey, Callum will meet many characters, explore the city of Starhaven, and dive deeper into what that strange email entails for him. But he must be wary, for his goddess is watching closely.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2703700/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1700789838","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2703700/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1700789838","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2703700/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1700789838","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2703700/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1700789838","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"\u201cI can give you that which you desire most.
