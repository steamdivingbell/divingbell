{"about_the_game":"Eye uv Eve is (maybe) the world's first First Person bullet heaven shooter, and almost definitely the first game featuring quattordectal gun wielding.  Descend into the arena and survive for 30 minutes against massive waves of enemies. Make it long enough and you can collect up to 14 stacking weapons. Fill the screen with bullets and magic to defend yourself. Level up and improve yourself and your weapons. Fulfill achievement to unlock new characters, weapons, and more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Eye is always watching. What it wants is a mystery...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEye uv Eve harkens back to the arena shooters of old, filtered through modern survivor/bullet-heaven games, with the twist of being able to wield 14 guns at once. Each gun has a unique mechanic and can be leveled up over the course of a 30 minute run and evolved to fire more bullets, faster, and weirder. You'll face off against an endless horde of Angels and Demons as you fly and sprint around the arena looking for the next gun. Collect the hearts of your enemies to unlock permanent upgrades and items to equip to come back faster and stronger in the next run.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2319170/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1699019821","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2319170/page.bg.jpg?t=1699019821","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2319170/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1699019821","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2319170/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1699019821","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Eye uv Eve is (maybe) the world's first First Person bullet heaven shooter, and almost definitely the first game featuring quattordectal gun wielding.
