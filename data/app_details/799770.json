{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/799770/extras/sp1.png?t=1519124729\" /><br>Basically, you are in control of an Eight-ball that gets thrown on different platforms and needs to achieve a certain goal. Now, the platforms are consisted of smaller dice blocks, each dice block has a certain value of numbers on it and a certain color.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/799770/extras/sp2.png?t=1519124729\" /><br>The goal in each level is to honor the dice block pattern given to you at the left side of the screen. For example, the pattern asks of you to have 2 green dice blocks with the value of 3, 1 green with the value of 2 and 3 reds with the value of 4. (Note at this point that there are 5 possible colors of the dice blocks and their value is from the range from 1 to 5). The main part now - after rolling on a certain dice block and rolling back of it, its appointed value will be risen for 1 unit. This will keep happening until the value is 5.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/799770/extras/sp3.png?t=1519124729\" /><br>Strategy is very important in order to beat the levels in this game, for you have to think before you roll. It is not a rare case that the player rolls up values a little bit too much and the pattern is therefore out of reach. So, develop your own way and see what works out the best.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/799770/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1519124729","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/799770/page.bg.jpg?t=1519124729","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/799770/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1519124729","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/799770/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1519124729","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/799770/extras/sp1.png?t=1519124729\" /><br>Basically, you are in control of an Eight-ball that gets thrown on different platforms and needs to achieve a certain goal.
