{"about_the_game":"Imagine waking up on a small dock with no recollection of who you are or how you got there. The first person you find is a grumpy, old man who enlists you to work on his ferry boat which seems to have materialized behind you. But not all is as it seems on this strange ship, and the people you meet may know more about your past than they let on.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPort of Call is a narrative exploration game that focuses on telling the player an immersive story. The game is an experiment in short-form storytelling in an immersive media. Interact with the ship's passengers and explore your surroundings in first person to try to uncover the secret of your past.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Bad Barkeep","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/356520/dd275f72851a0d1eaeea57405ebfdfb31fc52ee3.jpg"},{"name":"All Aboard","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/356520/2dd6b07b98923111933f425eadac4e6ad4fe24b9.jpg"},{"name":"Art Connoisseur","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/356520/f899866b205b8d5c42df921d93bcf63b7359fd46.jpg"},{"name":"Crayon Hoarder","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/356520/e5a03a6f2e2138edba6bbb6a1cda68ab5d02ab3b.jpg"},{"name":"Rite of Passage","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/356520/1e8a34d517d8d1ea7e83572d6bbc4e5e8488ec8b.jpg"},{"name":"The Other Side","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/356520/3007ff679f3db78802f8e1f750948f84e6fddb39.jpg"},{"name":"No Place Like Home","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/356520/4304a76ae2a9c39d79b53b1a548aa70e739f5c5d.jpg"}],"total":7},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/356520/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1447370834","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/356520/page.bg.jpg?t=1447370834","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/356520/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1447370834","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/356520/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1447370834","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Imagine waking up on a small dock with no recollection of who you are or how you got there.
