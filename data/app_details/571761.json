This means that the Khemri team surpasses the other Undead teams when playing the ball as they can run and pass almost as well as similar players of the living races.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHaving a few faster players who can pass and run with the ball has its advantages but not if their team mates can\u2019t keep up with them. With the majority of its team made up of shambling Skeletons and lumbering Mummies, the Khemri Coach needs all his centuries of experience not to lose his most useful players early on in the game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/571761/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1640279247","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/571761/page.bg.jpg?t=1640279247","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/571761/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1640279247","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/571761/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1640279247","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Over 8,000 years ago, the Khemri played the first ever games of Blood Bowl against the Slann.
