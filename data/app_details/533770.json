{"about_the_game":"<strong>27.08.2014</strong><br><br>What if I could invent a way to change identities, becoming a different person almost instantly, choosing a new self, as though from a catalogue?

They would stay on your mind, swapping and switching, until you make a choice. Then you pop one more pill, and the future you like, the future of your choice, becomes your present in a couple of nights. Another thing required would be a program capable of scanning the subconscious and recording everything that happens there. All you would have to do for it to work is lock yourself in a small room to produce a dense aura\u2014required to transfer data from the subconscious to the program.
