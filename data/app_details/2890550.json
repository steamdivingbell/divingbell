Along with him is his dutiful assistant, the Metaldead, a necromatic musician always eager to hype up her now ghostly partner! This duo isn't just undying, it's post-dying, too!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Stone Cold is a frosty, frigid fighter... an ever-cold elemental... a bone-chilling brawler.

Despite being a mere mortal, this basement-dweller fancies himself quite the magic aficionado (just ask the five magic-related subreddits he moderates). But whatever you do, don't insult his waifu 4 laifu, or he'll have no choice but to unsheath his (totally authentic) katana and defend her honor!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Don't let his flimsy fairy wings fool you: Rock Hard is packing! A punch, that is. His rippling muscles will intimidate any foe who dares draw near, but all he really needs is his tiny pink wand to vanquish them.
