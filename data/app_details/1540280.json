{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Marco Volo: Arrival (2E)</h2><i>Marco Volo - Arrival</i> is the last volume of the <i>Marco Volo</i> trilogy, designed for four to eight player characters of 6th to 8th level. When the characters first set off on an intrigue-laden journey to Shadowdale, they did not suspect how much trouble they would get into. Joined by Marcus Wands (also known as <i>Marco Volo</i> ), they found him just a bothersome but likeable little rogue. No one suspected he was on the run from the crazy wizard Sabbar. The troublesome Marcus had previously stolen from him a rare artifact called the <i>Dragonking's Eye</i> , and hid it in the Spiderhaunt Woods. Now the party approaches the Spiderhaunts, and Marcus insists on diverting the group to retrive the <i>Eye</i> . But strangethings have been happening there. There are rumors of an oddly constructed keep of bone (or is it crystal?): of a warlord out for conquest (or is it a lich?); of goblin tribes strangely clad, an extra-planar beings banding with the giant spiders of the aptly named Spiderhaunt Woods. Something evil has denned at the heart of the forest. It has a mind of its own...and it has plans for Faerun. The last volume of the <i>Marco Volo</i> trilogy gives a DM tools to run this free-wheeling, fast-paced adventure, and the secrets of the powers at work behind the scenes. The player characters must face - and deal with - the mad wizard Sabbar, the annoyed Volothamp Geddarm (who wants to have &quot;a little chat&quot; with Marcus!), and ultimately the <i>Dragonking's Eye</i> itself. Even the gods themselves step in to have their say. In a dramatic denouement, this epic adventure draws to a close, but the memory of what transpired will live on!<br><br><strong> <i>We (Wizards) recognize that some of the legacy content available on this website does not reflect the values of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise today.
