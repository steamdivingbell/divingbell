/></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Ken, a high school student, is suddenly swallowed into another world, and he decides to take desperate action to rescue his younger sister.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In this strange world illuminated by the red moon, a terrible tragedy unfolds....</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A tense search and a battle to the death await you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">For those who love the survival horror of yesteryear, this is a gem of a game experience.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">[Search]</h2><p

the next step in order to open up the blood path.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Battles deplete your HP and weapons, so collect items in the dungeon.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">However, the dungeon

to escape.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">[Combat]</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Combat is a turn-based battle system.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">So you will be faced with the choice of defeating the enemy and obtaining items, or running away to save wear and tear.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Even if you choose to run away, it does not mean that you will be able to escape for sure. ......</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Encountering enemies in this game is a big risk in itself.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">[Fear System]</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the fear system, which is a distinctive system, there is a &quot;fear gauge&quot;.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When the fear gauge reaches its maximum, allies are put into a state of fear.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When this happens, defenses are greatly reduced for several turns,</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The battle becomes overwhelmingly disadvantageous.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Before or after this happens, the fear must be eliminated.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">To do this, you need an item called a &quot;talisman.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The talisman can be used during or outside of battle and will completely eliminate the fear.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Fear can also be eliminated by using the &quot;spring water&quot; in the dungeon.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Note that the fear gauge is also raised when you encounter &quot;terrible events&quot; in the dungeon.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">[Nanomachines]</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As the game progresses, the protagonist obtains an ability called a nanomachine.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Once this ability is released, the protagonist will be able to use special skills in battle.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The use of skills consumes Energy.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Energy is zero at the beginning of the battle and increases with the passage of turns.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This ability will be most effective when dealing with tough enemies.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2360350/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733151607","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2360350/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1733151607","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2360350/c28a04ce7613eff5a7a5f138dbee27662ede15dc/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733151607","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2360350/c28a04ce7613eff5a7a5f138dbee27662ede15dc/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733151607","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full
