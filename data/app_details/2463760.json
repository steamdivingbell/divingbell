{"about_the_game":"Stream from a cute cat caf\u00e9, where viewers can interact with the cats in the environment with redeems or bits.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGive your viewers more interaction on your streams, by converting those cheers or redeems into visuals in your background. Viewers get their names displayed against the kitties they command and are rewarded for their engagement by being a part of the stream, with their Twitch usernames displayed in screen against the chaos they cause.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis App is designed for 2D and 3D Vtubers who use VTubeStudio, VSeeFace, VNyan or Warudo (or any other app with spout2 capture). For other apps you can still use Cat Cafe as a background, although pulling your vtuber into Cat Caf\u00e9 provides best results with some redeems appearing over your vtuber.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince channel points and bits are used, you should also have at least affiliate status for your Twitch account to utilize the features.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2463760?t=1690985155","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2463760/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1690985155","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2463760/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1690985155","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2463760/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1690985155","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Stream from a cute cat caf\u00e9, where viewers can interact with the cats in the environment with redeems or bits.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGive your viewers more interaction on your streams, by converting those cheers or redeems into visuals in your background.
