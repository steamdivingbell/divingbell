{"about_the_game":"Take out your targets in a crowded elevator and escape before hitting the ground floor! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSix Floors Under is a Sokoban-style puzzle game where you are tasked with eliminating a target in an elevator without being seen. You must manipulate the other people on the elevator, stay out of sight, kill your target stealthily and escape - All before the elevator reaches the ground floor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTake on a series of missions assigned to you by operator Panda, or create your own levels to share with friends using the in-game level editor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWill you take escape scot-free? Or will you wind up Six Floors Under?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSix Floors Under was originally created as a submission for Ludum Dare 54, which placed 99th overall, 33rd in audio, and 44th in visuals. This is the fully imagined version of the game, complete with upgraded sounds and visuals, all-new levels, more NPC types, more complex targets to tackle, and an all-new level editor. We hope you enjoy it!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2902590/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1712632320","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2902590/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1712632320","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2902590/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1712632320","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2902590/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1712632320","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Take out your targets in a crowded elevator and escape before hitting the ground floor! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSix Floors Under is a Sokoban-style puzzle game where you are tasked with eliminating a target in an elevator without being seen.
