{"about_the_game":"SymbioPhobiA is a short survival horror game, mainly from an isometric perspective that mixes action, exploration, puzzles and platforming that takes place in a futuristic and post-apocalyptic bunker that has an oppressive and claustrophobic atmosphere. The duration of the game is about 2-3 hours and it would be a first chapter in which we wanted to focus more on the gameplay than on the story. If this game has enough support we will be able to continue developing the remaining 2 chapters and improve the current one, and thus close the story with the 3 parts in which it is intended.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2><br>In a dystopian future where people live in bunkers to survive outside radiation you are sent from Colony 9 to Colony 7, with which contact has been lost, to obtain information and samples from a genetic experiment that would allow humans to survive outside radiation.<br>In this first chapter you enter Colony 7 through the water treatment plant area and your goal is to reach the maintenance area and gather information.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2><br>Mainly from a Topdown view, but closer than usual, you have to explore claustrophobic and dark environments without any map references. In specific areas, the normal camera will be changed to a fixed camera. In order to advance you need to solve puzzles, push or drag objects, climb, jump and run. You'll face enemies that can surprise you in the most unexpected corners and that you shouldn't underestimate even if you think you'll have already killed them with the next shot. To help you on your adventure, you can collect medkits and ammo. You'll need to search for keys, activate switches, and search for information in order to progress through the adventure. At the moment you have your starting weapon and another weapon that you will have to find a way to access.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Explore a labyrinthine and claustrophobic futuristic bunker fraught with dangers.<br></li><li>Face off against dangerous and misshapen monsters that can dodge your shots and give you a hard time.<br></li><li>Solve interesting puzzles<br></li><li>Find keys and activate mechanisms to enter other areas.<br></li><li>Drag objects or drop them so you can climb them up or unlock the passage to other places.<br></li><li>Jump, crouch, climb, run, shoot.<br></li><li>The game camera is closer than the rest of the games with a topdown view, making the game more immersive and making the player have to be more alert to avoid possible dangers.<br></li><li>You'll find specific areas with a fixed camera in the style of classic survival horror.<br></li><li>And be careful, because you may get an unexpected scare.<br></li><li>The protagonist is a young girl with an exotic figure.<br></li><li>Several types of bipedal enemies differed mainly between mutated humans and Marauders, of which the latter were stronger, faster and more intelligent.<br></li><li>You will have to face some final boss.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mature Content</h2><br>This game contains scenes of intense violence and blood and gore.<br>This game may contain partial nudity.

The initial idea of the head of the project was to create a survival horror mainly from an isometric perspective focused on action, that had puzzles with a more classic style but giving it a more innovative touch, and that in addition to all that had platforms. This project tries to offer a different experience to all the games of this genre starting from the same ingredients but making its course more dynamic and less slow, trying to avoid falling into boredom or frustration. So we want you to enjoy our game and allow us to offer you a higher quality and many more good ideas that we want to implement in the next 2 chapters that would close the full game.</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2818800/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725796630","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2818800/page.bg.jpg?t=1725796630","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2818800/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725796630","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2818800/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725796630","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"Frequent violence and gore, mutilated and dismembered bodies.
