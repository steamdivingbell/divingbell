{"about_the_game":"This DLC contains one Hunter, one Weapon, and one Tool:<br />\r\n- Teche Wraith (Hunter)<br />\r\n- Wraith's Hand (Springfield 1866 Striker)<br />\r\n- Verbena (Knife)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSmall and delicate, a choir of pastel purple bunched, fist-like, shading the hidden blades of its subtle, woody thorn. So-named is the Verbena blade, a subtle but steadfast companion for those who stalk the Bayou with stealth. Like the Teche Wraith: that insidious trickster, that Bayou Puck, that outlaw. With theatrical flair he bests his enemies, his Springfield never far from his hand, and a laugh never far from his lips \u2013 in spite of all that has befallen his family, and in spite of the corruption that walls them in on every side.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, the threat of a greater shadow at hand, one he has fought \u2013 and bested \u2013 before, the Teche Wraith shines out from the shadows, striking at its dark heart. Shadow takes shadow, dawn takes night, camouflaged and protected by the very same energy that fuels that unspeakable being.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nLight my shadow, dark my days.
