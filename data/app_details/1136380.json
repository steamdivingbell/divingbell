Each one is stunning in its appearance, with local flora and fauna replicated in minute detail. Feast your eyes on the fascinating locations in Ultimate Fishing Simulator 2, which will continue to appear more and more with each update.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Jackson Park (USA)</strong><br>Uncle Sam invites fishing enthusiasts to the state of Wyoming. Specifically, on the banks of Flat Creek, a tributary of the Snake River, which is one of the most important rivers in Yellowstone National Park. What kind of fish will you find here?

A perfect place would be the Zalasie summer resort, located in the heart of Warmia and Masuria. It is there that Gi\u0142wa Lake, also known as Renty\u0144skie Lake, is home to the common barbel or the mighty white amur.<br></li><li><strong>Mountain River (Slovakia)</strong><br>Fans of mountain angling will have a great time in Slovakia, a country whose area is more than 60 percent covered by the numerous ranges of the Western Carpathian Mountains. This means that almost all rivers there are mountain rivers. And this heralds, above all, the picturesqueness of the landscapes and the wild harshness of the angling challenges. By the way - this location is a veritable paradise for fly, spin, and surface ground baits anglers. Among the species of fish, you can catch here are rainbow trout and Danube salmon.<br></li><li><strong>Kiel Canal (Germany)</strong><br>In front of you is the maritime waterway connecting the Baltic Sea with the North Sea. This artificial waterway, located in the north of Germany, was built at the end of the 19th century with the aim of the faster and safer passage of ships between the two seas. With the Ultimate Fishing Simulator 2, it can become the place for successful fishing trips for you. Especially as you will find both fresh and saltwater fish, including sea trout and pike-perch.<br></li><li><strong>Kurile Lake (Russia)</strong><br>Move to the Asian part of Russia, to the southern tip of Kamchatka. That's where you'll find the volcanic Kurile Lake, the largest lake on the entire continent. In the game, you will get the opportunity to explore the surrounding lakes and the rivers they are connected by. Inter alia, silver carps and humpback salmons are swimming in them.<br></li><li><strong>Blue Bay (Thailand)</strong><br>Thailand is a real paradise not only for tourists but also for fishermen. In addition to the beautiful sandy beaches, we also have clear, turquoise waters that are rich in food. This in turn means one thing: an abundance of fish species. And not just any fish, because this is where you can catch the mighty tiger shark on a fishing rod, but also smaller specimens, such as the spectacular red lionfish.</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1136380/extras/60fishspecies-min.gif?t=1733226205\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Catch the 5-meter giant of the seas!

These have been reproduced extremely realistically in terms of appearance. However, that is not all. Each fish defends itself against being caught in a different way.
