{"about_the_game":"Zombie Slapper is a Wave-Based Zombie Survival where the goal is to survive as many waves as possible. You have super human slapping abilities and can send zombies flying with your hand cannon. As you progress through rounds, you can improve your characters stats and unlock new attacks and abilities. You have powerful ultimates that can be used to wipe out hordes of zombies and there are various power-ups around the map to give you an edge. Zombies get faster and more powerful as rounds increase and harder enemies will spawn as you progress. How many rounds can you survive?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/f2c8yC3SgB<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNote: This is a first release from Lazy Goose Games and is meant to be a fun game that you can play casually in between other games. This isn't a huge story driven open world type game by any means but more meant as a fun break. Thanks for checking it out!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you are a streamer, curator, youtuber that would like to feature this game feel free to email me!
