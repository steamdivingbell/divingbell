{"about_the_game":"Welcome to Gehenna, a brutal frontier planet at the outskirts of space. You've come to the humble town of Vestige in hopes of collecting a bounty on The Devil Riders, a violent gang of beast-riding mercenaries. Only the scrappiest folks have managed to survive out here - like Rose, a tough-as-nails warrior who's as keen with a katana as a pistol, and Juno, a rugged brawler most locals call The Hatchet. <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1233060/extras/DLC3.gif?t=1692309310\" /><br>To take down The Devil Riders, you'll need to learn new tricks to survive Gehenna. Indigenous plants and experiments left behind by a mysterious company open up new approaches to combat and exploration: make enemies turn on one another with the Traitorweed, beam yourself to faraway areas with a Telezapper, and more.
