In addition, the Europe Pack comes with three new enrichment items to keep your animals entertained. Alpine ibex can use the Goat Climbing Mountain\u2019s clustered boulders to display their nimble traversal skills; European fallow deer and Alpine ibex can enjoy meals from Scarecrow Feeders; and Eurasian lynx can use the rough surfaces of Rubbing Pad Bark to scratch their itches. Existing animals can also make use of these items.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>250+ BOLD NEW SCENERY PIECES</strong></h2>Build and decorate using fresh creative options inspired by picturesque European locations, including iconic cities such as Venice and Amsterdam. Erect ornate bridges over shimmering bodies of water; add native foliage including London plane tree, cork oak, and grape vine, and put up new medieval-themed animal signs.
