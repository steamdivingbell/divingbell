However, with the passage of time, <br>\u3000interaction with the Utsushiyochigai decreased and their culture became obsolete. <br>\u3000Eventually, humans forgot their boundaries with the Utsushiyochigai and lost their relationship with the gods and Yokai. <br>\u3000In this way, the gods and Yokai became a part of this world. <br>\u3000Thus, gods and Yokai disappeared from our world and were treated as phantom beings. <br>\u3000They are now treated as phantom beings.<br><br>\u3000<strong>\u2161.
