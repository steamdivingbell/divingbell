You play as a gas station attendant who must work the night shift in a rural gas station when things start to go bump in the night. You must try to juggle your responsibilities as a worker while dealing with a monster who may be much less scary and more of a pain in the neck but no one knows how many monsters lurk in the night.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2951520/extras/car.png?t=1727787692\" /><br><br>Key Features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>First Person</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Blend of Comedy and Horror</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Approx: 30mins playtime</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Retro Graphics</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2951520/extras/fall01.png?t=1727787692\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"First Day On The Job","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2951520/bc69875fe59d66214f37ca94c23c4883afa6333e.jpg"},{"name":"Rat Catcher","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2951520/b45a843479f2826c4ccd947fb2488893a1b0023f.jpg"},{"name":"We Only Sell Cereal?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2951520/9d35556b0e5627b7e0ed8de3a7a6e66d01b46e30.jpg"},{"name":"They Call Me The Trash Man","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2951520/6cb6bfbe51f40df8a17bc18261edefdb18af7022.jpg"},{"name":"Best Friends Forever!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2951520/205b2c1393d639e56355109e3ff2bf16074f3ccc.jpg"},{"name":"Meet The Old Man","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2951520/e23b699ba196a1f8b9a06a8e056eda1b215dc79e.jpg"},{"name":"What Am I, A Mime?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2951520/278713fba4cafedb0cae45e37d3f054e4e48b999.jpg"},{"name":"Closing Time","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2951520/b59e84ab0669e0bcde03192953c549699d62896e.jpg"},{"name":"YOU PUT THE BROM BACK!!!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2951520/508f0021bfb3032c84e48638aceb045b6cd7124f.jpg"},{"name":"My Happy Place","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2951520/11eed8eda0aeae24afb22a3b2733957bc4cda6d2.jpg"}],"total":19},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2951520/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727787692","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2951520/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1727787692","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2951520/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727787692","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2951520/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727787692","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2951520/extras/trash3.png?t=1727787692\" /><br>Bite Night is a comedic first-person horror game that explores the idea of what if the big scary monster was bad at being big and scary.
