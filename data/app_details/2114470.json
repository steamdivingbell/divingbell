The world we are familiar with has disappeared because of the world war. The people who survived built cities and villages on the wasteland, while some people wandered in the wasteland and became bandits. The world is revived, waiting for you to create a new world!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Real world</h2>The whole world is just like the real earth, with real sun and moon alternation, revolving around the sun. The real longitude and latitude make you feel like you have returned to the Age of Exploration and explore the entire earth. People in every place on the earth have their own data and behavior. Individual groups are the cornerstones of markets, banks, governments, shopping malls and factories, and maintain the operation of institutions. This also means that every town or village develops, operates and declines like the real world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Trade and battle</h2>You will play the role of a wandering merchant to explore and adventure in the world. Trade and battle will be the theme of your game. In the carefully constructed economic world, you can borrow money from banks, buy and sell factories, earn money, and upgrade airplanes. Your actions also affect all aspects of towns and villages, and even the government's tax rates. Of course, there are more ways to play waiting for you to discover!","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2114470?t=1721717169","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2114470?t=1721717169","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2114470/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1721717169","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2114470/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1721717169","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2114470/extras/\u5546\u5e97\u4ecb\u7ecd\u52a8\u56fe.gif?t=1721717169\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Near future worldview</h2>The game takes place in the near future.
