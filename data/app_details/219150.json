{"about_the_game":"<strong>Hotline Miami</strong> is a high-octane action game overflowing with raw brutality, hard-boiled gunplay and skull crushing close combat. Set in an alternative 1989 Miami, you will assume the role of a mysterious antihero on a murderous rampage against the shady underworld at the behest of voices on your answering machine. Soon you'll find yourself struggling to get a grip of what is going on and why you are prone to these acts of violence.<br><br>Rely on your wits to choreograph your way through seemingly impossible situations as you constantly find yourself outnumbered by vicious enemies. The action is unrelenting and every shot is deadly so each move must be quick and decisive if you hope to survive and unveil the sinister forces driving the bloodshed. Hotline Miami\u2019s unmistakable visual style, a driving soundtrack, and a surreal chain of events will have you question your own thirst for blood while pushing you to the limits with a brutally unforgiving challenge.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Combo Beginner","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/219150/20917c6b4638be28909a721702effd1452811ed6.jpg"},{"name":"Combo Intermediate","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/219150/836f00d63afd72deb3f55fc44c27ce106a0dd157.jpg"},{"name":"Combo Pro","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/219150/d5a6850b54add0fb769cfe3fbaba03783b855595.jpg"},{"name":"Combo Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/219150/ec17dac62f257dae694b039058651cb91e58bbd8.jpg"},{"name":"Combo King","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/219150/007faddcfc21b18679bfe50a7ef16dad8f0e2bd8.jpg"},{"name":"The End?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/219150/3d1a1b1244edc36f80d4433dd893683200527f7d.jpg"},{"name":"That's It?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/219150/ab8a7a4b855b7d4173eadb5ba05d9b8e7cf44598.jpg"},{"name":"This Is It","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/219150/3909d7641ab8d5e99865ff087c46be97c27ffc6d.jpg"},{"name":"Aced It","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/219150/a1c591495f0b77a272eb2d3284cb6b3d061b55ea.jpg"},{"name":"Get A Life","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/219150/2778bcc507c5e065608a303cea86cf68a02ef73d.jpg"}],"total":35},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/219150/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1686261983","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/219150/page.bg.jpg?t=1686261983","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/219150/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1686261983","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/219150/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1686261983","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>Hotline Miami</strong> is a high-octane action game overflowing with raw brutality, hard-boiled gunplay and skull crushing close combat.
