The goal of Iron Flag is to expand on the training missions that come with it and teach you new things not found there.

They have leaned on real civilian and USAF pilots, including a few A-10 drivers, other subject matter experts, and many within the DCS community to help them bring you the definitive A-10 training experience.<br><br>Iron Flag Part 1 is split into 10 Training missions that focus heavily on many of the systems used for flight, navigation, and emergencies, including CDU functionality and usage, TACAN navigation, ILS landing, emergency flight control (MRFCS) usage, TAD/SADL functionality, and everyone's favorite: Aerial Refueling.<br><br>Part 1 of the campaign also introduces you to effective employment of the A-10C and its weapons, with missions focusing on DSMS and CMSP systems, TGP usage/functionality, Air-to-Air application of the gun, and AIM-9M and of course using the GAU-8/A in its intended Air-to-Ground role!
