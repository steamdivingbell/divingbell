{"about_the_game":"Among the Skies is an indie naval-style game based around medieval airships built like castles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe goal is to construct a base, build an airship, and conquer territory. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is 47 different areas to conquer. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd throughout your conquest of this vast land, you will encounter many different enemies. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith 19 different enemies appearing in your quest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese enemies are constructed of lost, foreign technology. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBuilt up of unfamiliar stones they fly around seemingly on their own will.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd they will grow stronger and more numerous the farther you progress. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you best all of these enemies and conquer all there is to be conquered but still crave blood, <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThen there is a feature to reset your territory and scale enemy strength while still keeping your technological progression.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is 6 buildings and 12 upgrades to construct for your base.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can use these buildings to help you research technology, create new modules, and gather more resources.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game uses a modular airship construction system. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can use 28 different modules to construct a fantastical airship of your design to eliminate enemies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese modules can reinforce your ships armor or give you powerful buffs at your command.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIncase you're unsure, there's a demo available.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI hope you enjoy, regardless.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI plan on regularly updating this game into the foreseeable future.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1982190/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1654298668","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1982190/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1654298668","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1982190/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1654298668","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1982190/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1654298668","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family
