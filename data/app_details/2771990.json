The game features lots of interactions with objects in the house to make you feel better while playing. At the same time, the game itself is very random and sometimes confusing. You will wander through long corridors that take you to places you can't even imagine.

You play as a 10-year-old boy named Sam who falls asleep watching TV while waiting for his family. Sam is home alone, waiting for his family to return. But it's been too long.
