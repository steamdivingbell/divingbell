The storyline and accompanying strip that provide the backdrop are extremely professional in their own right, and this level has carried forward into the game. We often see new games coming out for the Amiga which lack depth, but this one is like the Mariana Trench! You will need to shut out the world and fully immerse yourself into this in order to get the best experience, but it will be very rewarding. Graphically extremely pleasing and sonically adequate, it's a thoroughly enjoyable ride that will take some time to finish. But even when you complete the story, there is an expansive world to navigate and explore\u201d<br />\r\n\u2014 ZZAP! Amiga (Issue 9)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cThe ambition of AQUABYSS is truly mind-boggling \u2014 the world is vast and although the game is fully released, it's constantly being developed and worked on. Updates are released frequently (not just bug fixes, but new features and content too), sometimes multiple times in a week, so it's well worth getting your Amiga online if you haven't already. The scope of the game is set to keep growing with the online features potentially expanding, which could be very exciting.\u201d<br />\r\n\u2014 Amiga Addict (Issue 19)<br
