You are to lead a group of those humbled by impending dread: build and develop your settlement, gather resources, and protect your people from monsters that lurk in the dark. Take care of the settlers, make them learn crafts and military skills so their next sunset is not their last. Over time, you will have to leave the lands you developed and look for the new ones... Who knows, maybe there you will find out how to repel the inevitable danger and save the world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Will you be able to do all that is needed before the sunset?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1703920/extras/1en.png?t=1739544519\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your management skills and strategic vision will determine the fate of your people. Delegate tasks to your settlers: regulate the gathering of essential resources, provision of food, clothing, and shelter. Attract new settlers. Teach them farming, smithing, and other necessary crafts. Explore the surrounding lands and send your warriors to search for rare materials. Who knows what unexpected lands and what random events await you there...</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1703920/extras/1_manage_t.gif?t=1739544519\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1703920/extras/2en.png?t=1739544519\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each settler is an individual with their own attributes, needs, skills, and strengths. Govern them wisely and guide their talents towards the settlement improvement. Settlers' morale will impact their resilience and determine their capability to overcome life struggles and challenges.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1703920/extras/2_direct_eng_t.gif?t=1739544519\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1703920/extras/3en.png?t=1739544519\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Build houses to protect your dwellers and keep them warm, workshops to make tools, and barracks to train your warriors.

You can supervise each warrior directly or trust them to act independently. Magic is also your ally: different spells can help you with the needs of your settlers as well as support you on a battlefield \u2014 by using magic you can protect your warriors and cause damage to your enemies.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1703920/extras/4_protect_t.gif?t=1739544519\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1703920/extras/5en.png?t=1739544519\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The nights grow increasingly longer and colder, but snowstorms and penetrating frost are not your only enemies... Portals open everywhere, allowing Prince Velimir's servants to hunt down the survivors. The longer you stay in one place, the stronger the Darkness grows and more ruthless the nights become: with every house built, with every lair destroyed the pressure of the woods only gets worse. Ghouls, Leshies, Werewolves, and Night Hags are only some of the creatures that will try to destroy your settlement.

You will need to collect Spirit Energy, Darkness Shards, technology and defense points and use them to research new technologies and advance your manufacturing methods to master farming, build new structures, and increase their level and efficiency.
