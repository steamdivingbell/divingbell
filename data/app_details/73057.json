{"about_the_game":"The Gamer Bundle contains three new robes inspired by some of the developers favorite games.

This number has a freaky, yet oddly appealing, parasite attached to it\u2019s head. For some reason it turns the wearer into some type of shambling, incomprehensible, crow bar wielding monster. But that\u2019s okay because, while a bit slower, the wearer can now take a punch or two thousand. <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Wizards have been known to go through great lengths in order to cosplay as their favorite game characters. The <strong>Tentacle Robe</strong>, and it\u2019s accompanying Ray-Gun, are great for conventions as well as general forest wear. While some people might point and laugh at this wizard, others would just love to have their photo taken next to him (or her.)<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Epic Robe</strong> is epic claims this wizard. While he may have lost his mount he still has all his other epic gear. The epic amount of hours and sodas he consumed to earn it is no match for the even more epic-y-ness of the sword and armor. </li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/73057/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1589889918","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/73057/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1589889918","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/73057/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1589889918","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/73057/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1589889918","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Gamer Bundle contains three new robes inspired by some of the developers favorite games.
