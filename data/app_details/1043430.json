{"about_the_game":"<i>A relaxing God Game about Terraforming, Water and Farming</i><br><br>In classical god game fashion, Tidal Tribe gives you the power to shape the terrain. Raise and lower the land to protect your villages from waves and floods, all while using that very same water to build lakes and rivers, turning the desert land into a lively forest of trees and bushes.<br><br>And these trees are the key to your success: provide enough plants of all the different types to allow your people to satisfy their needs and make their village prosper. Oh, and make sure the paths to those trees don't pass around a dozen lakes and mountains and stuff. There's no point in having all these plantations if it takes ages to reach them. But if you're not busy building, you can also just relax. Watch what kind of shenanigans your people are up too. Depending on the terrain you provide and their society stats, they may even start building factories. Or become criminals. Maybe wage war.
