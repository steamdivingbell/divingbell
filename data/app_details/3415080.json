{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">From the developer that brought you Quaternion comes a new ball-rolling platform challenge that's bigger, better, and full of surprises! Jump, bounce, blast, and fly through 12 pocket dimensions in order to harvest the precious power sources within. Find Modules that let your ball do things you've never seen before at the touch of a button. With robotic foes and tricky puzzles in your way, it's gonna take a lot more than Ion Cells to get through this!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Filtration is a single-player puzzle platform game. By rolling a robotic ball, you'll explore and unlock the secrets of the lost Amali civilization, along with hints as to where they might have gone. Along the way, you'll find Modules, expansion units to plug into your ball and increase its capabilities, adding abilities like a protective shield, a rocket engine, and a pair of wings. The game provides a balance of tricky platforming, brain-tickling puzzles, and action combat in order to explore every corner of the ball-rolling genre.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Features include:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">12 main levels, along with several small bonus levels</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">An expansive Split Complex hub</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">12 Planck Cores for you to collect</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">12 Modules to power up your ball</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">30,000 Ion Cells</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Unlockable upgrades to your abilities</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">An awesome soundtrack</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">And more!</p></li></ul>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3415080?t=1735508043","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3415080?t=1735508043","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3415080/514b77dac03cc3bf5ea96ee638467d421e2398cb/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735508043","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3415080/514b77dac03cc3bf5ea96ee638467d421e2398cb/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735508043","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">From the developer that brought you Quaternion comes a new ball-rolling platform challenge that's bigger, better, and full of surprises!
