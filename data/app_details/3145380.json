{"about_the_game":"Featuring a movement system that's as unforgiving as it is addictive, your gaming skills will be put to the ultimate test! Play through the entire first stage of the game. This one little area, known as &quot;The Cave&quot; is where Jeff lives with his mama. This area contains enough content to keep you failing for hours on end, or if you are lucky maybe just one hour!<br><br>Since you are a turtle, you move quite slowly. So, how does Jeff get around that? It's simple, he gets in his shell and spins around! The faster you spin, the further you jump. But, be careful! Once you start spinning you can't stop unless you exit your shell again!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3145380/extras/FinishedDifficultMovement6.gif?t=1726948650\" /><br><br>Once you make it to the end of the demo, you get your final time.
