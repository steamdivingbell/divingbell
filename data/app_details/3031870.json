Suddenly, Emiko got separated from Tri Demon Girls members and fell through the collapsed floor. She ended up in an unknown cave, where she came across Hitomi, the daughter of Majetsu, the Master Healer. After hearing the concerns of Hitomi, Emiko decided to help her get out of the cave safely and escort her to her own village called Iyashino, where Hitomi was supposed to meet her father.\u00a0<br><br>As soon as they arrived at the village, Hitomi learned from the remaining survivors of the village that her father had been killed by one of the silver-haired N.O.W demon girls leaders. Hitomi broke down and started crying. It came down as a shock for Emiko as well. She could not control her anger, and she vowed to avenge Hitomi's father.

One of her demon energy balls struck Emiko, and she was brought down to her knees.\u00a0Assuming Emiko was dead, she went after Hitomi.
