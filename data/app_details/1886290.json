{"about_the_game":"The Slot Shots Pinball Collection includes seven unique tables and two modes, the standard three ball classic mode and an additional score attack mode for three of the tables. Features include full controller support, mouse / keyboard support, Steam online leaderboards, a soundtrack spanning over three hours, and thirty five achievements to unlock. No subscription, no monthly fees, no hidden DLC, no in-game purchases, and no &quot;tickets&quot; are required to own and enjoy some good old fashion pinball. <strong>Please note: These tables have been upgraded and included in the Slot Shots Pinball Ultimate Edition which is now available!</strong><br><br><u><i>The table line up: </i></u><br>Dream World - A bright, colorful, rainbow and candy filled table with three flippers.<br>The Kraken's Cove - A dark pirate themed table with a giant kraken that pops up during a special mission! <br>Super Vixel Land - A retro themed pixel/voxel super wide table that has missions on both the upper playfield and a lower playfield that has a revolving wheel!  <br>Slot Shots Casino - A fantasy themed casino playground that features a fully functional slot machine, which has a total of ten payouts based on your slot machine roll. This table also has a spinning lucky wheel in the back that grants various different awards based on where the ball drops down the wheel!<br>Bass Hunter - A fishing themed table that also features its own custom slot machine. In Bass Hunter you will be completing fishing themed missions, such as catching the &quot;legendary&quot; fish, while also collecting high scores from activating the slot machine that features different fish and tackle. <br>Neon Nights 2 Skylines - A cyberpunk styled purple and blue neon themed table with a pulse pounding synth style soundtrack. <br>Outergalactic Aliens - A remake of last year's table with all new LEDs, and the addition of the slot machine. <br><br>PLEASE NOTE: This title was built using the Unity game engine and there is a slight delay while playing if using BOTH shift keys at the same time to control the flippers. This is a known issue with the Unity game engine. If using a keyboard we recommend picking and using ONE shift key on either side, and then another key to control the other flipper such as S, L, CTRL or Tab. <br><br>What do the Steam curators have to say about this title?
