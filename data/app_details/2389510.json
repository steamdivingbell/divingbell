{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Arcadia Issue 012 - January 2022</h2>  Welcome to ARCADIA! Inspired by old-school tabletop magazines, ARCADIA is MCDM's digital magazine for 5th edition GMs and players. We hope you like it! <br> <br><strong> So Your Best Friend Is a Monster</strong> by Jessica Marcrum with art by Elisa Serio. You know how sometimes the characters make friends with a monster and instead of battling to the death, they decide to save the creature? Or you know how sometimes you can turn into a half-spider demon after, say, pissing off a certain eight-legged goddess? Well, we got you covered! This article presents rules for uncursing driders, harpies, and medusas and turning them back into humanoids plus rollable tables for generating quick and dirty curses. <br> <br><strong> Fey of the Shadowfell</strong> by Jonathan Connor Self with art by Faizal Fikri &amp; Zuzanna Wuzyk. This article gives you new dark fey creatures to add to your game. When fey move to the Shadowfell, whimsy and passion can turn to pain and rage. These creatures make excellent villains and NPCs for your next adventure! Say hello to new hags and fomorians and unique creatures like the bogie and lubberkin. <br> <br><strong> The Stuff of Nightmares</strong> by Carlos Cisco with art by Gustavo Pelissari. Run one of these two nightmare encounters and your characters won't take long rests for granted again! If they dare to stay at the Helm Street Inn, they'll find the murderous Glass Ghost stalks their dreams. When a hypnagoug crosses their path, they'll have to act fast or become the first victims of an aberration that uses their energy to tear into our reality.\u00a0 <br> <br><strong> The Dimensions of Dowda</strong> by Robert J. Kuntz with art by Nick De Spain. You get a bonus article in this issue! We're presenting a magic item with adventure inside for the first edition of the game. Dowda's Lantern contains an entire secret dimension. Defeat the item's four challenges, and its power is yours. A conversion guide for using this article with fifth edition rules is included. <br>  &quot;","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2389510/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1681824138","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2389510/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1681824138","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2389510/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1681824138","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2389510/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1681824138","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Arcadia Issue 012 - January 2022</h2>  Welcome to ARCADIA!
