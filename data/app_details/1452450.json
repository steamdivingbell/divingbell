{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Pathfinder RPG - Campaign Setting: Distant Worlds</h2>Golarion is the primary world of the Pathfinder campaign setting, but it is not alone.

Now take your game off-planet and explore these weird new worlds for yourself!<br>This book offers a detailed introduction to the science-fantasy worlds of Golarion's solar system, each complete with its own mysterious locations and cultures. Discover how your swords and spells match up against the trench dwellers of the Red Planet or the angelic Sarcesians who soar between asteroids.
