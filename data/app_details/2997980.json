Our story follows Natsu, a timid, effeminate young man who embarks on a family trip to the countryside to visit his aunt Misaki. But just as everyone's getting settled in, a mix-up at his father's workplace forces Natsu's parents to hop right back in the car and drive home, leaving him to spend the remainder of his summer break out in the sticks. Misaki is more than happy to take him in, of course, and so begins a peaceful, relaxing few weeks where absolutely nothing out of the ordinary threatens to disturb his tranquil everyday routine... Bwahahaha, as if! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">It isn't long before a self-proclaimed magical girl named Chitose worms her way into Natsu's life, but her boisterous intrusion is the least of his problems. An eccentric candy seller, an insecure wanna-be teacher, a pink-haired loudmouth... Not to mention, his aunt's strange behavior around the topic of the outdoors. Surrounded by misfits, it soon becomes apparent that Natsu's real summer homework is to learn more about the women around him and help them with their problems. And yet, with only 30 days until his parents pick him up, is this one assignment he's fated to flunk, or will he pass with flying colors?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2997980/extras/Natsu_no_Sagashimono_~What_We_Found_That_Summer~_Description_2_EN.png?t=1731464573\" />Have a blast fishing, catching bugs, taking in the sights, and collecting other bits and bobs as you go around talking to the locals.

It may seem like you have all the time in the world, but if you aren't careful, summer will pass by in the blink of an eye.
