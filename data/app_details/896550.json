{"about_the_game":"The Sea Between is an indie fantasy JRPG, about a young man named Vis, who realizes there are a lot of things he doesn\u2019t know about his family and himself. After growing up on a small island, Vis is forced to leave the comforts of his home to set out on an unexpected journey. Along the way he meets a group of new people and, together, they find out just how dangerous the world can be. Monsters start appearing in greater numbers, and it's up to Vis and his new allies to find out how to keep themselves safe and where this new threat is coming from.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game isn\u2019t about heroes and villains. It\u2019s about the grey area we all live in based on the choices we make. If Good and Evil are islands that we are travelling towards through every decision we make, then this game is about The Sea Between.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"The Start Of The Journey","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/896550/02605c603c8066b799f089dab56d34a1fb427d9b.jpg"},{"name":"Flower Power","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/896550/8bc6a7f42a5020855120d275b7fd16f71975c0e0.jpg"},{"name":"Kira The Courageous","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/896550/84315651856064bc0d1e293d2ce3fad31eecdda2.jpg"},{"name":"Merritt Joins Your Party...
