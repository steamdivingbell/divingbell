{"about_the_game":"Welcome to 'Crying Alone', a deeply personal and emotional game experience crafted from my own journey through heartbreak and healing. Spanning approximately 20 minutes, this story-driven platformer is not just a game, but a fragment of my life, transformed into an interactive narrative.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 'Crying Alone', you'll walk through the echoes of a relationship that profoundly changed me. Experience the raw emotions of waking up to a world turned upside down, the struggle to find footing amidst the chaos of loss, and the gradual path towards acceptance and self-discovery. Each level, each scene, each moment in this game is a reflection of my journey - from the depths of despair to the first glimmers of hope.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the developer and narrator of this story, I invite you to immerse yourself in a tale that's not often told, but deeply felt by many. This experience is for anyone who has ever loved and lost, for those who are navigating through the darkness of heartbreak, and for those who find solace in knowing they are not alone in their pain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJoin me in 'Crying Alone', a journey of sorrow, introspection, and the slow, yet inevitable, healing that follows. This is more than a game; it's a piece of my heart, shared with you.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Thanks for playing!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2704870/8f5416f6868890eeb4d7f5fe68e78542483920e8.jpg"}],"total":1},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2704870/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1703208532","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2704870/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1703208532","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2704870/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1703208532","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2704870/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1703208532","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to 'Crying Alone', a deeply personal and emotional game experience crafted from my own journey through heartbreak and healing.
