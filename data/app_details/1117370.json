{"about_the_game":"Bearded Dragons is a lightning-fast indie brawler that explores identity politics and gender expression through the tongue-in-cheek battles and cash-grabbing antics of bearded drag queens. Players face off in quick-pickup, samurai-style combat, using a variety of attacks and mobility techniques to best their opponents. For every hit landed or smash/kill secured, cash tips rain from the sky, and the player with the most money at the end of the round takes the crown.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the story mode preview, follow a bearded queen on her journey of self acceptance, as she works to overcome loneliness, poverty, self-doubt, homophobia, and even discrimination from within the drag community. She faces off against headless torsos, street thugs, police officers, and a litany of other drag queens as she goes from busted to dusted and discovers the real meaning of drag. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the versus mode (Face Off), up to four local players go head to head in quick-pickup combat, controlling a diverse set of bearded drag queens and kings. They explore a range of unique stages representative of real and virtual queer spaces, all the while grabbing as many cash tips as possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a passion project by a solo-developer, and it will continue to receive updates until it's ready to leave early access.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117370/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1661986295","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117370/page.bg.jpg?t=1661986295","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117370/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1661986295","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117370/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1661986295","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Bearded Dragons is a lightning-fast indie brawler that explores identity politics and gender expression through the tongue-in-cheek battles and cash-grabbing antics of bearded drag queens.
