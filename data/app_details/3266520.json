Set in a world of dark magic and ancient secrets, you'll craft and upgrade homunculi to battle through perilous realms and gather the materials needed for your ultimate goal. Master alchemy, face challenging encounters, and unlock the mysteries of immortality. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Crafting and Alchemy</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">At the heart of your journey lies the alchemist's castle, a hub where you can create and refine your homunculus. Use rare materials to produce potent potions and powerful augments that enhance your homunculus. Upgrade its abilities, improve its stats, and grant it magical powers to prepare for the trials ahead. As you progress, you'll unlock more advanced crafting options, allowing you to create increasingly formidable homunculi to aid you on your quest. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combat</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Combat in Homunculus is an auto-battle system where strategy and preparation are key. Your homunculus will automatically use its augments in battle, utilizing its skills for attack and defense. Each encounter demands careful planning and effective use of your crafted potions. As you journey through the realms, you'll face a variety of foes, from minor adversaries to powerful bosses, each requiring a different approach to defeat. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Homunculus Management</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your homunculus starts as a loyal but weak companion. To strengthen it, you\u2019ll use your alchemical skills to craft various augments that enhance its attributes. If your homunculus falls in battle, you can sacrifice a piece of your own soul to create a new one. However, be mindful of your soul\u2019s limits, as it's a finite resource. As you progress, you'll unlock the ability to create stronger homunculi with new abilities to aid you in your quest. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Progression and Exploration</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The ultimate goal is to create the Philosopher's Stone by completing four transformative steps: Blackening, Whitening, Yellowing, and Reddening. Each step represents a phase in the alchemical process and the soul's journey towards immortality.  To advance through these stages, you need to explore a diverse array of realms that represents the mystical lands. From the Shadow Realm's deathly gloom to other unique and mysterious locales, each area offers distinct challenges and encounters.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3266520/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728898376","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3266520/page.bg.jpg?t=1728898376","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3266520/e977d584dbda5ac972b74011aac6c8e6bf77a04e/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728898376","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3266520/e977d584dbda5ac972b74011aac6c8e6bf77a04e/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728898376","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your enthusiasm and support are crucial as we bring Homunculus to life.
