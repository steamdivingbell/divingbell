{"about_the_game":"Acoustic Kits is a collection of 24 bit drum kits recorded in professional studios. The library includes Gretsch, Yamaha, DW, Pearl, Ludwig, and Tama drum kits along with a full set of percussion instruments. Acoustic Kits were meticulously recorded through a complete range of playable velocities using 16 microphones, tube preamps and pristine 24-bit ADCs. The close and overhead samples were then mixed for each individual drum for optimal punch and room ambience. Each kit is comprised of up to five layers for unmatched realism. Programmed specifically for Session Drummer 3, kicks, snares, toms, cymbals, and percussion have been isolated and recombined to create alternate variation kits and mixes. The result is real drums in real rooms played by real drummers. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis collection contains 1.2 gigabyte of 24 bit samples, 40 programs, &amp; 128 MIDI patterns.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490190/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1511559782","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490190/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1511559782","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490190/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1511559782","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/490190/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1511559782","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Acoustic Kits is a collection of 24 bit drum kits recorded in professional studios.
