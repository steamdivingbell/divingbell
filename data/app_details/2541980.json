{"about_the_game":"Melvin's Blocky Adventure features Melvin, a robot, stranded in a grid-based watery world. Melvin doesn't really know how he got there, but with his wit (and his five balloons), he is sure to find a way of this world. Control Melvin to solve block-based puzzles to advance through the ever more difficult puzzles.<br><br>The puzzles are based on a few simple rules:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Walk up the block if the height difference is one.<br></li><li> Push the block if the height difference is exactly two.</li></ul>The rules may seem simple, but don't be fooled, the puzzles get increasingly more difficult and the worlds inhabitant may also have a say in Melvin's success.<br><br>The game focuses on creating a serene atmosphere where there are no time limits or stressful moments, only Melvin versus the puzzle. With unlimited undos and being able to reset the puzzles, it provides a satisfying puzzle-solving experience where brain power is more important than muscle memory.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2541980/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1692809845","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2541980/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1692809845","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2541980/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1692809845","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2541980/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1692809845","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Melvin's Blocky Adventure features Melvin, a robot, stranded in a grid-based watery world.
