(Calling and comparing strings was around 8x slower than comparing indexes, overall this is a large boost to more complicated level packs.)<br></li><li>Note: Due to the way that assets are loaded, the order in which the ModSystem file is loaded will likely be wrong for previous mods, the Authoring Tools has been updated to fix this.<br><br></li><li>Added the following commands.<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>then(createlist,index) - Creates a list data system that can be interacted with.<br></li><li>then(addlist,index,value) - Adds a value to the list.<br></li><li>then(setlist,index,position,value) - Changes a value to the list.<br></li><li>then(deletelist,index,value) - Deletes the value in the list at that position.<br></li><li>then(sortlist,index,&quot;ascending ,descending ,shuffle&quot;) - Sorts the list.<br></li><li>then(creategrid,index,width,height) - Creates a grid data system that can be interacted with.<br></li><li>then(setgrid,index,position x,position y, value) - Changes a value in the grid.<br></li><li>then(functiontarget) - Performs the next function for every entity on the target list. To be used with the &quot;target&quot; subcommand.<br></li><li>then(createhitsplat,x,y,type, amount) - Creates a hitsplat at the position. <br></li><li>then(createtext,x,y,text) - Creates a text popup similar to when you pick up an item.</li></ul><br><br></li><li>Added the following subcommands<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>list(index, position) - Returns the value in the list at that position.<br></li><li>grid(index,x position, y position) - Returns the value in the grid at that position.<br></li><li>targetvar(variable) - To be used with the &quot;functiontarget&quot; function in place of variables.<br></li><li>damage() - Returns the amount of health lost between frames.</li></ul><br><br></li><li>Added the following options for the playervar/targetvar subcommand.<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>xrel - X position relative to the block.<br></li><li>yrel - Y position relative to the block.<br></li><li>speed - Speed value.</li></ul><br><br></li><li>Rooms now have a value to determine how common the room is. The higher the value, the more common.<br></li><li>Setting particle life to 0 will now make them live infinetly.<br></li><li>Fixed an issue with ELSE blocks.<br></li><li>Fixed comments in code breaking everything.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Additions</h2></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>You can now copy and delete career mode files. Copied files will be automatically made hardcore.<br></li><li>Added a buffer for switching weapons and picking up weapons. Trying to switch or pick up a weapon when firing will now buffer it to pick it up after the weapon is fired. (To make picking weapons up smoother.)<br></li><li>Added a new weapon modifier - bullet velocity (V).<br></li><li>Added a simple pseudo-in raid progression system with weapon drops. Having a better weapon will result in better weapons dropping. This is to both gate off extremely powerful weapons early on and to make weapon progression more noticable.<br></li><li>Added some more clothing particle effects. They now only spawn on hats as well. (Having two pieces of clothing with the same particle effect was very unlikely.)<br></li><li>Added the currently equipped clothing to the inventory screen.<br></li><li>New Hat - Graduation Cap - When equipped, the level of your hat and pants equipped will be increased by 2. (Similar to a max upgraded piece of clothing in career mode.)<br></li><li>New Hat - Paper Bag - When equipped, the range for picking up enemies and dropped items is doubled.<br></li><li>Changed the Mushroom Cap. Now is a Plague Mask that sounds an acid rain cloud that circles around the player.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Balance</h2></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Reduced the turning speed suffered when frozen.<br></li><li>Made rotating lock puzzles harder to solve.<br></li><li>Enemy weapon will no longer determine how far they can see.<br></li><li>Items in co-op are now valued based on their rarity.<br></li><li>Clothing generated at the start of a career is now levelled appropriately.<br></li><li>Reduced the amount of health gained from tiny healthkits.<br></li><li>Tweaked enemy aim speed.<br></li><li>Tweaked weapon kickback formula.<br></li><li>Tweaked enemy damage.\t<br></li><li>&quot;Golden&quot; now increases all weapon stats by 5% instead of 2%.<br></li><li>Changed the functionality of the cash lockboxes.

It was causing crashes. I don't even know if it worked properly.<br></li><li>Fixed an unavoidable (and frankly common) crash related to the new blood system.<br></li><li>Fixed a crash with the grenade launcher. (And probably the rocket launcher too.)<br></li><li>Fixed a crash caused by entering the getaway car with a prosthetic hook launched.<br></li><li>Fixed some localization related issues.<br></li><li>Fixed an issue with the &quot;mastermind&quot; puzzle.<br></li><li>Fixed an issue where enemies would try and walk through tables to get to a player.<br></li><li>Fixed a crash caused by the Mind Bender.<br></li><li>Opening a lockbox now uses up the keycard.<br></li><li>Fixed an issue where frozen players with items didnt appear frozen.<br></li><li>Fixed a large amount of problems related to dropping clothing in quickplay and career mode.<br></li><li>Fixed an issue causing the new blood system to not even save on performance.<br></li><li>Fixed a bug allowing you to upgrade weapons past maximum level in career mode.<br></li><li>Scopes can no longer damage &quot;brainfreeze&quot; statues. Brainfreeze no longer creates ice blood as well.<br></li><li>When moving up a floor, the game will no longer run very poorly while selecting a perk.<br></li><li>Fixed a glitch related to the juggernaut charge where you could clip through walls. (This has been in the game for a while honestly.)<br></li><li>Changed the way files are read. This is all backend stuff, but there was a (probably rare as I only encountered it once) issue where certain configs could not start the game due to an issue with the old system.<br></li><li>Hats can no longer spawn with a glitched effect when spawned from a chest.<br></li><li>Fixed a crash with the flare gun and tesla gun.<br></li><li>Fixed a crash caused by completing a raid with the knight helmet on.<br></li><li>Fixed a problem causing precision skills to not work right.<br></li><li>Fixed a crash with C4.<br></li><li>Fixed a crash with the executioner's hood.<br></li><li>Hats can no longer appear in clothing store boxes that aren't gold.<br></li><li>You can no longer break square shark tanks.<br></li><li>Fixed a potential error causing the leather chaps and overalls to function incorrectly.<br></li><li>Fixed many hats not showing up ever in the career store.<br></li><li>Fixed a bug where swing weapons could spawn with the bullet velocity bonus.<br></li><li>Fixed a bug where enemies in arcade mode at very easy would be unkillable.<br></li><li>Leaving a room with backup helpers now makes them disappear.<br><br></li><li>Co-Op Related<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>While this isn't verified, steamworks now throttles bandwith coming in and out. As a result, playing in steamworks was nearly impossible. A makeshift system was put in place to make 2 player coop with steamworks at least POSSIBLE. The network at the moment is EXTREMELY unoptimized and will be improved in a coming patch.<br></li><li>Fixed a crash caused by dropping a weapon.<br></li><li>Clients now properly drop weapons.<br></li><li>Fixed a crash caused by leaving the server in steamworks.<br></li><li>Fixed client names/avatar not loading properly.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Other Changes</h2>[/list]<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Changed the way the &quot;shader detail&quot; option handles optimization. It now disables the dropshadow instead of the shaders at the lowest setting. The shader really wasn't making a gigantic impact to the framerate in the long run and disabling it disabled other important options. For consistency, this should be better in the long run.<br></li><li>Bitmaps can no longer be used for the mod image.<br></li><li>Optimized the lighting backend when it comes to detection of how bright the area in which you were standing was. This was (potentially) causing major framerate issues (in one instance around 50% of the work the engine was doing was dedicated solely to this) on less powerful computers, hopefully this should help.<br></li><li>Altered the physics of the flaregun.<br></li><li>You can no longer spam pause, this was causing some issues.<br></li><li>Clicking off the inventory/puzzle/continue screen will no longer cause you to fire.</li></ul></p><br><h1>Free Quickplay Demo</h1><p><strong>Want to try out Cash_Out before you buy?
