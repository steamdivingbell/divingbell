Explore different fantasy environments with the 8 Knights of Galiveth, each with their own stats and skills that make exploring different with each character. Some areas will only be accessible to specific characters while other areas will require you to use teamwork between characters to get through. The game features &quot;permadeath&quot; meaning that when a character loses all it's HP and falls they're gone forever. This can restrict you from getting items and exploring areas that required that character.
