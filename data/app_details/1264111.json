The top left corner of the window will be moved according to your first touch, and the bottom right corner of the window will be moved according to your second touch, so you can effectively pinch the window smaller or stretch the window bigger with two fingers.

This means you will start by clicking the top bar for movement like normal, but you will then press the right mouse button also, having both the left mouse button and the right mouse button pressed at the same time, like a musical chord of notes.  When you do this, the window will anchor at the corner farthest from the cursor, allowing you to expand or contract the window at the closest corner.
