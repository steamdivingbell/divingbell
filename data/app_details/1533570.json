class=\"bb_tag\">Making Words</h2>When you first load into a game world, you will see a board of tiles.<br>While hovering over a tile with the mouse cursor, the tile will be highlighted and you will have the option to select it.<br>Note that certain tile types can not be selected, and selecting tiles is unavailable in some cases (e.g., when the board is replenishing).<br>Drag the mouse over several tiles to begin making a word!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1533570/extras/highlighted.png?t=1617285653\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Valid Words</h2>If the word is a valid word, the selected tiles will be highlighted in green, otherwise they will be highlighted in orange-red.<br>The directional arrows that indicate the flow of the word being made will also change colour as an indication of validity.<br>Note that a word must be at least 3 letters long to be considered valid<br><br><i>A valid word</i><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1533570/extras/valid_word.PNG?t=1617285653\" /><br><br><i>An invalid word</i><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1533570/extras/invalid_word.PNG?t=1617285653\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Points</h2>You may have noticed the numbers on the tile faces. <br>These numbers indicate the points value for that tile. <br>A preview of the full word you are making will appear on the top of the screen.<br>On the bottom of the screen, a breakdown of the points including the total word score will be shown.<br>Once a word is made, the points of the tiles used are added to your score. <br>The top right of the screen shows your score, and the bottom left shows your level. <br>You go up a level every 1,000 tiles used<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Marking Tiles</h2>When making long words, you will need to keep tiles on the board without using them. <br>You will make words in order to drop desired tiles into position to be later used in said long word.<br>However it is easy to accidentally move, or even use these reserved tiles.<br>For this purpose there is a feature where you may double-click on any tile to mark it.<br>Marked tiles will be highlighted in a magenta colour, making it easier to keep track of them<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1533570/extras/saved_word.PNG?t=1617285653\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Getting a Closer Look</h2>You may find it helpful to get a closer look at the board. <br>At any time you can use the mouse wheel to zoom into the board.<br>While zoomed in, you may use the middle or right mouse buttons to pan across the board.<br>Zooming out will automatically re-center the board<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1533570/extras/pan_zoom.PNG?t=1617285653\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tile Types</h2>In the game there are 7 types of tile, these include wood, bronze, silver, gold, diamond, bomb, and burning.<br>Non-wood tiles are known as special tiles.<br>Bronze, silver, gold, and diamond are the most common special tiles you will encounter.<br>You may have noticed they do not have a face value, this is because they work a bit differently.<br>Bronze, silver, gold, and diamond have a 0 value, however they will multiply the score of your word by 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively.<br>This will be reflected in the points breakdown, where the multiplier values will themselves be multiplied together if multiple special tiles are used.<br>Bronze, silver, gold, diamond, and bombs will appear when words are made with scores greater than or equal to 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000 points respectively.<br>When special tiles are earned, one will always appear, however this one and subsequent tiles will only have a 50% chance of spawning an additional special tile.<br>Special tiles can appear anywhere, even over existing special tiles, so use them up before you risk finding your hard-earned diamond turning into bronze!<br>Furthermore every tile that spawns to replenish the board has a 1% chance of being any of the special tile types<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1533570/extras/tile_types.png?t=1617285653\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Bombs</h2>Bombs are unique, they are the only type of tile that can not be selected.<br>A bomb will explode should any word be made that is directly adjacent to it.<br>When a bomb explodes, it will destroy nearby tiles, and you may notice burning tiles are left behind.<br>The points value of any exploded tiles will be added to your score.<br>Burning tiles are tiles that were caught on fire from the explosion, use them up quickly, because they have a chance to spread with every new word made!<br>Note that burning tiles have a multiplier of 0, and will nullify the score of any words made with them<br><br><i>A bomb</i><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1533570/extras/bomb.png?t=1617285653\" /><br><br><i>A burning tile spreading to another tile</i><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1533570/extras/tile_burning.PNG?t=1617285653\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">UI Options</h2>There are several buttons in the top left of the screen<br><br>First we have the exit button, this just brings you back to the menu<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1533570/extras/ui_options_exit.png?t=1617285653\" /><br><br>Next is the info button.<br>From here you can discover plenty of fun statistics about your word making including amount of words made, amount of tiles used, average score per word, etc. <br>You can also check words to see if they exist in the lexicon, which is especially useful for making long words<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1533570/extras/ui_options_info.png?t=1617285653\" /><br><br>The third button is for settings.<br>Here you can do many things including volume control, determining what genres of music will play, and adding or excluding your own custom words. <br>Note that although identical to the settings screen in the main menu, this screen also contains an option to show the FPS of your game<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1533570/extras/ui_options_settings.png?t=1617285653\" /><br><br>Lastly are the shuffle and rejuvenate buttons.<br>A shuffle can be done an unlimited amount of times, and will shuffle around the tiles on the board.<br>A rejuvenate will completely replace all of the tiles on the board, however these are in limited supply.<br>Every time you level up, you will earn an additional 2 rejuvenates<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\"
