{"about_the_game":"Negative space block-stacking. Test and improve your spatial reasoning from two perspectives. Think on your feet, turn obstacles into paths, and practice balance to survive without crossing the caution line in this elegant arcade-puzzler.<br><br><strong>GAMEPLAY FEATURES</strong><br>----------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Fast-Paced Block Stacking</strong><br>You can drop blocks instantly without locking them, allowing you to build at ridiculous speeds once you know what you're doing. For the Grandmasters: DAS timers are customizable. Everyone else: in the options menu, you can set how long until you move again automatically after moving once.<br><br><strong>Slow Motion</strong><br>The game ends when a piece gets placed across the caution line. When this would happen, time slows down to buy you time and help you survive for as long as possible.<br><br><strong>Jumping</strong><br>If you fell too low, don't worry. You can jump up and over small gaps. Simply move away from the ground to jump off it. Don't let one bad drop break your flow; fall once, get up twice.<br><br><strong>Co-op Support</strong><br>Play with a friend locally. (Or online via Steam Remote Play!)<br><br><strong>Dual Wielding</strong><br>If you think you're already a block stacking master, prove it with Master mode in single player by controlling two blocks at once. Depending on who you ask, this is either impossible, or two impossibles.<br><br><br><strong>GAME MODES</strong><br>----------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Casual</strong>: Survive as long as you can.<br><br><strong>RELAX!</strong>: Take as long as you like. (Boring? Maybe. Zen? Aggressively.)<br><br><strong>Master</strong>: Good luck; you'll need it. There are credits if you survive for long enough, but I made the game and I couldn't get to them... Can you?<br><br><br><strong>NONFEATURES</strong><br>----------------------------------------------------------------<br>No Versus Mode.<br>No Scoring or Combo System.<br>No Control Customization.<br>No Visual Customization.<br>No Story Mode.<br><br>I spent nearly a year trying to force in other modes and features, but nothing felt right. That left me with a difficult decision. Eventually I quit going against the grain and just kept the gameplay straightforward and simple for my first commercial game. This is just a humble block stacking survival game. To whatever small audience still wants games like that, bless your beautiful pure souls, and have fun stacking blocks in negative space!","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1434270?t=1707694731","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1434270/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1707694731","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1434270/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1707694731","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1434270/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1707694731","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Negative space block-stacking.
