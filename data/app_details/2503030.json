{"about_the_game":"HIDEOUT is a first-person survival horror game where survival and resource management play a crucial role.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSuddenly, war breaks out in the city, and the protagonist must quickly reach a shelter to escape the raining rockets. Navigating through the streets amidst active combat, the hero finds refuge in an old abandoned hideout. The entrance he entered collapses, leaving no way back. Gradually, the protagonist begins to lose sanity as nightmarish visions haunt him relentlessly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe player assumes the role of an ordinary civilian forced to survive the war at any cost. Inside an old Soviet bunker, resources are scarce, with little food and water available. The old generator has limited fuel, necessitating electricity conservation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe player must monitor the protagonist's needs and strive to satisfy them. Insufficient food, poor sleep, and frequent exposure to stressful situations cause the protagonist's sanity to rapidly decline. As the protagonist's sanity worsens, a paranormal presence haunting the place becomes more pronounced.
