{"about_the_game":"Explore an open, post-apocalyptic city, delving into run-down shops and apartments, where mutated creatures run rampant. Few survivors remain alive in a small, secure settlement. Paying off your debt to the Mafia will be no easy task as you dive into the dangerous, contaminated city of Castan. <br><br>Humanity has foretold many near mass extinction events that would reshape all life that existed on earth. But, when a devastating meteor shower shattered the world, things changed. It brought DNA and radiation that shaped the creatures of the world into grotesque monsters, that feast on the few remaining survivors. With time, many grew to accept the changes, evolving alongside this strange new world. Small communities were reborn, and trading scavenged loot or your own life became the new way of living.<br><br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1836170/extras/Gas-Mask-Filter.gif?t=1653774196\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Loot:</h2>Explore abandoned apartments, stores and more as you search for loot and fill your backpack with rare and now valuable pre-apocalypse goods.<br><br><br><br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1836170/extras/Sell-1.gif?t=1653774196\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Sell:</h2>Choose to sell your findings to a zany, unhinged scientist turned shop-keeper for money to spend on gear.
