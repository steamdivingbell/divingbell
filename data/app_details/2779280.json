{"about_the_game":"Chromatic Memories is<strong> a cozy visual novel about grief, loss, memory and acceptance,</strong> set in the Canary Islands (Spain) in the early 2000s. You play as Nayara, a painter of memories \u2013 a woman who has mastered a discipline that, using a machine called Memory Channeller, allows her to<strong> dive into people\u2019s memory, altering their minds</strong> to change or even erase their memories.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2779280/extras/cm_description_banner_about.png?t=1718903048\" /><br><br>One day, upon waking up in the morning Nayara thought there was <strong>something strange, something she couldn\u2019t put her finger on </strong>\u2013 missing items, things out of place or that she couldn\u2019t remember well. When she set to work with the Memory Channeller, she realized that she had left it in Editor Mode \u2013 a mode that memory artists only use to alter their own memories. That can only mean<strong> she erased something from her own mind; </strong>so she starts going through her past, following hints that lead her to more and more memories, with the ultimate hope of finding out what happened to her that she wanted to forget so badly. <br><br>You will have to<strong> investigate all of Nayara\u2019s memories, analyze their settings and talk </strong>to the people who were present in them. Investigating a memory will help you learn all its relevant information, characters and facts; once you manage to put all that in the right order, you will be able to recover that lost memory, unlocking new steps in your investigation. As you advance in your search, you will get new pigments that will allow you to craft new colors through some minigames; they will help you better remember by<strong> tying a specific memory to the right emotion.</strong> Also, some special colors will allow you to visit events that happened in the same place, but at different points in time. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2779280/extras/cm_description_banner_features.png?t=1718903048\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Redraw Nayara's destiny</strong> in this compelling story of loss, grief and acceptance.<br></li><li>Explore an <strong>alternate version of the Canary Islands</strong> (Spain) in the 2000s.<br></li><li><strong>Navigate your own memories</strong>, investigating each scene and talking to all the characters to get the main facts.<br></li><li><strong>Craft new colors</strong> to use in your investigation with pigments you find as you advance through the story.<br></li><li><strong>Learn from the past to make Nayara happy in the present</strong> \u2014 reconnect with old friends, or even discover new details about her life and world.<br></li><li>Revel in the <strong>colorful Fauvism art style</strong> of Chromatic Memories, inspired by the avant-garde artists of the early 20th century.<br></li><li>Let your imagination run wild to the rhythm of a <strong>unique soundtrack inspired by Spanish folklore</strong>, with elements of progressive rock, blues and flamenco.</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2779280/extras/cm_description_banner_institutional.png?t=1718903048\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2779280/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1718903048","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2779280/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1718903048","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2779280/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718903048","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2779280/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718903048","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":3039530,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Chromatic Memories is<strong> a cozy visual novel about grief, loss, memory and acceptance,</strong> set in the Canary Islands (Spain) in the early 2000s.
