From humble beginnings, forge your path amidst a sprawling sandbox of peril and opportunity. Survive against the odds as you scavenge amongst the undead, build, and battle your way to dominance. Tame beasts, construct naval warships, and navigate a world where danger lurks around every corner. With each sunrise, a new challenge arises, pushing your limits in this relentless quest for supremacy. Will you conquer the island, or become just another victim of the Grimm Harvest? </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2903720/extras/image__5_.png?t=1737752790\" /> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Players must navigate a harsh and unforgiving environment filled with threats both alive and undead. From battling the undead, scavenging for resources, taming wild animals, setting up traps, to contending with rival survivors, every decision you make under the sun helps you to survive till the next day...if you survive the night. In this world, there are no rules that define what you can do, and who you will become. Become friends with the local carnivore, trade with a questionable pirate, stalk your ex-lover, have a pet pig named bacon, beg for resources with your proximity-voice, the choice is yours.  <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2903720/extras/image.png?t=1737752790\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Grimm Harvest offers a wide-variety of benefits to our players such as hand-drawn environments for players to delve into, and conquer. From the start of our release, we plan on pushing regular balance fixes, improvements to AI, additions to our story, as well as core mechanics and features. Grimm Harvest has an intrinsic storyline that we wish to tell throughout the maps that we create for our game. We plan on adding content on a monthly basis such as new maps, new weapons, vehicles, bosses, and much more.
