{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Epilepsy Warning</h2>If you are suffering from epilepsy, this game is probably not for you. This is due to the huge amount of bright stars, which can flicker and rotate around you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Description</h2><br>'A Hole In Space' is a slow-paced space simulation game. You take control of a small black hole, which roams through an universe created by parameters you choose.<br><br>The movement is slow and sluggish, because everything moves by forces. The time you need to accelerate is the same time you need to decelerate. Therefore, it is not advisable to try to fly with max speed. <br><br>The amount of time you need to absorb the whole universe depends on how many stars you want in your universe. Your universe can have from 100 up to 10 million stars, but only if your PC can handle it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Goal</h2><br>The goal is to absorb the whole universe.<br><br>1. Absorb nearby suns to grow in mass. <br>2. Absorb other black holes in the universe, if you are greater in mass. <br>3. Absorb the rest of the universe through your new added huge mass.<br>4.
