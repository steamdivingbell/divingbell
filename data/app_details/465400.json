There are also larger levels in which game camera following your tank as he moves, this resembles more of an adventure shooting type of game play. These 2 types of levels are intersecting each other so you don't get bored of one type. As you progress through levels they are gradually introduced to more powerful enemies and more power-ups.</ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/465400/extras/control.png?t=1461637808\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">Control is very simple to immediately hook you into actions without going through boring tutorials. Controls just include four directional buttons (up, down, left, right) and a single fire button. Your tank movement is restricted to horizontal and vertical and no diagonal movement is allowed.

We concentrated our best effort on the firing and enemy tank explosion animations as we think these are the two most satisfying actions that the you experiences. When firing, tank\u2019s gun recoils, air shock wave and nozzle fire created. Enemies recoil and exploding when hit. After exploding, tank burning bodies remains. Also the tank movement is also treated well with tank acceleration and braking animation. When moving, tank body goes up and down relative to its treads, this make it looks realistic as tanks move through bumpy terrains.Tanks leave dust, smoke and tread mark on ground behind.</ul><br>for more info please visit :<br>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/465400/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1461637808","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/465400/page.bg.jpg?t=1461637808","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/465400/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1461637808","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/465400/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1461637808","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/465400/extras/about2.png?t=1461637808\" /><br>The perfect game to play local co-op with your friends and partners with classic top-down game play and simple yet dynamic controls.
