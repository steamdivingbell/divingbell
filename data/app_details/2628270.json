{"about_the_game":"Additional research branch &quot;Cambridian Airborne Forces&quot;.<br><br>Airborne troops are a branch of troops designed to envelop and destroy any enemy forces, carry out sabotage missions in his rear to disrupt command and control, capture and destroy ground elements of precision weapons, disrupt the advance and deployment of reserves, disrupt the work of the rear and communications, as well as to cover individual directions, areas, open flanks, block and destroy enemy groups that have broken through, and perform other tasks.<br>After the collapse of Cambridia, the socialist republics became the successor to this type of troops, all material and technical parts and deployment bases.<br>The addition will help you carry out landing operations on the global and tactical maps. Use a unique type of troops for new strategic and tactical decisions. Produce unique equipment, equip your airborne units and crush the enemy by dropping parachute troops in unexpected places.<br>Unique types of military equipment will significantly increase the combat power of airborne units:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ASU-85</h2>a combat vehicle of the airborne troops, an airborne self-propelled artillery unit (SAU) based on the PT-76 amphibious light tank.<br>The main self-propelled artillery unit, which was in service with the airborne troops of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union from 1959 until the self-propelled gun 2S9 \u201cNona-S\u201d entered service in the early 1980s.<br>Thanks to the angles of inclination of the frontal and side armor plates, the hull provided protection for the crew from armor-piercing shells of small and medium calibers. The corrugated bottom gave the hull additional strength. In the bow on the right there was a control compartment, in which the driver\u2019s seat was located. The fighting compartment was located in the middle part of the vehicle. To the right of the gun, one behind the other, were the positions of the loader and commander. To the left of the gun was the gunner's position. There was a hatch in the bottom for emergency exit.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Typhoon</h2>Multi-purpose armored all-terrain vehicle designed for transporting personnel and cargo. Equipped with a 12.7 mm tank machine gun and a Kornet missile launch system. Accommodates 4 soldiers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">2S9 Nona</h2>A divisional-regimental airborne self-propelled artillery installation allows airborne troops to use and maintain high rates of attack. The body is made on the basis of the BTR-D armored personnel carrier from welded sheets of armored aluminum, and the V-shaped 6-cylinder four-stroke diesel engine produces 240 hp. allows you to reach speeds of up to 60 km/h. The main armament of the 2s9 is a 120 mm rifled howitzer gun. Self-propelled guns, like other equipment, have the ability to land both by landing and by parachute from aircraft such as AN-12, AN-22 and IL-76. Crew: 4 people.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BMD-2</h2>combat tracked amphibious vehicle, designed for use in airborne troops and landing by parachute or landing from military transport aircraft such as AN-12, AN-22 and IL-76. Equipped with a 30-mm automatic cannon and a coaxial 7.62-mm PKT machine gun, as well as a Kornet missile launcher. The 240 hp diesel engine provides high cross-country ability and a speed of 60 km/h. Accommodates a crew of 2 people and 5 landing troops.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BMD-2M</h2>deep modification of BMD-2. Unlike its predecessor, it is equipped with a 100-mm smoothbore gun, which significantly increased the firepower of airborne units in the fight against tanks and enemy fortifications. Accommodates 3 crew members and 4 troops.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">2S23</h2>A 120-mm battalion self-propelled gun, developed on the basis of the chassis of the amphibious armored personnel carrier BTR-80. SAO 2S23 is designed to suppress manpower, artillery and mortar batteries, rocket launchers, armored targets, fire weapons and fortified command posts. Capable of conducting targeted fire without preparation from closed positions and direct fire. Equipped with an 8-cylinder diesel engine with a capacity of 260 hp. s., which allows you to maintain high speeds on roads of up to 80 km/h. The crew is 4 people. It is equipped with a parachute system, which allows the crew to parachute while inside the vehicle.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2628270/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1717522184","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2628270/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1717522184","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2628270/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1717522184","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2628270/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1717522184","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Additional research branch &quot;Cambridian Airborne Forces&quot;.<br><br>Airborne troops are a branch of troops designed to envelop and destroy any enemy forces, carry out sabotage missions in his rear to disrupt command and control, capture and destroy ground elements of precision weapons, disrupt the advance and deployment of reserves, disrupt the work of the rear and communications, as well as to cover individual directions, areas, open flanks, block and destroy enemy groups that have broken through, and perform other tasks.<br>After the collapse of Cambridia, the socialist republics became the successor to this type of troops, all material and technical parts and deployment bases.<br>The addition will help you carry out landing operations on the global and tactical maps.
