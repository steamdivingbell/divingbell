Gameplay is divided between grid-based tactical battles where players take on a variety of enemies and 2D visual-novel-style dialogue sections where the vast majority of the game\u2019s story is developed.\r\nDuring the dialog sections the player is required to make choices that affect their relationships with various female side-characters. At fixed points in the story the player character will marry the side-character with the highest affinity, affecting who the player character will be in the next \u2018generation\u2019 of story.\r\nThroughout the game the player reaches sections of storyline where still 2D images of female characters are depicted in provocative situations. Although there is no nudity, there are some images of veiled nudity and some situations with a sexual innuendo.\r\n"},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>UNCOVER THE EPIC STORY PRECEDING #1 SELLER, AGAREST: GENERATIONS OF WAR</strong></h2><br>Following hot on the heels of the number 1 top selling epic SRPG \u201cAgarest: Generations Of War\u201d, Ghostlight are proud to announce its prequel \u201cAgarest: Generations Of War ZERO\u201d bringing an enticing blend of in-depth strategy and epic multi-generational storytelling to Steam!<br><br>...From the void, the gods of darkness and light created Agarest, a most perfect and divine world.
