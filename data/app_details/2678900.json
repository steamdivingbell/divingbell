You can also add him to your roster immediately by selecting him as a starting agent in a Custom Game!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTake care while you Light the Way - or you might wind up burned!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2678900/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1701791940","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2678900/page.bg.jpg?t=1701791940","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2678900/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1701791940","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2678900/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1701791940","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Bad Language\r\nTobacco and alcohol references\r\nViolence"},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Heat things up in the fight against the Banished Court with Isaac, a new agent who will join your team with a light machine gun - and a hefty grudge!
