{"about_the_game":"Chronoraptor is a puzzle solving time-travel game about recovering ancient artifacts stolen from throughout history by a time-traveling dinosaur! The player uses their own time-travel abilities to cooperate with past versions of themselves to retrieve artifacts and put an end to the raptor\u2019s time altering hijinks. Play through a futuristic museum, working with time-clones of your past selves to obtain key-cards, open doors, solve puzzles, and ultimately retrieve each ancient artifact, all while evading the &quot;Chronoraptor&quot;. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe player has the ability to rewind or fast forward time. Every time you travel backwards in time, a time-clone is created that will echo your previous actions. If you press a button and then rewind, your clone will now press that same button. This allows you to be in two places at once, enabling you to solve unique and interesting puzzles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChronoraptor was made by a team of 15 students with the Entertainment Arts and Engineering (EAE) program at the University of Utah.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1049000/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1557442133","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1049000/page.bg.jpg?t=1557442133","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1049000/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1557442133","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1049000/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1557442133","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Chronoraptor is a puzzle solving time-travel game about recovering ancient artifacts stolen from throughout history by a time-traveling dinosaur!
