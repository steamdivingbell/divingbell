Chilla's Art did it again, they develop a game that is terrifying as no other. This game is similar to Aka Manto but scariest because there is no way to hide from Yuki Onna, she is very unpredictable, and her transformation is going to make you scream for sure. I recommend this game 100% and more if you love horror, and Japanese legendary ghosts.\u201d<br>Recommended \u2013 IGXL Insane Gaming XL<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1191070/ss_4f18ea5996025e68e6737cb5eb169d866b06aeaf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1662351930","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1191070/ss_4f18ea5996025e68e6737cb5eb169d866b06aeaf.600x338.jpg?t=1662351930"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1191070/ss_9fec9911b2811f22bf4afe763ccbc0567de69df3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1662351930","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1191070/ss_9fec9911b2811f22bf4afe763ccbc0567de69df3.600x338.jpg?t=1662351930"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1191070/ss_ecf1cad98210783bd0cc17eeb473bfd68db6a1fa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1662351930","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1191070/ss_ecf1cad98210783bd0cc17eeb473bfd68db6a1fa.600x338.jpg?t=1662351930"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1191070/ss_402907e9715e9dcf5f96821c1d4dfd1e7bad5686.1920x1080.jpg?t=1662351930","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1191070/ss_402907e9715e9dcf5f96821c1d4dfd1e7bad5686.600x338.jpg?t=1662351930"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1191070/ss_db273e31e9d7a44b89f843de2eedb0880ea96ef0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1662351930","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1191070/ss_db273e31e9d7a44b89f843de2eedb0880ea96ef0.600x338.jpg?t=1662351930"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1191070/ss_2eca1cc6c9c8c844bd401de1b2feeb1c7b683294.1920x1080.jpg?t=1662351930","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1191070/ss_2eca1cc6c9c8c844bd401de1b2feeb1c7b683294.600x338.jpg?t=1662351930"}],"short_description":"Yuki Onna | \u96ea\u5973 is a PS1 inspired survival horror game.
