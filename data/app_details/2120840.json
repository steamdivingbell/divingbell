{"about_the_game":"Peasant Jump Quest Extreme 8K AI is a single player, action, 3D, 8K, puzzle, skill based, platformer.  Jump to the top to save the world, get all the females, and revenge on the King for kicking you into the dungeon.  The deep punishment from a fall makes the success of getting to the top that much sweeter.  Good skill to anyone who attempts this game.  You are going to need it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n- Revolutionary jumping predictor to easily show where you will probably jump, most of the time.  With the jump predictor the game becomes a game of skill instead of guessing.<br />\r\n- Continuous fluid scrolling as you jump so you always know exactly where the next jump is.<br />\r\n- &quot;Peasant Mode&quot; available for a true peasant experience.<br />\r\n- AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.2 also known as FSR.  Great for high frame rates at insane resolutions like 4K, 8K, and beyond.<br />\r\n- Twitch connection should be working so Chat messages will appear in game and / or cause a random jump to happen while playing.  Bit amounts for each can be set separately.  Twitch connection is done through web browser so no personal info is done through game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMap:<br />\r\n- Jump you way through 5 hand crafted sections.  Crafted to look nice, and to be hard, but not impossible.<br />\r\n- Each section has its own theme, and different unique jumping challenges.  Each section stays exciting by slightly changing how and when the jump needs to happen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAtmosphere:<br />\r\n- Full 3D beautiful backgrounds optimized to run on lower end systems.<br />\r\n- Sound effects that make you feel like you are climbing to insane heights in a real world.<br />\r\n- Characters help cheer you on as you work you way to the top.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"You Became King","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2120840/9311dd3a849d7a57485a8ff919e38dc2c0b768de.jpg"},{"name":"Welcome to The Dungeon","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2120840/5daa4a062146deb09d5fd5bab6fa4c04620e469a.jpg"}],"total":2},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2120840?t=1690080235","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2120840/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1690080235","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2120840/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1690080235","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2120840/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1690080235","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Peasant Jump Quest Extreme 8K AI is a single player, action, 3D, 8K, puzzle, skill based, platformer.
