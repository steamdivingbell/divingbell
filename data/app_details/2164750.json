{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Historical background:</strong></h2>China was in the heyday of the Tang Dynasty from the 7th to the 8th century, which was the peak of China's feudal society. The social economy was highly developed, the Silk Road was prosperous again, and the people lived a prosperous life. The Kaiyuan period was also the most prosperous period of the Tang Dynasty, known as the Kaiyuan Prosperity.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Game features:</strong></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Urban economy</strong></h2>As a city builder, you need to fully consider the needs of the people and the distribution of work, and trade with other cities to obtain stable urban finance income.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Transportation system</strong></h2>You need to coordinate the supply of goods between cities and regions, establish an efficient transportation system, and allocate limited resources to the places where they are most needed.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Train the army and appoint generals</strong></h2>You need to build a strong army to defend the city. When expanding the army on a large scale, you need to consider whether the city's finance is affordable. You will find that training an elite army can greatly improve the city's defense capability. You can also appoint generals for your army. The combat effectiveness of soldiers under the command of generals will be enhanced.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Build a palace</strong></h2>In the game, you need to build a famous palace building in the Tang Dynasty, which requires a lot of manpower and building materials. This task is undoubtedly a huge challenge.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Simulate the real environment</strong></h2>The game automatically alternates day and night, and automatically changes seasons. Of course, you can also set a fixed season according to your own preferences.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Restore History</strong></h2>Each city you build in the game is a real city in the Tang Dynasty of China. There will also be historical events consistent with the era in the game, such as the Kaiyuan Prosperity, the An Shi Rebellion, and so on.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"A new dynasty","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2164750/00602d4f028586ef108246aa15a2349bc34e5736.jpg"},{"name":"A new broom","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2164750/fc0d569c21adeff44e95277bd04e43502107d5c7.jpg"},{"name":"Iron and the Army","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2164750/bcf7faadd760fe61271a22a98e2cc1b416cc07df.jpg"},{"name":"The land of abundance","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2164750/d5636e93e12e7a8f8018ab687a51bc5ed5fc83cd.jpg"},{"name":"The northern border","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2164750/853ff2ff26720e315774041c23eb9cc7d0c32eaa.jpg"},{"name":"Desert outpost","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2164750/ef31f8fff1d7321557f3eb20a78062c2af700d5e.jpg"},{"name":"Alluvial plain","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2164750/82fe9ae06738580d0567ec679e3866d5727b0c42.jpg"},{"name":"A new provincial capital","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2164750/2441237743a511317139101c68d6720b0952e85e.jpg"},{"name":"Gap in Helan Mountain","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2164750/59ca60a8a3fa4665caaf3b8f366a116013f0368a.jpg"},{"name":"Luoyang, the eastern capital","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2164750/3fab38dc9114d4a312ad6db56ebb53c3146bb87a.jpg"}],"total":24},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2164750?t=1703675079","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2164750/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1703675079","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2164750/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1703675079","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2164750/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1703675079","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Historical background:</strong></h2>China was in the heyday of the Tang Dynasty from the 7th to the 8th century, which was the peak of China's feudal society.
