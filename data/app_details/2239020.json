Made to Emulate games from the 1990-2000's in terms of design, animation and functionality. This also doesn't pander to any modern sensibilities. It's made to be an OLD game in every way besides visuals.

When you go out and journey into the real world.... Do you find lore papers throughout? No! The locations have titles use them as guidance. It's environmental story telling.. If you have no imagination then this game is not for you.... perhaps you could try using spreadsheets or predicting the cheese stock market instead. Just know that if you are here for an adventure and experiencing something different then this is for you! Otherwise let me know about that stock market with various cheeses will you?
