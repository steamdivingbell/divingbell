Even though I wrestled with the pitch-perfect timing required to clear Pole Vault and Gymnastics, I do believe they can be won with enough time, patience and luck. Meanwhile, the 100m Dash, 100m Freestyle, and Platform Diving have a more subdued challenge. You can get a decent score without much trouble, but to get a good score, you\u2019ll have to practice. When it comes to the sports minigame genre (such as it is), I\u2019m more of a Track &amp; Field man, but Summer Games is still the best in the Games series\u201d<br />\r\nSega Does (Apr 10, 2017)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cSummer Games is an impressive technical accomplishment and a lot of fun.
