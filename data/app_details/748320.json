He is catapulted into an extraordinary adventure where he must save his pet cat, \u2018Mr Dirty Paws\u2019, and bring colour back to the surreal feline world. Along the way he meets all manner of cats. Some try to use him to do their bidding, some want him dead and use all manner of deception to end his life.

From the moment he opens his eyes to see the surreal monochrome cat world he can run, jump, dash, and wall jump. His friendly droid FT follows him around as his flying arsenal of ranged weapons. Once Art has a sword he can hack away at enemies and do some cool combos, hack-stab-hack, hack-kick-hack up, you get the picture. Most of the swords Art finds deal more damage to organic enemies whilst FT's guns do more damage to mechanical enemies making them the perfect duo. In the surreal world of cats there aren't just organic and mechanical enemies, oh no! There are organic enemies wearing mechanical armour, mechanical baddies with organic internals and brains, machines that wear other living beings as armour. This is a strange and deadly world and Art and FT must work together to overcome the plethora of threats facing them.<br><br>As well as the hack 'n' shoot lifestyle that Art and FT must adopt they also need to explore the world. Exploration on the isometric world map will uncover new areas, characters to talk to, side quests, and loot. Art can travel to a number of towns where he can help the locals, buy supplies, and do all manner of side activities. Once Art and FT have cleared out the enemies from an area they can explore the area using Art's  moves; jumping holes, climbing cliffs, dashing over spike pits to uncover hidden treasure and quest items.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/748320/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728392461","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/748320/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1728392461","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/748320/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728392461","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/748320/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728392461","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Flawless: Art\u2019s Tale is an epic adventure set in a brutal world of cats.</strong></h2><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/748320/extras/Epic_Tale.png?t=1728392461\" /><br>Cats sleep for over seventy percent of their lives...<br><br>Or do they?<br><br>Welcome to Typha, the world where cats go to when they sleep.
