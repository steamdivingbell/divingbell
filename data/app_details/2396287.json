{"about_the_game":"The Mini Ultra Stick was E-flite's first-ever &quot;wood&quot; PNP (Plug-N-Play) and ARF (Almost-Ready-To-Fly) model that became an instant best-seller when it was released in 2005. It was available for more than a decade and is still iconic to this day because it went together as easily and in as little time as foam PNP models, yet offered the advantages of lightweight, stiff, and strong wood construction that delivered flight performance unlike similar class fully-molded EPS and EPO foam models. The Ultra Stick 1.1m is an updated and upgraded version that is slightly larger to offer even better flight performance with extremely popular and common 3S or 4S 2200\u20133200mAh batteries. It's available in an ARF version that bolts together and is ready for installation of your preferred power system and electronics, or in a BNF Basic version that's equipped with four factory-installed servos, a Spektrum Avian Smart ESC and motor, plus a 6-channel receiver with AS3X and SAFE Select technologies. Both versions are ready to accept two additional wing servos for &quot;crow&quot; and/or flaps plus full-span aileron/flaperon/spoileron setups, as well as optional wheel pants to look even more like the larger Hangar 9 Ultra Stick models the design is based on. That design offers excellent low-speed characteristics for easier landings, incredible high-speed handling, and impressive aerobatic capabilities that intermediate to experienced pilots will appreciate and enjoy!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis model is equipped with Horizon Hobby and Spektrum exclusive AS3X (Artificial Stabilization \u2013 3-aXis) and optional-use SAFE (Sensor Assisted Flight Envelope) Select technologies, and when SAFE Select is turned on using the mode switch (B on the Spektrum InterLink DX controller) it offers:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPitch and Bank Angle Limits<br />\r\nThese envelope limits keep the airplane from rolling or pitching upside down.  They also prevent excessive climb or dive angles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAutomatic Self-Leveling<br />\r\nThe airplane instantly returns to and holds level flight when the sticks are released and in the center position.  It\u2019s also helpful for keeping the wings level during takeoffs and landings.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396287/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1699908577","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396287/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1699908577","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396287/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1699908577","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396287/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1699908577","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Mini Ultra Stick was E-flite's first-ever &quot;wood&quot; PNP (Plug-N-Play) and ARF (Almost-Ready-To-Fly) model that became an instant best-seller when it was released in 2005.
