{"about_the_game":"Mysterious planets are located in the Maskros Nebula\u2014a galaxy far away from Earth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Pieces I: A Maskros Nebula Game, you solve three jigsaw puzzles that will give you a glimpse of three distant planets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- First, we take a look at the exteriors of the pizzeria &quot;PizzaPastaMaro&quot; in the cyber city Emoh, which is located on the planet CobeeDot. PPM was founded by Maro, a sentient android, and is frequented by many pizza fans in the city.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Next up is Nou-Raex\u2014a planet not too far from CobeeDot that is rich in plants. Teenager Norx loves the quietude of the morning and enjoys his walks in the swamp.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- The third planet we visit is called Eskolea (or &quot;Downpourlea&quot; to its inhabitants). This rather dystopian planet is characterized by rainy, stormy, cloudy days and nights. Somewhat eerie that it's a rainless night all of a sudden...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach puzzle consists of 144 pieces and takes about 30-60 minutes to complete. Featuring comic-style drawings, illustrative descriptions and a beautiful, soothing soundtrack, Pieces I introduces you to the universe of the Maskros Nebula and some iconic characters you will meet in later (narrative) owly crow games.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"CobeeDot","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2781310/ecd0fcb39b2ce9139c2ed6348d460da04ed3c87f.jpg"},{"name":"Nou-Raex","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2781310/127ca22c794c742f7630d6d42c563b25d9587799.jpg"},{"name":"Eskolea","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2781310/866e6655ddef48ae493247a7992fd8bb97c48de2.jpg"},{"name":"Emoh","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2781310/fb527338fc6c907979ed2a3819bb017da9d5f9c3.jpg"},{"name":"Completionist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2781310/415330e719caa9f0f7eb31c0a345a32b19609393.jpg"},{"name":"True Puzzler","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2781310/391ac1d7454e83401a1680cac50c9ba2c8e6b8cb.jpg"}],"total":6},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2781310/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1713450413","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2781310/page.bg.jpg?t=1713450413","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2781310/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1713450413","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2781310/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1713450413","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Mysterious planets are located in the Maskros Nebula\u2014a galaxy far away from Earth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Pieces I: A Maskros Nebula Game, you solve three jigsaw puzzles that will give you a glimpse of three distant planets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- First, we take a look at the exteriors of the pizzeria &quot;PizzaPastaMaro&quot; in the cyber city Emoh, which is located on the planet CobeeDot.
