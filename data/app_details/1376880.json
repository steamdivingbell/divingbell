In Ultimate Hunting\u2122, you'll have various clothing options that affect how animals detect you. Avoiding detection requires you to hide from an animal\u2019s sight, smell, and hearing. Use natural barriers like terrain, rocks, trees, tall grass, and bushes to limit visibility, and ensure your camouflage matches the surroundings.

Thoughtful camouflage and strategic movement are key to a successful hunt.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1376880/extras/rags2.gif?t=1739264945\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">UNIQUE TROPHIES WITH RAGS</h2>The Random Antler Generation System (RAGS) in Ultimate Hunting ensures every trophy is unique.
