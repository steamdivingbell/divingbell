{"about_the_game":"You find yourself in the Australian outback with the bare minimum to survive. You are surrounded by Australian wildlife and most of it is as deadly as it comes. You have no memory of who you are and how you got here. You also find out that people appear to have abandoned this area. <br><br>Surviving in the Australian outback isn't easy - it is an extremely harsh environment with extreme temperatures, low rainfall, and little vegetation. The water is scarce. You will have to find your own strategy to survive, manage the heat and gather food. <br><br>Who are you and how did you get here?<br><br>Why are you alone?<br><br>Why did people leave this place?<br><br>How do you get back to civilisation?<br><br>And finally, are you really alone...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Survival</h2>Australian wildlife isn't the friendliest in the world. Kangaroos and dingoes can be aggressive, but saltwater crocodiles or the eastern brown snake will most likely cause your death if you get too close to them. <br><br>You will have to develop your own strategy to survive. You can either approach them directly with a weapon you crafted earlier, or you can build traps and prepare poisoned baits. <br><br>However, wildlife isn't your biggest problem. Extreme temperatures and dehydration is what usually kills people stranded in the Australian outback. You must find water. You must find shade. You may consider sleeping through the heat of the day and explore the outback at a night time. Or you can gather as much water as you can and continue exploring. You may carefully plan the trip so you stay shaded for most of it. The choice is entirely up to you. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2201540/extras/SnakeTrap.gif?t=1704942482\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build and Craft</h2>Building system allows players to build the shelter as advanced or as simple as they want.
