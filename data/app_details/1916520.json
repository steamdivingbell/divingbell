{"about_the_game":"Game content<br />\r\nYou are an agent on a mission to prevent the outbreak of nuclear war, but your mission failed. During the mission, you mistakenly entered an underground facility and regarded its personnel as terrorists to be eliminated in the mission. When you think the target has been solved, the first nuclear bomb has already fallen into the city, and everything you know has disappeared in the nuclear war. Nevertheless, human history is far from coming to an end. AI Noa in the underground facilities rescued you from the collapsed cave and invited you to replace her last &quot;operator&quot; to help her complete the work entrusted to her by the creator. You will guide the human civilization that will emerge later and help them move from slash and burn to the Starry Sea as soon as possible, Finally send them out of the cradle where they were born.<br />\r\nAs for why Noa's creator gave her the job? I'm afraid you have to find the answer yourself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame playing method<br />\r\n\u300aNoa\u300b is an AVG. It is mainly composed of technology acquisition interface and civilization conflict interface. Players get new technologies in the technology acquisition interface. These technologies can be applied in the civilization conflict page. When using technology, players can choose whether this technology is offensive or defensive, so as to achieve the goal of 100% occupation of the planet. The civilization controlled by the player has multiple endings. Reaching these endings can increase the player's understanding of the plot and ultimately determine the ending of Project Noa.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame features<br />\r\n1.
