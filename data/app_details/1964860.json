{"about_the_game":"Titan Shell is a roguelike twin-stick platformer set in a dystopian world. A recent slew of holy decrees from the theocratic government have placed countless people in prison for seemingly pointless reasons. Stories tell of a strange device hidden at the heart of the nation where one can speak directly to the Gods themselves to plead their case. But first they must fight their way across a massive mountain full of hazardous terrain, bloodthirsty mercenaries, and a ridiculously well-funded police force.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1964860/extras/KickstarterHeadersGameplaySteamRevision.png?t=1660313762\" /><br>In Titan Shell, you will fight through six levels jam packed with powerful foes, mysterious vagabonds, and hidden power ups. In standard roguelike fashion, the rooms, enemies and NPCs you encounter on each run will vary, making each run through the game different from the last.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1964860/extras/d1da01ec04a903dda83352b9bb7bed21_original__1_.gif?t=1660313762\" /><br>The world of Titan Shell will not go easy on you. Power up your shell with special guns and stat boosts to even the playing field against a barrage of seemingly endless enemies. But if your shell is destroyed, not all is lost! You will eject from your machine and continue your run with nothing but the clothes on your back. You can even willingly leave your shell too. But be careful! While you are a smaller and faster target in this state, it won\u2019t take many hits before you are completely incapacitated.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1964860/extras/KickstarterHeadersStorySteamRevision.png?t=1660313762\" /><br>Titan Shell takes place in a nation built atop a mountain surrounded by desolate wasteland, guided by the wisdom of a church claiming to have a direct line of communication to the Gods. But recently the church began issuing stricter laws and harsher punishments carried out by a brutal police force. This led to the expansion of the nations largest prison, a once humble shack tucked away in the wilderness, now overflowing with political decenters, freedom fighters and independent journalists - you know, \u201ccriminals\u201d.
