This monster mainline runs at capacity all hours of the day, with fast and slow lines offering local and longer-distance commuter destinations. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Accelerating through the dense boroughs of Camden and Brent, the WCML is accompanied by further passenger and freight action. The Bakerloo line surfaces at Queens Park, and shares tracks with the Lioness line.
