It's inspired by Vampire Survivors and other casual, bullet heaven, roguelite, survivor-likes (Spellbook: Demonslayers, Rogue Genesia, and Nomad Survival are some other faves), ancient arcade classics such as Robotron 2084, and the upgrade system is influenced by action RPGs (like the Diablo series, Grim Dawn, and Last Epoch). Unlike other offerings in the genre, instead of a choice of random ability upgrades available when leveling up, the player has full control of how Cy's stats will develop. You can also unlock your choice of starting powers.<br><br>Community input is important to us.
