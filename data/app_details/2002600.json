{"about_the_game":"&quot;The Conquest of China&quot; is a RPG role-playing game centered around Liu Bei of the Shu Kingdom. Unlike other Three Kingdoms RPGs, the game does not start with the usual storyline, but instead begins with the murder of Liu's mother by the Yellow Turban Rebellion, setting Liu on a path of revenge. Along the way, he meets like-minded individuals such as Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, and together they pledge to save the people in a world of chaos under the peach blossom oath. The game has a total of thirteen main chapters, with a fourteenth chapter added in the third playthrough. Each chapter is based on historical events, and there are also numerous side quests that add to the game's depth. In addition to the familiar Three Kingdoms storyline, the game's lesser-known side quests provide a sense of freshness and novelty, making it a compelling experience to play.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"\u6843\u56ed\u7ed3\u4e49","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2002600/1b410d7fbc48cb7d42d4365d08e4e5ebf97a8845.jpg"},{"name":"\u82f1\u96c4\u51fa\u9053","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2002600/c79d9226f36a0484c29294cf02f2fe3f2bbbca66.jpg"},{"name":"\u6551\u67b6\u6709\u529f","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2002600/ef63feb32ff28b5aa9548c53f12d082e3c13c161.jpg"},{"name":"\u5321\u6276\u5927\u6c49","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2002600/8dbf9bcbca66c4648e25a7ff3ac996dcc6f326e8.jpg"},{"name":"\u4ec1\u4e3b\u4e4b\u59ff","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2002600/2d7968f9cff6e4f73984fc1f2319862793eea67f.jpg"},{"name":"\u5fe0\u4e49\u5343\u53e4","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2002600/f240ccbdb87d0399c7a8b5574a198b3b42d1f681.jpg"},{"name":"\u4e09\u987e\u4e4b\u793c","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2002600/c86a8c2735be24be73e96f853661690e2bf301e8.jpg"},{"name":"\u9f50\u5fc3\u534f\u529b","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2002600/b4040f4dc6936ee90330fdd87539897bb236df46.jpg"},{"name":"\u4e09\u8db3\u9f0e\u7acb","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2002600/c0a248b11c48bc00fe9a4c1a603f2346a3729151.jpg"},{"name":"\u5343\u94a7\u4e00\u53d1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2002600/4a31772ed30a4d2f946e44d52b34b93a96abb685.jpg"}],"total":13},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2002600/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1722739045","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2002600/page.bg.jpg?t=1722739045","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2002600/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1722739045","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2002600/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1722739045","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;The Conquest of China&quot; is a RPG role-playing game centered around Liu Bei of the Shu Kingdom.
