{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Red Rogue</strong> <strong>Sea</strong> is a roguelike strategy game that puts you in the shoes of a pirate captain and their crew. You will manage your vessel as you sail through the treacherous waters of the archipelago, interacting with the scum that inhabits it. Make decisions that impact the outcome of various events and the overall narrative. Sail from island to island on a map of randomly generated nodes, making each game unique. Defend your reputation and increase your loot by engaging in battles using mechanics that blend deck-building with crew and ship system management. Arm yourself with courage and join the legends of the Red Rogue Sea!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3200220/extras/wishlist_board_SP_v1.gif?t=1738736431\" /> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Game Features:</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i><strong>Unlock your fleet:</strong></i> Gain access to new ships and factions enabling the use of diverse strategies to outwit the fleet of the fearsome\u00a0Admiral\u00a0White.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3200220/extras/factions_loop.gif?t=1738736431\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i><strong>Manage Your Own Vessel:</strong></i> To survive events and battles, you\u2019ll need to command your crew with a firm hand and ensure that all ship systems and resources are used in the most optimal way.
