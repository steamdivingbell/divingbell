Will you solve the mystery of how you ended up there? And will you be able to return to your time?

Make the right decisions and master the minigames to reach the ending of your choice! The minigames feature unique, science inspired puzzles that will challenge your mind (but you can skip them if it's too hard for you). Moreover, in one of the minigames you will challenge your favorite character to a game of Go, but don't worry: Mr Young is going to explain the rules to you before the game. <br><i>Sweet Science</i> contains several interwoven story lines. To uncover them all, you will play more than one route. One route contains around 5 hours of gameplay, for all routes we estimate 15-20 hours of game play. On the way, you will encounter hundreds of graphics and a full soundtrack, featuring the song &quot;Butterfly Lullaby&quot; composed for this game by Alec Weesner, and the song &quot;Time&quot;, sung by Emilia.<br>&quot;Sweet Science&quot; is waiting for you. \u2013 Will you uncover all its secrets?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cast:</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2309230/extras/screenshot0055.png?t=1714359108\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2309230/extras/screenshot0056.png?t=1714359108\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2309230/extras/screenshot0057.png?t=1714359108\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2309230/extras/screenshot0058.png?t=1714359108\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2309230/extras/screenshot0059.png?t=1714359108\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Artificial Intelligence</h2><br>This is one of the first real AI-generated visual novels: nearly all artwork was generated by AI artists (NovelAI, DALL-E 2, Diffusion Bee).
