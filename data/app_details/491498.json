{"about_the_game":"Convair's  superb F-106 Delta Dart  is regarded by those close to it as the best all-weather interceptor ever designed. It was created as an outgrowth of the USAF's interceptor program in 1954. The aircraft used a delta wing design, common at the time because of its immunity to many of the problems experienced by conventional wings at supersonic speeds. In December, 1959 the aircraft set a world speed record of Mach 2.31 (1,526 mph) at 40,500 feet. It was equipped with advanced Hughes fire-control systems and could be controlled from the ground to some extent. The aircraft remained in service for 28 years, ultimately being replaced by the F-15 in 1981 but serving with the Air National Guard until 1988. The last unmanned Delta Dart drone was destroyed in 1998.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features </h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Includes both single seater and 2-seater versions <br></li><li>Authentic virtual cockpit with animations and mousable controls<br></li><li>Working radar system, capable of tracking unlimited targets and providing ID, aircraft type, heading and altitude.
