{"about_the_game":"Digital Paintball Redux is an online Multiplayer paintball game setup to give players the best online paintball experience on the market. This first-person shooter consists of maps with different styles of playing formats: woodsball, speedball, airball, and hyperball. The game brings constant action and has an easy learning curve for players coming from any gaming background.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe original Digital Paintball was born from individuals who had a love for paintball and gaming, and so the development of Digital Paintball 2.1 Beta was released in September of 2002. Digital Paintball had a vision to bring the most \u201crealistic\u201d paintball experience to online gaming. With backing from an outstanding community from all walks of life, including paintball players and non-paintball players, the online community in Digital Paintball became a close group of friends.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDigital Paintball: Source Alpha was released March 25th, 2007 and included innovative features never before seen in other paintball games. Alpha 2 was later released in 2007 and this was the time the development team began to move on to other projects. Life commitments and families became priority and the Digital Paintball community has had spurts of players keeping Digital Paintball 2.1 alive ever since. Semi-consistent releases of new maps and markers were made to feed the hunger for something new to the community. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow with the gracious help of the Digital Paintball community members Digital Paintball Redux is picking up where DPB 2.1 left off! We wanted to bring Digital Paintball up to today's standards of gear, visuals, and one of the most important things of all, Steam Community compatibility.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe look forward to bringing the go-to online paintball experience to your PC.<br />\r\nPlease be sure to join our Discord and Facebook groups to stay in touch with other players who have a passion for paintball and online gaming.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you all!<br />\r\nWe'll see you on the field.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1066610/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1592630718","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1066610/page.bg.jpg?t=1592630718","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1066610/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1592630718","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1066610/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1592630718","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Digital Paintball Redux is an online Multiplayer paintball game setup to give players the best online paintball experience on the market.
