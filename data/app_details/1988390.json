{"about_the_game":"People's thirst to conquer worlds will never wane.

Supplies were depleted, energy was running out, and inhabited worlds were never reached. A desperate attempt to save the crew forced the artificial intelligence to take extreme measures\u2026<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInstead of pleasant fresh air filling the lungs, the titanium-type atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen. Instead of luxurious flora covering the entire globe, a lifeless desert. Fortunately there were rare deposits of carbon dioxide, salts, but most importantly water!

Let's not go that far, it will require huge reserves of energy, and it is not so easy to accumulate, one problem at a time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt's an exciting and challenging adventure as the AI.
