{"about_the_game":"Task Force is the ultimate tactical shooter sandbox that focuses on close quarters infantry combat. It aims to provide competitive arcade-style gameplay inspired by classic third-person games. Maps will include locations around the world where special operations are conducted. These could be jungles, deserts, urban areas or snowy environments. They'll be designed around single-life game modes with mechanics involving either bombs, hostages, or intel.<br><br>There are NO plans to include any of the following in Task Force:<br>- NO Health Regeneration<br>- NO Weapon Unlocks or Economy<br>- NO Enemy Targeting (UAV)<br>- NO Character Progression<br>- NO Killstreaks, Deathstreaks, or Perks<br>- NO Drivable Vehicles in PvP (Co-op Only)<br>- NO Looting or Weapon Drops<br>- NO Unrealistic Skins<br><br><strong>TACTICAL THIRD-PERSON GAMEPLAY</strong><br>Gameplay focuses on close quarters infantry combat where communication and teamwork are required. Expanding crosshairs provide a sense of weapon inaccuracy which is affected by recoil, stance, movement, and a few other factors. It rewards bursting by keeping tighter shots more precise while still allowing for accurate spray.<br><br><strong>STRATEGIC ROUND-BASED GAME MODES</strong><br>Game modes are round-based and mostly focus on single-life objectives. They\u2019ll involve aspects such as planting or defusing bombs, extracting or guarding hostages, and capturing or defending intel. Each map will be designed to a specific game mode but may also have different areas sectioned off for different modes.<br><br><strong>COMPETITIVE LEAGUES AND RANKINGS</strong><br>Automated ladders and tournaments are integrated directly into the game. Players are provided with a detailed stats profile and a global ranking based on competitive performance. Servers are automatically created for scheduled matches and will instantly report game information upon match completion.<br><br><strong>CUSTOM USER-CREATED LOBBIES</strong><br>Servers are organized based on region and players have the ability to create their own lobbies directly in-game. These custom lobbies provide access to a robust set of management tools such as restricting players to friends-only or clan-only. It also allows for region-locking servers and automatically kicking high ping players.","achievements":{"total":0},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/611300/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1722541876","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/611300/page.bg.jpg?t=1722541876","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/611300/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1722541876","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/611300/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1722541876","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"HDR available","id":61},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Workshop Support</h1><p>Task Force provides modders with the ability to upload custom maps, characters, and sounds using our built-in workshop tool. This workshop content can be added to any dedicated server or hosted user-created server and then included in your server maplist.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/611300/extras/editor.png?t=1722541876\" /><br><br>There's also the ability to access in-game content to use in custom maps.

It's 100% free to use and only requires an Epic Games account with a linked GitHub account. However accessing in-game content requires Task Force to be installed in your Steam library.<br><br>Just head over to GitHub to get started: </p><br><h1>Controller Support</h1><p>All controller sensitivities, deadzones, and buttons are customizable through the in-game menu. There\u2019s also support for creating controller-only rooms. This removes the ability to use a mouse and restricts input to joysticks only. The controller-only option is available when creating a custom server and will display a special icon in the server browser.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Task Force is the ultimate tactical shooter sandbox that focuses on close quarters infantry combat.
