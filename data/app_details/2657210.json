Every aspect of daily life is shaped by music: tools, clothing and weapons are replaced by instruments and those who can wield them are greatly admired.<br><br><strong>Wield different instruments!</strong><br>In a world where weapons don't exist, instruments are your only defense. From Violins to Lotus Flutes, each instrument grants you unique abilities and synergizes with other items in the game!<br><br><strong>Fight in a musically responsive world!</strong><br>Your attacks and abilities as well as those of enemies adjust depending on the soundtrack that's currently playing!<br><br><strong>Team work makes the dream work!</strong><br>The Brass Empire may mostly be grunts, but they're not your grandpa's NPCs! Enemies will arrange themselves in formations in order to balance out their weaknesses and counteract your strengths, making for a true challenge.<br><br><strong>Meet some friendly (and not so friendly) faces!</strong><br>Meet a wide variety of unique characters who will help or hinder you on your journey! Complete quests, unlock new items and shape the way the arena changes as you approach its challenges. Vendors can procure you helpful gear and Jerome the brasssmith will upgrade whatever you've gathered along your way.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2657210/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738580980","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2657210/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1738580980","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2657210/9c608b2d3e09e7aacb58a06589159c662b958f60/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738580980","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2657210/9c608b2d3e09e7aacb58a06589159c662b958f60/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738580980","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You awake with no memory of your past, armed with a lyre, surrounded by instrument-bearing warriors.
