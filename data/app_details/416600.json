Play on the couch or online with friends, and make it a party for up to four players!  Or go solo in single-player, and show off your skills through a <strong>Pick 2 quick-switch system</strong> that retains all the nuances of multi-play.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GAME FEATURES</h2></strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Want to play with friends?
