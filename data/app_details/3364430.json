{"about_the_game":"Turn your hero into a samurai, a cyborg, a space ranger, or even a vampire prince with the Hero Character Generator for MZ pack! Gee-kun-soft is back with another excellent MZ-style generator part pack for your male characters, with 57 pieces to dress your heroes for success! 3 AccA, 9 AccB, 2 Beard, 2 Cloak, 20 Clothing, 5 Eyes, 1 Facial Mark, 2 Glasses, 1 Mouth, 1 Wing, 5 Front Hair, and 5 Rear Hair parts are perfect for making all of your male party members and important NPCs memorable compared to the normal citizens in your game. Give your serious soldier party member a short and low maintenance haircut while your brash barbarian has wild long hair barely contained in a ponytail, or show how a character is changing by switching his long flowing hairstyle into a short, loose style with bangs after he makes an important decision. Dress your agility-based fighters in lightweight cloth outfits so they can zip around the battlefield while your samurai are decked out in powerful armor and a gilded helmet to draw the enemy\u2019s attention. Give your game a sci-fi flair with some military uniforms for your hero that he can swap out for strength-enhancing cybernetic armor, and make sure your fantasy hero is properly dressed in a flashy suit when he\u2019s getting knighted by a king!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDon\u2019t forget the little things to take your hero\u2019s design to the next level! Give him a mouth with a fang sticking out to remind your players that he\u2019s not completely human, or add a scar across his face after he loses a fight to his best friend after he\u2019s revealed to be working with the villain the whole time! Let him grow his hair out or grow a beard while time passes in the game, or give your players the choice to switch up his looks depending on what outfits they\u2019ve unlocked. If you\u2019ve been wanting some new looks for your male party members in your fantasy or sci-fi games, pick up the Hero Character Generator for MZ pack!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3364430/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735237199","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3364430/page.bg.jpg?t=1735237199","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3364430/e5d9494bbe4d861282e93166200b2461bf9ca44f/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735237199","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3364430/e5d9494bbe4d861282e93166200b2461bf9ca44f/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735237199","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Turn your hero into a samurai, a cyborg, a space ranger, or even a vampire prince with the Hero Character Generator for MZ pack!
