Your peaceful night is shattered by the eerie mumblings of an unnamed man outside, searching desperately for his lost vinyl records.

The strange man is temporarily distracted as the records play, giving you precious moments to locate and place the remaining records on one of the six gramophones scattered around the clearing.
