DETAILS!! There is a level of detail I wanted to take the time to acknowledge. There is voice acting for every character in the game. This made the stry more entertaining. I was not met with the burden of reading. There is sound for doors and small moments to capture the player's attention.\u201d<br />\r\nChristopher Arsenault<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cSolid presentation, art, music and feel.
