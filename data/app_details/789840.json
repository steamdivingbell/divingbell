{"about_the_game":"<i>Today we passed the point of no return.  We no longer have enough water to<br>back out of the desert.  The only way open to us is forward: through the<br>desert, to the Burning King.  To victory, or to death.</i><br><br><i>The strain of this journey is taking its toll on Nina.  No wonder \u2014 this is<br>her first desert crossing.  I was born in the desert, but Nina was born in a<br>city, in some land unimaginably far away.  She never held a sword before I<br>summoned her to this world.  She never rode a horse.  She never slept under<br>the open sky.  The latter, she still doesn't do.  Every evening, she vanishes<br>before my eyes, and every morning she reappears, guided by the ancient magic<br>that I have released.  And every night I spend in fear, alone, worried that<br>she won't come back.</i><br><br><i>Because I can't do this alone.  I know how to use a sword, but I am no<br>warrior.  No hero.  Not like Nina.  I have seen Nina fight, and I know that I<br>cannot match her, despite my greater experience.  She has the instincts of an<br>adventurer.  Where I like to retreat into by books, she goes out to face the<br>world.  When I look at her, I see the face of the hero destined to defeat the<br>Burning King.</i><br><br><i>The heat is not just draining our bodies, but our spirits.  I feel hot and<br>tired and irritable.  I can only imagine how much worse this is for Nina, who<br>is not used to the desert.  I can only imagine, because we rarely talk anymore.<br>The heat makes speaking painful.  I wish I could tell Nina how much she means<br>to me, how much I appreciate her taking this journey with me, but nothing comes<br>out when I open my mouth.</i><br><br><i>Soon we will reach the great oasis of Daklath.  There we will replenish our<br>waterskins, and hopefully our spirits.  The way through the desert is long,<br>but we have already made it this far.  We will just have to keep going.  To<br>victory, or to death.</i><br><br>Platforming action and adventure game puzzles.  Seven chapters.  Lots of sidequests.  More secrets than you will ever find.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Pedestrian","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/789840/ee6fd9b5cf60f7d71d6fa47db30e04cf1f1cf074.jpg"},{"name":"Fighter","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/789840/89652217a8a65ce67ffbd751a54e61d3779388bd.jpg"},{"name":"Rider","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/789840/3391fafa98a8ea0a38857ff9a240a5a1f327408e.jpg"},{"name":"Adventurer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/789840/5aed9431ee5ee86a535491e9f47b8d78d332768c.jpg"},{"name":"Nomad","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/789840/ea3dbb2c6f51690f9dfa9e5b5c583e6f9cf73077.jpg"},{"name":"Avenger","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/789840/3010e97bad27df235ed780f05c940aa2eff3bf8b.jpg"},{"name":"Survivalist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/789840/4f59b390a22fd9a1cea8711348f36dc11a66d9d3.jpg"},{"name":"Hero of Renown","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/789840/40cdf7fdf2fd5198fa9583fbc2cd976780bdf36a.jpg"},{"name":"Hero of Legend","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/789840/98557698671591e15a091df72976f863706c314b.jpg"},{"name":"Hero of Myth","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/789840/6dd2e9fc73357117873a81c0683690495f1f9c5a.jpg"}],"total":38},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/789840/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1721936908","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/789840/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1721936908","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/789840/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1721936908","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/789840/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1721936908","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":3084250,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<i>Today we passed the point of no return.
