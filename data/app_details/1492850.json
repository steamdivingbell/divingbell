{"about_the_game":"Mulligans Golf Game is a wacky, arcade golfing game. Gameplay is designed to give the player complete freedom to play how they want in the world of a simplified yet challenging golfing experience. It is not a Sim! But it is designed to provide the scenarios and emotions that come when playing real golf. Players choose from the available pool of legendary characters and pre-built maps, either playing solo or with friends (local split screen and/or online), attempting to set new personal bests, going for course records (local and global leaderboards), or grabbing some friends and challenging each other to see who is the best!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What is there to do?</h2>Play local matches competing against yourself. Personal Records (per character) and Local Leaderboards (per map) are maintained. Global Steam leaderboards are also implemented so you can compete against others for the top spot! <br>Local Multiplayer has up to 4 players with Steam's Remote Play enabled. So if you don't have someone local to play against, invite a friend over the airwaves! Play matches against each other and make in game wagers on who is going to do better (long drives, closes to the pin, and best score). Also, checkout the driving range for a few different game modes and see who can get the better score. Or just run around throwing golf balls at one another.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Taking a Swing</h2>As a player, you are given all the tools you need, but must make the decision on what kind of shot (normal, punch, flop, chip), how to shape it (fade, straight, draw), and how hard to hit it. The game will not tell you any more than recommending a club to use. So lineup and take a few practice swings to determine your plan of attack. Practice swings will update the estimated shot trajectory, allowing you to determine if your current approach is going to work. Then it is up to you to replicate your practice swing once addressing the ball. And if you mess it up, hopefully you have one of your Mulligans available to redo it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Characters </h2>Characters have skills that are designed to improve your ability to hit better shots, but will not do the work for you. Temporary skill modifiers are applied while playing based on how your character is performing and items are available to consume to provide temporary modifiers as well. Currently there are only Legendary characters available to select from. Custom characters will be coming with early access.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Courses </h2>The game will have different Map Types which are designed to provide different challenges and apply variations to how you play the game. To start we have the Simplified Map Type which provides the basic golfing experience. There are a list of courses available in the game that everyone has access to and will maintain global leaderboards for you to scratch your competitive itch!
