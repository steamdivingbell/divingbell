You can switch between three pre-loaded weapon categories and launch the installed weapons every few seconds. Each round you fire costs you RAM and each weapon type has its own unique cooldown so you must choose wisely and adapt quickly to different situations. But beware, aiming requires some skill.

In addition there are 7 production towers which produce your main resource: RAM (Random Access Memory). Yes, building up a small RAM economy is very important, in order to keep your system routines running. Towers must be deployed by an expensive capsule drop and you have to find the sweet spot between the right amount of resource production towers and the performance of your defense perimeter. You can unlock and install new tower versions in the uplab.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Conquer - Real Time Strategy</h2>Spawn Intrusion Counter Measures (ICMs) in order to conquer corrupted system-structures like databases, honeypots and firewalls. Databases e.g. spawn datablips, which carry valuable data and head for your backup-devices. Every datablip successfully arriving at its destination releases a certain amount of RAM, so you should do your best to protect those important but vulnerable convoys.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Offense Certificate","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/443420/c23a74d33b2af63f66a3d986dca8a181ba46db99.jpg"},{"name":"Defense Certificate","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/443420/9290594613329e0299d6b8863eccaf8f1f41332c.jpg"},{"name":"Conquer Certificate","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/443420/a34b85a380706d6dbe537addcec9adb10034770a.jpg"},{"name":"Subsystem Specialist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/443420/ab977429bfa5cfae8d4d9a52774fd6df190d06a9.jpg"},{"name":"System Corporal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/443420/686d720da89545cd35167f13d2664c018fe3dae4.jpg"},{"name":"System Sergeant","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/443420/201c5cd9b8613b7831912a9a13336f04f1c5823f.jpg"},{"name":"System Major","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/443420/27e6966ffb1c58da067eec7ad2b19e5182b2dee7.jpg"},{"name":"Mainframe Officer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/443420/f06607b7862eb89cf68f15e8180b8e6613df2601.jpg"},{"name":"Mainframe Lieutenant","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/443420/0a001a8b5906e8cdec28afc553bb2d807ac52383.jpg"},{"name":"Mainframe Commander","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/443420/ad5eb6ab1177e10a9b43427c1809a88739805d0e.jpg"}],"total":16},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/443420/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1499705272","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/443420/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1499705272","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/443420/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1499705272","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/443420/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1499705272","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">In a nutshell:</h2><i>&quot;It's a yummy cocktail out of a AC130-Top-Down Shooter, RTS and a bit of Tower Defense.
