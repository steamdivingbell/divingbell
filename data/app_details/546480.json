{"about_the_game":"&quot;Atomic Butcher: Homo Metabolicus&quot; original Soundtrack - A collection of all music tracks used in the game. This pounding industrial-metal soundtrack is the score to the excessive violence and preposterous mayhem going on in &quot;Atomic Butcher: Homo Metabtolicus&quot;, blaring from the speakers as the Butcher slaughters his way through a post-apocalyptic wasteland. The tracks were composed by two members of Austrian Black Metal Band &quot;Locus Neminis&quot;, Franz Enkner and Xarius Neminis. The OST incorporates brutal metal-riffs, driving techno beats and ambient soundscapes to create an aural representation of a world gone utterly insane!<br><br>Included are 22 tracks that amount to a total of 73 minutes.<br><br><strong>Tracklist:</strong><br>01.
