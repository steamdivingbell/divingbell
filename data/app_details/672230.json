The mounting medical debts are something you can only dream to pay off with your low wage from a stagnant position in medical research.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut then, one day, seemingly out of the blue, what promises to be a miracle cure for Grace lands in your lap. But as always, nothing comes for free - and when you set out to try to unravel the mystery of where this mysterious cure came from, things take a very sinister turn.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSet in modern day Maine with a backdrop of never-ending autumn rain, I fell from Grace is a side scrolling 2D pixel adventure mystery game that blends storytelling and puzzle solving with a branching narrative which means that the decisions you as a player make, will affect how your story unfolds (there are around 20 different endings).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI fell from Grace is a poetic journey, where all your interactions with work colleagues and townsfolk are all presented in rhyme.
