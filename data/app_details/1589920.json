Collect feathers or coins in your path. Some game elements change the ball's path, while others react to being hit by the ball. Try to interact with everything to figure out how they work! Take your time to figure out the best solution for each puzzle. Or, if you get stuck, use the integrated hints system for a bit of help with the next move. Or all of them, it's up to you!<br><br><br>In story levels, the goal is to collect all the feathers before your run out of moves. Each collected feather reveals another bit of the story. In coins levels, the goal is to collect all coins and depending on how many moves you make, you're awarded up to three gems. Besides showing your puzzle solving skills, gems are also used to unlock new chapters. As for coins, you'll be able to spend those on skins to customize the rolling ball!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Ungrateful child","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1589920/68ee2ec8c39b6d2a594517570ad88da4a4d7b89e.jpg"},{"name":"Summer hero","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1589920/3bb51ee917bb6aaa3fcccc5951053765dae50186.jpg"},{"name":"A small treasure","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1589920/03fba348f92fc0963492c317ef1717b8145bba5e.jpg"},{"name":"Blade wielder","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1589920/d29cba61731542d018a9a3ca17e4406d156cc7b6.jpg"},{"name":"Autumn hero","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1589920/2c614723ac3e6ddeef365ca5925b257b2734a8a7.jpg"},{"name":"Enough for a necklace","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1589920/7942ca1430a320ab1d709e32b71e15a38fb5c203.jpg"},{"name":"Kind hearted","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1589920/17809bb4b342220d22950705aa1fb7eb4e4052d9.jpg"},{"name":"Mountain hero","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1589920/a1245e018a4117f3b1c56cbadd0ae238ef659363.jpg"},{"name":"Might need them later","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1589920/a2547659c207ff04add8d2e1a31c3bf0b858321a.jpg"},{"name":"Silent spectator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1589920/6ee9cdc884ba96336fb8cee33d33cfc0f1f871f0.jpg"}],"total":39},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1589920?t=1726314394","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1589920/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1726314394","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1589920/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726314394","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1589920/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726314394","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1589920/extras/LogoDescription.png?t=1726314394\" /><br>Long Ago: A Puzzle Tale is a relaxing puzzle game combined with a modern fairy tale told in rhyme.
