{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Referee's Briefing 1: Companies &amp; Corporations</h2>Economics is one of the fundamental driving forces in any society, and Charted Space is full of groups trying to make a living - or better, a big profit. Companies and Corporations presents some of these groups along with their agenda, their methods and any dark secrets they may have. These commercial bodies are much smaller than the great Megacorporations, but some of them are major players in their own field. They might be encountered as patrons, allies, opponents or victims of the Travellers' schemes, adding depth and colour to that generic row of starport cargo brokers and putting a backstory to that pile of freight containers.<br>This book contains a number of commercial entities which can be used by the referee as part of the backdrop or a key part of an adventure. Since the Travellers keep encountering detailed companies, they will not be able to guess which one is important to the plot and which are essentially red herrings.<br> <i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by:</i> <strong>ColinRichardson</strong> <br> <br> <strong>Requires:</strong> An active subscription or a one time purchase of a Fantasy Grounds Full or Ultimate license and a one time purchase of the Traveller 2E (Mongoose) ruleset.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1361930?t=1595350149","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1361930?t=1595350149","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1361930/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1595350149","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1361930/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1595350149","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Referee's Briefing 1: Companies &amp; Corporations</h2>Economics is one of the fundamental driving forces in any society, and Charted Space is full of groups trying to make a living - or better, a big profit.
