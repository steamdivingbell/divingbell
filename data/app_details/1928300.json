Each subterranean is powered by aortic crystals, metritic energy crystals that keep synthetic biomes 'alive' and manage the system's behavior and defenses. The system has a simple objective, to maintain the balance of synthetic biomes and eliminate any type of biological invasion or not in the refuge. As it was to be expected, the undergrounds did not completely resist the nuclear chemical bombardments, making many undergrounds uninhabitable and totally hostile, few refuges partially resisted the war, bringing a problem that puts human existence in possible extinction; with the atmosphere made chemically toxic, the little oxygen and fresh water from underground become vital.
