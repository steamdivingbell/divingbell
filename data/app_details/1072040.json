For this reason, Panzer Corps 2 includes the most powerful Scenario Editor we have ever created, which is also very user friendly and easy to use. Using the Editor, you can create your own campaigns, single scenarios and multiplayer maps in no time, or you can enjoy content created by fellow players. If the prequel game is any indication, literally hundreds of user-made scenarios will be available for Panzer Corps 2 in no time, for unlimited replayability!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"You are the Best","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1072040/cf151ff6a809d33a59f06c7d61495f7498645b7b.jpg"},{"name":"Prepped for Battle","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1072040/8659e516b67af60ffd2ae6a5434cd4d849930d57.jpg"},{"name":"Mouse Hunter","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1072040/1a2cc577c01fa5ffb26cacd4e5ed18a1ad3076d7.jpg"},{"name":"Successful Surrender","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1072040/42642e077c5735419c9b338227350d39c8b84dc9.jpg"},{"name":"The Great Escape","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1072040/b912567591f9c4ebda28b8a13a87c141c4aadc4e.jpg"},{"name":"Impossible is Possible","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1072040/1ac0afd0e9c167e49d3e1053a675deab44336761.jpg"},{"name":"Cat Hunter","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1072040/d462b38e826bad6f8faf462db25b18f022bc1463.jpg"},{"name":"Panther Hunter","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1072040/6cd707a8bec327c0a77a4e9db514772d275c06e5.jpg"},{"name":"Victory Fireworks","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1072040/1c32fab3d10eb97a9e8ef7ae0796c4018ac2d168.jpg"},{"name":"Helpful Enemy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1072040/2b8c66eeeac7d7eb8db38c0b03ac9109ad78614a.jpg"}],"total":95},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1072040/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726825193","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1072040/page.bg.jpg?t=1726825193","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1072040/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726825193","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1072040/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726825193","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Axis Operations Bundle</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1072040/extras/PC2-1940_spotlight-bundle.jpg?t=1726825193\" /><br><br>All the Axis Operations DLCs in a single bundle.
