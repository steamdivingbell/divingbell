Cromp is super passionate about two things; Making people smile and slamming away on his Bonker drums. He practices every moment he is not at school or being pestered by his 23 siblings. One day, he wants to start a band and try to make people smile all over the universe. His dad laughs at him and just wants him to join the family business of snark shaving. But nothing will stomp on this Cromps dreams. He is going to keep grinding and get better every day. He hopes one day to make you, and everyone else out there, smile.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1863770/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1647710687","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1863770/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1647710687","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1863770/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1647710687","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1863770/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1647710687","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":1913520,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"The Kickstarter is now live.
