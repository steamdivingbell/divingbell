{"about_the_game":"Jump into the portal and take the journey, not just with your LEGO\u00ae minifigure but with your ears as well. The soundtrack of LEGO Bricktales is a globetrotting mix of styles that serves as the musical backdrop for your building adventures. Dense jungles, busy bazaars, regal castle interiors, concrete streets and sandy pirate beaches, arrangements ranging from orchestral elements to moody synths and laid back beats, it's downright eclectic. And hey, maybe you can use it for some inspiration while building with real LEGO bricks?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2147170/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1665641954","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2147170/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1665641954","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2147170/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1665641954","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2147170/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1665641954","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Jump into the portal and take the journey, not just with your LEGO\u00ae minifigure but with your ears as well.
