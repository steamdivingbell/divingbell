{"about_the_game":"Sentry System combines modern roguelike systems with classic tower defense gameplay. Collect and modify sentries, make use of interactive environments, and face off against varied enemies and boss encounters.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Modify Your Sentries</h2><br>Choose from a wide selection of sentries. Change damage types, add new status effects, and improve stats. Create powerful builds and combos with smart use of status interactions. Explosions that trigger explosions, stunning lightning chains and massive damage over time effects are waiting to be built. The most powerful effects may come with large drawbacks, but hard choices can lead to great payoffs.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2942160/extras/SteamGifUpgrades.gif?t=1717770545\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Interactive Environments</h2><br>Use your sentries to charge devastating explosive devices, power up amplifying antennas using generators, move map tiles, and much more. Use the environment to your advantage and defeat enemies in creative ways. Different enemies will require different counters, and mastering the environment is key to defeating challenging bosses.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2942160/extras/SteamGifNodes.gif?t=1717770545\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Diverse Enemies</h2><br>Encounter a wide variety of enemies with powerful abilities. Enemies may shield others, accelerate, teleport, explode when defeated, and much more. Different sentries and status effects counter different enemies, so choose your weapons carefully.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dynamic Bosses</h2><br>Face off against challenging bosses in large encounters that test your skill with sentries as well as environmental mechanics. Every boss is an intricate puzzle where skill and strategy will be rewarded.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Roguelike Progression</h2><br>Advance through a randomized network. Take routes that lead to items you need, trade some of your resources for others, and make the best of randomized choices. Resource management between battles is critical to success, as is building a varied roster of sentries that can tackle any challenges you face.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Classic Tower Defense Gameplay</h2><br>Use your sentries to build mazes and control the routes your enemies take. Lead them down winding paths, past explosive devices, and into deadly choke points. Set up perfect positions for your sentries to maximize their damage.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2942160/extras/SteamGifPaths.gif?t=1717770545\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Yes I'm On Fire","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2942160/23aa81688ea8a1e75dac8ded04b5a2532ceba340.jpg"},{"name":"Assault On The Mainframe","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2942160/10408dc2c5d8545b047bf1e1c531827262f284b2.jpg"},{"name":"Starlight","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2942160/cd99bca25d41c2cfc60df3c3d385fd82315d46d9.jpg"},{"name":"Sequence Is Pattern","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2942160/4f00ed6211b5468ccf9a5cdb409d26b6d68e8dda.jpg"},{"name":"Simulation Theory","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2942160/0c5f9cf2647f7f2d594279727f6f9886e23a9b3e.jpg"},{"name":"Boss Rush","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2942160/b3b337064586e5a256925f68ffab323a457fd304.jpg"},{"name":"Flawless","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2942160/11c73e205a0a57b8912b39d7eedc588c06d4d709.jpg"},{"name":"Experimental Configuration","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2942160/0c62ef4e55bd413ef45e516dcddaa603119af154.jpg"},{"name":"Vorpal Code","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2942160/9bdc8d17951c65904b6c234b16c00cba32a234e0.jpg"},{"name":"Condition Overload","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2942160/264fe2dc04672999b10c0a3772d96d12d8612fa4.jpg"}],"total":13},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2942160/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1717770545","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2942160/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1717770545","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2942160/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1717770545","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2942160/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1717770545","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Sentry System combines modern roguelike systems with classic tower defense gameplay.
