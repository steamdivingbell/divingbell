{"about_the_game":"Showcase an array of outstanding new prehistoric species with the Jurassic World Evolution 2: Camp Cretaceous Dinosaur Pack. Inspired by Universal Pictures, Amblin Entertainment and DreamWorks Animation\u2019s hit Netflix show, Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous, this DLC features two entirely new dinosaurs, two new variants for existing species, and eight eye-catching skins that players can use to bring their parks to life.<br>\ufeff<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SCORPIOS REX</h2>One of Dr. Henry Wu\u2019s first hybrid creations, the Scorpios Rex is a truly fearsome carnivore. Blood-red eyes, charcoal-black scales, prominent spikes, and jagged, uneven teeth characterise this impressive species. Known for its aggressive nature, it was originally deemed unfit for display\u2026until now.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MONOLOPHOSAURUS\u00a0\u00a0</h2>Named for the single crest adorning its skull, the Monolophosaurus is a medium-sized carnivore from the mid-Jurassic period. Its distinguished crest helps intensify roars and aids communication between Monolophosauruses.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">OURANOSAURUS\u00a0 (Variant)</h2>The Ouranosaurus is a peaceful herbivore that lives in large herds. Keeping a single Ouranosaurus is not advised, as lone individuals have been known to break out of their enclosures and panic guests. The Ouranosaurus has a broad snout and tall spines on its back supporting a camel-like hump.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">KENTROSAURUS\u00a0 (Variant)</h2>Despite being covered in lethal-looking spikes, the Kentrosaurus is actually a docile herbivore that uses its beak to bite off plant material. One of the smallest species of stegosaur, the Kentrosaurus defends itself when threatened using long spikes on each shoulder and smaller spikes protruding from its hips and tail.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">8 NEW DINOSAUR SKINS</h2>Bring the Baryonyx trio Grim, Limbo and Chaos, plus Toro the Carnotaurus, Bumpy the Ankylosaurus, and Big Eatie the Tyrannosaurus Rex to life in your parks, and entrance your guests with two glow-in-the-dark skins inspired by the Parasaurolophus Lux.<br><br>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1 Ankylosaurus skin - Bumpy <br>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3 Baryonyx skins - Grim, Limbo, Chaos<br>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1 Carnotaurus skin - Toro<br>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2 Parasaurolophus Lux skins - Lux 1 (glow in the dark), Lux 2 (glow in the dark)\u00a0<br>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1 Tyrannosaurus rex skin - Big Eatie\u00a0","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1882470/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1646748017","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1882470/page.bg.jpg?t=1646748017","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1882470/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1646748017","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1882470/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1646748017","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Showcase an array of outstanding new prehistoric species with the Jurassic World Evolution 2: Camp Cretaceous Dinosaur Pack.
