{"about_the_game":"Ten-hut! It\u2019s time to add voices to more of the men in your games with NPC Male Soldiers Vol.1! TK.Projects\u2019 latest voice pack offers you another 120 SEs to help your NPCs find a voice of their own. Give your guardsmen cheerful greetings to the people passing through city gates, let noble knights offer thoughtful advice when your heroes need it, and have the kingdom\u2019s gruff general let out a deep belly laugh when an overconfident soldier challenges him to a fight for command!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach character voice comes with 10 SEs covering a variety of uses, including greetings, angry shouts, concerned sighs, and screams of terror. Let the hellos and hums add some much-needed sounds to long conversations, punctuated with loud laughter or angered grunts when the speaker feels like your hero\u2019s attention has started to wander. Or use the voice clips as audio clues for your players to realize certain NPCs have sidequests to offer. Worried sighs from middle-aged soldiers at the bar could lead your heroes on an adventure to reclaim a prized helmet, and an excited \u201cwow\u201d from a nervous new recruit reading a book in the barracks could start a quest to turn those young men from zeroes to heroes!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMultiple file formats make it easy to add these voices in your favorite engines and use them right away.
