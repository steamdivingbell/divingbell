It's not just about survival; it's about the immersive experience. The graphics are crafted with meticulous attention to detail, ensuring that every shadow, texture, and element feels utterly realistic. As you explore, you'll notice subtle details intricately woven into the environment. Putting your ear up to a pipe reveals the faint sound of water flowing within, adding to the eerie atmosphere. Objects like mirrors, tables, pipes, mannequins, and much more populate the maze, infusing every corner with a sense of life and potential danger. In Redlight, <u>every sound</u>, <u>every shadow</u>, and <u>every object</u> contributes to the immersive horror experience, ensuring that every moment is filled with suspense and dread.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2748490/extras/YourEscape.gif?t=1719595807\" /><br>Your objective is clear: activate all the generators scattered throughout the maze before the creature hunts you down. But in the darkness, every step could be your last, and every decision could seal your fate.  Adding to the tension is the &quot;Redlight&quot; mechanic, a harrowing twist that puts players into a panic at unpredictable intervals. When the lights turn on and shift to a blood-curdling red, players must scramble to find the nearest hiding spot, lest they become easy prey for the now aggravated monster. As the darkness closes in, the true terror of Redlight is revealed, testing your nerves and forcing you to confront the unknown in a battle for survival like no other.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2748490/extras/Isolation.gif?t=1719595807\" /><br>Even amidst the company of friends, Redlight maintains a haunting sense of isolation that intensifies the horror experience. From the outset, players find themselves scattered across the maze, each starting in a different corner, alone and vulnerable. With <i>in-game proximity chat</i>, players have to locate each other to communicate. Even when players group up, the \u201cRedlight\u201d mechanic means players must scramble for the nearest locker to hide. These lockers, strategically spaced throughout the maze, force players to split up in their frantic search for safety. Alone in the suffocating darkness, the sense of isolation is palpable, heightening the tension and instilling a profound sense of dread.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2748490/extras/BarNotTexturedSmall.png?t=1719595807\" /><br><i>\u201cIn every detail of Redlight, I've strived to capture the essence of realism, immersing players in an environment where every sound, and every action matters. I had to imagine myself in the maze, attuned to every small pin drop of noise, feeling the palpable tension in the air. That's the level of immersion I aimed for in the game. From the subtle echoes of footsteps and water drops, to the distant hum of machinery, every sound is meticulously crafted to transport players into the heart of the horror. In Redlight, it's not just about survival\u2014it's about experiencing fear in its most visceral form, where even the slightest action has an impact and could spell doom.\u201d</i> <br>- Luke (Developer)","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Play Your First Match","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2748490/85325f9c59a5802ea008379473ba1273722a91e0.jpg"},{"name":"Complete Your First Match","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2748490/373852f801a0d85f281f7d3aac8d005caf578abb.jpg"},{"name":"Death Is Only The Beginning","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2748490/68ac4c0572b9ecbbbfff69a535419df7506f6a2e.jpg"},{"name":"Beginner Electrician","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2748490/075ad4bc768fedaf520548ad8b5261d470b90b13.jpg"},{"name":"Was That The Maze Of '87?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2748490/83a35932b2049f3a61d7d5edf6075fbfcb95bbe1.jpg"},{"name":"Nuh Uh!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2748490/4b8a204fd56e9bd4ddda584f4239fa59de12db3a.jpg"},{"name":"I'm Getting Good At This!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2748490/68f2e822009b88bd66613a51eb65c06d2794794d.jpg"},{"name":"Ouch...","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2748490/f32c309656a4a1966c8354f2bc3ec35708221f2b.jpg"},{"name":"Back Again...","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2748490/a1c633f31fce5199d5c21f11a36e51641aa5cc87.jpg"},{"name":"Apprentice Electrician","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2748490/4a1429fd4c39c87091b5d048babfa7b7b5e6fb0b.jpg"}],"total":19},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2748490/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1719595807","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2748490/page.bg.jpg?t=1719595807","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2748490/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1719595807","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2748490/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1719595807","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Gross non-human monster, humans being trapped in a \"calcified\" state when the monster catches them, suggestion of limb dismemberment."},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2748490/extras/LogoWithBarNotTexturedSmall.png?t=1719595807\" /><br><i>Redlight</i> is a chilling multiplayer first-person horror experience.
