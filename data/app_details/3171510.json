At Camp Guidance, you will take on the role of a socially anxious outcast and stumble upon an ancient computer that foretells a greater purpose for you. The story explores themes of being lost, late-night talks around a campfire, and the strange comfort of discovering who you really are.<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3171510/extras/kids.gif?t=1737716592\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your new friends are weird\u2014but in a cool way. They\u2019re all battling inner demons, whether real or imagined, while figuring out what brought them to this point in their lives. They\u2019re not all doom and gloom, though; they\u2019re also funny, lovable, and kind when they want to be.
