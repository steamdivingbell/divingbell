{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Ever wanted to listen to your music to graphics that move to the beat of it? This is not a game. It's a relaxing experience where you can place your own music in the application folder at\u00a0\\Gliss\\Windows\\Gliss\\Saved\\Music and listen to your music play in real time synced with VFX. You can type in the numbers 1 through 9 to dance, spacebar to jump, W to pause a song and E to go to the next song. The gameplay is up to you depending on what music you play and what dances you choose!
