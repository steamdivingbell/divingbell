Blasting cells causes others to wilt away if you're lucky, but can also cause massive explosions of new cells! Feel the upbeat rhythm energize you as you connect the shapes to unlock cross-shots, tri-shots and T-shots at enemies! Beware of new cell formations as the colors get hotter and the music gets more intense! Race to the top of the leaderboard and beat developer high scores. Challenge your friends!
