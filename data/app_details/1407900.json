{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Pathfinder 2 RPG - Pathfinder Society Scenario #2-01: Citadel of Corruption</h2>A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 1-4.<br>A new year dawns for the Pathfinder Society. For the past several years, Pathfinders have explored the edges of the Iobarian wilderness, making new allies and discovering hints at a long-forgotten past. Now, the Decemvirate has decided that it is time for the Pathfinders to do what Pathfinders do best: explore, report, and cooperate! In an ancient cyclopean ruin, the Society seeks to stake their claim with both a new lodge and, hopefully, new insights into Iobaria's remote history. Some secrets are best left buried, however. Will the PCs make a name for themselves as modern day explorers, or will the evil lurking at the heart of the Iobarian dig site consume their hopes and dreams?<br><i>Written</i> <strong> by Scott D.
