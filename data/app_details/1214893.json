{"about_the_game":"Eat as much cocaine as you can before the police arrive to minimize your losses, then high-tail it until you can lose the cops.

Nobody is going to bust a drug lord on the moon, since the moon is probably already made of cocaine. There\u2019s no way to stop you, since that is where all the cocaine gets sent when they take it anyway!<br><br><strong>If you find that the other dealers in town are a little too rational, you can utilize IRC technology in order to tap in to a vast network of drug dealers that have far less rationality at their disposal in their pursuits.</strong>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1214893/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1601646789","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1214893/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1601646789","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1214893/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1601646789","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1214893/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1601646789","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"ostriches doing enough cocaine to outrun the police and achieve space flight to wind up on the moon"},"detailed_description":"Eat as much cocaine as you can before the police arrive to minimize your losses, then high-tail it until you can lose the cops.
