{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><i><strong>The Shadows Within: Nightmare's Game \u2013 Demo invites you to the heart of fear. Are you ready?</strong></i></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There are whispers in the shadows of the town. Something is watching you at every corner, with every step. The streets of Ebonvale may be quiet, but that silence is deceiving. It\u2019s the calm before the storm... <strong><i>The Shadows Within: Nightmare's Game \u2013 Demo</i></strong> will take you not only on a survival adventure but to the darkest depths of terror. Can your heart endure? Are you ready to face true fear?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong><i>A Town, A Curse, A Story...</i></strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Ebonvale was once a peaceful place, but now it's turned into a town where nightmares come true. Wandering the streets are deranged creatures, and lurking in the depths are even more terrifying things. This demo opens the darkest corners of Ebonvale for you. Although it's just a taste, it will be enough to introduce you to the real face of horror. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>What Awaits You in This Demo?</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You will step into the darkness with three different modes, each allowing you to experience the horror of Ebonvale from a different perspective. But there's one thing common in all modes: the silence that draws you in and the feeling that danger could strike at any moment\u2026</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><br>Story Mode: Pursuing Fear with Elena Hartfield</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Ebonvale's dark secrets are entwined with Elena Hartfield's destiny. In this mode, you will discover the events leading up to the full game and witness Elena\u2019s fight against the town\u2019s curse. The shadows of the town follow you with every step. Crumbling buildings, empty streets, a sense of nothingness... But even in this emptiness, something is there\u2014close enough to touch. By gathering clues about Ebonvale's past, you will journey toward the heart of darkness.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Every door, every discovery brings more questions. In Elena's fight for survival, it\u2019s not just your courage but also your mind that will keep you alive. You will need to solve puzzles, but where will these secrets lead you? Every clue you uncover will reveal a darker truth. And remember: once some doors are opened, they cannot be closed again.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><br>Visual Mode: Discover the Details of Fear</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In this mode, leave the action behind and focus on the visual details of Ebonvale. As a journalist, you roam the decaying surface of the town. The terrifying atmosphere of the town\u2014rotting houses, abandoned shops, a supernatural gloom\u2014unfolds with every step. This mode lets you fully experience the technological and visual power of the game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">But don\u2019t let the visual beauty deceive you. The quietest moments of fear are often when it\u2019s closest. You will feel the presence of something watching you around every corner. Visual Mode is not just a feast for the eyes; it\u2019s also a nerve-wracking, unsettling experience. Do you dare to explore the aesthetics of fear?</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><br>Alliance of the Brave (Co-Op Mode): Unite to Survive</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Entering this town alone takes courage, but sharing the fear is no easy task. In Alliance of the Brave mode, you and up to four players will take on the role of soldiers trying to stop this disaster. You will join forces with your friends and fight your way to the heart of the darkness. But beware: this town is difficult to overcome, even with a team.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Develop strategies with your teammates, defeat enemies, and survive the dangerous streets. Each stage will take you deeper into the town, and every step will bring more danger. In this mode, you\u2019ll have to face not only fear but also the mistakes of your teammates. Being a good team is essential to survival, but can they all keep up with you?</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><br>What to Expect in This Demo</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This demo may only be a small part of the full game, but it will make you feel the horror the town has to offer. You will delve into the story, uncover the town\u2019s secrets, and try to find your way in the darkness. Horror is not just about the monsters you face; it\u2019s also the tension that comes from confronting the unknown.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Are you strong enough to protect yourself? More importantly, are you brave enough to keep your sanity? This demo is a short journey into the nightmare of Ebonvale, but remember: fear never ends so quickly.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><br>Dare to Step In</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The darkness awaits you. Every decision you make, every move you take will make a difference in this world. Think carefully and feel deeply\u2014because one wrong step could cost you dearly. Discover Elena's fears in story mode, explore the terrifying beauty of the town in visual mode, or fight for survival with friends in co-op mode. But whatever you do, don\u2019t let fear consume you. The secrets of Ebonvale are waiting.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i><strong>Are you ready to face the darkness? Then, begin.
