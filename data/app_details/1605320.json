Inspired by classics as Explorers or The Goonies, it delivers a great story with lovable characters full of satisfying puzzles. A modern cult classic of the genre, an unforgettable adventure that can be considered the best point and click game of the year, even above Return To Monkey Island.\u201d<br>90/100 \u2013 Meristation<br><br>\u201cUnusual Findings is a charming and often hilarious sci-fi tale set during the 80s which oozes with a great retro-graphical style, good voice acting, and a fun story about teenage boys being, well, teenage boys - while also attempting to thwart an alien war. The point-and-click genre has seen a resurgence in recent years and Unusual Findings is certainly a worthwhile successor to the games it pays homage to.\u201d<br>90/100 \u2013 Gaming
