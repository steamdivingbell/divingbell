{"about_the_game":"Own the THRONE is an open world, action-adventure RPG that starts in the everyday normal life of a busy city called La Cruz Central. You are either an Elite Martial Artist with Spiritual skills that set you apart from all other humans or, you are of the Advanced Cyborg Human Hybrids. It all takes place in a near future where we finally accept Artificial Intelligence as a natural part of our every day life when one day the unexpected happens. The Artificial Intelligence decides that they have not processed us yet. Or in A.I. &quot;technical terms&quot; they do not accept humans as part of their normal every day life.<br />\r\n      During your final training if  you chose the Martial Artist life, you earned a sword that must be kept safe for the next generation of your kind. It came with Super Human Power but it also comes with the Curses of the &quot;Demonic Cyborg Souls World&quot;. Or in technical terms as the A.I. would suggest, it's all of the humans that did not give their consent to be recreated as a Cyborg. So every time you need rest or even just take a nap, you risk the event of waking up in the &quot;Swords Owning Nightmare&quot;, a series of quests that await in both worlds. You can use the nightmare to level up your Powers even further by combating hundreds of dozens of demons that lurk inside the nightmare. The downfall is that every now and then you encounter your own Demon, made by you and it will eventually possess you for a certain period of time. Your Demonic self also has Super Abilities which will take you further down the rabbit hole but eventually your demon wants to be the King of the Nightmare World and Own the THRONE that controls the entire system. Not an easy task but as a Super Demon with your Elite Martial Arts training you can conquer your Demon and travel back to the regular city life and become human once again. Once returned to the city you keep whatever power you gained in the Nightmare and can start the new city life of the game.<br />\r\n     The city life continues the second part of the journey. It revolves around currency and Street Racing Trends. You can earn money by pawning off the artifacts you bring from the Nightmares, sell the artifacts for a small fortune at the Museum, or just keep them and strategically use them in the City to gain more power.  Once your days work is finished you have the choice of taking a &quot;Reprogrammable Wake Pill&quot; to stay awake for another day, or you can risk falling asleep and waking up in a whole new Nightmare.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2266050/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735309027","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2266050/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1735309027","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2266050/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735309027","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2266050/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735309027","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Own the THRONE is an open world, action-adventure RPG that starts in the everyday normal life of a busy city called La Cruz Central.
