{"about_the_game":"The P-51D Mustang is world-renowned as quite possibly the most iconic fighter aircraft of all time! Its unique design resulted in it delivering some of the best performance among all fighter aircraft flown in WWII. \u201cDetroit Miss\u201d is a history-making P-51D Mustang that was flown by Urban \u201cBen\u201d Drew, and in 1944 he became the first USAAF pilot to shoot down two jet-powered Messerschmitt Me 262 fighter aircraft with it. The E-flite UMX P-51D Mustang is an ultra-micro sized model of the famous aircraft that\u2019s a warbird version of the popular UMX P-51D Voodoo racer. It\u2019s equipped with expertly-tuned AS3X and optional-use SAFE Select technologies and is 2S and 3S battery compatible. Because of its ultra-micro size, the UMX P-51 can be flown in more places and smaller spaces including many yards, parks, and sports fields! The fixed landing gear with a steerable tailwheel makes it easy to taxi, takeoff from, and land on smooth surfaces, or you can leave the landing gear off for more speed and vertical performance with easy hand launches over and landings on grass. It\u2019s the most affordable, convenient, and easiest-to-fly replica of a P-51D Mustang yet!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759410/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724890681","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759410/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1724890681","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759410/4712812aef2cde300a17d425777ce6c2ef52e9e2/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724890681","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759410/4712812aef2cde300a17d425777ce6c2ef52e9e2/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724890681","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The P-51D Mustang is world-renowned as quite possibly the most iconic fighter aircraft of all time!
