{"about_the_game":"Welcome to Dusty Springs, a small country town in Australia with a vibrant bogan community. The quiet life of this humble town is thrown into chaos when a nearby opal mine unearths mysterious opals that release spirits, causing strange mutations and anomalies across the land.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA large corporation known as Drill and Thrill seizes the opportunity to exploit the valuable opals, taking over the mine and rapidly expanding their operations. However, as the anomalies worsen, the company shifts the blame onto the bogans of Dusty Springs, inciting fear and suspicion. The town is unjustly placed under strict lockdown, trapping its residents and cutting off their supplies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur unlikely hero, Davo, is a quintessential bogan who loves nothing more than enjoying a cold beer at his local pub. With the lockdown in place, his beloved pub is forced to close, depriving Davo and his mates of their cherished pastime.
