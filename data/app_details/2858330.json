In the opening video, there is a brief shot of a non-detailed, severed heart being thrown through the air. In this story, it is mentioned that a character attempted suicide in the past. (Nothing is visually shown.) In this story, a character hates herself and asks the protagonist to strangle her, which he refuses to do. In this story, a character struggles with the trauma caused by her abusive parent, who tested drugs on her. (The drugs are fantasy drugs, which don't exist in real life.) The actual abuse is not depicted. However, her struggle with this trauma is a focus of the story. In this fantasy story, the ages of two, non-human characters are ambiguous. (Each was 'born' when split from the soul of another person.) Technically, each of these characters were only 'born' quite recently. However, they aren't intended to be minors, and are fully mature individuals. In this story, it is heavily implied that one of the characters takes time to masturbate."},"detailed_description":"","developers":["Overlooked Option Visual Novels"],"fullgame":{"appid":"2858220","name":"The Silent Column"},"header_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2858330/header.jpg?t=1711498266","is_free":true,"linux_requirements":[],"mac_requirements":[],"name":"The Silent Column Demo","package_groups":[],"pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS *:</strong> Windows 7 or higher<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> 1920 x 1080</li></ul>"},"platforms":{"linux":false,"mac":false,"windows":true},"publishers":["Overlooked Option Visual Novels"],"ratings":{"dejus":{"banned":"0","descriptors":"Viol\u00eancia\nTemas sens\u00edveis\nDrogas il\u00edcitas","rating":"16","rating_generated":"1","required_age":"16","use_age_gate":"0"},"steam_germany":{"banned":"0","descriptors":"Sexuelle Inhalte","rating":"16","rating_generated":"1","required_age":"16","use_age_gate":"0"}},"release_date":{"coming_soon":false,"date":"26 Mar, 2024"},"required_age":0,"short_description":"","steam_appid":2858330,"support_info":{"email":"","url":"https://overlooked-option-vns.itch.io/"},"supported_languages":"English","type":"demo","website":null}
