Aiden is living his life unaware of the reincarnating Tuyuk within him. As Tuyuk reincarnates, it unleashes a burst of power that can only be sensed by those who wield their strength. Aware of this power, the King arrives in Aiden\u2019s village within a day. The King, seeking to harness the power within Aiden, sends him on a dangerous journey. Eager to become an adventurer and hero, Aiden excitedly accepts the King's quest. In this adventure, the player, along with Aiden, will uncover the mysteries of the world, the Tuyuks, and secrets of the Kingdom, setting out on a path that will shape the future of the world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3273380/extras/2a79edc5c755700f96e5ef0a3cbd4fad_original-ezgif.com-webp-to-gif-converter.gif?t=1729250638\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>We can talk to the townspeople</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3273380/extras/gameplay_ui.png?t=1729250638\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\ud83d\udcac <strong>Interact </strong>and <strong>Talk </strong>with the People around the <strong>world\u00a0</strong></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\ud83e\udded <strong>Explore </strong>a colorful and <strong>magical </strong>world and discover the <strong>secrets </strong>of the Kingdom</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u2694\ufe0f <strong>Fight </strong>against the <strong>Demon </strong>living Alongside you</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3273380/extras/07857877f80ea4dadb23400e1667e592_original.gif?t=1729250638\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Showcasing our two fighting mechanics</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Tuyuk Mode:</strong> Tuyuk is an ancient creature that has undergone reincarnation within our character. In short, he is a reflection of an ancient species in modern times (Shadow of Ancients). Throughout the game, he will literally be &quot;the voice inside our heads,&quot; He'll talk and help us to uncover the mysteries of the world. There is a mode in the game called &quot;Demon Mode.&quot; This is a mechanic with a bar that fills up based on the player's reactions to the actions and dialogues of the encountered characters. When this bar is full, our character enters Demon Mode. When this mode is activated, our character loses control and is seized by Tuyuk. Control of the main character is taken from the player, and control of opposing characters is given to the player. The player is expected to defeat and calm the character who has lost control at this stage. Otherwise, the character under Tuyuk's control will destroy enemies, and events contrary to our character's personality will occur. Whenever this occurs, in-game dialogues, monologues, and even the game's atmosphere change.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3273380/extras/e97a03728844457f285ad93ec8d210c5_original.gif?t=1729250638\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Aiden transforms into Tuyuk Mode</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3273380/extras/characters_ui.png?t=1729250638\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3273380/extras/7652062f6e5a581d1ac29ba5f5cc430c_original.gif?t=1729250638\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Aiden, our main character</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3273380/extras/Character.png?t=1729250638\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>There's plenty of characters we are going to know and interact with as Aiden</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3273380/extras/MAP_ui.png?t=1729250638\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3273380/extras/Town_MAP1.png?t=1729250638\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Map of our first Town and nearby area</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3273380/extras/6.png?t=1729250638\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3273380/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729250638","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3273380/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1729250638","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3273380/372ba3c724bec56850235d4c01e2789a228baa1a/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729250638","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3273380/372ba3c724bec56850235d4c01e2789a228baa1a/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729250638","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"The world of Shadow of Ancients offers a world of bloody warfare, albeit a little"},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3273380/extras/SoA_Banner.png?t=1729250638\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Get ready for an incredible fantasy adventure where you'll uncover the mysteries and long-hidden secrets of the world alongside Aiden</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3273380/extras/aff48cd60ebd4f10c0b348e6fe264789_original.gif?t=1729250638\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3273380/extras/game_ui.png?t=1729250638\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Shadow of Ancients is a 3D Semi-Open World, narrative adventure game with a stylized and colorful atmosphere.
