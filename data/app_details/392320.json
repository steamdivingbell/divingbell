{"about_the_game":"<strong>A tough-as-nails cave-flyer for players who want a solid challenge. Stay on your toes or this galaxy will devour you.</strong><br><br>Retrobooster is an exceptionally difficult 2.5D shooter, focused on skill-based flying and enemy blasting. Pilot your nimble thrust ship through bizarre worlds littered with vicious enemies. Each new level takes you farther from home and, ultimately, into the deadliest reaches of the galaxy. Retrobooster also has speed-flying challenges, puzzles, juicy monsters, a warped sense of humor, and a healthy dose of bullet hell action. Survive to the end if you can, and use your new flying skills to replay for high scores.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Master classic thrust ship controls, plus reverse thrust<br></li><li>Enjoy detailed physics (with plenty of death by crushing)<br></li><li>30+ levels in the full game<br></li><li>Unlocked levels can be replayed any time<br></li><li>10 weapons in the full game<br></li><li>Challenge yourself with 4 difficulty levels<br></li><li>Customizable controls, because Retrobooster is all about daring flying and unbridled shooting<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Keyboard<br></li><li>Mouse and keyboard<br></li><li>Game controller (Some popular controllers are recognized automatically)</li></ul></li><li>Split-screen multiplayer for up to 4 players (no online multiplayer)<br></li><li>Cooperative and deathmatch multiplayer modes<br></li><li>Electronic soundtrack by Subatomicglue frontman, Kevin Meinert</li></ul>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/392320?t=1447377410","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/392320?t=1447377410","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/392320/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1447377410","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/392320/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1447377410","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>A tough-as-nails cave-flyer for players who want a solid challenge.
