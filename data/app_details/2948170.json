{"about_the_game":"<strong>Taxing puzzles meet challenging platforming!</strong><br><br>In Blockhead, you take control of various blocks and move them around to solve puzzles. Many blocks can move left, move right and jump, but others have different restrictions and mechanics that you'll need to deal with. You'll need a combination of brains and skill to beat all 50 levels!<br><br><br><strong>Solve puzzles!</strong><br><br>The goal of each level is to transport certain blocks to their targets, elsewhere in the level. That won't be easy - you'll have to move other blocks out of the way, use them as stepping stones, or maybe create even more complex structures that you can use to reach your goal. Different blocks have different physics and controls that you can use to your advantage!<br><br><br><strong>Tricky platforming!</strong><br><br>In several levels, figuring out the solution is only half the challenge - you'll still need to pull it off! You'll often need to make some long and carefully-timed jumps, so make sure you don't fall and lose your progress. And keep an eye on the timer - if it runs out, the level will reset!<br><br><br><strong>Make your own!</strong><br><br>The built-in level editor allows you to create up to 5 levels of your own to challenge your friends! Levels are stored as simple, lightweight files that can be easily shared. See what devious challenges you can come up with!<br><br><br><strong>Completely free!</strong><br><br>Blockhead was originally made as a college project back in 2009-2010. This is a remastered version with improved graphics, better controls, and even music from other school and college projects! Of course we're not going to charge money for that - it's yours to enjoy for free!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Block by Block","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2948170/b6a1af6382b5680de979fe3622ac9573b90964a4.jpg"},{"name":"Mental Block","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2948170/1131fccd803799b2fab93f6e6741b16f1835ed21.jpg"},{"name":"Official Blockhead","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2948170/039a0fdda6166025d4fd2026c462cb6fda099af9.jpg"},{"name":"Blocky V","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2948170/8cd5a9d67ec7c6ce2fe581abcec34302b4470b32.jpg"},{"name":"Antiblockwise","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2948170/32967dabe814228c3bf581bd1ba26f08be0783ee.jpg"},{"name":"Block 'n' Roll","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2948170/cac94d675861fb68d598e07141141a460cce3daf.jpg"},{"name":"It's a Hard Block Life","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2948170/5fa2ba0ac7a75364eb092d9e4777435d23c1ad49.jpg"},{"name":"Chip Off the Old Block","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2948170/9ac9a365912608acad2617ae9ae2fb78a42a1d83.jpg"}],"total":8},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2948170/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725382814","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2948170/page.bg.jpg?t=1725382814","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2948170/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725382814","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2948170/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725382814","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>Taxing puzzles meet challenging platforming!</strong><br><br>In Blockhead, you take control of various blocks and move them around to solve puzzles.
