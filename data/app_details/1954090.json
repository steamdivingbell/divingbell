{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mini-Dungeons Bundle #186-190</h2> Mini-Dungeons are short, setting-agnostic adventures for 5th Edition which can be easily inserted anywhere in your campaign.<br> This bundle contains five such adventures for use with Fantasy Grounds Classic or Fantasy Grounds Unity (line of sight included).<br> <strong>MINI-DUNGEON #186: A NARROWS ESCAPE</strong> <br> <strong> <i>4-5 characters of levels 6-7</i> </strong> <br> The characters are consulting with a scholar at the Great Librarium when an alarm is raised. Someone has broken into the restricted section and stolen The Chained Tome, a book of fiendish lore. Witnesses saw a cloaked figure fleeing the library and heading toward the Narrows, a series of subterranean canals.<br> The characters are asked to follow the thief, in the hopes of catching the criminal before they disappear completely.<br> <strong>MINI-DUNGEON #187: TEMPLE OF REFLECTION</strong> <br> <strong> <i>4 characters of level 12</i> </strong> <br> The magical security expert Ytrellia De'bouchar had the reputation of a mad genius, so nobody was particularly surprised when she succumbed to the occupational hazard of paranoia and vanished.<br> Known for her overly complicated but efficient security systems, her erstwhile patrons want to find her and help her recover. One of her last completed vaults, referenced as the &quot;Temple of Reflection&quot; in her sparse remaining design documents, might hold a clue to her whereabouts.<br> The party must figure out how the notoriously-lethal complex works and document it--every mechanism might be a concealed hint!<br> <strong>MINI-DUNGEON #188: CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES</strong> <br> <strong> <i>4-6 characters of levels 2-3</i> </strong> <br> For decades the Klesdeep swampfolk have been at war with the kingdoms, with both sides' misunderstandings and atrocities either exaggerated or dismissed. Now, after decades of strife, most differences have been put aside and accords of nonaggression and cooperation between the swampfolk and the borderland estates abound--except for one holdout; the mysterious renegade Quai.<br> An enigmatic figure rife with contradiction, Quai is short in some tales, in others unusually tall. Some claim she is a young woman, while others speak of a handsome boy. Some even claim that Quai is no mortal, but a kind of quasi-god, a divine coalescence of the spirits of the swamps reborn through many incarnations to protect Klesdeep. Quai adamantly refuses to lay down their arms.<br> The hard-won peace is in jeopardy! Can the adventurers finalize a Cessation of Hostilities, or will their interference see the flames of conflict stoked anew?<br> <strong>MINI-DUNGEON #189: COFFIN BALL</strong> <br> <strong> <i>4-5 Character Levels 14-15</i> </strong> <br> The game is eternal. The stakes are your immortal souls.<br> An archaeological expedition attempted to excavate a recently discovered tomb, only for one mercenary escort to emerge alive, screaming of powerful undead waiting within. The party, as adventurers of great renown, have been paid a considerable fee to explore this tomb, as it could be symptomatic of a mighty force of undeath lurking below.<br> Little do the adventurers know that sports-obsessed Pharaoh Akhmenij is about to play the most lethal game of them all with the adventurers as participants: Coffin Ball! Will the adventurers manage to best the undefeated, undead champion of the coffin, or will they join his legion of undead reserve players for an eternity on the bank?<br> <strong>MINI-DUNGEON #190: THE SAD TALE OF HEIDI AND HER TWO DAUGHTERS</strong> <br> <strong> <i>4-6 Character Levels 13-15</i> </strong> <br> Not all gods serve a grand purpose. Some tend to the worldlier, more common tasks; this is the divine life Gr?nwald has chosen. Worshipped amongst many worlds he was assisted by six witches who saw to these everyday miracles. As of late, prayers had become less common and his flock dwindled to two, Heidi and Lotte.<br> Heide recently assisted a village and brought many prayers to Gr?nwald, enough for her deity to bless her with offspring, the spark of life growing within her. Soon, two daughters were born: Iris and Viola. Lotte, Heidi's elder sister, became jealous and disillusioned. Swearing fealty to a rival god, she was granted a curse to bind her family to her will.<br> Heidi was imprisoned in a hideous iron statue, alive and unable to escape as long as a fire, fueled by the bones of the freshly killed, burns and Lotte is alive. Heidi's two daughters were transformed into pishacha demons, trapped in beautiful tiger-like forms bound to hunt for these bones and protect their vile aunt. Their once beautiful plane-traveling tower has become a curse to any place it appears in.<br> <i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by:</i> <strong>Ryan Yingling</strong>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1954090/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1670941732","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1954090/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1670941732","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1954090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1670941732","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1954090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1670941732","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mini-Dungeons Bundle #186-190</h2> Mini-Dungeons are short, setting-agnostic adventures for 5th Edition which can be easily inserted anywhere in your campaign.<br> This bundle contains five such adventures for use with Fantasy Grounds Classic or Fantasy Grounds Unity (line of sight included).<br> <strong>MINI-DUNGEON #186: A NARROWS ESCAPE</strong> <br> <strong> <i>4-5 characters of levels 6-7</i> </strong> <br> The characters are consulting with a scholar at the Great Librarium when an alarm is raised.
