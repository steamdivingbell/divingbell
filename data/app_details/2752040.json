{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Stay on Top of Your Game with Smart Controller Monitoring </h2><br>As a gamer, there's nothing worse than your controller dying at a critical moment. PlayStatus is here to ensure that never happens. Whether you're using a Dual Sense, Xbox or Nintendo Switch Pro controller, PlayStatus diligently tracks your controller's battery life, delivering real-time updates on battery changes. It alerts you when your controller starts charging or discharging, allowing you to stay immersed in your game without any unpleasant surprises. Not only that, but when you are playing with others, PlayStatus will also keep track of those controllers as well (given they're supported)!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Important Information for Best Experience </h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Initial Setup Required: Some features need setup for full functionality. All instructions are in-app. A restart is necessary during setup if you want controller emulation; otherwise, you can skip this. </li><li> Compatibility Notice: PlayStatus does **<strong><u>NOT</u></strong> work on Steam Deck or any Linux distribution using Proton. </li><li> Unsupported Hardware: Xbox Wireless Adapter and other USB controller adapters are not supported. Connect controllers via Windows Bluetooth settings. </li><li> Windowed Borderless Mode Required: PlayStatus works only in windowed borderless mode, not in exclusive fullscreen. </li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2752040/extras/controller.gif?t=1727061533\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Enhance Your Gaming Sessions with Seamless Music Integration </h2><br>Music is the heartbeat of a great gaming session. PlayStatus seamlessly integrates with your favorite media players like Spotify, YouTube, and Foobar2000. It displays notifications of the current track, complete with artist details, song name, and album art. Whether you\u2019re skipping tracks, hitting pause, or playing your favorite tunes, PlayStatus keeps you informed without interrupting your gameplay.<br><br>Not only that, but PlayStatus features a built-in media player that can provide real-time audio visualizations and low latency audio playback! You can look forward to playing flac, ogg, m4a, mp3, or wav files with custom EQ profiles which can allow for the perfect sound for your specific audio setup.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2752040/extras/music.gif?t=1727061533\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Xbox 360 &amp; DualShock 4 Controller Emulation </h2><br>PlayStatus also offers a fully functional controller emulation system, including controller mappings and full rumble support*!<br><br>This means, if a game only supports DualShock 4 controllers, but you have an Xbox controller, PlayStatus will emulate a DualShock 4 controller for you, so you can continue to game on, no matter what controllers it supports.<br><br>PlayStatus will also optionally auto detect when games have launched, and can apply certain game mappings based on the game.<br><br>*(only for Xbox 360 controller emulation).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Why PlayStatus is a Game-Changer for You </h2><br>Designed with gamers in mind, PlayStatus solves a common yet overlooked problem: the hassle of checking your controller\u2019s battery life. Its intuitive overlay is perfect for those who play in borderless windowed mode, offering non-intrusive, real-time updates. This is all done with safety and convenience in mind; PlayStatus is completely self-contained, meaning that no Anti-Cheat or game will have any problem with PlayStatus running in the background!<br><br>Moreover, if you\u2019re a music aficionado, you'll appreciate the ease of viewing your music without having to switch screens or pause your game. And for those who prefer a more focused gaming experience, the option to disable notifications is just a click away.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Supported Controllers </h2><br>PlayStatus supports the following controllers:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Xbox Series or Xbox One S Wireless Controllers connected via Windows Bluetooth Settings.<br></li><li> Dual Sense controllers (DualSense Edge is experimental)<br></li><li> Dual Shock 4 controllers<br></li><li> Nintendo Switch Pro, SNES &amp; N64 Controllers</li></ul><br><i>PlayStatus will be unable to report correct battery/connection information if you are using any sort of controller emulator dongle, like a 8BitDo, or a Microsoft Xbox Wireless Adapter.
