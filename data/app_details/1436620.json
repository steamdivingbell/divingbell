{"about_the_game":"Agony Online is the world's first ever mix of MMORPG &amp; Battle Royale on a monumental scale that is made by independent developers that want to play their own game. Players can choose to join Battle Royale, or continue playing the Horror MMORPG. The massive 30 Mile / 48 Kilometer apocalyptic island explodes and burns with hell fire killing 100s of players not quick enough to make it to the safe zones.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Discord:</h2>Join our Discord and talk to the Dev Team today!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story:</h2>Hell has risen and taken over the world, the last of humanity is in hiding. Your family was killed and your child was tortured to death by demons. Satan then cursed you with immortality so you can never leave this Hell on Earth. You kill yourself, but after dying, you always wake up somewhere else. You find out that you're a part of a prophecy to team up with others like you to destroy Satan in a final battle to save the world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Movement Information:</h2>In Agony Online supports both WASD &amp; Point-Click movement, whatever sits your style.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">10,000 Player Battle Royale Information:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>All players that register for Battle Royale are teleported randomly across to a 40km/25mile size Battle Island which slowly explodes and bursts into fire as the island becomes unstable. </li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>To get weapons and armor, players kill zombies which drop randomized gear.
