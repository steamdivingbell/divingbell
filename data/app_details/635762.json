There are over 1,000 towns to complete.<br />\r\nPlenty of towns are easy enough. Some take complex planning. Do them in your own order. Get bonuses for completing regions and contracts.<br />\r\nSome cargoes are easy to get. Others you have to create in industries. Use existing industries and build your own.<br />\r\nThe further you get from the start the more strategies you have to use.<br />\r\nPimp up your trucks with bonuses. Last truck delivering gets the bonus.<br />\r\nThe towns and map are to scale. Current or historical industry placement. You could even say that playing is educational.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is plenty more to keep you on your toes.<br />\r\nTowns consume the cargoes you are trying to get to completion.<br />\r\nBig trucks are great for moving lots of stuff, but can't travel everywhere.<br />\r\nThere are lots of broken roads that need deliveries.<br />\r\nUpgrade the industries for better exponential throughput.<br />\r\nCargo stores can sure come in handy.<br />\r\nWhat! I can't take my big trucks across the water on a ferry.<br />\r\n... and what is with those quarantine checkpoints?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nComplete towns, roads, industries, contracts, regions and states for lots of in-game and Steam achievements.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLOGistICAL's base game covers the whole of Australia including all the major cities, towns and industries. Start in Sydney and work your way through the different regions and states. Eventually covering coast to coast with the most difficult being across the sea to Tasmania.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/635762/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1507863473","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/635762/page.bg.jpg?t=1507863473","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/635762/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1507863473","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/635762/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1507863473","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"LOGistICAL expands into North America with the islands of Hawaii<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver 100 new towns to complete.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHawaii is a wonderful collection of islands in the Pacific.... hang on, you probably already know this...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLOGistICAL Hawaii is a great module for both beginner and experienced players.<br />\r\nThough there aren't lots of instructions to walk you through steps, everything is fairly close at hand and intuitive.<br />\r\nMake your way across all the islands having to use each to fix the others.<br />\r\nIt does push your strategies as you get to the larger towns and cities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor those that would like an extra challenge, try doing this one with just a dump truck.
