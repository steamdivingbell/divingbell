{"about_the_game":"Immerse yourself in the world of WhereHurt, a spine-chilling psycho-horror game that blurs the lines between reality and nightmare. Navigate through the distorted landscapes of your home, city, and workplace while racing against the merciless passage of time in an attempt to escape. If you run out of time, your inner demons will be unleashed and relentlessly pursue you. The city's random, impenetrable walls symbolize the mental barriers created by societal norms. Will you be able to navigate the maze of your mind, or will the monsters within you prevail? Or do you want to wander here forever? The puzzle pieces will help you break free.
