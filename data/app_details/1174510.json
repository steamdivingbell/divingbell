It's got an intriguing story and interesting characters in a unique low-fantasy medieval setting. The graphics are charmingly old-school, low-poly 3D with photorealistic textures. All the characters are photographs and frame sequences of real actors you can interact with, see in the world, and fight. The combat system is a turn-based hex grid affair with many tactical options. Also, the game has a magic system based on gods and divine favor, which is unique and immersive. Overall the game has a very relaxing pace, and it feels like reading a good novel; it makes you feel right at home.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">90's Old-School Looks</h2>Call of Saregnar features a 90's inspired low-poly 3D look with detailed handcrafted textures, while the characters you encounter are made of thousands of frames of real photographed actors!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Believable World</h2>Saregnar lets you role-play through a deep, engaging story filled with murder, mystery, intrigue, and suspense.
