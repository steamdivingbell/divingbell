{"about_the_game":"Electro-Motive\u2019s SD45-2 \u2013 it was the titan of EMD\u2019s landmark \u201cDash 2\u201d line of diesels \u2013 and now the potent diesel is available for Train Simulator in a titan-sized pack that features the 3,600-horsepower, six-axle, 20-cylinder diesel in a dozen liveries of CSX and its predecessors!<br><br>Created by noted developer DTM (Digital Train Model), the Train Simulator EMD SD45-2 faithfully re-creates the husky locomotive which was introduced in 1972. Powered by EMD\u2019s unique 20-cylincer 645-series diesel powerplant, the SD45-2 was a refinement of the SD45 that had been introduced in 1966. As compared to its predecessor, the SD45-2 featured the improved electronics of the Dash-2 line and addressed the main-bearing and crankshaft problems that had plagued the big 20-cylinder powerplant in the SD45. At 70-feet, 8-inches long, the SD45-2 was nearly five feet longer than the SD45, which allowed EMD to utilize vertically mounted radiators on the Dash-2 rather than the SD45\u2019s trademark flared radiators. <br><br>Four railroads \u2013 Seaboard Coast Line, Clinchfield, Erie-Lackawanna, and Santa Fe \u2013 were original buyers and through mergers and sales, the husky diesel went on to appear in numerous other notable railroad liveries, including Family Lines, Seaboard System, Conrail, and giant CSX (which inherited the SD45-2s originally owned by SCL and Clinchfield as well as a number of ex-Erie Lackawanna units which had joined the Conrail roster). <br><br>DTM\u2019s monumental Add-On features the Electro-Motive SD45-2 in twelve liveries: Seaboard Coast Line; Clinchfield; Family Lines; Seaboard System; six captivating variants of CSX liveries; and unbranded versions of the Erie-Lackawanna and Conrail schemes.<br><br>Along with its multiple liveries, the SD45-2 captures many of the distinctive details of the big diesel. Erie Lackawanna\u2019s SD45-2s were notable for their massive 5,000-gallon fuel tanks and the model is included with both standard and 5,000-gallon tanks. And there\u2019s even more! Joining the SD45-2 in this pack are CSX\u2019s distinctive modern 16600-class platform caboose in two liveries, a bay-window caboose in four liveries, 60-foot ribbed-side and waffle-side boxcars in two liveries, 100-ton coal hoppers in four liveries, modern 111A tank cars in four liveries, 2-bay covered hoppers in two CSX liveries, and flatcars with waste containers in three liveries. Rounding out this huge pack is a selection of four career scenarios on the Clinchfield: Elkhorn City \u2013 St. Paul route (route available separately).<br><br>The EMD SD45-2, in a dozen authentic liveries \u2013 is now available for Train Simulator!<br><br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2><br>Four career scenarios featuring the SD45-2 on the Train Simulator Clinchfield: Elkhorn City - St. Paul route are included:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>01 - Waste Management<br></li><li>02 - Coal Time<br></li><li>03 - Petroleum to the East.<br></li><li>04 - Westbound Goodies</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on the Steam Workshop online and in-game.
