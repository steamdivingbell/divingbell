{"about_the_game":"You were exploring a abandoned hospital until you got trapped in a loop when using the elevators. Stay on the look out for anomalies. Made for single player and multiplayer 2-6 co-op. Can you make it to level 12?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCO-OP Multiplayer<br />\r\nThe hospital is creepy on your own, team up with friends to try and help to remember your way out of the hospital together! Everyone must agree with the decision your group is willing to make when using the elevators. There are 2 elevators, one that confirms there is an anomaly and the other elevator will select no anomaly. Floor 0 will be the correct layout that you and your friends will need to remember. Anything above floor 0 may or may not have something wrong with the original surroundings. A wrong decision resets you back to floor 0. Test your communication skills with your friends. No VOIP is implemented, recommend other applications to communicate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a memory based game. Take your time there is no timer.<br />\r\nAverage playtime: 0.5 to 2 hours.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3115320/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724442330","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3115320/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1724442330","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3115320/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724442330","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3115320/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724442330","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You were exploring a abandoned hospital until you got trapped in a loop when using the elevators.
