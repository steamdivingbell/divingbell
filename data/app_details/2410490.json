You enter the Haunted Castle with your five friends, and one of you gets randomly chosen as the Hunter. The remaining players must hide and survive within the Castle, completing tasks and avoiding the Hunter until the escape portal opens. Those unlucky penguins who get caught can still assist their friends as Ghost, messing with their pursuers. And those who become Hunters must do everything to stop \u2018em all from escaping.

But more sneaky.</h2><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2410490/extras/Hunter_600x335.gif?t=1725535593\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Hunt as the Hunter</strong></h2>This is the most mischievous game of hide and seek ever, and\u2026 you are it! Selected at random to be the most sneaky Hunter ever, make \u2018em all fear for their lives! Pick your favorite character to embody from a list of terrifying monsters, such as the scythe-wielding Reaper, the blood-thirsty Vampire, or the pumpkinhead Scarecrow (just to name a few), and embrace the thrill of the chase, taking advantage of the unique abilities that come with your choice.

But don\u2019t worry, being chased can still be quite funny. It all depends on your attitude! Run away from the Hunter, hide wherever you can, get sneaky, and complete tasks to open the portal to safety. Too easy? So snap and retaliate! Use  traps to catch the Hunter off guard or a well-placed banana peel to slow him down, hop on a magic broom to fly away, resurrect your fallen friends, or choose to turn yourself into a lamp while at it. Yes, you can do a lot, but there is no escaping if you\u2019re not putting up the work. Finish tasks, both big and small to earn coins and open up the portal to safety. And if you feel the Hunter\u2019s breath on your neck, do whatever it takes to survive, even if it means sacrificing a friend or two.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2410490/extras/ghost_600x335.gif?t=1725535593\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Haunt as a Ghost</strong></h2>Congratulations, you're dead!
