{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>With a Great Prize Comes Great Peril in this 8th-level pirate adventure!</strong></h2><br><i>A richly laden imperial merchant ship caught on a sandbar presents a tempting target to a crew of daring pirates. Her holds may be bursting with swag, but they are also laden with soldiers, with a cruel captain at the helm. At any moment the sails of her imperial escorts may appear on the horizon, but your scurvy scalawags have found her first. A daring assault might bring you more plunder than you've seen in a year, but many pirates greedy for gold have lingered too long over a prize they thought safe, until an enemy fleet sent them to a watery grave. Can the PCs stage a lightning raid on the immobilized ship and get away with their ill-gotten gains? Dare they risk a Raid on the Emperor\u2019s Hand?</i><br><br>Raid on the Emperor's Hand in a series of pirate-themed Islands of Plunder adventures by superstar author Matt Goodall, collaborating on this adventure with Joshua Root, with amazing artwork by Ivan Dixon and William Hendershott and marvelous maps by Pedro Coelho. This adventure can be easily dropped into any seafaring campaign, though it also harmonizes beautifully with the official Pirate Adventure Path from Paizo, Inc. (issues #55 to 60).
