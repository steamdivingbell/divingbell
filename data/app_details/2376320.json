{"about_the_game":"You are tasked with servicing Terraformer Ai cores. To do this you will have to blast your way through the automated defense system. Turn the bots you come across into slag and get what &quot;res&quot; you can out of them as you will need it to load out your tank with different weapon and mods systems. <br />\r\nEach Terraformer complex is split up into 5 levels. On the 5th you will find yourself against the pinnacle of the core\u2019s defenses.  After slagging that, and carrying out the most delicate of repair work, you will be granted full use of the leftover core. This can be used to run powerful upgrades for your tank to help overcome the next core\u2019s defenses.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Slag you can change your whole tank with 3 body types - Track, Mag Ball and Hover. Then you will need to decide if you want Laser, Ballistic or Missile as your main weapon system. But wait, that is not all! You can then pick from passive or active mods to put into the mod slots for your build. These modify almost everything from armour to damage, turn rate and more! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce you have your loadout built you will be dropped into a Terraformer complex from a bird's eye view.  A dynamic camera tracking will allow you to look beyond your center of view. Start shooting and keep moving as the defense systems will be on you in no time! <br />\r\nEach area has its own objective. These range from Destroy, Hack and Capture. Do these to navigate your way through the complex. <br />\r\nIf the defense systems overwhelm you and your tank gets a bit broken, you can always get another, but make sure you save enough \u201cres\u201d for a rebuild!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2376320/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729479336","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2376320/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1729479336","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2376320/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729479336","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2376320/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729479336","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3270390,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"You are tasked with servicing Terraformer Ai cores.
