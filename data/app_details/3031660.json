{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">About this game:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game is a Soul-like swordplay game where you fight from morning to night, switching between two characters depending on the situation.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As a knight employed by a futuristic city, you need to fight smartly and avoid taking as much damage as possible in order to get a good evaluation.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The evaluation from the company is very strict, so if you do not fight seriously for one day, you will be fired and the game will be over.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When night falls and the day ends, the company will evaluate your battles for the day. If your evaluation is B or higher, you will continue to be employed, but if it is below that, you will be fired and the game will be over.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If you continue to be employed, you will then fight a boss enemy.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Repeat this for five days, and defeat the boss enemy on the fifth day to reach the ending.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">At the start of a stage, you first select one of ten cards.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Cards increase or decrease stamina (enemy/player), increase or decrease attack power (enemy/player), and double (halve) experience point gain. There are ten types of cards in total. The enemy/player's status will change according to the content of each card.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">One of the two characters is always selected with a blue frame around its face image. If you change the character you are controlling to the character with the blue frame, your attack power will be 1.5 times higher.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">So the trick to fighting advantageously is to always select the character with the increased attack power.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Crosses (health), gears (experience points), swords (increases attack power), and triangles (increases reputation with companies) are placed randomly on the field on the mini-map.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can obtain up to three sword marks with sword upgrades and choose from them.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Sword upgrades have a rarity and are assigned random values.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Obtaining a cross mark as a character's stamina will restore 50 health for two characters.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Do your best to fight through five days.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When this game ends, you will have to start over from the beginning, keeping only the sword upgrade item.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">*Keyboard controls are not possible.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">*Operation cannot be guaranteed with controllers other than the XBOX CONTROLLER.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">&quot;Recording, streaming, Let's Play videos, and any similar activities related to this game are strictly prohibited.
