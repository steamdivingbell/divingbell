{"about_the_game":"Welcome to NervBox, the multiplayer VR physics simulation that bends to your imagination. Join friends and unleash your creativity with our extensive suite of tools and tailor your worlds to your liking.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Interactive Physics Playground</h2>Hop into a world where everyone and everything follows the laws of physics. Play with two-handed swords that take your whole body to swing. Ride in a shopping cart while a friend pushes you around. Everything is at your disposal for endless fun.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Getting Physical</h2>Work together to move massive objects, boost someone up on your shoulders to get to hard-to-reach areas, or give them a high-five for a game well played.  With a fully physicalized body, your presence affects everything around you - even other players!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tools for Tinkering</h2>Utilize the Sandbox Gun - a powerful multitool - to spawn in objects and attach anything together with simple welds or more dynamic joints. Wield this power to build dynamic battle arenas, design challenging parkour courses, or just hang out with friends while putting together new gizmos and gadgets.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fully Loaded Arsenal</h2>Handle an array of guns with realistic operations, mastering the art of loading, ejecting, and racking for the most engaging encounters. The melee weapons range from swords to bats, and everything has its own unique audio to fully immerse yourself in the world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Games \u00c0 La Mode</h2>NervBox provides various gamemodes to give basic rules to a world, but everything else is up to you. From the open-ended sandbox, to Capture the Flag where you build forts to defend from the enemy team, and NervBall, a brawly, in-your-face test of skill, anything and everything goes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dynamic Environments</h2>Hop into different maps, including a close-quarters warehouse, an open park set in an expansive city, and a minimalist empty space for unlimited creativity. Use them as inspiration for your creative builds, or as a backdrop for a friendly skirmish.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiplayer Shenanigans</h2>Host or join a lobby with up to 8 players. Private sessions let you and your closest friends explore together, or hop into a public session and meet your new best bud.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Community-Driven Development</h2>Join our active Discord community! Share your ideas, report bugs, and help shape the future of NervBox. Your voice matters!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Continuous Evolution</h2>Expect a constant stream of new content and features. With upcoming mod support, you'll be able to upload your own new toys and share them with the growing community.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2168200/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1722641933","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2168200/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1722641933","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2168200/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1722641933","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2168200/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1722641933","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"VR Support","id":31},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Players are able to create violent scenarios with NPCs, weapons, and other players.
