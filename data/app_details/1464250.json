It always holds secrets and discoveries that we will learn. A team of ordinary guys must fight against the mighty army of evil Lord Erlion, who is going to destroy the country of these brave heroes! Immerse yourself in a voxel 2.5 D world! Together with you, you will call your loyal friends who can protect you and your Homeland at the cost of their own lives.

For each of them, you can play separately! You will need to develop your camp alone, or with friends online! Everyone will be able to develop individual abilities, and you also need to learn the unique style of the battle tower. For the tower, you will have three development branches available: defensive, attacking, and mixed. You will be able to develop individual characteristics of the tower. As the battle progresses, your scores will be updated on the leaderboard! You have to fight against a strategically developed enemy, so you need to awaken the same strategist in yourself! Each new wave will be stronger than the previous one! You will be able to keep a list of opponents, thanks to which you will know the weaknesses of each of them!
