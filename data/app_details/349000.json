Spiritual successors to The Emperor and The Abbot from the original Stronghold Crusader (2002), The Emperor and The Hermit are driven by religious fervour.

Having abandoned any sense of religious obligation to his fellow man, The Emperor will stop at nothing to reclaim his former power and authority.

The Hermit is something of a departure for Stronghold with no preordained authority, royal lineage, military background or house to act as a status symbol. What he does control is an army of religious zealots, equally angry about the invasion and out for Crusader blood as their leader.
