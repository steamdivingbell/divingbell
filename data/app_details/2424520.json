{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Shadow of the Demon Lord Monstrous Pack 5 - The Constructed</h2>  This collection contains the final four Monstrous Pages. This pack consists of the following Shadow of the Demon Lord products: <br>  <br> <br> <strong> False Lives</strong> <br> <br> In the years leading up to the orc uprising, the Empire saw incredible innovation, as constructs and other mechanical beings emerged. Although their creation was prohibitively expensive for large-scale manufacturing, wealthy individuals could commission such wondrous devices to toil in mines, haul cargo off and onto ships, and perform whatever other labors they commanded. In Lij, clockworks joined the ranks of other mechanical beings, but rather than be powered by magic or engineering, they derived mobility from souls anchored to their unliving components. <br> Although some believe these marvels to be recent developments, the methods of their creation can be traced back to antiquity, to the time of the Edene and older, lesser-known peoples before them. The dreaded prometheans and the unstoppable golems embody such ancient artifice. And though the means to produce such entities lies far beyond the abilities of most magicians, the mighty spells remain hidden in old tomes and in the notes of the legendary scholars of magic who pioneered their creation. <br> False Lives joins the other entries in the Monstrous Pages series, examining beings created by magic and imbued with sentience. Here you'll find new lore and variants for clockworks, golems, prometheans, and other constructs for use in Shadow of the Demon Lord. <br> <br> <strong> Forgeborn and Magicmade</strong> <br> <br> From animated brooms zipping through the air to menacing suits of armor, lurching forward to bash intruders, from mechanical steeds to dancing statues, slithering rugs and aggressive wardrobes--all these, and so many more, represent constructs, a creature made by imbuing an ordinary object with magic to grant it locomotion and purpose, creating the semblance of life from unliving materials. <br> Constructs can be found through the lands of R?l, as laborers toiling in fields or hauling cargo from ships, or as guardians, set to protect priceless treasures. Some act as steeds, companions, and entertainers, or serve in myriad other roles and capacities. The reasons for their creation are as varied as the often-eccentric individuals who create them, and thus constructs come in all manner of shapes, sizes, and functionalities. <br> Forgeborn and Magicmade explores constructs as they are found in Shadow of the Demon Lord, offering you a set of tools for creating and customizing them, as well as expanding the options for the forms they might take and the methods for their creation. <br> <br> <strong> From Beyond this World</strong> <br> <br> It usually begins with random dissections of farm animals, such as pigs, cattle, and even horses. After that, the children go missing--the foolish or the unwanted, the strays and orphans who won't be quickly missed. Soon, though, they're found in the same condition as the mutilated livestock, precisely divided into so many oddly shaped parts, spread out and arranged in mysterious patterns, the cuts and slices impossibly neat, well beyond the skill of the finest chirurgeon in R?l. <br> For those few who know the meaning behind this, the strange, bloody remains are an obvious sign: the reen have arrived, with an obsessive curiosity that drives them to brutal and horrific experimentation on the denizens of Urth. <br> From Beyond this World joins other installments of Monstrous Pages by revealing secrets of some of the most notorious creatures found in the world.
