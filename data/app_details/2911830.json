{"about_the_game":"Take on the role of a fleet commander and lead your fleet to victory! Compete against other players' fleets over several rounds and gain fame and prestige throughout the galaxy. <br>Each round you will receive more credits to purchase the best ships or improvements for your strategy from the shop's random assortment. Create a powerful fleet not only by selecting the right spaceships, but above all by arranging them. Because each spaceship has its own advantages and disadvantages and can influence others in the vicinity. Optimize your fleet by merging spaceships to create new variants with stronger and combined effects.<br><br><strong>Characteristics</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Player versus player: Compete against the fleets of other players with the same rank and rise in rank yourself through your victories.<br></li><li>One fleet per game: A game starts with a small budget to buy the first ships.
