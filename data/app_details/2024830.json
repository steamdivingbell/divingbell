Blood-splatter effects occur frequently as enemies are killed; some areas depict large bloodstains and impaled heads on spikes. Players can also perform finishing attacks (e.g., decapitation, impalements) that are sometimes highlighted by close-up camera angles. Cutscenes depict additional acts of violence: bound warriors decapitated by swords; characters executed with weapon strikes to the head"},"detailed_description":"Play as the first Egyptian hero in For Honor\u00ae with the Medjay, and switch between the Fan Axe and the Dual Wielding Axe. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen his friend Bolthorn stole the Scarab Bracelet from the desert kingdom, Neferkha, the last descendant of the pharaohs, knew what would happen next.
