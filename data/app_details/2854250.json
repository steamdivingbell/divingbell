You may know me as the creator of College Saga.<br><br>In June 2021, I fell and broke my neck while training my backflip. Immediately, I lost sensation and control below my chest and could hardly move my fingers. Such was spinal cord injury, a cruel and utterly humiliating condition with no cure as of today.

Having minimal control with my core, I am always at risk of tipping sideways or forward unless I keep an arm on my wheelchair. With weak fingers, I can't click normal mouses or move around on my wheelchair. I am now 30% of my former self carrying a load of dead weight.

I have never experienced such an overwhelming and profound sense of shame and loneliness. Knowing about my creative past, my doctor advised me to create once again as a means to prevent myself from spiraling into depression. A form of escapism, if you will.
