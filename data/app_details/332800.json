{"about_the_game":"Welcome back to the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the old and aging animatronics are joined by a new cast of characters.

The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift). So to make your job easier, you've been provided with your very own empty Freddy Fazbear head, which should fool the animatronic characters into leaving you alone if they should accidentally enter your office.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or dismemberment.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/332800/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1579635993","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/332800/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1579635993","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/332800/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1579635993","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/332800/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1579635993","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome back to the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the old and aging animatronics are joined by a new cast of characters.
