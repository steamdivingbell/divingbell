But, in the deepest bowels of this world exists a safe haven hidden within an ancient structure and filled with liberated members of Nyana\u2019s people. <br><br>As Nyana liberates more of her people in her journey, they will find their way to this safe haven and bring their own resources to help it continue to flourish. New abilities in Nyana are tied to specific buildings that can be placed in the HUB. And new buildings can only be unlocked by liberating more of Nyana\u2019s people throughout the sprawling world. <br><br>Save your people. Build your safe haven.

It is best to use enemies to traverse past them as you collect resources. However, through the use of custom-created spells, you can combat and execute those who would stand in the way of your vengeance. <br><br>As Nyana liberates her people and grows stronger in the process, she will obtain the power she needs to face off against each of the five key Masters, including the head of the snake, the Imperator.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2563310/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1709809254","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2563310/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1709809254","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2563310/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1709809254","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2563310/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1709809254","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2563310/extras/NyanaEmail.gif?t=1709809254\" /><br>Embark on Nyana\u2019s journey to liberate her people in the 2D action-adventure Nyana.
