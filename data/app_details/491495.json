{"about_the_game":"A technological tour de force of epic proportions, the legend of the XB-70 Valkyrie\u2122 very nearly surpasses the performance of this extraordinary aircraft. Built in the 1960s as a result of a USAF proposal for a supersonic bomber with high subsonic cruising speed and supersonic dash capabilities, the massive XB-70\u2122 was to have carried the same bombload as the B-52 Stratofortress\u2122 at a higher supersonic speed than the Air Force's current strategic bomber, the B-58 Hustler\u2122. A later requirement specified that the plane be able to fly the entire mission at Mach 3.0 or greater, with a range of up to 10,500 miles and a maximum gross weight of 490,000 pounds. In the event, technology quickly relegated the Valkyrie to the role of supersonic research testbed and flagship of the USAF's public relations fleet. Ground-to-air missiles and advanced radar made the XB-70's supersonic mission impossible. The bomb bay of the aircraft was instead packed with data acquisition equipment.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features </h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>High quality exterior model with detailed textures<br></li><li>Large set of custom XB-70 gauges in 2D panel and virtual cockpit<br></li><li>Highly authentic flight model with carefully illustrated checklist<br></li><li>Animated folding wingtips<br></li><li>Animated afterburner petals<br></li><li>Authentic gear retraction sequence<br></li><li>Automatic (on throttle) staged animated afterburner visual effect with corresponding performance boost<br></li><li>Simulated XB-70 soundset included<br></li><li>Pilots togglable<br></li><li>Automatic smoke trail, wing surface vapour flash and canard tip vortices effects</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/491495/extras/BOEING.jpg?t=1537259121\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/491495/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1537259121","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/491495/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1537259121","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/491495/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1537259121","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/491495/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1537259121","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A technological tour de force of epic proportions, the legend of the XB-70 Valkyrie\u2122 very nearly surpasses the performance of this extraordinary aircraft.
