{"about_the_game":"This game is a run n' gun 2d shooter with 6 unique stages, and 360 degree aim. Graphics are pixelated and based on a black, white, and red color palette, and the music is 8-bit styled.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIN-DEPTH DESCRIPTION (SPOILERS)<br />\r\nCheckpoints (if you die) are provided at the beginning of each stage. The 6 stages in the game are: Avenger (Forest); easier gateway level to build up basic practice in the controls. Subway; first dose of challenge and more enemy variety. Pursuit (Highway); a switch-up from the usual level formula thus far, taking place on a car whilst being chased by Wasp Army vehicles. City; returning back to the regular stage formula, with more scenic graphics and focusing more on platforming than the other levels. Airship; the pinnacle of the regular stage formula, reaching a crescendo in difficulty. Wasp Nest; the final boss stage, containing a view of Katag-Lupan island at the start of the level, and then moving into the underground ornate halls of the wasp nest. As for the bosses, there is one at the end of each stage, increasing in difficulty as the game progresses. There is also a mini-boss to fight in the first stage, and stage 3 is mostly comprised of a unique boss-rush. Your weapons include the rifle; shoots straight and accurate, the shotgun; less accurate but more total DPS, and the grenades; resetting to 4 at the start of each stage, if you conserve your grenades through the whole stage, you will receive bonus health after the boss fight.<br />\r\nBosses include: The Hornet, James, AA-Walker, The Submarine, Big Buzz, Tarantula Hawk, and Project Omicron (see manual for more details).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCINEMATIC DESCRIPTION<br />\r\nThe Wasps have returned to take over humanity once more, but this time the challenge is real. Blast through 6 stages full of Wasps to shoot, each containing a boss at the end of the stage for your playing enjoyment. With graphics that are black, white, and red all over, this game is pretty violent. But wasps suck, so who cares? <br />\r\nSetting up their new base on Katag-Lupan Island, the Wasps have sent massive strikes to military bases around the world, causing them to be a bit more of a problem than almost a year ago. Unfortunately for the military, they got their heads handed to them, so they had to go get the guy who beat up the Wasps the first time. It doesn't really make sense that one guy is better at wiping out the Wasps than the whole military, but maybe he's just that cool.
