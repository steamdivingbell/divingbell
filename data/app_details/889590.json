Leading the resistance are the United States Free Forces, armed with a one-of a kind, building-sized weapon: the Archangel. The Free will do everything they can to try to stop HUMNX and take back their freedom, but HUMNX resources are plentiful, and they have been working on weapons of their own to face off against Archangel-class mechs. Take on the mantle of the Free and engage in Archangel\u2019s award-winning single player campaign. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCurrent Events - Year 2099<br />\r\nSubsequent a few strategic victories on the USFF side, the HUMNX armada has adapted.

The USFF, in response has also brought their mech class roster up to three and initiated automated mechanized war machine construction. The ensuing war has resulted in billions of casualties. Who will reclaim our shattered world...? Will it even matter when the war is finally over? Most importantly pilot, are you ready to heed the call and unleash hellfire?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/889590/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1739206299","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/889590/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1739206299","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/889590/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739206299","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/889590/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739206299","categories":[{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to the Archangel\u2122: Hellfire Demo!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArchangel\u2122: Hellfire is the unholy union of godlike mech weaponry and infernal team deathmatch gameplay.
