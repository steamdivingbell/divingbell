{"about_the_game":"<i>Songs of steam and bright machines...</i><br><br><strong>Welcome to Full Gear! </strong>This is a <strong>steampunk-style traditional roguelike</strong> (turn-based, permadeath, absolutely no progression), where you'll learn that information is key: learn new things, die from an unknown attack, repeat. Use goggles, guns and gadgets to get a gain on the gears, and find... whatever you're looking for down there. You keep forgetting your goal, don't you Devi? Eyes on the prize!<br>You can also play Full Gear as a <strong>modern roguelike</strong>, slowly unlocking item sets, boosts, and Toolboxes. If you don't like starting with all the chaotic and complex items, be sure to select Modern Mode and ease more into the game as it progresses.<br>With hundreds of unique items to equip, throw, shoot, learn and build, there's plenty of possibilities to crash your wrench into the drones patrolling the area. And sometimes your own drones as well. Don't worry, no crafting will be required.<br>Featuring:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>8 sprawling areas, all in one giant room, to traverse</li><li>300+ items, all with unique capabilities, combinations and strengths</li><li>50+ unique enemies, completely animated in cute pixel art style</li><li>6 NPC's with their own hopes, dreams, aspirations, and make-shift shops</li><li>6 Toolboxes, a run tracker, and a seeding system to make your runs personal</li><li>9 Boosts and 9 Challenges to make the game harder - or easier - at will</li><li>6 main bosses and 1 final boss</li><li>30 Steam achievements!</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Make Your Own Death Machines</h2>Ah, but using a weapon is never quite enough, is it? You need additional firepower! Gather Parts and combine them in any way you like using local Drone Stations, then let the crafted <strong>Drones </strong>roam near you, distracting and eliminating any threat. You can make a killer robot with three flamethrowers moving at lightning speed - or a cute companion with a taser called Randy. Nobody's safe from Randy. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2212500/extras/gif4.gif?t=1706308416\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Turn Of Events</h2>That cogwheel of yours isn't just for decoration, it's your essence. Whenever a <strong>Token </strong>reaches the top, it'll activate whatever it does - heal you, shield you, give a Crit, give Scrap, or allow a Drone to fire. Re-arrange these Wheel Tokens to whatever you see fit, and before you can say &quot;hey watch this&quot; you deal 40 damage in one attack.<br>Not enough slots for your tokens to fit? No big deal! Swap <strong>cogwheels </strong>to get more slots, stacked slots, special tokens or more regeneration to increase your active capacity. But beware - larger cogwheels may have more slots, but consequently, each slot activates less often.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2212500/extras/gif1A.gif?t=1706308416\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Block And Unlock</h2>Many items are locked at first, but in-game <strong>Goals </strong>can be tracked to unlock them.

Additionally, you can simply choose Traditional Mode, where all items are unlocked from the start and Goals are purely cosmetic.
