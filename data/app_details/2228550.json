{"about_the_game":"Is your game\u2019s churches as quiet as a graveyard when your heroes revive? Do you want to give your healers some verbal cues when they greet passersby? Then it\u2019s time to check out NPC Female Priests Vol.1! TK.Projects newest SE pack brings us 120 Japanese voice clips to fill your churches and hospitals with greetings and laughter of the women who work there. Instead of overexplaining with messages, have a priestess sigh when your heroes need to be revived after losing a fight to a slime or let a healer chuckle if a party member needs to be healed after getting food poisoning.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n12 different character voices offer up options for multiple ages and levels of belief. Have a young girl give a shy hello from her spot in a pew when your heroes walk by, or a middle-aged woman sob outside to attract your players to talk to her and start a new quest. Soft-spoken priestesses and believers can hum in thought before suggesting blessings to help in combat or cry in joy when your heroes manage to recover the town\u2019s lost relic. Don\u2019t give only your good NPCs' voices though! The fanatic SEs in this pack are perfect for followers of the demon lord or villains who are trying to trick townsfolk into giving away all of their hard-earned money.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach SE comes in multiple file formats, so you can easily add them to your favorite engine without needing to edit them.
