{"about_the_game":"ARACNIDIUM is a simplistic platformer \u201cFast Game\u201d where you will help BOB save his family from the spiders invading his house. The game has 30 levels, each of which you must find the right angle to use the weapon found by BOB, which is the only resource that can eliminate spiders and ensure the safety of the family. You must use the weapon in the right aim so that you can hit all the paths that the spiders pass, thus protecting BOB's entire family: his parents, baby brother, dog, cat and guinea pig. In each level you will find only one, or two or even three possible crosshairs. Will you be able to find the right aim to kill the spiders? Only by playing will we know!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1919610/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1656036709","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1919610/page.bg.jpg?t=1656036709","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1919610/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1656036709","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1919610/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1656036709","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"ARACNIDIUM is a simplistic platformer \u201cFast Game\u201d where you will help BOB save his family from the spiders invading his house.
