I am very happy to have made this game, and if some players find it interesting, I will be even happier. &quot;Get Up In The Night&quot; is entirely independently developed by myself, without borrowing or imitating any existing games, so I guarantee that this game will bring you a fresh experience. Since this is my first time making a game, you are probably not familiar with me, so I am bringing you plenty of free content this time. The demo version of &quot;Get Up In The Night&quot; will include five long story levels, which is about one-fifth of the full game. You can experience it for several hours to see if this game suits you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">On the other hand, in the early stages of the game's release, the early access version and the demo version will have the same content, but as the game is further updated, the two will gradually diverge. If you like this game, feel free to add it to your wishlist and follow it. Of course, you are also welcome to purchase the early access version of the game; money is always a great motivator. In any case, thank you for playing!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Long story, handmade Levels</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The levels in &quot;Get Up In The Night&quot; are divided into two types: procedurally generated Roguelike levels and unique handmade levels by the creator. All story levels are handmade, filled with surprises. &quot;Get Up In The Night&quot; is a sci-fi story set in the future with dark humor. An old man wakes up in a completely unfamiliar place... His bladder can no longer hold it, and he must get to the bathroom! But what is really going on? What secrets does it hold?

The protagonist of the game is an old man who urgently needs to pee. Being an old man, he is not very agile. When controlling the old man, players need to understand his condition and act accordingly. In the game, players will encounter various enemies, but given the old man's limited abilities, it's better to see through their weaknesses and solve the mysteries they hold, using wisdom to clear obstacles and progress.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Roguelike Levels and Unique Game Logic</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">&quot;Get Up In The Night&quot; includes unique Roguelike content, fully integrated into the main story. As the story progresses, the richness of the Rogue levels will gradually increase. At the same time, this game is indeed very unique, with unexpected elements in both the story and level design.
