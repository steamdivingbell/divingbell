{"about_the_game":"Indulge in pan-European fantasy football by taking control of any club from the four English divisions, or simultaneously from the top two divisions of the continent\u2019s premier leagues (Spain, Italy, France and Germany).<br><br>All the usual features are here : transfers, tactics, team management, squad rotation, finances and club development. Again, the pressure-inducing action takes place within a lush, interactive world. More environments have been added and more characters created as you go about conversing with the club staff and the media. Delegation is a brand new feature allowing the manager to pass on various roles to the backroom team and freeing the manager to concentrate purely on all things footy related, making for a more speedy and efficient season. <strong>Premier Manager 03/04</strong>'s new engine gives more scope for tactical involvement from the bench. More stat feedback is given to highlight differences in performance and skill. Transfers are more true to life than ever with player power now governing transfers, allowing greater opportunities for those unhappy or those chasing a quick buck to leave the club. And if some of them really are mercenaries, you can engineer a move and have the player on his way quicker than you can say Jaap Stam! Make The Transfer.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1272050/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1677138621","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1272050/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1677138621","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1272050/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1677138621","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1272050/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1677138621","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Indulge in pan-European fantasy football by taking control of any club from the four English divisions, or simultaneously from the top two divisions of the continent\u2019s premier leagues (Spain, Italy, France and Germany).<br><br>All the usual features are here : transfers, tactics, team management, squad rotation, finances and club development.
