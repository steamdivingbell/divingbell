{"about_the_game":"You find yourself in a familiar subway tunnel. As you descend, you begin to get the overwhelming sense that something is very wrong. You find a Red-Labelled Cassette and a Tape Recorder... A melody begins to play. Are those footsteps yours, or are you just imagining things?<br><br>A short horror experience that ties together the original Close Your Eyes and the upcoming Close Your Eyes: Intermission. Stylized as something of a teaser for Intermission with an ARG/Creepypasta style similar to Intermission but in a much simpler way, all while following the story and events of the original game. <br><br>Various puzzles are cryptic and may be difficult to solve alone, encouraging you to communicate with others. There are a number of secrets to discover as well, including multiple endings. Can you solve the various puzzles and find the hidden depths that lay within these subway tunnels?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/645840/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1629739785","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/645840/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1629739785","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/645840/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1629739785","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/645840/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1629739785","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You find yourself in a familiar subway tunnel.
