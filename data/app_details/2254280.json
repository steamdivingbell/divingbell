{"about_the_game":"When a star falls in a nearby forest, it spurs Po onto a quest to find that light and bring it into their life. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWelcome to Light &amp; Shadow, a narrative-driven 2D platformer in shadow puppet form, where you face your anxieties, climb out of depression, and find the moments of joy in a grey world. In the game, you puppeteer Po through 26 levels spread over 5 Biomes, where you will collect music notes and seek out key special moments in each level, which will help you push back the manifestations of Anxiety and Depression which will obscure your view and slow you down on your quest to find the star.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere you find the original soundtrack of the game, composed by Jake Morris and Doug Sowten for the different areas of your journey. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the game itself, the music is tied to your collection of musical notes. The soundtrack diminishes the longer you go without collecting notes, and enriches as you collect and push back your anxieties and depression. To properly encompass this experience, Doug and Jake have remixed the songs to rise and fall and give the listener the experience of the music as it was intended, as if you were playing the game yourself.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2254280/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1672764892","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2254280/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1672764892","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2254280/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1672764892","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2254280/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1672764892","categories":[{"description":"Additional High-Quality Audio","id":50}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"When a star falls in a nearby forest, it spurs Po onto a quest to find that light and bring it into their life. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWelcome to Light &amp; Shadow, a narrative-driven 2D platformer in shadow puppet form, where you face your anxieties, climb out of depression, and find the moments of joy in a grey world.
