Save and invest, steal and extort, arrest and get arrested \u2013 in single-player and multiplayer, with ranks and ladders, team mode and spectator mode. Featuring seasonal content updates, regular tournaments, item drops, full support of Steam Community Market \u2013 and more!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>HOW DO YOU PLAY THIS GAME?</strong></h2><br>Gremlins, Inc. is designed for up to 6 players, in <u>multiplayer</u> or in <u>single-player</u> mode (with AI bots). Each player has 6 cards on their hand (replenished from the same deck) and uses them either to move around the playing field or to perform different game actions. There is a lot of interaction with other players, and duels are significantly different from 3-player or 4-player games. You can play until a certain score limit, or until agreed number of rounds, or for time limit. The game offers both <u>custom</u> and <u>ranked</u> sessions (with matchmaking by rating).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>CAN YOU PLAY IN TEAMS OR JUST WATCH?</strong></h2><br>Yes, you can! In addition to <u>custom sessions</u> (where you define the parameters of the session and may optionally set filters for those who can join you) and password-protected <u>private sessions</u> (so that you and your friends can play undisturbed), the game offers <u>team mode</u> (2x2, 3x3, or 2x2x2) with teams of human players and/or AI bots. Gremlins, Inc. also supports a built-in <u>spectator mode</u>, which allows you to watch sessions of other players right from inside of the game, sharing your emotions with players and other spectators through messages and emoticons.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>CAN YOU PLAY THIS GAME OFFLINE?</strong></h2><br>Certainly! When you buy this game, you get 2 products in your Steam Library: <u><strong>Gremlins, Inc.</strong></u> \u2013 the edition that is playable online in single-player and multiplayer modes, with full support of item drops and Steam Workshop; and <u><strong>Gremlins vs Automatons</strong></u> \u2013 the edition that is playable offline in single-player mode, without any connection to our server whatsoever.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO PLAY ONE SESSION?</strong></h2><br>The game offers different session settings to make them fit your available time, and single-player mode offers automatic <u>SAVE / LOAD</u> function at every turn so that you can take a break whenever you want (while multiplayer mode offers re-connect functionality as long as the session is still in progress). A quick duel for 20 score points with a fast timer can finish in under 20 minutes, while a 4-player session for 60 rounds can last for 2 hours or more.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM STRATEGIES?</strong></h2><br>There are different types of cards in the game (permanent, regular, secret and criminal) and as each card can be used either to move or for action, you will develop both <u>short-term</u> and <u>long-term</u> strategies for making the most out of where you are, and what you currently have in your hand. Normally, you spend half of your game time accumulating resources and building the foundation for the end-game, and the other half trying to control the progress of your opponents (stealing, arresting, initiating player conflicts, and so on). The more you play, the more new strategies you will discover \u2013 especially when combining the effects of several cards played in a combination.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/369990/extras/StorePage07.png?t=1731228620\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>MAKE DECISIONS, PLAN YOUR MOVES</strong></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>This is an intense <u>strategy game</u>: make decisions at every round!
