{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">  </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Sunken Veins is a resource management horror game set on a flooding underwater coal mine. Your job is to mine for coal whilst dealing with overwhelming floods of water and adaptive aquatic creatures that learn from the way you play.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><u><i><strong>MINING</strong></i></u></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Operate a deep-sea mining drill to extract coal and scraps. Whilst mining, the facility builds stress, which increases the chances of causing a flood. Find the balance between gathering resources and maintaining stress levels.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><i><strong><u>DRAIN</u></strong></i></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Floods in the facility will disrupt electronics and extend the length of your shift until they are dealt with. Large industrial drains will help you remove  water and keep the water levels down.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><i><strong>  <u>MAINTAIN</u></strong></i></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A proactive approach can help you stay alive. Repair and reinforce ceiling vents. Fortify doors to stop water spreading. Whatever it takes to stop you from being overwhelmed.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><i><strong><u>ADAPTIVE CREATURES</u></strong></i></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You aren't alone. Predatory creatures have found their way into the mine after the company disrupted their home. They are smart, adaptive and very dangerous. How you play will influence the behaviours they use to hide, deceive and try to kill you. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><i><strong><u>TWITCH CHAT INTEGRATION</u></strong></i></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Connect your Twitch account to allow chat to influence the game. You can control which commands are available for chat to use, set cooldowns for them, and also set custom text prompts that triggers the commands. Some commands are helpful and some are disruptive.
