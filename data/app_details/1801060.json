{"about_the_game":"Helix is a low-poly multiplayer FPS Hero-Shooter with MOBA-like Mechanics. During gameplay you will play as (currently) one of three characters: Aca, the red sound character specialized in close combat audio-visual attacks, Radon, the green smell character specialized in fast-moving prey-stalking combat through his heightened sense of smell, and Vision, the blue sight character specialized in long-range sniping combat, enhanced thanks to his improved owl-like sight. During a match, you will have to kill your opponents and steal their DNA to unlock and upgrade your abilities which will give you an edge against anyone standing in your way. There are (currently) two main modes, deathmatch, where through the use of your abilities you will have to kill the most amount of players, or team-deathmatch, which starts off as a normal team fight, but later evolves into a king-of-the-hill, where players with the most abilities will be able to unlock an area to capture. Through the unlock and upgrade of skills during the match and a dynamic game mode. Helix is trying to pursue a mix of FPS with MOBA-like mechanics.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1801060/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1638490320","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1801060/page.bg.jpg?t=1638490320","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1801060/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1638490320","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1801060/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1638490320","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Helix is a low-poly multiplayer FPS Hero-Shooter with MOBA-like Mechanics.
