It invites players to wander through a gloomy city, engaging with its inhabitants, solving small tasks, and unraveling the lives of five distinct characters. At its core, the game is a profound character study, delving into their stream-of-consciousness narratives while weaving a tale of introspection, alienation, nostalgia, loneliness, and the human condition.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The story unfolds over <strong>seven pivotal days in Avoir's life</strong>. Each day brings a new encounter with a unique individual, offering opportunities to help them navigate their personal struggles. Through these interactions, players not only aid others but also uncover deeper layers of Avoir\u2019s identity and inner world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When not immersed in these meaningful connections, players are free to explore the city, interact with its diverse residents, and lend a hand in their daily lives. These moments of wandering and discovery enrich the narrative, creating a tapestry of interconnected stories.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Structurally, the game is divided into three acts, each containing two chapters, totaling six main segments. These are bookended by a prologue and an epilogue, framing the journey with a sense of completeness and reflection.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Crafted with care using <strong>RPG Maker 2000 v1.7</strong> and enhanced by BananenJoe's <i>Destiny Patch</i>.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1732500/extras/train.gif?t=1739917983\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>5+ Hours of Emotional Gameplay</strong>;  <br>Though concise, every moment of the game is crafted to deliver a rich, heartfelt experience that lingers long after you finish it.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Reactive Storytelling</strong>; <br>Your choices matter.
