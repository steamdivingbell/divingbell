When small sacrifices can ensure the survival, even prosperity, of an entire community, aren't they worth making? Some might think so, or at least tell themselves as much in the small hours of the night, when the distant cries of those sacrifices echo in their memories. <br> Combat encounter maps included: none <br>  <br> <br> <strong> The Demon's Wet Nurse (Novice)</strong> <br> <br> The group of characters find themselves caught in a net of a cult's plot to wreak havoc and, in so doing, loose a hideous demon into the world.
