{"about_the_game":"Egypt, 1923. A young archaeologist discovers the gigantic tomb of an unnamed pharaoh. As she and her team descend into the tomb, it seems to come alive and closes completely, plunging them into darkness. Pharaoh has awakened from his eternal sleep, as well as his armies who impatiently await his orders.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShadows of Duat is an old school survival horror set in Egypt. An indie game with the essence of the classics of the genre, but modern gameplay, with realistic graphics, immersive sound and over-the-shoulder view. A difficult and terrifying challenge only for the bravest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis story takes place entirely inside a colossal Egyptian tomb full of secrets to discover, puzzles, traps, curses and spooky enemies, which you will have to face through your wits, due to the shortage of ammunition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are 4 main characters that you can embody: the Archaeologist, the Engineer, the Mercenary and the Sage. Each one has their own unique abilities and will allow you to experience the story from a different point of view.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is full of references and curiosities from Ancient Egypt, since its levels are based on the Egyptian underworld described in the Book of Gates.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the darkness of the tomb, you must be alert to every sound, every mural or statue, which will give you clues about the dangers lurking around every corner. The tomb is alive and sometimes the same corridor can lead to different places with new threats, so the tension is constant. The scary thing is not being alone in the dark. It's not being alone in the dark.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe puzzles will be a recurring mechanic and the keys to solving them are in the details. Your observation capacity and your ingenuity will be rewarded. But often to fail can mean suffering a fateful fate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShadows of Duat rewards exploration, as the labyrinthine paths of the tomb hold many secrets, curiosities, and even unique items.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is no single way to end this adventure. There are multiple endings that you will be able to see depending on your decisions. Choose wisely, because the life or death of the characters and even the fate of humanity will depend on it.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Inside the tomb","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2342750/5dd32f1da10fbef394269fbae6024e7ca5ca09c5.jpg"},{"name":"The Waters of Nun","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2342750/325f9fbd120c6a26bfcb2f3ec56441b672b08b81.jpg"},{"name":"A very noisy broom","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2342750/5e6e6819258992d8a3a80008c544a85b256dbe58.jpg"},{"name":"Under the wings of the Triad","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2342750/41740091039f603177a00f3785dd337b2ba55105.jpg"},{"name":"Death is just the beginning","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2342750/0150606d02c6caa4ddddfcf9b6adb5e1f92b01fb.jpg"},{"name":"Crack!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2342750/9fa09753738fac3596bd15504b7f886e111a6403.jpg"},{"name":"Don't touch the red button","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2342750/098389e615630d8e88d1e12cbadacda07ff81bb8.jpg"},{"name":"Shaken, not stirred","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2342750/74e2fb984709501f9f296de4c5d7a3683aa0bc38.jpg"},{"name":"The first meeting","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2342750/33f9bf2370df90e46bb1c339c9abe2485505b8ca.jpg"},{"name":"The Beginning of Desolation","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2342750/16417e1339667663f88b92f9003580f62421a39e.jpg"}],"total":100},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2342750/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737912140","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2342750/page.bg.jpg?t=1737912140","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2342750/c50776fd887eb9661984755207d47f1b3847e9f1/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737912140","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2342750/c50776fd887eb9661984755207d47f1b3847e9f1/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737912140","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"It is a horror game where mummies, zombies and plagues of insects appear.
