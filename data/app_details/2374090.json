It's up to you to adapt to each round, make the right choices and create combos that are as unexpected as they are devastating, by mixing, for example, the famous frenemies Unhygienix and Fulliautomatix.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><u>ASTERIX, OBELIX\u2026 AND OVER 20 ICONIC CHARACTERS FROM THE COMIC</u></h2> <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2374090/extras/GIF03.gif?t=1725350265\" /><br><strong>Asterix et Obelix are here, of course, and so is the entire village and their friends, all ready to set off on an adventure.

Asterix's &quot;&quot;Born Rebel&quot;&quot; skill, for example, works best against the Romans, making their attacks less precise, while Dogmatix uses &quot;&quot;Mark Territory&quot;&quot;, which terrifies opponents and completely stuns animals!

But be careful, the path ahead is fraught with peril: in each chapter you choose your route and combat, find treasure and avoid many obstacles. Use your cards wisely to avoid the traps set by the Romans. You will travel across 6 regions well known to fans of the series while you take on the Roman legions, of course, as well as the pirates, Egyptians, Vikings, and even wild animals.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"First Steps of a long journey","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2374090/fc0c316dd13cb70329442ff905d3c8482f3e2bd2.jpg"},{"name":"Complete Adventure Gaul","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2374090/3660b6502edba23f3292beb951f96752eda827f5.jpg"},{"name":"Complete Adventure Carnute Forest","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2374090/d851944eef4cfb4b725c69ea3253c5b3ec487c33.jpg"},{"name":"Complete Adventure Egypt","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2374090/8fbc063f4435dbe1016a9e8b9abf838d1a5b3764.jpg"},{"name":"Complete Adventure Britain","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2374090/1932bc78d4efe69b6c2bdec21390ab0577c4f7f9.jpg"},{"name":"Complete Adventure Land of the North","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2374090/09e4fbd65ea5a8d9a11821dd6dc78a410896d016.jpg"},{"name":"Complete Adventure Rome","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2374090/54156dbeacbe008be1ee3c092cb6ad5b653496c2.jpg"},{"name":"Victory is ours","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2374090/67c892e49acc27a1e25a032931b51ac4a815175a.jpg"},{"name":"Nothing is holding you back","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2374090/13850d5569070c2bfa085218268ca04e516c5457.jpg"},{"name":"Play with fire","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2374090/58ea22e072b05d6ca87a68f21b965182df5b03e6.jpg"}],"total":22},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2374090/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725350265","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2374090/page.bg.jpg?t=1725350265","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2374090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725350265","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2374090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725350265","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2374090/extras/GIF01.gif?t=1725350265\" /><br>The year is 50 BC.
