MAJOR Nickolai Patrikov then led an illegal invasion of an Island Country called Gemstone Island defeating and killing the Gemstone Police and National Defense, toppling the Ruling Communist Government in a war called CGT vs. Gemstone Island War. He ordered for all politicians and members of the Ruling Communist party to be rounded up and executed with him personally executing Communist Gemstone President: Johnson Lincoln by electrocuting him with Lightning until his head explodes ( Senior officers in both IMS and CGT have powers ).

Freedom fighters side with IMS since its working with the Communist Government and only kill CGT forces, Gemstone Resistance kill both IMS and CGT to force them to leave since they don't want any foreign powers in their country.

All of this violence has lead to a high number of dead bodies littering the streets of Gemstone Island, with the dead bodies now reaching unprecedented levels and continuously increasing.<br><br>COMBAT AND GAMEPLAY<br><br>You have a wide variety of weapons to use in Super Incursion. You are carrying 2 rifles and a pistol, You got bombs like (Pipe bomb, Molotov, Flashbang, EMP, Smokebomb, Flare) which can be crafted or found in the world, you've got a melee weapon and can use Fists and kicks when its durability runs out. All bombs can be planted on the floor as Proximity trap mines for enemies to step on and trigger. You can choose to kill enemies with firearms, melee weapons or bombs or mix them and use them all at once. Planting bombs and stunning enemies then rushing them with a melee weapon for an easy kill, Blinding enemies with a flash bang then taking them down with a melee instant takedown or gunning them down, There are multiple ways to take down enemies including using stealth and silent takedowns. There are crafting components laying around in the world which you can use to craft medicine and bombs in your bag. <br>This is a linear story driven game with small puzzles you'll need to figure out to progress forward. it has 10 chapters and can all be individually replayed after completion. There is PERMANENT DEATH ( PERMA - DEATH ) mode for those who've already beat the game before and think they can play it flawlessly. There is also NEW GAME + which lets you play the story from the beginning with all your existing weapons, money and upgrades.  You can collect and gather up money to spend at the Advanced Station to refill ammo, buy bombs, Armour plates and melee weapon repair kits. You can store any inventory items you don't currently need in the Advanced Station Storage Safe for later retrieval and usage. To break enemy pursuit or to reset engagements you can lay down in tall grass to hide from enemies causing them to start searching for you, you can also do this also in shallow water which is high enough to hide your whole body however If an enemy walks by too close to you they'll spot you Or if you discharge your firearm and you don't relocate afterwards to different hiding position. Initially In Combat enemies don't know where you are at all and only get alerted when they see you / hear you discharge a firearm if your close to them or if you shoot a wall they're stand next to. They will approach to investigate wondering what's going on, as they are approaching you can quickly relocate to another hiding spot to avoid being spotted / plant a bomb to kill them when they arrive, or you can wait for them to arrive then attack them. If you move to another hiding spot they will come and search around with their guns raised if they don't find anyone they'll leave. If you are in an active gun fight you can run away and go hide to momentarily end or reset the gun fight, The enemies will come looking for you where they saw you running and start searching that whole area when they get there, you can use this opportunity to take them down using stealth one by one since they don't know where you are or start new gun fight. If they search and can't find you at all they will leave and go search around for you at other places.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1879560/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735143762","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1879560/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1735143762","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1879560/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735143762","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1879560/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735143762","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Super Incursion during combat with enemies includes frequent cursing by enemies, player and enemies bleeding, enemies screaming and blood from player and enemies spilling on the floor and splatting on walls near-by. its mostly found during fight scenes and combat with enemies, There are dead dismembered bodies, beheaded bodies, hung up dead bodies on gallows with vulgar language warnings from one violent group warning others."},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1879560/extras/superincursion_cover.jpg?t=1735143762\" /><br><br>- Story Plot<br><br>Super Incursion takes place in 2040 which is 5 years after the First Global Biological Genocide in which The Con-Federation of Global Terrorism (CGT) killed 80% of the world's human population turning the world into an Over-Grown Post-Apocalyptic Dystopia, The attack was master minded by CGT MAJOR Nickolai Patrikov and Commenced by CGT SUPREME GENERAL John Voorhies.
