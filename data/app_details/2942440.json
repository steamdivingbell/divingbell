{"about_the_game":"You and your fellow pilots go by many names, but to the innocent civilians of the planets you save, you are simply known as the SYSTEM SHOOTERZ...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a 2D top-down arena space shooter with rogue-like progression.  Unlike other games where all you do is move around and auto-fire, in this game every rocket thrust, weapon shot, and planet pass must be pulled off with extreme timing and skill by you, the SYTEM SHOOTER. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou begin your journey with the young pilot GOOSE MCHONK of the RED LEAF SQUADRON.  Using his stock space fighter from the academy and an affinity for PLASMA BOOST(Also know as the Cosmic Egg...)  Goose must defend systems and prove himself so he can rise to the ranks of the pilots he admires.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are countless galaxies with countless systems to defend from the alien mothership menace. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery level is procedurally generated with five planets to defend from a swarm of enemies coming from deep space.  Your ship is controlled by rocket thrust with limited fuel.  You also have limited oxygen and ammo!  Nothing is free in space.  You must fly through planets for refills and pick up what your enemies drop to stay alive and level up your capacities in order to hunt the alien motherships in deep space.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou are a system defense pilot tasked with answering the call of systems in need.  Whether or not you choose to help, these systems need you!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can reroll everything about the level to give yourself an advantage, at the cost of urgency!  Pass up hard to defend systems with powerful enemies for an easy fight, or do the opposite and stack the odds against yourself for a hard fight and extra rewards should you successfully defend.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSuccessfully defend systems to earn System Defense Medals.  Combine these with reputation and XP to unlock new equipment, talents, and pilots!  Will you find an end to the alien mothership menace once and for all?","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2942440?t=1715633669","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2942440/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1715633669","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2942440/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1715633669","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2942440/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1715633669","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You and your fellow pilots go by many names, but to the innocent civilians of the planets you save, you are simply known as the SYSTEM SHOOTERZ...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a 2D top-down arena space shooter with rogue-like progression.
