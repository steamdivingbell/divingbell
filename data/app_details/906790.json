It is said to host incredible ancient technology, one which can bend time itself. However, as your ship approached this particular planet, something went bad with its engine, which caused a chain reaction of explosions from which only you survived when you crashed on the planet.

These space mercs can come in spaceships to rain down fire on your base, or drop down directly on the planet and get personal.<br>  - Nox event: Poisonous meteorite explodes in the atmosphere, enveloping the atmosphere in poison and slowly killing everything that breathes.<br>  - Solar flare: Causes fire tornadoes, spreading fire that can damage almost anything, including animals who in turn spread the fire themselves if they catch it.<br>  - Meteor shower: Mostly visual, but also provides a nice boost to your well being while it's active.<br>  - Trade ships: Trade with the different factions.<br>\u00b0  Day and night cycle with amazing weather and seasons.

Inspired from games such as Rimworld, tower defense games, RPG games and even Paradox games, Gaia has a bit of everything. From the sandbox experience of Minecraft, the wave survival of tower defense games, to the beautiful graphics of RPGs like Skyrim and Subnautica, the game will provide a unique gameplay experience.<br><br><strong>You have your own needs that affect gameplay</strong>, such as hunger and thirst. Make sure you eat prepared food, drink water, rest from time to time, relax by watching the sunset, go to the bathroom when needed and wash your hands. Failure to do so will cause problems, such as decreasing your max health, running speed or mental health, which itself can cause some pretty serious issues.<br><br><strong>Choose from 4 different biomes </strong>every time you want to start a new game.

These factors affect you as well as how some of your buildings work, like turbines. Make sure you take into account all of this when deciding what to build or what to do at any given time during the day. You might also want to prepare for winter time while it\u2019s still warm outside.<br><br><strong>Grow your own food and cook complex recipes</strong>, some which may require alien flora or alien meat.
