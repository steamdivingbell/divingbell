Think fast, take chances and find the secret way to the final boss to win the game and end the Dracolord's reign forever!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1035830/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1553067965","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1035830/page.bg.jpg?t=1553067965","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1035830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1553067965","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1035830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1553067965","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"An action-puzzler where you try to create patterns to damage the various creatures of the Dracolord's domain.
