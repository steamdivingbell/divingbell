However, this game has no combat or survival mechanics whatsoever and your only method of surviving is trying to escape the enemy. Likewise the length of this game is understandably nowhere near those games. I chose to rather keep it shorter and tighter than trying to artificially lengthen it, which would have only resulted in a leaned out and milder experience. On the delivery of the horror theme, I chose to leave out all the jump-scares and opted for constant oppressing and dark atmosphere.<br><br>Photosensitivity warning: This game contains couple of flashing lights. If you are at risk of having epileptic seizure, you might want to take that into consideration.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/576700/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1488312828","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/576700/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1488312828","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/576700/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1488312828","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/576700/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1488312828","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You woke up in a locked room in an abandoned complex.<br><br>For a reason unknown, your legs have stopped working.
