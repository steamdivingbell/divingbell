{"about_the_game":"Evil Next Door is a game about the survival of a group of people in an authentic small post-Soviet town called Ensk. The area suffers from a deadly epidemic and is cut off from the outside world. The player switches between multiple characters with different backgrounds, living out their unique stories and determining how they conclude. Sometimes he or she meets other people playing online and intervenes in their activities or even invites them to take cover in the player\u2019s shelter.<br><br>An epidemic that ravages Ensk turns people into bloodthirsty lunatics. There is no cure available, so the government put the town into quarantine and encircled it with military checkpoints with a shoot on sight order. Food and fuel supplies are limited and there is no way to get them replenished.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1941960/extras/1.gif?t=1712764368\" /><br><br><strong>AN ATMOSPHERIC POST-SOVIET RURAL TOWN</strong><br><br>Gloomy paneled houses and creepy communal art objects are everywhere creating a feeling of total devastation and hopelessness. It\u2019s strange, but these views also provide a strange comfort to those who were born in post-Soviet countries. Evil Next Door players will also portray the idea of what it is like to get stuck in one of these.<br><br><strong>MANAGING ONE CHARACTER, WHILE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THEM</strong><br><br>A player controls the shelter and the several characters living in it. You can choose one of them, equip him or her at your discretion and set out to explore the streets and look for supplies while other characters cook food and craft equipment. This is what life in Ensk looks like, because food, fuel and medical supplies are scarce.<br><br><strong>A TEAM OF CIVILIANS ONLY</strong><br><br>It's easy to survive if you are a special forces soldier. But what about a TV presenter, a grocery store cashier or a pensioner? The player determines how to use the strengths and weaknesses of each character on the team to get everyone to last at least one more day in Ensk.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1941960/extras/2.gif?t=1712764368\" /><br><br><strong>A CITY SURVIVAL GAME</strong><br><br>Surviving in a city and not in a tropical jungle has some advantages. Your characters will always have a roof over their heads, and the supermarket down the street has some supplies left. But who knows what's on your neighbor's mind?
