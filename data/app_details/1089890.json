{"about_the_game":"3D Life is a game of cellular automata that generate endless patterns from a few simple rules.<br><br>Cells live or die based on the number of live neighbors. Too many cells nearby, a cell is overcrowded. Too few, it is underpopulated. Empty cells come to life if they have a certain number of live neighbors. <br><br>From these rules evolve a multiplicity of forms that grow, blink, and glide through mathematical space. The behavior of each rule set is unique.<br><br>Use your stopwatch to control the flow of time: start and stop cell movement, slow down or speed up gameplay. <br><br>Use your flashlight to generate cells in three ways: randomly, frozen until discovered by the algorithm, or spaceships. Spaceships are cell patterns which move on their own, repeating after a number of generations. They can be created in any direction and orientation. <br><br>This game is VR-only for SteamVR-compatible headsets and motion controllers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>14 rule sets, each with their own unique patterns and behavior<br></li><li>23 spaceships<br></li><li>20 million+ cells<br></li><li>Start, stop, and control speed of play<br></li><li>Supports play areas up to 8 x 8 meters (26 sq. ft.)</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Photosensitivity Warning</h2>This game has rapid, flashing patterns.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Acknowledgements</h2>Original <i>Life</i> by John Conway<br>Spaceships from the published work of Carter Bays<br>Game music from <i>The Suite Acoustic</i> by Matthew Lister<br>Trailer music by Christopher Wolff","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1089890/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736881423","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1089890/page.bg.jpg?t=1736881423","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1089890/be4edacb77a16c3473cabf020ce8dc53de7898d2/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736881423","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1089890/be4edacb77a16c3473cabf020ce8dc53de7898d2/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736881423","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"3D Life is a game of cellular automata that generate endless patterns from a few simple rules.<br><br>Cells live or die based on the number of live neighbors.
