{"about_the_game":"<strong>Monkey Mansion</strong> is a multiplayer co-op horror survival game for 1-4 players.

Your assigned objective is to steal the enchanted relics found inside and contain them in an expensive &quot;Power Dampening Container&quot; accommodated by the big bucks of the government agency that hired you. You cannot, however, grab any relic that you desire. Each one of them relies on the power of and is protected by another relic, except for one, due to some other unknown presence inside the mansion.
