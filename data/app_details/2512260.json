{"about_the_game":"Donuts! and Guns!? This is the definitive indie, pixel art, 2D, top-down, wave-based, twin stick shooter that has a Donut as the main character and personified food as the enemies. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nChoose from a box of Donut! characters (with each holstering multiple unique Guns!) and embattle in wonderfully large locations in search for more Donut! companions. Fight through hordes of Fruit, Vegetables, and other miscellaneous enemy types by using either your Guns!, your Donuts!, or your puzzle solving skills!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe games soundtrack is certified FIRE. With composed music designed specifically for high-octane, high-bpm, and high moments. DJ ProdDamon and WackyTacks exclusives will certainly make your head bop.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirst released on GameJolt in 2016, Guns and Donuts has evolved over the last half decade. Guns and Donuts stands as a living project with active development. Tubby is a current PhD student studying Infectious Disease, but Guns and Donuts is his main passion project<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA Demo version of Guns and Donuts will be released at some point in 2023. Following that, Guns and Donuts will be developed to include over a dozen characters at launch, multiple new enemy types, perhaps a story game mode, and a LOT of gameplay/UI changes. The current price point is set for around $0.99-$1.99.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2512260/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1696483425","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2512260/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1696483425","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2512260/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1696483425","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2512260/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1696483425","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Donuts! and Guns!?
