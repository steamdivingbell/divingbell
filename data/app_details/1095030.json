{"about_the_game":"Soul Sorcerer and historic host of the Mortal Kombat. Born in Earthrealm, Shang Tsung's relentless pursuit of powerful magic led him to Outworld, where Shao Kahn offered him a dark power that no sorcerer on Earthrealm could. Shang Tsung pledged his eternal loyalty to Shao Kahn in exchange for this evil magic, but he is no faithful servant. He dreams of the day his sorcery will overtake Shao Kahn's, and he'll pay any price to get there.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1095030/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1597877240","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1095030/page.bg.jpg?t=1597877240","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1095030/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1597877240","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1095030/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1597877240","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence or Gore, General Mature Content"},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Soul Sorcerer and historic host of the Mortal Kombat.
