You enter the world as Edward, a lonely individual tormented by a tragic past, whose only solace is in the medicine that helps him to get through the day. Edward is barely able to cope with his issues, which are only intensified by the solitude of his workplace. He puts on a brave front and dutifully wakes up for work every day. His routine serves as his only anchor, but deep inside, trouble is simmering... </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">One night, while working the dreaded midnight shift, a chain of disturbing events draws Edward ever closer to losing his sanity, as the very fabric of reality seems to unravel and twist around him.
