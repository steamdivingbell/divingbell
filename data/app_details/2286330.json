{"about_the_game":"Good afternoon dear friends! We present to your attention an exciting mini-game in which not only the adventures of a gosling, but also the love of a little girl are embodied! All of the illustrations for Goose Ronnie were created by our 9 year old daughter in memory of her friend.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen our baby was 4 years old, goslings appeared on our farm, and then something happened that we could not have expected: our daughter found a friend - one of the weakest goslings. She fed and nursed him, played with him in the yard. Over time, the goose grew stronger and became completely inseparable from our baby; he followed her everywhere, drove other geese away from her and ran towards her as soon as she left the house! But 5 years later, Ronnie passed away, our daughter was broken, she cried for many days, until we invited her to perpetuate her love to her little friend: to draw their happiest moments, the places where they loved to walk together.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHer dream is to become a great artist, and we support her endeavor! Just like your support can help her. The cost of the game is only 1$ - this is not a big amount for you, but for us it is a huge step towards fulfilling a childhood dream of entering an art academy. By purchasing the game and leaving a review, you will give our daughter Hope to make her dreams come true.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe believe that together we can make this world brighter and inspire little artists to great achievements. Buy Goose Ronnie right now and embark on an exciting adventure knowing you've contributed to supporting children's dreams! Thank you for helping make dreams come true! If you have any ideas or requests, feel free to let us know so we can improve our game to make it even better!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game features charming graphics and whimsical sound effects that bring the world of Ronnie the Goose to life. With multiple levels and increasing difficulty, &quot;Goose Ronnie&quot; offers a unique and engaging gaming experience that is sure to keep players entertained for hours. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or a newcomer, this game is perfect for all ages and skill levels. Join Ronnie on his exciting adventure and see how many points you can score as he becomes the ultimate champion.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2286330/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1694459936","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2286330/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1694459936","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2286330/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1694459936","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2286330/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1694459936","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Good afternoon dear friends!
