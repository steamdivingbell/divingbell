{"about_the_game":"<strong>Don't swipe - type!</strong> Improve your typing speed with this endless runner game. <br><br>In the 2010s the world went crazy for mobile endless runner games like <i>Subway Surfers</i> and <i>Temple Run</i> in which you swipe your away around obstacles and try to see how far you can make it before crashing. <strong>Timmy Types</strong> is a creative twist on the genre in that you type words to navigate your environment. <br><br>The only interesting typing game I've found on Steam is <i>Typing of The Dead: Overkill</i>. The game is a great arcade experience that you navigate using your keyboard instead of a gun, and I really want to play other similar games. Unfortunately <i>Typing of the Dead</i> isn't really suitable for kids and there aren't really any other comparable games out there.<br><br>And this is why <strong>Timmy Types</strong> was created. It is our first experiment in developing a fun family-friendly typing game.<br><br>We appreciate your support of our game! We're working tirelessly, creating new prototypes and always thinking of ways to breathe life into the typing game genre. Hope you enjoy <strong>Timmy Types </strong>and please stay tuned because there's more to come!","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2071540?t=1662413370","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2071540/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1662413370","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2071540/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1662413370","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2071540/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1662413370","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Don't swipe - type!</strong> Improve your typing speed with this endless runner game. <br><br>In the 2010s the world went crazy for mobile endless runner games like <i>Subway Surfers</i> and <i>Temple Run</i> in which you swipe your away around obstacles and try to see how far you can make it before crashing. <strong>Timmy Types</strong> is a creative twist on the genre in that you type words to navigate your environment. <br><br>The only interesting typing game I've found on Steam is <i>Typing of The Dead: Overkill</i>.
