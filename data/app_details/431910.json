{"about_the_game":"Psychocat: The Answer is an evil arcade game about the life of a cat named &quot;Zag&quot;, who desperately seeks an answer. The purpose is to survive for 180 seconds in a Psychedelic tunnel by dodging the obstacles. The primary gameplay is that sometimes Zag will go through colored walls that will reverse your controls. With this unique and evil mechanic;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;it won\u2019t be your reflexes that let you down, it\u2019ll be your concentration \u2013 as control reversals mean you\u2019ll constantly have to keep track of what\u2019s up and what\u2019s down (and left and right).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou control a Zag as he hurtles down multi-colored, gyrating tunnels packed with obstacles and (worst of all) zones that reverse your controls.  The obstacles aren\u2019t that hard to avoid themselves, but the zones that reverse your controls really mess with your mind.  You can have the best timing in the world, but if you\u2019re pressing the wrong button, you\u2019re going to be one flat cat.  Zag does change color to give you some indication of which controls are reversed, but with so much happening on-screen, that doesn\u2019t make things much easier!&quot; -Alphabetagamer<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- The most evil game you will ever play<br />\r\n- 2 tutorials<br />\r\n- 1 survival mode <br />\r\n- 1 epic Answer","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"New Born","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/431910/4da9341b6440404b8ccfb73f449d6297a6c940dd.jpg"},{"name":"I am ready","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/431910/d52e53180b55e84f7eac1da8abeee7bcd444c146.jpg"},{"name":"First step","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/431910/fd1601cb7ab07af17d82b0f46f5c90a928facecf.jpg"},{"name":"Through colors","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/431910/c99024cb5eb910dc8d0f0774fdc72c6fe0b363eb.jpg"},{"name":"Beat the spirals","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/431910/7bc22aafe93fec4051089712fd28b6e9ae623817.jpg"},{"name":"Survivor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/431910/ffe2844efd3214da7ecb352399bbb26c94ca2a52.jpg"},{"name":"Veteran","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/431910/6aa90f3711656559ddfbcc6ec006fb9db5fbfdd0.jpg"},{"name":"Almost","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/431910/854e499cf1066019fdec56c4a50b3fd9797ac14e.jpg"},{"name":"Enlightened","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/431910/9331fe14bdd87cf49f28d3c84c9c5d492399cda3.jpg"}],"total":9},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/431910/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1596271376","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/431910/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1596271376","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/431910/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1596271376","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/431910/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1596271376","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Psychocat: The Answer is an evil arcade game about the life of a cat named &quot;Zag&quot;, who desperately seeks an answer.
