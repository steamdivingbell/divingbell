Anyone who enjoys the Napoleonic wars will find the tactical thinking required for Imperial Ambitions to be much more rewarding. As you forge an empire, the battlefields will become more challenging. We've redesigned the way that armies move on a campaign map, so they act more like real-world military units. Large armies can move in column formation, making it harder to move and requires more tactical thinking to prepare for the battle. The regiments can be split from the main army for small tactical excursions, or sneak into enemy lines for crossfire. For the same reason, attention is required to avoid leaving gaps on your frontline.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219390/extras/Landing_in_IA_01.gif?t=1731847278\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Social Classes</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219390/extras/artisan.png?t=1731847278\" />The society in the game is divided into classes, slaves, peasants, apprentices, artisans and masters. Besides slaves, the citizens will be allowed to progress through four tiers of classes, with each step providing increased capabilities, but also requiring different resources from you. The education is the key for most of your citizens to climb this social ladder. Higher classes will provide exponentially more labor, but will also require unique luxury resources. The citizens may stop working for several reasons, such as training, hunger, epidemic, strike, accidents, criminal activities, exhaustion, rebellion or retirement. While higher classes are often preferable, they are also harder to maintain due to requirement of luxury. The units and agents are also required to be trained from respective classes. For that reason, the players need to find the optimal balance between these classes.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219390/extras/Sociates_02.png?t=1731847278\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Production Chains</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219390/extras/engineer.png?t=1731847278\" />Your Empire will grow beyond the mountains and the seas. As it grows you will have access to more and endemic resources. The more you invest into your roads and docks, the more resources that produced around the corners of your empire will be transported into your capital. With abundance in your capital, you can allocate your laborers to produce to higher quality goods. Imperial Ambitions has more than 40 different resources that can be extracted, produced or imported. Your population will demand products depending on their level of education. You must manage your resources and customize your production chains, while ensuring the wellbeing of your population. Some key resources may just not be accessible to you. You can resolve either by leasing the land from the natives, military invasion, trading with superpowers, or exploiting black market.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219390/extras/gentleman_animations.gif?t=1731847278\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Black Market And Trade</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219390/extras/merchant.png?t=1731847278\" />For the savvy entrepreneur and economist, the black market is a huge opportunity to boost your own empire. No longer do you have to go through the tedious and sometimes costly process of building a colony and maintain an industry. the game will include a black market besides the regular market. In regular trade, a player can initiate a bid for something they need and, if another player sells it to them, everyone is happy! Though, this trade is also taxed by any country that has lands en route. Black market, however works completely different. The resources in the black market is pulled from towns with high corruption. And players can bid for these resources, even if they belong to their enemies. The cost, however, is often higher than normal, yet no one can tax. This can be a boon for some players in need of certain products that are capitalised by their enemies and for everyone that prefers not to pay taxes. Instead, however, corruption and criminal activity will become more prevalent among the towns along the route. e careful not to get caught in a cycle of corruption and crime! To promote corruption player can send man of shadows to start a crime syndicate. It however requires opium to initiate (also only available at black market) However, the player is not defenseless. Players can use the man of shadow to start intelligence mission, to eradicate crime syndicates.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219390/extras/tradeUI.png?t=1731847278\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Undisclosed Tech Tree</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219390/extras/spy.png?t=1731847278\" />In our opinion, it is unrealistic for the players to be able to view the tech tree. In Imperial Ambitions, the player will only be shown the available techs they can fund without disclosing the whole tree. It makes the game more challenging and exciting. This is also part of the discovery experience in Imperial Ambitions - you learn by doing! Funding a tech is not enough for research. The player must have one of their gentlemen agent perform an action related to that technology to be able to discover it. This action is also not revealed to the player. Thus player has to make a guess to what actions would help discover that tech. For example, a gentlemen has to sail the ocean to be able to discover the &quot;Sextant&quot;, a navigation tool for sailors. Or, to discover &quot;Abolishment of slavery&quot; the player need to actually working slaves.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219390/extras/Industry_in_IA_01-2-2.gif?t=1731847278\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Diplomacy</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2219390/extras/diplomat.png?t=1731847278\" />We envision a simple diplomacy for Imperial Ambitions.
