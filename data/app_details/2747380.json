{"about_the_game":"The Harvard Subdivision was previously owned and operated by the Chicago and Northwestern railroad until the merge in 1995 with the now known railroad as Union Pacific. The line goes from Chicago, Illinois to Evansville, Wisconsin which is approximately 102 miles apart. Out of the 102 miles, approximately 85 miles of it is used by both freight and Metra commuter trains.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor Metra, the line starts at Ogilvie Transportation Center in downtown Chicago and is a quad-track to CY tower just south of Clybourn station. There the Harvard Subdivision meets the Kenosha Subdivision with two tracks heading north to Kenosha, Wisconsin and the Harvard Subdivision becomes a triple track to just southeast of Barrington station. From Barrington to Harvard the line is double track until it reaches Harvard where it becomes single track and heads to Evansville, Wisconsin.<br />\r\nAt Crystal Lake, the Harvard Subdivision meets the McHenry Subdivision which carries some freight and commuter service (weekdays only).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll trains on Union Pacific\u2019s tracks run left-handed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Harvard Subdivision: Commuter Edition DLC pack features 6 commuter passenger service sessions through a variety of conditions:<br />\r\nTrain 620 - Morning Express<br />\r\nTrain 709 - Snow Storm<br />\r\nTrain 634 - Winter Morning<br />\r\nTrain 633 - Evening Express<br />\r\nTrain 714 - Stormy Weather<br />\r\nTrain 715 - to Crystal Lake<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRoute development notes:<br />\r\n--- The route was original supposed to be non- prototype with prototype trackwork.
