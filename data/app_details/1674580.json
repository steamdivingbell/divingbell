{"about_the_game":"This DLC contains one Hunter and two Weapons:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Cain (Hunter)<br />\r\n- Nightmare (Vandal 73C Striker)<br />\r\n- Bone Briar (Specter 1882 Bayonet)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe bones of the dead litter the bayou, picked clean, piled high into thickets and briars, pallid in the glow of the fires set by hunters. It\u2019s easy to get lost amongst them, and easier to fall prey to the lurkers who lost themselves there long ago. First amongst these lost souls is Cain, who\u2019s said to have made the greatest sacrifice, and pays his penance with primal fury.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCain lost the man he once was long ago. But the memories of that man wait in the dark, horrors that feast on his desiccated mind at night. Cain carries Nightmare not to ward them off, but to keep them coming, their pull towards death the only reminder of all that has been lost. The Bone Briar keeps Cain oriented on his journey, lest he becomes lost in the labyrinth he\u2019s built of the dead.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674580/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728572568","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674580/page.bg.jpg?t=1728572568","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674580/b59f3702cce17b13fbc3a7301ddfa55002b66713/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728572568","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674580/b59f3702cce17b13fbc3a7301ddfa55002b66713/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728572568","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Remote Play on Tablet","id":42},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"This DLC contains one Hunter and two Weapons:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Cain (Hunter)<br />\r\n- Nightmare (Vandal 73C Striker)<br />\r\n- Bone Briar (Specter 1882 Bayonet)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe bones of the dead litter the bayou, picked clean, piled high into thickets and briars, pallid in the glow of the fires set by hunters.
