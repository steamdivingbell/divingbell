{"about_the_game":"Give a warm welcome to the Planet Zoo: Tropical Pack! Adopt and care for five incredible new animals commonly found in tropical rainforests around the world, including Africa, Southeast Asia and South America. Some of these species live high up in the canopy, others along fertile riverbanks, but all have evolved to flourish remarkably in jungle biomes. In addition, expand your dream zoo even further with 200+ detailed new scenery pieces celebrating the beauty of traditional Indonesian architecture, and take on an exciting new campaign scenario set in a lush green Indonesian locale.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>5 NEW ANIMALS</strong></h2>Welcome the Fossa, Lar Gibbon, Red River Hog, Asian Water Monitor, and Brown-throated Sloth exhibit animal! Take a look through the lush green foliage and discover what makes these stunning tropical species so fascinating. Hear the loud calls from the Lar Gibbon ringing out from across the zoo; observe the Asian Water Monitor\u2019s deep-swimming ability; see the Red River Hog happily rolling in the mud; get a rare, close-up glimpse at Madagascar\u2019s silent apex predator in the Fossa; and invite guests to marvel at the adorably slow Brown-throated Sloths as they unhurriedly traverse their walkthrough exhibit.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>200+ SCENERY PIECES</strong></h2>Expand your zoo with a huge range of stunning new scenery pieces that pay tribute to the architecture and traditions native to Southeast Asia. Build Balinese-style tiered temples that cast striking silhouettes against lush jungle foliage. Construct peaceful Tongkonan-inspired villages, and assemble detailed new multi-part animal statues. As well as beautiful assortment of props such as tables, benches, parasols, drapery, there\u2019s also exotic new Southeast Asian plant life, including the Rafflesia, Attenborough's Pitcher Plant, and Basket Fern! Add all of these beautiful pieces and props to your existing zoo, or use them to build a fresh new tropical paradise from scratch.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>NEW CAMPAIGN SCENARIO</strong></h2>Try your hand at an all-new campaign scenario set in the spectacular environment of Bali, Indonesia. Reunite with Tiffany, the rich socialite whose ambition outweighs her zookeeper skills, and lend a hand at the tropical zoo she\u2019s just been gifted by her dad. But watch out for a mysterious character from the past making a surprise appearance! Take up ownership of the zoo, adopt and manage a wonderful array of animals, and see if you can generate reviews as hot as the climate. The temperature may be sweltering, but cooler heads will prevail.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2346830/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1706276990","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2346830/page.bg.jpg?t=1706276990","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2346830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1706276990","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2346830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1706276990","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Give a warm welcome to the Planet Zoo: Tropical Pack!
