{"about_the_game":"The Sturmgesch\u00fctz III (or StuG III) assault gun was one of the Germany\u2019s most-produced armored fighting vehicles during World War II and saw action on all fronts in both Europe and North Africa. Initially deployed as a mobile armored light gun for infantry support, the StuG III underwent constant revisions throughout the war and was eventually heavily employed in the tank destroyer role.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe StuG III Ausf\u00fchrung (Ausf.) G was the final and most common variant of the StuG III series with approximately 8400 built. Production of the type began in December 1942 and ended in April 1945. Panzer III Ausf. M chassis and Maybach HL120 V-12 gasoline engine rated at 296 horsepower allowed for a top speed of 40 km/h (25 mph).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis StuG III Ausf. G was armed with the 75 mm Sturmkanone 40 (StuK 40) L/48 that was a modification of KwK 40 tank gun with different recoil absorbers (you may be already familiar with it from Pz.IV tank included in Tank Crew). Additionally, a shielded 7.92 mm MG 34 light machine gun was fitted above the loader\u2019s hatch and spaced armor plates were also added to the vehicle front and sides from May 1943.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur StuG. III Ausf. G can be used in both single-player and multiplayer scenarios.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2220831/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734532167","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2220831/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1734532167","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2220831/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734532167","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2220831/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734532167","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Sturmgesch\u00fctz III (or StuG III) assault gun was one of the Germany\u2019s most-produced armored fighting vehicles during World War II and saw action on all fronts in both Europe and North Africa.
