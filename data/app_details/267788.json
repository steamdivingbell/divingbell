The Blood Moon introduces the Werewolf, a feral creature and a new NPC into the game. As you venture through the land, try to make sure you\u2019re not in reach of the Werewolf as the consequences of him landing on you could be fatal, unless you plan on becoming a lycanthrope yourself!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/267788/extras/TDE_Bloodmoon_Banner01_Werewolf.png?t=1617711726\" /><br><br>The Werewolf can smell the blood of an Enemy up to 6 spaces away and continues to prowl the land of Talisman for the entirety of a game. Anytime you roll a 1 you\u2019ll have to roll for the Werewolf\u2019s movement too. If the Werewolf lands on a space with a Character, the player has to roll a die against the Werewolf\u2019s chart to determine their fate.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/267788/extras/TDE_Bloodmoon_Banner02_Lycanthrope.png?t=1617711726\" /><br><br>Being a werewolf isn\u2019t the end of the world\u2026 If you become a lycanthrope, you\u2019ll find yourself with some great advantages, but also with some disadvantages.<br><br>During the night you\u2019ll discover your strength as a Werewolf allows you to add 2 to your attack score, you must attack another player if you land on their space, and if they lose against you they have to roll against the Werewolf chart! <br><br>However, during the day you must deduct 2 from your attack score, so best to avoid other characters or you may be left with your tail between your legs! <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/267788/extras/TDE_Bloodmoon_Banner03_TimeCard.png?t=1617711726\" /><br><br>Time in Talisman moves slowly. The world as we\u2019ve known it so far has not shown us the risks nightfall brings.

However, during the day creatures receive a penalty and have a reduced attack score. Some Adventure and Spell Cards also have different effects depending on whether it\u2019s Day or Night. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/267788/extras/TDE_Bloodmoon_Banner04_Characters.png?t=1617711726\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Doomsayer</h2>The end is nigh. Now that Werewolves are roaming the lands it won\u2019t be long until we\u2019re all cursed and there\u2019s no one left to save us. The Doomsayer is prepared though. When playing as the Doomsayer:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Whenever any character draws an Enemy, you may replenish 1 fate.<br></li><li>Whenever any character draws an Event, you may gain 1 Spell, if your craft allows. <br></li><li>Whenever you draw an Adventure Card that is not an Enemy or an Event, you may draw 1 additional card. </li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Grave Robber</h2>Desperate times call for desperate measures, and with a Werewolf lurking around? You need to get your hands on anything you can to be in with a fighting chance! When playing as the Grave Robber:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Whenever you encounter a space with instructions to draw 1 or more Adventure Cards, you may draw the top card on the discard pile and then draw the remaining cards as normal. <br></li><li>Whenever you discard an Adventure Card, you must place it at the bottom of the discard pile instead. <br></li><li>Whenever you visit the Graveyard, you may draw the top 8 cards from the Adventure deck and take 1 Object of your choice. Then discard the remaining cards.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Vampire Hunter</h2>The sightings of a Werewolf mean that a Vampire can\u2019t be too far behind. The Vampire Hunter needs to investigate the situation and gain as many resources as she can. When playing as the Vampire Hunter:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>After you encounter a space with instructions to draw 1 or more Adventure Cards, you may choose to investigate further. To do so, discard 1 card on your space that is not an Enemy and draw one more card to replace it, which you must encounter.<br></li><li>Whenever you engage an Enemy in battle or psychic combat, add 1 to your attack roll. <br></li><li>Whenever you visit the Graveyard you may draw 1 Adventure Card instead of following the instructions given on the space.</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/267788/extras/TDE_Bloodmoon_Banner05_Endings.png?t=1617711726\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Horrible Black Void</h2>This hidden ending isn\u2019t one for the faint-hearted.

Once this ending is triggered another alternative Ending Card will be placed facedown on the Crown of Command for the next character to encounter.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Lightbearers</h2>One of Talisman\u2019s most unique endings as all players need to work as a team to win the game. You can\u2019t attack each other but can freely exchange Gold, Objects and Followers. At the start of the game, 2 full days are given to complete the game for each character that is in play. Whenever night falls a day will be removed from the counter. If no characters make it to the Crown of Command before the last nightfall, all players lose the game. If a player makes it to the Crown of command before the last night falls, all players win.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Blood Moon Werewolf</h2>The Blood Moon Werewolf sits on the Crown of Command.<br><br>If you\u2019re not a lycanthrope when you arrive at the Crown you must choose whether to attack using Strength or Craft.

The character who removes the Blood Moon Werewolf\u2019s last life wins. <br><br>If you are a lycanthrope, at the start of your turns you must choose one character in any Region and attack them. Your character remains on the Crown of Command. If you defeat the character, he is killed. If the character defeats you, they claim a reward as normal.
