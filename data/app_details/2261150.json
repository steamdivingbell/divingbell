{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ABOUT THIS GAME</h2><br>You are the Elven Spirit \u2013 a leader charged by the Elder Gods to Revive the wasteland and discover lost riches of old times, elven's last bastion against the Sunstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a city and resources, in Elven City Simulator you must not just build a prosperous settlement. You teach elfs for their own specializations, make decisions to set them on the path of Forest, High or Dark Elves.<br><br>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and absolute darkness will batter your population into stress. If your settlement should fall, then the Revive may end. You have to guide the elves through exciting missions. You will get to know the local flora, fauna and even different races.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2261150/extras/berry_house.gif?t=1738130197\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build your settlement</h2>Elves in the struggle to survive. Utilize each profession's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from resting and culinary needs to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture worked stone, brew jam, and bake buns to boost morale and comfort in the face of the oppressive hostility of the darkness, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Minotaur Chieftain who is looking for your enchanted trees?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2261150/extras/farmer_story.gif?t=1738130197\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Transform the world around</h2>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage settlements, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Druid Knowledge. Feel the pressure of the shadows while the Minotaur Chieftain demands constant resources while recurring afflictions pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your army to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes. How will you build each settlement to not just ensure the best life for the citizens, but for your fate as Elven Spirit as well?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2261150/extras/miner_work.gif?t=1738130197\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Best Old School Game Traditions</h2>With dozens of gameplay modifiers and three distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Elven Spirit.
