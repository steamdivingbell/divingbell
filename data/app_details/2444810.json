Dozens of quests can be discovered throughout the lands, and their order of completion is based on how the player explores. Some may wish to find the \u2018main\u2019 path as fast as possible. Others will simply venture off their own way and find new friends and quests. Every new adventure brings in new friends, growing the town and its facilities to create a bustling town that can be returned to at any time.  If you love traditional JRPGs that give you space to explore than this will be perfect for you to dive in to.\u201d<br>The Ugly Monster<br><br>\u201cUsually, RPG Maker games are at their best when they're doing something wacky, but other, very rare times, an RPGMaker game can be perfectly conventional, but excellently made.  This is one such game.  From the wide open exploration and minimal required plot events, VoltAge Genesis allows players to scrub through the content in the order they please.  AS you play, you'll find yourself stumbling across sidequest after sidequest in a rabbit hole that never seems to end.\u201d<br>5 / 5 \u2013 itch.io user<br><br>\u201cWhile the game can definitely be a little grind-heavy (though there's a hidden item you can find early on to alleviate some of that), the intentionality of some of the quests, ability to make choices, and level of gameplay variation across the game raises the whole experience a lot more than I expected when I first started out. What I thought I'd only play for a few hours ended up taking over 30+ hours as I went secret hunting and figuring out all the possible story variations, and I'm definitely looking forward to the continuation of the series. There's a lot of layers here that I hope others are able to get into!\u201d<br>5 / 5 \u2013 itch.io user<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2444810/ss_175c60977844e0fef4ec5e9165f1ddf7a38f93e7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1705704107","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2444810/ss_175c60977844e0fef4ec5e9165f1ddf7a38f93e7.600x338.jpg?t=1705704107"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2444810/ss_c2b4d740fc1e8544fc36363c752bdd4239294390.1920x1080.jpg?t=1705704107","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2444810/ss_c2b4d740fc1e8544fc36363c752bdd4239294390.600x338.jpg?t=1705704107"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2444810/ss_1e3fdc68200fc62699082da01c405f47c05f298f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1705704107","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2444810/ss_1e3fdc68200fc62699082da01c405f47c05f298f.600x338.jpg?t=1705704107"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2444810/ss_ae33ab50a0cda26c0fd84f81b659fdb188eb7ed6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1705704107","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2444810/ss_ae33ab50a0cda26c0fd84f81b659fdb188eb7ed6.600x338.jpg?t=1705704107"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2444810/ss_471ef4ec089cf1e416c2d54d5dd2e75abf530ca1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1705704107","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2444810/ss_471ef4ec089cf1e416c2d54d5dd2e75abf530ca1.600x338.jpg?t=1705704107"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2444810/ss_a617e638dfee36597d909c60808890942481f08e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1705704107","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2444810/ss_a617e638dfee36597d909c60808890942481f08e.600x338.jpg?t=1705704107"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2444810/ss_08c54be034d8e550a93baf7c2a3b2186580a050d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1705704107","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2444810/ss_08c54be034d8e550a93baf7c2a3b2186580a050d.600x338.jpg?t=1705704107"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2444810/ss_c231c434450c42d1ef71c96628b24f886fbc1404.1920x1080.jpg?t=1705704107","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2444810/ss_c231c434450c42d1ef71c96628b24f886fbc1404.600x338.jpg?t=1705704107"},{"id":8,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2444810/ss_526b760491263869c78ef80ad025a637f01720f1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1705704107","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2444810/ss_526b760491263869c78ef80ad025a637f01720f1.600x338.jpg?t=1705704107"},{"id":9,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2444810/ss_b6e8968494581f732450e13013da78370d1c5523.1920x1080.jpg?t=1705704107","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2444810/ss_b6e8968494581f732450e13013da78370d1c5523.600x338.jpg?t=1705704107"},{"id":10,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2444810/ss_a1516aee0c462aa53ae68f476cfe2cfebbbe0c7f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1705704107","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2444810/ss_a1516aee0c462aa53ae68f476cfe2cfebbbe0c7f.600x338.jpg?t=1705704107"}],"short_description":"Freely explore a deadly wasteland as you uncover a plot to awaken an ancient evil.","steam_appid":2444810,"support_info":{"email":"goldenfishent@gmail.com","url":""},"supported_languages":"English","type":"game","website":null}
