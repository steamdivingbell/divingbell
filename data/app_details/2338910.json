Guess correctly to continue, or game over if you are wrong too many times.<br><br>- A simulator where you create both armies and watch them battle.<br><br>- 72 different units, some with unique attacks such as spawning undead minions.<br><br>- From small to gigantic battles, and many difficulties to test your prediction powers.<br><br>- Gold betting mode, and a spell mode where each side gets a random spell.<br><br>- Complete challenges to earn more spectators.<br><br><strong>Please note:</strong> Behold Battle uses the same art as Mage and Monsters, but has a very different core gameplay loop. It is a much more simple and casual game, where you judge how strong one army will be against another. Or just play around in the sandbox mode. A lot of time and care have gone into creating many different variations of this simple idea of guessing who will win. I have strived to make Behold Battle as polished as I can, so hopefully for many it is an intuitive, unique and enjoyable game.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Peasant Man Spectator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2338910/bf358e517ecd687627c62a6baaf2813969d6b9a5.jpg"},{"name":"Peasant Woman Spectator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2338910/1f21510dd7be6694bc3e1c02179d62d420e1b8f7.jpg"},{"name":"Nobleman Spectator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2338910/da993c5ebe80620e4ce287cf7abd058279b1aa35.jpg"},{"name":"Princess Spectator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2338910/c4241b50da95c77fb5c9eb89eee1e4baad4e51e0.jpg"},{"name":"Prince Spectator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2338910/2d91c018dcfbd01d6d7dd132812f9dd15a297652.jpg"},{"name":"Queen Spectator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2338910/d67f4f454091462fb64d524d02910d558322898b.jpg"},{"name":"Madman Spectator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2338910/8e1cc0a37cc09ae632710ee63b8f0ebac1e458db.jpg"},{"name":"Ninja Spectator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2338910/c16c8f2d13217d5ca997ef19be94438ce19336b8.jpg"},{"name":"Baby Dragon Spectator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2338910/da8c10aa0c500a279f23c0425d4b8076df92d08d.jpg"},{"name":"Fish Boy Spectator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2338910/9213f4fffd5d03c7cfd84ee32fe415c7da29fffe.jpg"}],"total":20},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2338910/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726132094","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2338910/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1726132094","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2338910/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726132094","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2338910/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726132094","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2338910/extras/gifbb3.gif?t=1726132094\" /><br>Guess which army will win, and watch them fight for your amusement.
