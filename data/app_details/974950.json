{"about_the_game":"<strong>Take Down The Dino-Apocalypse</strong><br>Dinosaurs have time travelled from their destined extinction to the present day. As Proh - and her brain eating friend, Gon - it's up to you to restore Jollywood to it's former glory. Seek out the dinos, fight them, and survive as long as you can. Maybe even save the world? <br><br><strong>Too Many Dinos</strong><br>From Pterodactyls to Triceratops, the enemies you encounter are all unique to one another and will challenge you in different ways. But that's not all, the pro-player will come across even more hectic versions of the dinos. That's right, those big lizards get even BIGGER!<br><br><strong>Armed To The Teeth</strong><br>Proh might be up against some big enemies, but she's not so defenceless herself. Eight different weapons will drop as you defeat enemies and they each have something special and unique about them. Whether they harness the power time, infused with the energy of the sun or just a really sweet revolver, the weapons each have something unique and fun about them. <br><br><strong>Bring A Friend</strong><br>If you have a friend over and they're getting sick of watching you play DAMNOSAUR, why not invite them to join in? DAMNOSAUR has local co-op with a few tweaks made to make it an enjoyable, chaotic experience you can share with a friend. So bring on in Broh, the Proh of an alternate dimension who's just as dino-butt kicking as the pink-haired girl herself.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Extinction Level Event","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/974950/c1003f595c8e1d39f4a4891a5bbc972fa9ae7799.jpg"},{"name":"Raptor Exterminator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/974950/8e4792d45d5cc99240f53f5fb9b8a087c3e2dd52.jpg"},{"name":"T-Rex Exterminator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/974950/5dbac95daa08abd8162febf19704e2ca26de98b8.jpg"},{"name":"Triceratops Exterminator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/974950/3023950c0cca6dabbed6ab94e0a80f5137d271d6.jpg"},{"name":"Pterodactyl Exterminator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/974950/4b04b1bee0a2591ef2b65211297379a6e1f8ae3f.jpg"},{"name":"Lizardsaur Ecterminator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/974950/dfbf217dd139adaf6f0e15b383ca687d2a1ffc83.jpg"},{"name":"Break The Mil","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/974950/6a2288c8087b76c3842354803b6ff5d0908a3013.jpg"},{"name":"Easy Girl","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/974950/06b3455b7ea6a5ed406c0cc949628ad88ad86a98.jpg"},{"name":"YAAAAY!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/974950/7ad3509552b7474e709ca645872ba414c1e5c86e.jpg"},{"name":"Trojan Dino","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/974950/ced6c6e7059e781426c0cc1dc63ab6d2587c9e68.jpg"}],"total":18},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/974950/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1703904530","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/974950/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1703904530","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/974950/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1703904530","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/974950/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1703904530","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>Take Down The Dino-Apocalypse</strong><br>Dinosaurs have time travelled from their destined extinction to the present day.
