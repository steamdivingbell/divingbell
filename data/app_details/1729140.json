A long-term, mysterious company named Intersection claims to have the solution. By selecting a few individuals capable of perceiving and dealing with Distortions, they can keep the threat to a minimum. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PLAN YOUR STEPS</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1729140/extras/H2D_LS_Multiplayer.gif?t=1738953185\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Never go blindly into the darkness.
