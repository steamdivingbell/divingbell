You can try to survive as many waves as you can or you can also try to beat the map. You can also buy weapons, ammo, attachments or grenades in the shop. Every 5 waves you fight a boss. They have a lot of health so make sure to replenish your health and ammo! You can also try to get the Weapon Upgrade machine which will allow you to give your weapon special powers.<br><br><br><strong>Who is the Zombie? (PvP)</strong> <i>Requires a minimum of 3 players, but recommended for 6+ players</i><br>In this gamemode you have three roles:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Human<br></li><li>Zombie<br></li><li>Detective</li></ul><br>Everyone's roles are a secret except to themselves and in the case of the zombies, who are told who their teammates are.<br>The main objective for the zombies is to eliminate all of the humans and the detective, while the main objective of the humans and the detective is to eliminate all of the zombies. The zombies at first glance look like the humans but they can transform into their zombie form which gives them speed but at the cost of being able to shoot bullets which means they have to kill the others by walking through them. The zombie can also shoot bullets outside of his zombie form but if he damages a person he will lose health too, so zombies are incentivised to use their melee attack. All players can buy weapons and items in the shop, with money which can be earned by killing the correct people and/or winning. The zombies have exclusive items they can use to help them win. The detective does twice as much damage as the other players and also has exclusive items. Humans and detectives can shoot everyone they want but if a human kills a fellow human he will be kicked from the server. If a detective kills 2 fellow humans he will be kicked also. Players can identify body's by pressing Q to see what role the body belonged to.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2239930/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1671222640","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2239930/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1671222640","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2239930/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1671222640","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2239930/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1671222640","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"The game contains pixelated blood, bloody pixelated corpses, and depictions of drugs."},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Never Immortal</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2239930/extras/Screenshot_2022-12-13_01-51-16.png?t=1671222640\" /><br><br><strong>Never Immortal</strong> is a 2D multiplayer topdown shooter featuring two different exciting gamemodes: <i>Wave Survival</i> and <i>Who is the Zombie?</i><br><br><strong>Wave Survival (PvE)</strong> <i>Can be played alone or with friends</i><br>In the Wave Survival gamemode, you need to survive waves of zombies to avoid being eaten alive.
