{"about_the_game":"No Time to Explain Legacy is the original version of No Time to Explain developed by two dudes from their bedrooms back in 2011. It is what started tinyBuild. You should probably play the Remastered version which was built in Unity and has proper controller support and local multiplayer. You should play this if you want to see how it all started, and/or to express your support for indie devs. It was written in Flash, is very unreliable, and glitchy. But hey, it's legacy.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/681570?t=1667316300","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/681570/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1667316300","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/681570/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1667316300","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/681570/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1667316300","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"No Time to Explain Legacy is the original version of No Time to Explain developed by two dudes from their bedrooms back in 2011.
