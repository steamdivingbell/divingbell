Guide your party of characters through a dark web of intrigue and combat, where dragons, draconians and other unspeakable monstrosities dwell. Go with a brave heart - for you and your heroic adventurers are all that stand in the way of evil tyranny. <br><br><strong>Death Knights of Krynn </strong><br>Lord Soth has thrown down the gauntlet of challenge - a challenge that you are oath-bound to accept.
