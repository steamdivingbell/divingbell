{"about_the_game":"<i>It\u2019s Barbaric is an indie game being created by solo developer Tomaz Ravljen.

Visuals such as environment and characters may not be final. Combat system primarily consists of directional attacks and blocks controlled by the players mouse.<br><br><strong>Immersive-Strategy</strong><br>A unique combination of role play and strategy elements that places you in a fantasy world of Euroza. Playing a character in third-person, you can build settlements, combat enemies, explore the open world and conquer lands that bring your people prosperity.<br><br>This is a unique approach of utilising strategy components in a third-person action genre. Create your character, build a large army, construct a base as a command headquarters, expand your borders by taking other settlements and defend them from clans attempting to take back their land. You can disrupt food supplies (traveling convoys), take out scouts, and attack at night in stealth. You will need to make sure that convoys between your settlements have a clear path and no enemy territories nearby, bandits are enough of a threat.<br><br><strong>Large battles</strong><br>Recruit up to 100 soldiers and 10 officers for your army. Hundreds of Eurozians will die on open battlefields or in the woods. Use your army to take control of local farms, villages and strongholds, pillage settlements. Take prisoners or execute the survivors, but prisoners work for less food than your workers.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2288460/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731446624","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2288460/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1731446624","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2288460/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731446624","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2288460/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731446624","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<i>It\u2019s Barbaric is an indie game being created by solo developer Tomaz Ravljen.
