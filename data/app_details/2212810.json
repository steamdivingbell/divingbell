{"about_the_game":"A castle, pristine but strangely empty. Then, in the blink of an eye, ruined, crumbling, long since left to the ravages of time and the elements. A sealed door at its heart, and, from beyond it, a slowly spreading corruption that seems to fracture reality itself. A question, scrawled on the wall with red paint, or perhaps blood: <i>how did she know?</i><br><br>Crown of Thorns is an atmospheric adventure game made with RPGMaker. There is no combat, only exploration, puzzles, and a slowly unraveling mystery. Use portals to travel between pristine and ruined versions of the same castle. Explore interwoven areas, from the brand new library to the ancient catacombs. Study scripture, history, and lore to solve riddles and dispel magic barriers. Discover the long-lost secrets you need to confront what waits beyond the seal in the throne room.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2212810/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1672605684","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2212810/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1672605684","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2212810/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1672605684","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2212810/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1672605684","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A castle, pristine but strangely empty.
