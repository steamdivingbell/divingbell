You fulfill the wants and desires of overlords, creatures, and companies - the highest bidders. Your missions will take you to the farthest reaches, exploring wondrous places and meeting many characters. Some cower at your coming, but many eagerly embrace you. Some things are just as they seem, while others are smoke and mirrors. You can amass great influence as an OMEN, what mark on the world will you leave?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ongoing Development</h2>It is my plan to support and develop this game for years to come. This is a passion project and I absolutely love working on it. My aim is to continually add new end-game modes, new loot, new places, new enemies, and Quality of Life improvements. In its current state there are still some non-core aspects that are rough around the edges. <ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Many NPCs are not Voice acted yet.<br></li><li>Performance/Optimizations: Though I generally try and optimize as I go, there are still many aspects that can be optimized further so that the game will run better on a wider range of hardware.<br></li><li>Vfx clutter: There can be a lot of visual noise particularly with certain vfx. I'm working on toning them down and finding a happy medium between coolness and noise.<br></li><li>Placeholder assets: many of the games assets, such as environment objects, certain enemies, vfx, etc are placeholder and will eventually be replaced.<br></li><li>Character Customizer is rudimentary at the moment.

In AnR, there are no multiplicative scaling stats, only additive stats, many with built-in Diminishing Returns, and large AoE takes heavy augment investment, thus reducing character power in other areas. This should help remove the main culprits of forcing all builds down certain paths to be end-game viable.<br></li><li>No non-progression based combat systems. In other words there will never be combat mechanics that are not based on utilizing your build to defeat it. For example: no environment traps, no quests where you use some vehicle/turret to defeat enemies, no long-cooldown transformation forms (&quot;apocalyptic&quot; mode, etc). In AnR, your unique build means everything, and I don't want to gate/shoehorn your progress behind some arbitrary mechanic.<br></li><li>New content should never obsolete old content.
