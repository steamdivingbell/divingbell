{"about_the_game":"<strong>Munich Tram - the first Add-On for the LOTUS-Simulator!</strong><br>For the first time, we offer you the possibility to control a highly detailed tram model in a realistic simulation on real tracks!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Simulation At A Glance</h2>With the tram type R2.2b you can take a virtual tour through downtown Munich and explore the routes of the lines 27 and 28! Experience for yourself how it feels to take the tram through the Bavarian capital. The tram has a long tradition in Munich, the first tram line opened in 1876. But our simulation doesn't lead you that far back, because instead of the R2.2b there was still a horse-drawn tram on the way. About 120 years later, since the mid-1990s, the vehicles of the R2.2 series have dominated the Munich cityscape. The type R2.2b was comprehensively modernized from 2011 and is currently in use on Munich's rails in its redesign.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/374871/extras/Layout_Screen.png?t=1725053998\" /><br><br>And exactly with this vehicle in the well-known blue design of the MVG you can become tram drivers yourself!

The journey time for the 15 stops along the line is about 20 minutes. Past many famous sights, such as the Pinakotheken or the old B\u00f6rse, time passes in a flash. Line 27 is not only in use during the day, but also at night. Test your driving skills in night traffic as well!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/374871/extras/Liniengrafik_28.png?t=1725053998\" /><br>Route 28 also starts at Sendlinger Tor and runs via Karlsplatz and Karolinienplatz to Kurf\u00fcrstenplatz. There, line 28 branches off from the shared route with line 27 and continues to Scheidplatz. The journey time for the 12 stops along the line is about 16 minutes.<br>Try it out!

After around 15 years in service, the R2.2 one-way vehicles were extensively modernised and went into operation in 2011 as the R2.2b series. Both inside and outside, the modernised model is available in a new design - blue and white aluminium. New handrails, extended passenger information and swivelling sliding doors characterise the redesign.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/374871?t=1725053998","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/374871/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1725053998","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/374871/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725053998","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/374871/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725053998","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"VR Support","id":31},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Latest updates</h1><p><i>06.02.2020</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Official announcement</h2><br>Dear Community,<br><br>we would like to inform you that we unfortunately have to change the planned content and schedule for the product LOTUS-Simulator: Munich Tram.<br><br>As we are still waiting for essential functions and improvements in the LOTUS Rails module (bug fixes in the MapEditor, complete AI functionality, passengers, lighting, performance optimization and loading times in the MapEditor), we hereby inform you that we have to suspend the further development of the LOTUS Munich Add-On for an indefinite period of time.<br><br>In the sense of early access, as it is communicated by Oriolus Software GmbH for the LOTUS Simulator, we unfortunately cannot provide a concrete time schedule when we will integrate further functions. We regret this step very much, but unfortunately we have no influence and get no feedback when the mentioned functions are expected. <br><br>Since we are dependent on the LOTUS Simulator basic functions for the further development of the add-on, we have no other choice than to suspend further development indefinitely.
