{"about_the_game":"Dive into the enchanting world of Horathos, where magic meets the sword in an epic adventure of intertwined destinies. Horathos is more than just a GRPG (Grid Role-Playing Game); it's an immersive experience in a fantastical universe brimming with life and mystery. With an active turn-based combat system (ATB), every decision you make can change the course of destiny.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this fantastical world, two moons rise in the sky, symbolizing the two intertwined paths of a single destiny. You'll have the power to control up to four characters, but the choice of their class is entirely up to you. Will you be an indomitable warrior, ready to defend your allies while unleashing destructive fury upon your enemies? Or perhaps you prefer to master mysterious arcana as a magician, capable of manipulating the primal forces of magic to shape destiny itself?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArchers, with their deadly precision, can become agile scouts, capable of uncovering Horathos' darkest secrets, or formidable crossbowmen, where every shot is a promise of death to their foes. As for thieves, their agility and cunning open doors to acrobatics, allowing them to slip into the shadows to reach otherwise inaccessible places, or the path of the assassin, where every move is a deadly dance executed with lethal precision.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Horathos, each class offers a multitude of possibilities, and your team can be shaped according to your playstyle and preferences. Explore mysterious lands, confront legendary monsters, and uncover ancient secrets waiting to be revealed. The fate of Horathos rests in your hands. Are you ready to answer the call of adventure?","achievements":{"total":0},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2906390/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1718209837","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2906390/page.bg.jpg?t=1718209837","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2906390/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718209837","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2906390/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718209837","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Dive into the enchanting world of Horathos, where magic meets the sword in an epic adventure of intertwined destinies.
