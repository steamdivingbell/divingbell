{"about_the_game":"Breathless is an immersive virtual reality train ride through a dystopian landscape.  At it's core, Breathless is a music video created by electronic artist Croom featuring the vocal work of Berlin based experimental artist, Audriana Acu\u00f1a. Anchoring it is the masterful mixing work of Dylan Cameron (S U R V I V E, Troller), with his knack for bringing out exquisite and impactful bass without cluttering the haunting vocals and masterer Jess Labrador (Chasms). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCroom worked with 3d environmental artists from around the world to help bring his vision to life.  Hasan Zeki G\u00f6\u011febakan from Istanbul, Turkey was the lead developer. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a short VR music video experience, not a game.  Users can view 360 degree angles, listening to the original song, while sitting stationary on a simulated train ride.   The Oculus 2 controls only the exit, pause, and start functions. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis VR experience requires an Oculus 2 headset, Windows 10,  and an Oculus Link connection enabled.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1847220/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1652419806","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1847220/page.bg.jpg?t=1652419806","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1847220/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1652419806","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1847220/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1652419806","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Breathless is an immersive virtual reality train ride through a dystopian landscape.
