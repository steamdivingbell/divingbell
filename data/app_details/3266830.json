Yet after recruiting local allies and besieging living fortresses, they discover their foe has fled to an unfamiliar realm: the Plane of Wood. The PCs pursue, arriving in an elemental town that is all too familiar with the Wildwood Lodge\u2019s trickery. The PCs must earn the inhabitants\u2019 trust and investigate their foe\u2019s final gambit before giving chase into a blighted wilderness and averting an invasion that could devastate the Verduran Forest.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Shepherd of Decay is a wilderness-themed Pathfinder adventure for four 11th-level characters. The adventure concludes the Wardens of Wildwood Adventure Path, a three-part monthly campaign in which a group of adventurers navigate a tricky balance between idyllic wilderness, a hungry nation, and primal forces beyond the natural world. This volume also includes a look at how to continue the campaign, a gazetteer of a settlement on the Plane of Wood, several new magical items, and new monstrous threats!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>This is not a PDF or accessible outside of Fantasy Grounds.
