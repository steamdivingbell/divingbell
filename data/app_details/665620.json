{"about_the_game":"Imagine you're having a good time. You're on a picnic, or play billiard with your best friend, or maybe prepare for pool party - cold beer, hot water - amazing, right?<br><br>It was. Until your home town has been invaded by the most creepy aliens. They took control over your friends. And the worst thing - you can't help them. You can only fight and win this battle! <br><br>Zombie Hobby is the best playable way for you to train your skills, to be prepared for zombie invasion. Wherever you happen to be while it's coming. Guitar, billiard balls, golden bars - everything is a weapon if you know how to use it. Become a champion and kill as many low-poly zombies as you can! <br><br>Yes-yes! It's been days and you're a pro-zombie-killer. You can kill the zombie and hit a home run with just one hit! If you are - well we have a way for you. Try our night mode. Turn off the light and try to kill at least one zombie with just the light of your little flashlight.
