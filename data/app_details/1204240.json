Will you rule or be ruled?<br><br>- JRPG meets western RPG with 30+ hrs of gameplay!<br>- Homestead mode: Farming/Dating simulator (Marry and have children)!<br>- Difficulty settings: story, normal, hard, and includes a hard core mode perma-death.<br>- Custom time/weather/light/day-night cycle that affect gameplay.<br>- Alignment system (Nefarious deeds - pick pocketing, lock picking, sandman kills, etc)<br>- Professional voice acting (You can turn on or off at anytime!)<br>- Recruit characters to populate and defend your village (25+ characters).<br>- Story altering game mechanics like perception and persuasion.<br>- An Infinite dungeon to explore, full of challenges and epic loot!<br>- Mounts that you raise and breed in Homestead.<br>- STEAM Achievements!<br>- Tons of secrets and easter eggs (And I mean tons, many tied to achievements)!<br>- Includes a STAR SHIFT game cross over (An epic quest line - Link Below)<br>- Continually updated and supported!
