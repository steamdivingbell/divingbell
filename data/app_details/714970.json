{"about_the_game":"A combination of Dante\u2019s Inferno, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Fight Club, Metonymy follows Colin as he travels through the indoctrinated utopia of Sagacity on a quest to the vile and viscus center of the world known only as The Blood. He is joined by a few companions he meets along the way and with their help fights the oppressive Theocratic Choir and the insane and depraved Disease in an effort to reclaim his life before it\u2019s too late.  <br><br>Key Game Features<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Cinematic Adventure:</strong> Players will experience a unique and engaging story that takes advantage of the foundations of interactive entertainment and film in order to bring its narrative and world to life unlike other games in its genre. </li><li><strong>Interactive World:</strong> Players will be able to explore set locations and unravel the mysteries of Sagacity via delving into the dark cracks of its environments or talking to its inhabitants. The player will be rewarded with a clearer understanding of the overarching narrative and its unique characters. </li><li>Multiple Perspectives: While the story centers around Colin, players will be given unique insight into other inhabitants of the world of sagacity.
