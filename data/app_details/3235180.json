{"about_the_game":"<strong>&quot;Bring back the lost moments&quot;</strong><br><br><strong>STORY</strong><br>In the 1980s, an unknown corporation develops groundbreaking technology, seemingly impossible for the era. This technology enables the restoration of memories in individuals who are in tragic states, completely eliminating symptoms of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, or other memory disorders. The corporation is fully funded by the government. They advertise with numerous successful studies over the years. Their reputation is mainly owed to misinformation among people. At that time, this is very possible because the internet or television are not well developed. Their advertising relies on displaying many opinions of families or individuals who managed to restore memory and cure memory disorders. The problem is that it is arranged in a very good way. The government knows everything about it, but there is a lot of corruption in the world, which the corporation and the government exploit and reduce their wealth. The therapy itself costs $40,000 monthly. The corporation in its premium packages for $70,000 per month includes and provides faster therapy and better care for the subject.<br><br>Nonetheless, the intentions of the corporation and the government are good, but in the initial stages of technology development, they exploit the misfortune of the subjects' families. The machine in later stages of development is supposed to truly restore memory, but because such technology is simply impossible to achieve at that time, the government and the corporation take advantage of this.<br><br>The machine is supposed to work in such a way that it adjusts its operation based on the latest living synapses and neurons.
