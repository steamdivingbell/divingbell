Once you have found all the memory shards you are free to explore the next area.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story mode</h2>You start in the middle of the ocean as this is where life itself started.<br><br>You are a little flying spirit which moves continuously forward and is free to fly wherever you want. <br><br>After you have played around a little and enjoyed the sensation of flying you start to discover the nearby areas and hidden secrets. You fly towards a giant kraken that seemingly has no interest in you. <br><br>Once you come closer you see a bright shining memory shard right in front of you. <br><br>The memory shards are hidden all over the different worlds and contain memories and information about the different worlds and the path into the next area. You fly towards the shard and collect it. <br><br>Once you have found a certain amount of memory shards you will be able to remember the right path and can enter the next area - the story continues. On your journey you will discover worlds that represent different stages of the human evolution as well as a long-forgotten land with beautiful environments, and you will be able to enjoy the feeling of flying while exploring a whole world filled with beauty and little secrets. Intrigued, you move forward and with every new level the humans evolve a little more.
