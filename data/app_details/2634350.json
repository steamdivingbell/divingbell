{"about_the_game":"Has your kid ever asked you why they can't play games like <i>Red Dead Redemption</i> because they want to be a cowboy or cowgirl too?  Well, mine have.  Instead of saying they need to wait till they get older I have built this game instead.  <i>That Cowgirl life</i> was named by my daughter because, as she said, &quot;there are no cowgirl games and she wants one&quot;.<br><br>With that in mind, prepare to enter a low-poly world where you will &quot;initially&quot; be playing as a really cool cowgirl named Victoria.  She is awesome and she loves her family and everyone on the island she lives on.  Prepare for an adventure that will take place over six years and will take you to places you never imagined a cowgirl could go.<br><br>You'll be able to ride horses, make camp, build houses and go on adventures.  In the story there are quests for your character that will have you taking pictures of local wildlife, buying and selling supplies at the local store and building friendships with the other people that inhabit the area you live in.<br><br>Once you are ready, you will be given a task to begin the search for your long lost mother.  The trip will be perilous and we can't promise it will have the ending you would hope for, but it will be an adventure.<br><br>While a player can enter a survival mode where they can hunt and harvest animals, there will be no gore.  Plus, if that is not your cup of tea, you can instead choose a path of planting and harvesting crops or foraging for berries.<br><br><i>That Cowgirl Life</i> is a game that takes place in the Rook Games Universe.  This means that it can and will relate to our other games, the most imminent of which is <i>UNC: Pathfinder</i>.  The big difference between these two games is that this one &quot;<i>That Cowgirl Life</i>&quot; is for everyone.  There will be no swearing, gore, nudity or anything that would make this game not suitable for children.<br><br>While new games that add to the story of <i>UNC: Pathfinder</i> will be added once a year, <i>That Cowgirl Life</i> will be updated at least once a quarter for the next six years.  There is great music planned for the game as well as a very interesting and emotional story that you and/or your children can embark upon that will teach lessons in friendship, compromise and introduce them to large ideas of belief and purpose.<br><br>Built primarily for VR, this game will release on that platform first and will be followed by a standard &quot;flat screen&quot; version.  This game will also be used for &quot;Augmented Reality Games&quot; that are run by Rook Gaming LLC.  Over time there will be many secrets and interesting characters to discover and interact with.  We hope you and your kids will join us on what is quickly becoming a passion project for our team!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2634350/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1706754045","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2634350/page.bg.jpg?t=1706754045","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2634350/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1706754045","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2634350/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1706754045","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Has your kid ever asked you why they can't play games like <i>Red Dead Redemption</i> because they want to be a cowboy or cowgirl too?
