{"about_the_game":"Relive the history of the German omnibuses on your computer at home and explore the technology of the Citybus O305. Do not only drive a bus with automatic transmission, but be the first in an OMSI add-on to control a bus with manual transmission in the busy city traffic. Use the citybus on line 92 in Spandau or explore the fictional Neuendorf route including its five bus lines. This is where you can prove that you are not limited to suburban traffic but you are also capable of handling city traffic.<br><br><strong>MB E2H84 </strong>\u2013 This is the Berlin version of the O305 from 1984.
