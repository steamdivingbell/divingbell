{"about_the_game":"Welcome to the world of Mariposa and the Galaxy Man, a story-rich stylized 3D platformer set in a galaxy with colorful planets based on different decades of the 1900s. Save space creatures, platform precarious places, solve physics-based puzzles, and interact with fun characters as you zoom across the galaxy to save a man made of stars.<br><br>Set in a retro-futuristic sci-fi fantasy world, Mariposa and the Galaxy Man stars Mariposa Connors, a half-human, half-alien girl who spends  her days helping her Aunt Dawn at a space animal rescue center. However, one night a mysterious giant star-wolf crashes into the moon while bleeding stars. Mariposa helps to patch him up and he turns into a man made of stars--a living galaxy that needs Mariposa\u2019s help to escape the star-eating monsters and energy corporations pursuing him. Thus, our journey to the center of the Galaxy begins!<br><br>Over the past year, our team has put together an approximately 2 hour demo encapsulating the first chapter of the game, the prologue of the story set on the 70s inspired planet of Fluttika. This demo can be played right now here on Steam! <br>In the demo, Mariposa has a large hub world in the form of the animal rehabilitation center. This large open area will contain collectibles, story bits, interactive animals, and platforming challenges. Within this hub world are four mini-levels to complete, which are represented by big domes in the open area. The domes act as controlled environments for the rehabilitating animals.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1892480/extras/MariSteamDescGameplayHeader.png?t=1645207735\" /><br><br>Gameplay consists of platforming, exploration, helping alien creatures, conversing with characters, and collecting, while also implementing Mariposa\u2019s 0G abilities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Platforming-</h2>Mariposa can jump, double jump, sprint, dash in the air, and float! Like all Fluttikans, Mari can use the Nectra that flows through her body to activate a 0G state. This will continue her into whatever direction and speed she was at when pressed. You can use 0G to reach new heights and speed forward! Nectra can also be used to make objects and enemies float, which ties into the combat system.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combat-</h2>Combat is mostly puzzle-centered. Mariposa must shoot zero-gravity liquid at attackers. Once they are sufficiently coated they are put in a 0-g state and are able to be manipulated by Mariposa. <br><br>The goal of combat is to get the enemy trapped or somehow incapacitated using your 0-g abilities. Often, there will be some kind of cage or trap to get them into.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Exploration-</h2>Each world will have an open HUB area to explore from which the smaller, instanced levels will branch from, similar to Spyro\u2019s system. These areas will contain secondary quests, collectibles to find, and characters to interact with.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Character Conversation-</h2>Talking with characters is an important element of the game. Listening to them and helping them with their issues will unlock additional rewards and dialogue.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Collecting-</h2>There are various types of collectibles for Mari to find! These include Flutterstars, Fabric, Thread, and Patterns.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Spaceship Hub</h2><br>In the main game, Mariposa\u2019s hub will be her spaceship van in which she travels the universe. She can chat with characters, play with/take care of pets, and select destinations from this area. She can also use supplies she\u2019s collected to craft custom clothing and hairstyles.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1892480/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1645207735","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1892480/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1645207735","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1892480/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1645207735","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1892480/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1645207735","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to the world of Mariposa and the Galaxy Man, a story-rich stylized 3D platformer set in a galaxy with colorful planets based on different decades of the 1900s.
