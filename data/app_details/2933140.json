{"about_the_game":"On a rainy and stormy night the main character Cyrus wakes up in a cave. He doesn't remember anything. At least a cross tells him his name. He is taken in by a nearby village of the Mali tribe. Time passes as one day a malicious red fog covers the whole village, forcing Cyrus and his friend Vera to flee. Thus is the start of a long journey through a medieval world where Cyrus and his comrades nowhere can feel save nor at home. The cleavage between humans and creatures can be felt in every village the group is about to visit. Safe zones are few and far between. Cyrus and his friends want to figure out the meaning of the malicious red fog. The closer they come to the conclusion the more Cyrus has dreams about his past, revealing a dramatic story.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDive into a handdrawn cruel medieval world of a classical JRPG. The story is rather gloomy but has individually scattered funny moments. Discover a turn based battle system where the time stops for action selection. However the player can also decide to let it continue. For certain skills the timing is crucial and can result in extra damage or other special effects. Discover further an equipment skill learning system where different items can bear different skills. By practicing against monsters you can learn those skills permanently. Additionaly passive skills give you freedom for customization.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2933140/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1717747733","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2933140/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1717747733","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2933140/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1717747733","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2933140/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1717747733","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"On a rainy and stormy night the main character Cyrus wakes up in a cave.
