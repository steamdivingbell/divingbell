{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Clean that world is a cute, not evil VR shooter.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your task is to cleanse the planet with two suns from germs and worms. They are afraid of water, and you just have everything you need - water pistols and shotguns, and a bucket with a mop will also work for this task. As a last resort, you can use stones.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game has 10 levels. Some are quite simple, while others are like a labyrinth in which you can get lost. At first, microbes are not very dangerous, and you can easily deal with them, but then more evil species appear that can not only bite, but also spit poison. And at the last level a surprise awaits you. Perhaps these creatures are not as simple as they seem.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Destroying all enemies, of course, is not necessary in order to survive this expedition. You can try to simply go through all the levels, but your real task is precisely cleaning. So try to find and pour water on them all. Even those that are hiding from you, and perhaps have not even hatched yet. We will record your successes in a table - a reward is paid for each microbe or worm.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3199570/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731934341","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3199570/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1731934341","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3199570/bf7552acd0a171b4da74aec4ba041a5fd3f114c6/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731934341","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3199570/bf7552acd0a171b4da74aec4ba041a5fd3f114c6/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731934341","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Clean that world is a cute, not evil VR shooter.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your task is to cleanse the planet with two suns from germs and worms.
