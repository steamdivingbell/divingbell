{"about_the_game":"<strong>Neonis</strong> is a highly action packed top-down shooter in which you try to survives hordes of enemies. The game consists out of several gamemodes, such as: <strong>Classic</strong>, <strong>Chaos</strong>, <strong>Dodge </strong> and <strong>Flood</strong>. Each gamemode is explained below. Pick up buffs and use them to their full potential in order to survive. <br><br>You'll be armed with two personal abilities: The Rocket Launcher and the Dash ability. Killing enemies with each of the respectable abilites will grant bonus point. Dash is also really handy to get out of sticky situations.<br><br>Neonis has a high replayability as you try to keep beating your own personal highscore.<br><br>Neonis now also has a new <strong>Tower Defense</strong> mode!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1126680/extras/ClassicHeader.png?t=1723748053\" /><br><strong>Classic </strong>is a gamemode in which you start off facing the basic enemies and the more you progress and the more score you get, the harder it gets. Different kind of enemies start spawning the more you progress, enemies start spawning faster, but also buffs start spawning faster. You basically start off really slow, and end in complete chaos, if you manage to reach the final &quot;level&quot;. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1126680/extras/ChaosHeader.png?t=1723748053\" /><br><strong>Chaos </strong>is a gamemode where you fight enemies in complete chaos. From the start you'll see every sort of enemy spawning, at a very high rate. Buffs will spawn incredibly fast as you are going to need them. <strong>Chaos </strong>is basically the last level from the <strong>Classic</strong> gamemode. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1126680/extras/DodgeHeader.png?t=1723748053\" /><br><strong>Dodge</strong> is a gamemode in which you are unable to shoot. You are also unable to use any abilities. You won't get any help from buffs either. The main purpose of the gamemode is to dodge. Enemies will spawn around you and the game will progessively get harder. Enemies explode after a certain amount of time. Enemies exploding will grant you points.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1126680/extras/FloodHeader.png?t=1723748053\" /><br><strong>Flood</strong> is a gamemode in which you will only face the basic circular enemies. Here you start off slowly as well, but the playfield will flood really quickly. Make sure you defeat your enemies fast enough or else you'll lose rather fast. <strong>Flood</strong> is really satisfying if you really enjoy killing large numbers of monsters in a short amount of time.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Play Classic","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1126680/794cd313f01154cf5440bb2edf755d7928db28af.jpg"},{"name":"Classic Rookie","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1126680/8bdfb97d468f97570d3e23b7d283e110546fe714.jpg"},{"name":"Classic Beginner","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1126680/3c395f5240c0f7ab57608446460189b2d64eb0e9.jpg"},{"name":"Classic Skilled","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1126680/db95a55768086057c0f3fb241d9cdee02adfc22c.jpg"},{"name":"Classic Intermediate","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1126680/f09aded9e846088314d8e69b7d6b2e9da6dd0878.jpg"},{"name":"Classic Advanced","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1126680/fd07af53b373642ed0860fe065f9d016cf8e8c12.jpg"},{"name":"Classic Expert","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1126680/76aff9c81a4c203f2b301c6371334569a1c8abf6.jpg"},{"name":"Play Chaos","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1126680/a608073b970d721bd13b0077e1664551eb202a49.jpg"},{"name":"Chaos Rookie","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1126680/48bacb6e35018457da45c467dc45a9c9951758d8.jpg"},{"name":"Chaos Beginner","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1126680/a5ee817fc3b478c219660733889a921baec13b89.jpg"}],"total":35},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1126680/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1723748053","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1126680/page.bg.jpg?t=1723748053","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1126680/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1723748053","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1126680/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1723748053","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Neonis</strong> is a highly action packed top-down shooter in which you try to survives hordes of enemies.
