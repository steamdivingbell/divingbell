{"about_the_game":"The game revolves around a virus that must navigate through various challenges. It involves infecting cells, battling antibodies, destroying white blood cells, and more. The gameplay is quite engaging as players need to consider the behavior of each enemy and the mechanics of different puzzles. Currently, there are three types of puzzles available:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPulmonary Puzzles: In these levels, the virus explores the intricate network of the lungs. It must navigate through the branching airways, fight off antibodies, destroy white blood cells, and overcome various obstacles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCellular Puzzles: Here, the virus utilizes its unique abilities, such as inertia and jumping, to reach the cell nucleus. It's like a viral &quot;parkour&quot; challenge, requiring precise movements and timing to successfully replicate within the cell.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNuclear Puzzles: This puzzle type takes place within the nucleus, resembling a complex maze. The virus must navigate through the convoluted paths, avoiding contact with the walls, to reach the chromatin and achieve its objective.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThroughout the game, players will encounter different types of enemies, each with its own behavior and challenges. Additionally, there is an epic boss battle awaiting players at level 7, providing an exciting climax to the game's progression.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe are thrilled to share this unique arcade-style game with players and hope they enjoy the thrilling experience of being a virus navigating and infecting cells, completing puzzles, and collecting valuable RNA points.
