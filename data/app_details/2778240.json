{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i><strong>Moves Of The Diamond Hand</strong></i> is a first-person narrative RPG. It's set to the backdrop of a surreal dystopian jazz-drenched city. It builds on the gameplay of Cosmo D\u2019s previous game, the award-winning <i><strong>Betrayal At Club Low</strong></i>. At the same time, it returns to the first-person perspective of Cosmo D\u2019s previous games. Its dice-driven gameplay is deeper, the plot is richer and the scope is grander than ever.\u00a0 This demo represents the first of four chapters in the Moves Of The Diamond Hand tale.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2778240/extras/the_setup.png?t=1740153977\" /></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A new day dawns in Off-Peak City.

You\u2019ve arrived on the scene, ready to become a part of it and mint your destiny. But Circus X isn\u2019t hiring, and there\u2019s plenty of people who want a piece of the Circus X magic (and money). To become part of this elite crew, you\u2019ll need to figure out a way in. Sure, you have some leads, but you also have trouble.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This trouble arrives during the strangest Mayoral election in the city\u2019s history. One of the candidates isn\u2019t even a real person, he\u2019s the clone of a Mayor from a hundred years ago! The company that created him is betting on his success, but two rival candidates plan to stop him at all costs. To add to all this, someone called The Diamond Hand is playing all the sides against one another. No one knows who this Diamond Hand is or why they're causing trouble. But somehow you become enmeshed in this drama. Are you a potential collaborator, or a pawn in the Diamond Hand's game? Sure, you may be new to the neighborhood, but the Diamond Hand underestimates you.
