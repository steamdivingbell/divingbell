{"about_the_game":"Robo Do It is a funny game (made in M\u00e9xico) to learn logic programming without writing code by building scripts to program robots in each level. The goal is to find the best solution to create an algorithm that takes these robots into victory capsules.<br><br>In this videogame, the player is introduced into a 3d world filled with levels where the main objective is to help one or more robots to reach the capsules by assigning commands or actions (such as to forward, to turn, to jump, and others) that are logically programmable and iconographic, the latter to facilitate the understanding and learning of the player. On the other hand, with the passage of levels, the difficulty of the game increases, challenging the player with new challenges that encompass the sequential, repetitive and conditional control structures of programming in general, as well as inciting the player to apply the reuse and reduction of commands that are equivalent to the real programming code.<br><br>Robo Do It have two game modes, the game arcade and the level editor.
