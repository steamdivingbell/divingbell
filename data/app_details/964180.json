{"about_the_game":"Late'O'Clock is a capstone school project that we worked on for 6 months. NailGun Studios wanted to make a comedy-like stealth game that had an ever-changing and dangerous work environment. This vision allowed us to create a game based in an office, but throw unexpected obstacles at the player. The game has 15 levels in total with a lot of collectibles that give a little lore to our small world. This was our first team project for this long so it was a new experience for all of us. We wanted our game to be on a public platform for free so we could look back on it as we pursue our careers, and for you, the player, to enjoy. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you for taking the time to read this and we hope you enjoy playing our game as much as we did making it.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/964180/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1541757757","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/964180/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1541757757","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/964180/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1541757757","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/964180/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1541757757","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Late'O'Clock is a capstone school project that we worked on for 6 months.
