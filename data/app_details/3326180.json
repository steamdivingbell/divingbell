Explore the area to find multiple challenges. Completing these would reduce the bot presence and reward you with Credits and Schematics. Use these to upgrade your bot. Destroying bots increases the alert level and gives you access to high-level crates that have powerful weapons. Be wary; the bots will also double down on their efforts to stop you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Experience RogueLite features</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each time your bot gets destroyed, the alert level is reset, and it loses all the weapons and any items bought through credits. It will, however, retain the Schematics and core upgrades. Use these to make your bot more powerful each run. Weapons in crates have random traits, making them unique in each playthrough.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Note:</strong> This demo includes a static level that does not have random encounters or level changes on each run.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3326180/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730748419","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3326180/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1730748419","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3326180/19642a62ef8cb910b5e2fbf44f6118453f9c57ed/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730748419","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3326180/19642a62ef8cb910b5e2fbf44f6118453f9c57ed/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730748419","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3326180/extras/StoreDescHeader.png?t=1730748419\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">You control a Cyber Seeker.</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Cyber Seekers are bots used to complete high-risk bounties.
