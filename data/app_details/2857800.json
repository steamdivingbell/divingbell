It is written in modern C and takes a unique approach compared to other emulators for this system. This core focuses on providing a user experience similar to a traditional home console, both by defaulting to home console mode and the use of single-file game files. However, despite this focus, it also maintains full support for playing games in arcade form.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2857800/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1709063206","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2857800/page.bg.jpg?t=1709063206","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2857800/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1709063206","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2857800/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1709063206","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play on Phone","id":41},{"description":"Remote Play on Tablet","id":42},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2857800/extras/geolith256.png?t=1709063206\" /><br>Geolith is a highly accurate core for a popular console/arcade system released in the early 1990s, and surviving into the mid 2000s.
