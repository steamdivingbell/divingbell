The game includes depictions of psychedelic experiences, which can involve intense visual and auditory effects, themes of altered consciousness, and surreal or unsettling imagery. There are also themes of introspection that touch on mental health and existential questions. While the game does not include explicit sexual content or graphic violence, some scenes may evoke feelings of disorientation, fear, or anxiety, particularly during darker segments of the player's journey.
