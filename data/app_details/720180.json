This film is minimalistic in it's approach and focuses on the anxious Cambodia population as they try and avoid the war that has come to their backyard. It is nice seeing Cambodian made films on Amazon and Jack Ro includes some extra content that also very good. Support independent film makers and the Cambodian film industry by checking out this sweet little movie\u201d<br>5 \u2013 Amazon Viewer<br><br>\u201c&quot;A strong, interesting story with good characters and excellent acting, and the supernatural element was bizarre but just right for the story&quot;\u201d<br>5 \u2013 Highway 61 Film Festival<br><br>\u201cHaving also shot a movie in SE Asia myself, I really appreciate what the filmmakers accomplished in a developing country on an indie budget. They did some interesting things to recreate the atmosphere of war-torn 1970s Cambodia, using costumes, period props, good casting, and post effects. The point of what they accomplished is in the journey of the characters, underlining the theme of how war always hurts the innocent and powerless civilians the most. I also quite enjoyed the 'making of' featurette after the movie, narrated by the filmmaker on how they achieved certain effects and atmosphere as well as a taste of what it's like working in Cambodia. Highly recommended for those interested in film fare outside the usual western lens of the world.\u201d<br>5 \u2013 Amazon Viewer<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/720180/ss_1630dd1d07fc12ebf49ca10bcb8209b2974fe178.1920x1080.jpg?t=1552350342","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/720180/ss_1630dd1d07fc12ebf49ca10bcb8209b2974fe178.600x338.jpg?t=1552350342"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/720180/ss_54cb12cdd88887df05334d07b5add12c192f9630.1920x1080.jpg?t=1552350342","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/720180/ss_54cb12cdd88887df05334d07b5add12c192f9630.600x338.jpg?t=1552350342"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/720180/ss_fea0c050513fdf72b7c71593dd6990e11e38eba5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1552350342","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/720180/ss_fea0c050513fdf72b7c71593dd6990e11e38eba5.600x338.jpg?t=1552350342"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/720180/ss_80251bd71f45af78875d237523fa755deb26f173.1920x1080.jpg?t=1552350342","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/720180/ss_80251bd71f45af78875d237523fa755deb26f173.600x338.jpg?t=1552350342"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/720180/ss_d02d580c10e92fd38cc97c9345ef4834d137e24b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1552350342","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/720180/ss_d02d580c10e92fd38cc97c9345ef4834d137e24b.600x338.jpg?t=1552350342"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/720180/ss_de1a5d19e3c8c45b39465e628531f58efc441346.1920x1080.jpg?t=1552350342","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/720180/ss_de1a5d19e3c8c45b39465e628531f58efc441346.600x338.jpg?t=1552350342"}],"short_description":"(ENGLISH ON-SCREEN SUBTITLES &amp; Local Language) The first ever movie about this mysterious time in Vietnam War history!
