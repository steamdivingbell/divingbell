{"about_the_game":"Its everyone's favorite subject in school: Latin. Even though the usefulness of this language and subject is often being debated, for many students it is the most loved subject in school, especially if the teacher himself doesn't even like it and always uses dark humor to make the subject a little bit more interesting.
