{"about_the_game":"Do you remember your aunt from fifteen years ago, your aunt fussing in the kitchen during the early morning to prepare the pastries for the first customers? The nostalgia of baked delectables, the scent of aged wood, and the compassionate atmosphere of family all caused your heart to twinge. Suddenly, your old house was tragically abandoned, and the glory of the former bakery was only but a distant memory that was lost in the past. After so many years, could you revive the family business and return home, accepting the challenge?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this absorbing adventure, you can provide your fellow neighbors with luscious, lip-smacking cakes, pies, and rolls; you can engage in different handicrafts, participate in the town's fests and fairs, delight in the hymns of nature, contemplate about your town's historical streets, intriguingly interact with those around you, and explore the lore together with Kevin!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis video-game creation has both a colorful gameplay with endless possibilities and a captivating plot. A story of a timeless town is told through its vivid residents, including the protagonist Kevin and his ancestors. Free will acts as a guardian: decisions and freedom are bestowed upon you with the bittersweet responsibility of further consequences. You are allowed to decide for yourself\u2014from a certain day's tasks to the revelation of unseen opportunities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSometimes, one can face barriers with which they cannot cope. Sometimes, one makes inevitable, daunting mistakes and makes the wrong decisions. Sometimes, the world does not turn out to be as open and tender as one had wondered in their childhood of purity. Instead, one can be met with the unmerciful, shattering apathy of reality. Even so, you have the spirit to keep your welcoming heart warm to let love spread and to live life to the fullest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is not just a simple bakery simulator: it's a story about a young man whose fate was to resume family traditions of baking and about a man who can reject these traditions\u2014but ... does he want to? Your life is devised by your habits, the choices that function as the fragments to your very being.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1877480/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1697863931","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1877480/page.bg.jpg?t=1697863931","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1877480/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1697863931","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1877480/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1697863931","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Do you remember your aunt from fifteen years ago, your aunt fussing in the kitchen during the early morning to prepare the pastries for the first customers?
