{"about_the_game":"Operation Defensive is a tower defense game but instead of monsters following a track, it's a player. So instead of watching enemies follow a track for no reason, watch them attack a player instead. But dont just stand there--fight back with towers! Towers dont really aim so much, so it's your job to lead enemies into your traps!<br />\r\nYou can play multiple different themes, all with unique different enemies and tower skins, and some with bosses.<br />\r\nIf you ever feel like the game is too difficult, there are settings for extra starting cash and a heal at the end of each round. Just know that these help settings don't work on bosses. And remember to have fun :D","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2001870/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1672871969","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2001870/page.bg.jpg?t=1672871969","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2001870/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1672871969","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2001870/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1672871969","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Operation Defensive is a tower defense game but instead of monsters following a track, it's a player.
