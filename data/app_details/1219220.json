It was reported that someone performed Voodoo rituals inside the new house which caused the death of animals that were kept in the old barn. John, after hearing about the incident, decided to investigate both the house and the old barn as he was planning to shift to Texas permanently. Something unexpected happened which turned him into a believer of the ghosts and spirits. As soon as he set his foot inside the house, he came to realize that it was really haunted.
