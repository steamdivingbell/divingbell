{"about_the_game":"Why settle for trick OR treat when you can have the best of both worlds? Meet the Halloweenies... the newest gruesome group of six new cards for Squirmish: The Videogame of Brawling Beasties! Meet Spooksie, Slenderfella, the Unsmellable Man... and three more foul fiends! They are full of crazy tricks with their all-new special abilities... and their group ability is full of treats! Once the Halloweenies are activated, you get to roll a die on your turn for each Halloweenie you control. If you roll under the number of Halloweenies in play, you get to draw a card! It's like getting your plastic pumpkin filled to the brim with candy every time you play, except it won't make you vomit!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3165560/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727187602","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3165560/page.bg.jpg?t=1727187602","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3165560/26253afe7c6ba8e79b5b15c0a178f86892e82664/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727187602","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3165560/26253afe7c6ba8e79b5b15c0a178f86892e82664/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727187602","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Why settle for trick OR treat when you can have the best of both worlds?
