{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Caduceus Quest</i> is a single-player, role-playing game in which you engage with the scientific method to solve a medical case that has affected the community. You play as Simone: a Black college student who is home for the summer.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Simone's hometown is in the grip of a mysterious new illness which is spreading \u2014 and even seems to be impacting her grandmother. Simone takes on additional responsibilities in the quest to identify the mysterious illness and contain it. As Simone begins to grasp the scope and nature of the threat, she meets new expert companions that represent a wide variety of STEM and health professionals from diverse backgrounds. Over the course of playing, each of the STEM and health professionals Simone encounters provides the player with specific and accurate information about the aptitudes, education, and professional competencies that various STEM and health careers require. The game takes place in a variety of locations, including the hospital, town hall, and local park.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Multiple mini-games are embedded throughout the experience, allowing the player to practice science skills including science communication and keyword definitions. The primary mini-game is a turn-based card game in which your opponents' characteristics suggest optimal strategies. A secondary mini-game is a search-based challenge in which moving your cursor unlocks scientific terms.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Over the course of gameplay, Simone realizes that the mysterious illness is systemic in nature. She must complete the quest by using the scientific skills she has learned to engage with civic leadership (e.g. mayor and policymakers) and improve the conditions by taking civic action.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Caduceus Quest</i> was evaluated in a scientific trial conducted by researchers at the University of Chicago to evaluate its effects on young people. Playing <i>Caduceus Quest</i> was shown to increase STEM knowledge, scientific process inventory, self-efficacy and interest in learning and doing science, scientific career interest, and civic engagement.
