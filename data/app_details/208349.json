In 1938, the SP&amp;S took delivery of three Baldwin Locomotive Works 4-8-4 locomotives, numbered 700, 701 and 702. These locomotives, designated as E-1 Class \u2018 Northerns\u2019, were identical in design to the Northern Pacific A-3, except that they burned oil instead of coal.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The \u2018Northerns\u2019 operated at a tractive effort of 69,800 lbf (310.49kN) and included a Walschaerts valve gear, piston valves and two cylinders. On entering service, they operated the SP&amp;S\u2019 premier passenger services, including the Empire Builder, although by the late 1940s had been moved to secondary passenger services due to the introduction of diesel locomotives and by the mid-1950s were relegated to freight services.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">By Summer 1956, all three \u2018Northerns\u2019 had been retired from service, with No. 700 pulling its last passenger train from Portland, Oregon to Wishram, Washington on 20th May 1956.
