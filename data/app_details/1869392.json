{"about_the_game":"Shinkansen! Never has there been a more globally renowned rail network than Japan\u2019s high-speed rail system, which has, since the 1960s, been operating fast, frequent services across the length and breadth of the nation. Take on the challenge of breath-taking high-speed Shinkansen services, famed for being on time to the second, as well as more local commuter traffic in T\u014dhoku High Speed &amp; Main Line from Just Trains and Union Workshop!<br><br>Featuring two major routes, and both high-speed and commuter traction, you can experience vastly different rail operations that run side-by-side.<br><br>The T\u014dhoku Main Line stretches 48km in length and features 12 authentic stations. It runs between Kitakami and Morioka, and commuter-style services are provided by the hard-working 701 Series EMU. In service since 1993, this 2-car offering, often working in multiple to increase capacity, is well suited to passenger operations, featuring plenty of interior space and even provisions for passengers to purchase their own tickets while on-board.<br><br>Meanwhile, the star of the show is the T\u014dhoku High Speed line, which extends an impressive 175km between Sendai and Morioka, with 8 stations in total. This Shinkansen line opened in 1982 and serves the eastern regions of Japan, offering 320 km/h line speeds for unbeatable travelling efficiency. The route has been operated with E5 Series Shinkansen EMUs since 2011. The E5s are uniquely distinctive thanks to their state-of-the-art streamlining, including an elongated nose, combined with the white, teal and pink livery which runs end to end.<br><br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2><br>A wide selection of engaging Career scenarios are included:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>01.
