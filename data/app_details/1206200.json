{"about_the_game":"<strong>Isle of Siptah is a massive expansion to the open world survival game Conan Exiles, featuring a vast new island to explore, huge and vile new creatures to slay, new building sets and a host of new features.

The violent storm that swirls around it seems to gather strength and unspeakable horrors stalk within.
