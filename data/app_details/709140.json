You only need a Dream and the emptiness will be gone. A creature before you tried to build a world here, but he was greedy. He wanted to build a world in a day. He stole dreams. All of them. So he faced the consequences. This was my brother. The Fate caught him. In the deepest dream, below nightmares, below terrors, you will find my brother. Holding the stolen dreams, in the jaws of The Fate. Save my brother, take a Dream.
