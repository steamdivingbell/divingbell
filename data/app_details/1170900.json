Is this true? Is anyone reading this? Am I talking to myself? Don't answer that. Actually, you probably have no idea how long it took to write every sentence in all our marketing material, writing and rewriting, to convey the best parts of the game. Yeah, I know; it's not Shakespeare, but we work so hard on the game we want to get it all perfect. I've got to say: if you've made it this far, I'm impressed! This is shaping up to be a big, unappealing &quot;Wall of text&quot;. Not everyone would've actually dared give it a second look. On top of that, it's right above the system requirements! Yikes. Honestly, that's where *I* stop reading, and on a good day. Although below that, there is the &quot;More like this&quot; section, and often that's cool, so I skip right to it. That's all well and good, but I've actually got to finish all the other marketing things. Man, there's a lot. I think I might be dragging this out, just to avoid looking at the pile of marketing things. I'd rather be working on the game right now, but we've got to get this done as it's important. Anyway, thanks for checking out the game and getting this far! You should probably get a little something for going through all this. Tell you what; if you register for our newsletter by going to the special address berguevizthemaztocs [dot] universeworkshopstudios [dot] com, I'll make sure you get the earliest access to the playtests, and any other cool stuff we might do. It'll also be cool to know that someone actually read this. Actually, I've got to Google &quot;Bergueviz the Maztocs&quot; first, to check if it means something offensive in another language. Or if it's slang for something nasty or whatever. It's really just the first couple of random sounds that came to mind when I was trying to think of random sounds to write down for this thing, so who knows what I could've stumbled upon. Ok; I checked and looks like it's fine, so I'm ready to go here. Thanks again for checking out KG! We'll see you out there, friend.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1170900/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733496412","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1170900/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1733496412","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1170900/4af3116c14c9f4c86ab72df35a7746d6bae0ba7b/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733496412","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1170900/4af3116c14c9f4c86ab72df35a7746d6bae0ba7b/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733496412","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h1>Join in the fun with us!</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1170900/extras/Banner1_optimized.gif?t=1733496412\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1170900/extras/Banner2_optimized.gif?t=1733496412\" /></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1170900/extras/FiveMinuteBattles.png?t=1733496412\" /><strong>A concentrate of tactical decisions</strong>.
