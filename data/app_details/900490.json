{"about_the_game":"In Power Gunner, you play as a weaponized ship without landing gear and have to collect fuel supply drops to rid the planet floor of alien colonizers. Your ship is equipped with powerful Gatling guns that auto-acquire targets when in close range. This leaves you to focus on flying and navigating to find more fuel and upgrades!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRandom gen plays a big part in giving you a fun experience each try, the planet will be different every play through and the aliens come from the sky in the form of meteors before crashing down to a random spot on the planet.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Players ship has three main stats to upgrade in Damage, Fuel Tank and Shields, these can be upgraded by collecting XP orbs from the aliens. The player ship also can acquire limited time power-ups that enable ultimate destruction and survival temporarily!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Baby steps!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/900490/22e8afe58ce6be1d20e206a8c9c1b5b6297cd1c4.jpg"},{"name":"Crawling now","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/900490/b90e7425d4c6ebb14d79f874c5a99c4754bc490b.jpg"},{"name":"Almost standing","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/900490/6d533583b91209ce3edd4ee93dfaa292a6172aae.jpg"},{"name":"Fully erect!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/900490/903fee4b20d475b3eada823b2c7ad53bfc3512a8.jpg"},{"name":"Full strides ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/900490/95bf2d05829b75098a0dfd28b229bc117650453a.jpg"},{"name":"Getting pretty good at this now?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/900490/f1d050c681f0407ff6aed7f38cbc5d1917fbd732.jpg"},{"name":"Maybe some of these are too easy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/900490/8a2cc821ee48951d5a55b9e98653322f51257a08.jpg"},{"name":"Apparently we need to add in more","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/900490/68778b5bd03e3ea712703bfabdc02850e6a476af.jpg"},{"name":"Look more!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/900490/e9ce3f5a6b411da64622f95be33b5719947dcfbc.jpg"},{"name":"5000 Score, good going!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/900490/a6b1b1dbd2071d14843589d9080a8bc514b03831.jpg"}],"total":50},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/900490/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1635997198","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/900490/page.bg.jpg?t=1635997198","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/900490/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1635997198","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/900490/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1635997198","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"In Power Gunner, you play as a weaponized ship without landing gear and have to collect fuel supply drops to rid the planet floor of alien colonizers.
