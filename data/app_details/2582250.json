{"about_the_game":"Assemble is a gridless physics-based VR sandbox game. Glue, snap, and pivot to build mechanisms that function how they would in real life. Construct a working vehicle and then drive in it. Create weapons and test them out in live combat. Or create a new wacky mechanism. The only limit is your imagination!
