His only purpose was to guard and protect Warchief Urgo at all times. To never leave his side. When Urgo managed to break free from the soul magic that kept him enslaved to demonlord Aranox he was forced to struck down Azoga, his best warrior and personal bodyguard in a duel. The great wizards of the tower summoned many orcs from the abyss to serve them using their ancient portal. These battle-hardened warriors had been slaves to the demonlords for ages waging wars in the abyss.<br><br>THE TREASURE GOBLIN<br>The dark sorcerer Felix Moortus recruited many goblins to the tower as servants in his workshop. In the third age when he left the tower most of the goblins followed their master to the abyss realm. The goblins that stayed behind found a new ally in one the prison cells in the oldest parts of the tower. It was an ancient cavetroll.  This troll sorcerer needed the soul crystals that was locked up in Moortus vault and the goblins agreed to help him find a way into the vault and around all the magic barriers put in place by their former master. The combination of ancient troll magic and the chaotic soul crystals turned out to be very powerful. One of the goblins learned that this new unstable source of magic could be used to find treasures, gold and riches in the tower.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2646230/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730732781","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2646230/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1730732781","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2646230/f6f94497167ff31c94c45309d59aead30b8eeb6a/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730732781","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2646230/f6f94497167ff31c94c45309d59aead30b8eeb6a/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730732781","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>TOWER WALKER: THE WARLORD</strong> adds 1 new playable class and 1 new special party companion with a unique set of skills.
