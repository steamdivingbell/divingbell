Rotate jewels freely to set up electrifying combos, outwit surprising obstacles like Locks and Bombs, and create high-voltage Flame and Lightning gems. When you need to dial up the intensity or fine-tune your skills, turn to Challenge mode or five-minute Blitz. And if relaxing is more your style, kick up your feet with stress-free Zen.
