{"about_the_game":"A relaxing 1bit puzzle game set in a world where all the light is liquid. There are all sorts of creatures in the darkness, waiting for the light to bring them form, but no need to worry, they are quite tame. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis puzzle game revolves around utilizing the liquid light and liquid dark to gain the curiosity and cooperation of the other creatures in the world. The Lightposts and Darkposts will be tools for your success, but with the help of the other creatures in the world, can you progress. While sometimes the creatures are covered in darkness and lack physical form, that can sometimes be advantageous as they no longer block the way. Sometimes though, you need a creature who's body is covered in light that allows it to take a physical form and help you cross gaps that would otherwise spell your doom.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a puzzle game inspired by the classic game Lode Runner, but capitalizing on the puzzle aspect and downplaying the franticness of the game. The Creatures in the world also feature incredibly simple AI so they always do exactly what you intend for them to do. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game also features a level select which is accessible through the pause menu just in case you get hung up on one particular puzzle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nComplete with 8-bit sound effects and peculiar creatures, this game is certain to tickle your brain!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game currently features:<br />\r\n- 1 Tutorial<br />\r\n- 16 Levels<br />\r\n- Five Creature variants<br />\r\n- Levers<br />\r\n- Two Lamppost Variants<br />\r\n- Light Platforms<br />\r\n- Also a home screen... because of course","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2750690/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1705177939","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2750690/page.bg.jpg?t=1705177939","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2750690/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1705177939","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2750690/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1705177939","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A relaxing 1bit puzzle game set in a world where all the light is liquid.
