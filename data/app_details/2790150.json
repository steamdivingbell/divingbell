{"about_the_game":"<strong>A Brand New Horizon</strong><br><br>Welcome to the newest chapter of the Duck Life series, Duck Life 9, where the ducks are still finding new ways to do what they do best - honing their skills and racing their way to the top! Far away on the seemingly peaceful sanctuary of Featherhaven island, a hopeful young farmer is getting ready to cultivate the most talented bunch of ducks around, and from the second they pop out of their eggs, it's time to get to grips with some training!<br><br>It won't be easy, though, as this is hardly a simple matter of training alone. The island itself is filled with many challenges to overcome, and without fully exploring each of the 9 areas that surround your humble settlement, you won't stand a chance against the mysterious challenger that looms atop the volcano. Fortunately, should you take one of your ducks out into the wilderness, you may find that there are more than a few friendly faces willing to help you along with your quest - and not all of them are from your corner of the animal kingdom!<br><br>There's always another mountain to climb in this vast open world, and as you reach the far corners of each zone, you'll meet new ducks from other walks of life with different skill affinities, who may wish to join your gang if you prove yourself worthy. Filling your flock with a rich mix of feathered friends will help to strengthen the overall group as they learn new tricks to teach their fellow neighbours. It's going to be a team effort if you want to topple the competition!<br><br><strong>Classic Duck Life, Reimagined</strong><br><br>Duck Life 9 takes many of the defining traits of the original classic series and knocks them up a gear! Hatching and raising young ducklings, skill progression, duck customisation, racing and more - it's all here, with a shiny new lick of paint. With the introduction of gorgeous new 3D graphics, Duck Life is that much closer to being what it was truly meant to be all those years ago back in 2010, and now that we're here, the sky's the limit!<br><br>Building up your duck's repertoire of skills is nothing new, but what <i>is</i> new is just how many new skills are available to learn, and how you can utilise them outside of the racing format. The same goes for the sweet styles that your ducks choose to wear - duck fashion has never looked this good, and certain items provide cheeky bonuses and buffs to your performance. Get ready to strut your stuff!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2790150/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1708534748","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2790150/page.bg.jpg?t=1708534748","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2790150/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1708534748","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2790150/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1708534748","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>A Brand New Horizon</strong><br><br>Welcome to the newest chapter of the Duck Life series, Duck Life 9, where the ducks are still finding new ways to do what they do best - honing their skills and racing their way to the top!
