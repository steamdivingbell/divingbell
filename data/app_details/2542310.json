{"about_the_game":"Atari\u2019s Fatal Run 2089 delivers over-the-top driving action across a post-apocalyptic landscape.  You\u2019ll be drifting into hairpin turns while traveling at insane speeds across 20 levels, each with branching paths, shortcuts, and explosive set pieces.<br><br>Not challenging enough? You\u2019ll be fighting off the road rage of vehicular enemies intent on stopping you. You can take them out with an arsenal of weapons, or just smash them off the road with brute force. And all of that while the timer is ticking: The ARC, the key to saving humanity, is always losing integrity over time, but good driving and aggressive play will regain it, just like a classic arcade timer.<br><br>How did this come to pass? After a comet struck Earth and flooded the atmosphere with radiation, people everywhere got sick and new factions emerged to replace the traditional world order. A new power-elite has risen in the chaotic aftermath of the cataclysm, and they are intent on stopping you from upending the new status quo. You have been recruited by a group of dedicated scientists called the Engineers to deliver ARCs, a clean energy solution that pulls radiation out of the atmosphere, to key population centers across the globe. You must get behind the wheel and deliver ARCs to reverse the effects before it\u2019s too late.  This is your Fatal Run. <br><br>Atari teamed with game studio MNSTR on the development of Fatal Run 2089.
