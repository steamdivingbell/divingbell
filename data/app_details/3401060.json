{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">I am a solo/hobbyist developer and this is my attempt at the modernization of my favorite old time RPGs like Bards Tale and Might and Magic.

Descending will have a heavy focus on exploration, combat and character progression. There will be lore available in the world,\u00a0but it will not be a story heavy game. Stories and lore are intentionally simple, to evoke a feeling of a simpler time in gaming.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0I am also developing a full map editor which will allow players to modify or build new maps, this editor will be used to build the entire world and all of its content.
