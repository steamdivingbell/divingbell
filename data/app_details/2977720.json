{"about_the_game":"9 new in-game music tracks to enhance Flatspace. Like any in-game music for Flatspace, these will trigger at random when you enter a new sector. Three music packs were designed for the Flatspace and Flatspace II games, and this pack is the original Music Pack 1 for the first Flatspace game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe music of the Flatspace IIk packs overlaps the former packs to a great extent; but not exclusively. Each pack had new and unique tracks, or alternative edits. When Flatspace IIk was released on Steam, the three Flatspace IIk Music Packs were revised, but the packs for the first game were forgotten. Now they are back for you to enjoy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack includes a full description of the music as a pdf booklet. Here is an outline of the music included:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Heart of Aorkhan: Main Theme<br />\r\nCreated using the first generation of my music software, Noise Station, in 2001, this was the main theme for a massive 3D rogue-like game that didn't make it to final release. The Heart of Aorkhan would have ranked among the world's largest role playing games, but was shelved after approximately one year of development. This is the oldest music in the Flatspace Music Packs, and a slightly different edit to the version in the Flatspace IIk Pack.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCatacombs<br />\r\nThis was part of The Heart of Aorkhan soundtrack. Catacombs made it onto one of my earliest albums, The Incredible Journey. The fan-commissioned track, Journey Through Fractional Space, was developed as a crossover between this and Flatspace tune, Cobra.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInsanity<br />\r\nA simple fugue.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMariner<br />\r\nLater renamed \u2018Downloading\u2019, this track was written and recorded in 2002 for The Incredible Journey. It was inspired by the Mariner space probes. There are 100 beeps.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOceanic<br />\r\nOceanic appears on Animalia, which was written and recorded in 2004, and remastered in 2020. My music of that time was heavily influenced by Jean-Michel Jarre. I like to create music that evokes images as well as feelings, and Oceanic is about underwater life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSea Monsters<br />\r\nSea Monsters is part of my first album on a symphonic scale, a conceptual electronic works called The Spiral Staircase. The album was completely recorded twice, first in 2004 on my old software Noise Station, then in 2008 on much better equipment, and for the second version, this excluded segment was included.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpace<br />\r\nA short track which pre-dates the original Flatspace game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe 7th Bell<br />\r\nThis track was written for another game developer at the start of 2004, and influenced by 1970s electronic music, such as Pulstar and Alpha by Vangelis. Like all of the tracks here, this version is a new 24-bit master compared to the version in the Flatspace IIk Pack.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUltramarine<br />\r\nA version without vocals of this song from the Gunstorm EP project.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2977720/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737553929","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2977720/page.bg.jpg?t=1737553929","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2977720/6d2cf3d7bacb510ec6e4971f2858c17fbc629764/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737553929","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2977720/6d2cf3d7bacb510ec6e4971f2858c17fbc629764/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737553929","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"9 new in-game music tracks to enhance Flatspace.
