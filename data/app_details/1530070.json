{"about_the_game":"<strong>#Snake2 DX: Reawakening</strong> is a fan-made sequel to the classic arcade game, &quot;Snake.&quot; It aims to fulfill the huge potential of the first game, while remaining true to its core mechanics (just like what &quot;Pac Man 2: The New Adventures&quot; did for Pac-Man)!

All this culminates in a tense showdown with Snake's father, the all-powerful <strong>Butt King</strong>.
