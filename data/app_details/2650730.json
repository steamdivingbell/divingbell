Jay here. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Thank you for the overwhelming support on SEDAP!'s demo. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">It has come to our attention that players are facing some issues with playing using a controller.\u00a0<i>SEDAP!</i> does not currently have full built-in support for all controllers. <strong>However, Steam Input is supported.</strong>  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><u><strong>Steps:</strong></u><br>1. Enable controller configuration support for compatible controllers: </p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">   a. Open Steam and navigate to the controller settings page (Steam Settings &gt; Controller).</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2650730/extras/Demo_Controller_Help_01.jpg?t=1739268665\" /></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">   b.

Overriding game properties</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">   a. On &quot;Sedap Demo&quot; in your Library, click the gear button on the right, select 'Properties...'.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">   b. Go to Controller and select 'Enable Steam Input' for Override for Sedap Demo (Changing requires restart of the game).</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">   c. You may open the Controller Configurator to see more details or remap your controller. </p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We appreciate everyone's feedback so far and will be handling bugfixes and improvements to the demo as soon as we can! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Thank you!</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong> </strong><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2650730/extras/Divider.png?t=1739268665\" /></p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Two aspiring culinary geniuses open a traveling food truck and venture out to Khaya Island \u2013 a long abandoned, dangerous island with no shortage of monsters and mysteries.
