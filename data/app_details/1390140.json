Everything is going just as it should and everyone is doing their part - except that hasn\u2019t stopped the frost from growing through the farmbeds and the lights from crackle-popping in the frigid night.

As she drills, a crack forms, a large crack that swallows her up and slides her into the depths of the ice below. <br><br>Lost in the Underice, she must now find her family the food they need while navigating the dangers lurking below her world.
