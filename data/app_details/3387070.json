{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">AnyCircuit is a 3D voxel-based circuits simulator. It offers various mechanics for editing the voxel world, such as an integrated clipboard system to endlessly cut, copy, paste, rotate, save and load portions of the world in a user-friendly manner, and a vast array of items related to digital electronics that the player can freely place and interact with. With the use of said items, and a fair amount of knowledge and imagination, the player can build incredibly advanced digital machines. It can either be seen as a fun sandbox game where you can put your creativity and logical skills to the test, or as a useful, easy-to-use educational tool, whether you're a student, a hobbyist, or a professional in the field.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3387070/extras/Screenshot1.png?t=1734990408\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Integrated Clipboard System</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Build your circuits without boundaries with the integrated clipboard system.
