{"about_the_game":"Welcome to your new job, Security guard for Manny's Mechanical Emporium (MME)! Rated the #1 Robotic Mannequin company in America. You are on the night shift, Make sure to stay awake, and be quiet\u2026 Lately the mannequins in the cage marked for disposal have been getting restless... damaging company property, breaking other mannequin products in the facility, and are being unpredictable when the day shift goes home and they are no longer under surveillance. You are here to watch the facility, do your rounds, and protect company assets. Your job is to make sure none of the broken mannequins escape the building... even if that means you are locked in with them. After all if a broken product got loose and broke or harmed anything in the outside world that would damage the company name and reputation and we cannot have that. If any broken mannequins walk about the facility your job is to observe and report, keep a safe distance away.. and initiate the lock down procedure... stay in your office and report it to your supervisor immediately and a corporate contractor will handle the situation. If a corporate contractor is unable to make it to you then it is your job to keep them occupied until day shift can come in and help. You are authorized to keep the mannequin assets occupied by all of the following: walking, running, throwing small items, hiding under company furniture or in other rooms, dying\u2026(Death and dismemberment, and health benefits do not start until 3 months after your start date) You may also use your Security issued Tablet to check the cameras to see an assets position in the room and you can play sounds in other rooms to draw an asset away from you in an effort to save your cowardly self! Be careful though, if the battery in the tablet is dead you will be temporarily unable to access the camera system and will need to recharge the tablet to use it again\u2026 Make sure to stay hidden, stay quiet, they can hear you... Welcome to the team!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCan you survive your shift?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis Game is a Survival Horror Game, where the Enemy is attracted to sound. You are a Security guard and as such, you are unable to fight back as that would be destroying Company property. You must hide, and try to find a way to reset the lockdown and get out of the building before the mannequins find you, and provide a demonstration of what they were really built for.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1944510/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1664676474","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1944510/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1664676474","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1944510/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1664676474","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1944510/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1664676474","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to your new job, Security guard for Manny's Mechanical Emporium (MME)!
