The feeling of home, where peace exists and freedom is breathed.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">02 - Lu Shan - Ling Hun</h2>Here Yun begins to be able to use a new mechanic that greatly expands the gameplay of the title, with which the music must match, using a traditional Chinese string instrument called &quot;Erhu&quot; it generates a mystical and epic atmosphere to welcome the new challenges.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">03 - Shan Qiang - Ling Hun</h2>The traditional flute is introduced, with a sound that transmits freedom but also deception, since it is an area in the game where nothing is what it seems, it is transmitted through a changing melody but that remains at a relaxed pace.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">04 - Ju Yan - Ling Hun</h2>In the Ju Yan area, the game already begins to have several mechanics with which to interact and master, but despite this it continues to offer calm gameplay, therefore, another string instrument is introduced to give a touch of calm with long sounds and melodic that are accompanied by moments of relative tension when using &quot;stacatto&quot; techniques to play said instrument and give a melodic and defined rebound to the song.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">05 - Kua Shan - Ling Hun</h2>This song introduces several ancestral instruments such as Buddhist bells and traditional drums that are usually used in religious ceremonies and rituals. To maintain the calm of the title, these instruments have been used gradually and with spaces to give the listener a state of constant calm despite a certain noise resulting from the instruments themselves.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">06 - Simiao Yan - Ling Hun</h2>Here instruments that have already been heard before begin to mix, among them we can once again hear the &quot;Erhu&quot; with its sound as characteristic and recognizable as the &quot;Yanqing&quot;, two string instruments that sound so different that it makes them Combined, even in the distance, they generate a melody that can easily transport you to oriental fantasy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">07 - Rongtai - Ling Hun</h2>We again find a combination of several instruments, in essence we find several traditional flutes along with drums. In this case Gerard has played with the panning of said instruments and their vibrato (the panning refers to which side, right or left, certain sounds can be heard) to generate a vibrant and dissonant atmosphere that makes you understand that a certain thing is beginning to approach. closure of the adventure.<br><br><br>08 - Main Menu Theme - Ling Hun:<br>This is the theme that we can hear as soon as we turn on the title and it immediately conveys to us, with drums, a feeling of greatness and the importance of what we are about to reveal. In the case of being the first time playing, this grandiloquence is given by Yun's story with Zorro.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">09 - Extra - Ling Hun</h2>Since an extra phase has been made to discover all the collectibles within the game, the music of this phase could not be other than one of the previous phases but in reverse.
