{"about_the_game":"Alter is a turn-based RPG set in a world where humanity has been almost destroyed by monsters called crystallites after a cataclysmic event named&quot;The Fall&quot; where a giant red crystal fell from the sky. The crystal was both a curse and a benediction for humans, because if it gave birth to the crystallites, it also made the Alters : super human with special magic, the Blood gift.<br><br>The price to pay was high, and only a single giant fortress survived. Named Bastion, it fall mean the end of humanity and for centuries the Alters have fought bitterly on the wall to fend off the monsters. Shedding their blood to protect humans, they seized power as a rightful reward, further robbing the people of hope.<br><br>Centuries later, you will play as Mavenna, a young and ambitious Alter sick of this society. Determined to climb the social ladder at all cost, how she will change the society will depend on your choices.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Choices matters</strong></h2><br>Alter is a multiple-ending story game, and if all choices don't affect directly the end of the story, they all have consequences. We don't want to force the player to be a good or evil person. We want to let them choose and don't punish them just because they are cruel or greedy. Most choices aren't bad or good, but not all combination works and you may face Game Over... After all, you shouldn't expect support from a faction you're hostile with.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Reputation</strong></h2><br>Your reputation reflects your actions. Will you be a cruel tyrant? A guardian for the people? Or an Alter like the others, taking advantage of a system that is already greatly in your favor? Each of the factions present in Bastion has its affinities and satisfying them all will prove to be an arduous task and not necessarily a productive one. The more friendly a faction is, the more likely it will be to help you in the story, and the more hostile it is, the more it will interfere with you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Endless possibilities</strong></h2><br>Turn-based often mean tactic and RPG often mean skills. With Alter, you will have the possibility to create your very own build for each character! With two distinctive classes for every character and four skills per class, you can create your own hybrid class. Furthermore, each skill has its own specialization tree that can drastically change the gameplay of its skill, making the number of possible build endless.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A deep equipment crafting system</strong></h2><br>In Alter, you will have to build your own equipment. Steel isn't near enough to fight high level crystallites and you'll need the spoil of your previous battles to forge new weapons and armors. Each part of each monster offer a different set of bonuses and by mixing them you can build what you need the most. Moreover, those parts can come in different rarities, increasing even more the bonus and making your equipment powerful. The game is designed to be really tough with basic gears but still doable, and it's up to you to decide if you want to search for better loot in order to make your characters stronger.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2363560/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1709296671","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2363560/page.bg.jpg?t=1709296671","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2363560/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1709296671","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2363560/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1709296671","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Alter is a turn-based RPG set in a world where humanity has been almost destroyed by monsters called crystallites after a cataclysmic event named&quot;The Fall&quot; where a giant red crystal fell from the sky.
