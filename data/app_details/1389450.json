The goal when creating this game was to try and build something solid for players to enjoy, and stay away from things that where too big or technical this time round. I want to learn as much as I can in all areas of game development. The funds and knowledge received from this game, will be used mostly to fund the next project and attempt something much more technical. I hope all of you find some value in this game. I love this game.
