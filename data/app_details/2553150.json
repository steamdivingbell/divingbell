With the guidance of Joel, her charismatic childhood friend, Malka must navigate a mental landscape filled with dark secrets, twisted illusions, and terrifying monsters. Will she find a way to break free from the shackles of her own mind or be consumed by the darkness her mind has conjured?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNote: This game is a work of fiction.
