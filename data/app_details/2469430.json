{"about_the_game":"&quot; <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">D&amp;D Monster Manual - Syrinscape Sound Link Pack</h2>Syrinscape Sound Link Packs for Fantasy Grounds work with your Syrinscape Super Syrin subscription to provide you context-specific sounds for monsters and NPCs in the D&amp;D Monster Manual.\u00a0 The collection of Sound Sets can be created for free within the Fantasy Grounds Unity sound interface, but this pack has done all the work for you to link the monsters. Appropriate sounds from Syrinscape will show up in your Sound Context Window automatically when you add a monster to the Combat Tracker, launch an Encounter, or open an NPC record for the monster.  This pack include 435 sounds sets for NPCs in the D&amp;D Monster Manual that match the monster or NPC name to a set of sounds in Syrinscape. Sounds will include links to moods, music, elements, and oneshots. These sound sets contain links to Syrinscape sounds only and this pack does not grant you access to any sounds you don't already own at Syrinscape. For the best experience, we recommend subscribing to the Super Syring subscription at Syrinscape to enable access to all sounds.\u00a0      &quot;","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2469430/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1686778835","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2469430/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1686778835","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2469430/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1686778835","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2469430/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1686778835","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot; <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">D&amp;D Monster Manual - Syrinscape Sound Link Pack</h2>Syrinscape Sound Link Packs for Fantasy Grounds work with your Syrinscape Super Syrin subscription to provide you context-specific sounds for monsters and NPCs in the D&amp;D Monster Manual.\u00a0 The collection of Sound Sets can be created for free within the Fantasy Grounds Unity sound interface, but this pack has done all the work for you to link the monsters.
