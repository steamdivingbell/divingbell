{"about_the_game":"During the 1960s the newly independent Congo was the scene of constant warfare. Congo Merc puts you in the middle of that fighting with a task force of elite commandos. You conduct breakneck advances into the heart of enemy territory, seize critical objectives and, just as important, return to home base.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBased on the board game by Decision Games, Congo Merc includes everything from hostage rescue to tracking down Cuban cadre. You recruit from a variety of unit types, including jeep-mounted commandos, light armor, sappers, air support, paratroopers and many others.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce a task force is organized, you maneuver it into the Congo. The map covers the entire country, and when a force enters certain points an event occurs. Events can include anything from UN intervention to ambushes by enemy fighters. Combat is resolved via a quasi-tactical procedure in which both tactical superiority and firepower play their parts.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Congo Commando","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/510550/c0dbd0c2ed97f6110d5455540f1e0721149e477d.jpg"},{"name":"Congo Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/510550/1e1c8a9d1ff0bf5ba3bed82fa7d476c2431f19ce.jpg"},{"name":"Congo Samaritan","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/510550/5cebd220adad13597a9075b8eae682470b6b1328.jpg"},{"name":"Congo Savior","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/510550/740f7f8a110e6d8d1929a0b05b969d86909e15b1.jpg"},{"name":"Mass Grave","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/510550/74e66d2f3e3a090d55c3fe040f134f7ef7d63e62.jpg"},{"name":"Head of the Snake","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/510550/f8ec88d41f3ac470284beee40aa1eb4ab8fb4370.jpg"},{"name":"Anti-Anarchist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/510550/fce2d985061ba6cb613aae17b79161b7c0a9b319.jpg"},{"name":"I know where you are.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/510550/51f0635da872c7aa5508a726b5a1f0ae964d4170.jpg"},{"name":"AWOL","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/510550/ce19845006f3ef3ccab7a65abc51f12e11bd60b3.jpg"},{"name":"All-seeing","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/510550/1d7a2b84494ced9a6b4dfe836020fc0510d75762.jpg"}],"total":12},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/510550/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1481566794","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/510550/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1481566794","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/510550/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1481566794","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/510550/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1481566794","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"During the 1960s the newly independent Congo was the scene of constant warfare.
