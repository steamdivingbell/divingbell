{"about_the_game":"Every millennium the great demon king Azmodean opens a rift to the mortal realm to overtake it.

Are you game enough?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Authentic 8-bit graphics and sound!</h2><br>Extreme Volleyball Infernal League was created for a true 8-bit era console, the SEGA Master System. The Steam version is a faithful port of the original, built to run natively on modern hardware and with Steam integration, but we also bundle the ROM for use with emulators and flash cartridges.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Rules</h2><br>The demon imposes rules somewhat different from standard volleyball. In this league, players have 5 HP of life. When the ball touches the ground, the player on that side of the net looses life, so be careful not to miss the ball! Items are also spawned during the game to help conquer your opponent. After each round, you get bonus points for your remaining life (1000 per HP) and if your life gauge is still full, a perfect +10000 bonus.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Items</h2><br>    Fire: Throw a fireball to your opponent<br>    Slow: Slows down the opponent for approx. 15 seconds<br>    Shields: Summon a shield for help. (Insurance for one missed ball)<br>    Cloud: Jump a lot higher and fall slower when jump button held.<br>    Sprint shoes: Run faster!<br>    Sticky: The ball sticks to you once! Walk up to the net and do an air jump to smash it!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Controls</h2><br>Supports Game controllers, and Keyboard. Menus can be navigated using a mouse or touchscreen, but a keyboard or game controller is required to play.<br>The keyboard ESC key always opens the Pause menu in game and doubles as a Menu Back / Close menu key.
