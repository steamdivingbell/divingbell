Each game is different based on unique round types that will alter the AI and environment while playing. Both teams are given 6 cards and only allowed to see each card that the enemy has shown, with both sides needing to use strategy to counter their enemy. The player needs to use strategy to not only build a powerful deck of unique creatures, but also make sure they have enough currency to survive to the next round.

With mulitple unique maps for the player to buy and use, you will never feel bored with how the atmosphere feels, from an under water map to a diverse jungle each map will suit different playstyles.
