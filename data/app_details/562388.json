{"about_the_game":"Traverse the landmark Semmeringbahn route in the newly unveiled \u00d6BB 4010, from noted Partner Programme developer RSSLO.

Simmering-Graz-Pauker rolled three of the new train sets, classified as the \u00d6BB 4010, off the production line in 1965. Formed of a power car, cab car and four intermediate coaches fitted with first and second class throughout, the new fleet would quickly revolutionise luxury rail travel and would serve the route all the way into the mid-2000s.<br><br>Getting familiar with the cab of the \u00d6BB 4010 is key to success. Being a design from the 1960s, it features many classic dials, switches and controls which, while modern for the time, contrast quite considerably with the multiple units of today. With of-the-era rudimentary systems on-board, starting up the \u00d6BB 4010 is a fairly easy procedure once you know where the relevant controls are; simply raise the pantograph, turn on the main switch, select your intended direction of travel, set the lights up appropriately and you\u2019re good to go.<br><br>Where the level of complexity increases aboard the \u00d6BB 4010 is in its driving wheel.
