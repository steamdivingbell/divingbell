{"about_the_game":"The distinctive Electro-Motive BL2, envisioned by legendary EMD chief engineer Richard \u201cDick\u201d Dilworth as a diesel road-switcher with style and panache, is ready for Train Simulator duty! Dressed in Western Maryland Railway liveries, the BL2 is joined in this DLC by WM Alco FA2 and GE 44-tonner diesels and a selection of Western Maryland freight equipment!<br><br>Secure in churning out streamlined freight F-units, passenger E-units, and end-cab diesel switchers by the hundreds, Electro-Motive had been slow to embrace the road-switcher concept. But the success of the Alco RS1 and RS2 diesels in the 1940s, along with the presence of similar models offered by Baldwin and Fairbanks-Morse, EMD took notice.<br><br>Electro-Motive\u2019s Dick Dilworth was unrivaled in creating locomotives of both mechanical perfection and style, and thus when he put EMD\u2019s first 1,500-horsepower road-switcher to paper, he wished to give the diesel panache beyond that of a typical angular road-switcher design. The result, in the form of EMD BL1 demonstrator No. 499 of 1948, was a semi-streamlined diesel with a beveled rear hood and slightly narrowed nose to provide bi-directional visibility. Internally, the BL2 was, for all intents and purposes, identical to the EMD F3. Still anxious to not undercut its own F-units as masters of the main line, EMD\u2019s \u201cBL\u201d designation stood for \u201cBranch Line.\u201d<br><br>The BL1 demonstrator was followed two months later by production models designated BL2. In a production run that lasted 13 months, EMD produced 58 BL2s for nine railroads and the buyer list was as eclectic as the diesel itself, ranging from New England\u2019s Boston &amp; Maine to the Midwest\u2019s Rock Island. Also among the BL2 buyers was the Western Maryland, which purchased a pair of the unique diesels as the railroad dieselized in the late 1940s<br><br>Despite the BL2s uncommon external appearance, it was a reliable and trust worthy locomotive and many of the units enjoyed lengthy careers, including Western Maryland\u2019s duo. Early in their lives, Western Maryland BL2s 81 and 82 could be found roaming the \u201cWild Mary\u2019s\u201d main lines, then later in life the pair became regular denizens of WM\u2019s sprawling hometown yard at Hagerstown, Maryland. The Western Maryland BL2s remained in service to acquire Chessie System road numbers (7181 and 7182) in the 1970s and worked into the 1980s. Western Maryland BL2 81 is today preserved at the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Museum in Baltimore, Maryland, and sister No. 82 found a home on the Durbin &amp; Greenbrier Valley Railroad. A number of other BL2s also remain extant and operational in museums and on tourist lines.<br><br>Beautifully re-created by DTM (Digital Train Model), the BL2 for Train Simulator wears two classic Western Maryland liveries \u2013 its original \u201cFireball\u201d scheme and the WM \u201cSpeed Lettering\u201d livery which it wore for most of its career.
