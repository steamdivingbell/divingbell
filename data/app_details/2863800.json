{"about_the_game":"You found yourself in a small, dark room.<br />\r\nYou want to understand how you got here and what this place is, but you are overwhelmed by the desire to just get out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou don't know where the exit is, is it locked, or is there no exit at all?<br />\r\nIt's up to you to find out. But be careful, the person or creature you are here for hears everything and wants you dead, so you have only a few hours to leave this scary place. Or maybe just hide? The kidnapper is not so simple and deprived you of this opportunity, so you need to think carefully how not to meet him.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDon't be sad, you may have a friend who will help you for a delicious piece of meat, don't miss this chance!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are 5 levels of difficulty. Easy - we recommend it for those who have never been kidnapped. Medium is the middle ground. Hard is for those who like to suffer. &quot;Impossible&quot; or &quot;Are you serious?&quot; - we think the title speaks for itself. And the most beautiful level of difficulty is Practice. In practice you will not be disturbed and you can study everything around you in peace.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat happens if I sit in fear and do nothing? Well you can find out for yourself :)","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Hotel?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2863800/e0d1b25b52e38fb94a468aa1528490ffbb0a485e.jpg"},{"name":"Demon","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2863800/0ba77f7a26fee8ce6505299ce89d076d721c2219.jpg"},{"name":"The End","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2863800/82a69a72499dbdfb9dee7bc7a92f3f262b42d0bf.jpg"},{"name":"Crazy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2863800/74abd4afd78e20c73a8116edd11cbff918e91df4.jpg"},{"name":"Collector","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2863800/b6e3946c6157a82aedf06cb19f682bd7c591b49c.jpg"},{"name":"Where am i?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2863800/b00750461f90e57f4923eb068ba7b015fb677e5e.jpg"},{"name":"Ancient thing","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2863800/c369e33a519f269317d782e43bf1283567ac8349.jpg"}],"total":7},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2863800/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737821700","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2863800/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1737821700","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2863800/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737821700","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2863800/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737821700","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"The game contains elements of torture and violence, as well as references to and allusions to the use of alcohol, tobacco and drugs."},"detailed_description":"You found yourself in a small, dark room.<br />\r\nYou want to understand how you got here and what this place is, but you are overwhelmed by the desire to just get out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou don't know where the exit is, is it locked, or is there no exit at all?<br />\r\nIt's up to you to find out.
