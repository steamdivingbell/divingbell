This immersive experience sets you in the 1940's where legends of the game were making a name for themselves in spite of the oppositions set against them. Experience the story first hand as a player during this pivotal time in history. In this VR experience users will face certain struggles in playing the game of baseball during the time of racial segregation. This project is sure to be a hit for people of all ages as you face off with baseball legends such as Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson, and Buck Leonard.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis project is a short narrative base experience allowing the players to use mechanics of the controllers to get a taste of playing baseball in the Negro Leagues.  Practice your catching and throwing in the outfield. Take your place at bat and try to hit a home run. The VR experience weaves together historical narrative with entertaining game play to introduce you to a hidden chapter of America's past time. During game play you will explore some of the spaces and  interact with people and places from the perspective of a Negro League baseball player. Through partnership with the Negro League Baseball Museum, funding from the Epic Games Mega Grant and partnership with Reallusion (the creators of iClone and Character Creator) we are bringing Negro League Baseball to life as they celebrate their 100th year anniversary.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1929410/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1683133355","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1929410/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1683133355","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1929410/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1683133355","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1929410/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1683133355","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"From the award winning creator of the VR experience \u201cI Am A Man\u201d comes the next big history themed VR project, \u201cBarnstormers: Determined to Win.\u201d Travel back in time to the era of Negro League Baseball.
