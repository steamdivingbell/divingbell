{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>EVERY RISK IS REWARDED</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The most dangerous plays also happen to be the best plays. You gain health by getting near, but not touching, hazards. You can use health to get ammo. You can bet your score for better ships, giving you a chance to recover your investment and then some. Particularly impressive routes build a combo, allowing you to gain even more score on the leaderboard.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>RETRO GAMING FROM THE FUTURE</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Featuring a complete multiplayer campaign, a robust tied-in unlock system, and limited lives used to upgrade your ship, this game samples the best of retro and modern design.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With its arcade-style economy, your score from previous games let you play more exotic missions and gamemodes. This can be disabled for more casual settings, to ensure your loot doesn't go to waste.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>LIVE LOCAL MULTIPLAYER</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game supports split screen multiplayer, and is incredibly easy to pick up and drop out. Players can join in the middle of a match, or leave in the middle of a match.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In multiplayer, you may revive your comrades by getting near them. There is no downside to adding players once you're in a match - the more, the merrier.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There are no plans for multiplayer across the Internet.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>MANY WAYS TO PLAY</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">For each of the enemy ships you'll encounter in the game, there's a weapon and support tool you can unlock from them. This gives you a grand total of 20 different kinds of equipment to bear against 8+ enemy ships.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Fight the enemy across different maps, with different hazards, goals and strategies for each.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With all this, fine control over which upgrades you see, and what kind of army you'll face against, the amount of ways to play are limitless!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>COMPARE RECORDS</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With the game's replay system, your best games can be saved, revisited and shared. Their scores can also be put on a public leaderboard, allowing you to see which of your friends have mastered which challenges.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>ACCESSIBLE AND CHALLENGING</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With an infinitely scaling difficulty, most people will find an entry point where the game is accessible to them, and all will find a point when the game finally bests them.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3259230/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1739047304","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3259230/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1739047304","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3259230/d58198c8739107c2d80c4a1e2cc0f101f12add46/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739047304","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3259230/d58198c8739107c2d80c4a1e2cc0f101f12add46/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739047304","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>EVERY RISK IS REWARDED</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The most dangerous plays also happen to be the best plays.
