The FPS, keeping with the spirit of the series, maintains a pixel art graphical style referring to retro games. At the same time the game is enriched with additional solutions, thanks to which you can also feel a breath of gaming freshness. The whole game is permeated with an awe-inspiring, even brutal atmosphere - dark locations, enemies taken straight out of nightmarish visions, and finally - heavy music.

The death of his wife, the epidemic that gradually turned into a terrifying festival of grotesque citizen-murdering creatures, the closure of mining shafts and the further loss of loved ones. It would seem to be too much for one man. <strong>Nothing could be further from the truth.</strong> After all, the Cannon of Light has not yet dealt with all the evil consuming this 19th century Canadian town. This time, the dark sect MBSXII poses as the main antagonist, using the Rock Resin to prepare an even greater disaster. What\u2019s important however - a disaster threatening further than the known world reaches... Culligan, however, does not give in to any adversity and takes matters - or rather, guns - into his own hands.
