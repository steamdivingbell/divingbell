{"about_the_game":"Spark is an exciting new Moba coming in 2019.<br><br>We\u2019re taking the lessons learned from playing Mobas over the past 15 years to put a new spin on the genre.<br><br>With more focus on progression, a wider range of objectives and large variety in hero build options we\u2019re creating a game that will let you shine in whatever way you want, even going as far as letting you fully change your playstyle mid match to adjust to the situation.<br><br>We\u2019re a grassroots team of developers. Many of us found our beginning in creating custom games and even our primary funding comes from a source with strong ties to the custom games community. This also means we\u2019re able to act fully in what we think is in the best interest for our game and our community.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Our map, Jaekka\u2019s Court, is a living, breathing part of the experience. The court is loose and laneless, inhabited by strong bosses, remnants of the Mother and those that seek her blessing. Fight off those in your path and empower your allies on your way to claim the throne.<br>Slay bosses to upgrade items and win duels against the enemy team as you close in on a dynamically adjusting score limit.<br></li><li>The lore of Spark isn\u2019t just an afterthought. It\u2019s a fully integrated part of the game and the more you play the more mysteries and stories of the world you will find.
