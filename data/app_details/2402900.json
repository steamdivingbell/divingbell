{"about_the_game":"Hoboman is a 2D collectathon platformer with SNES-like graphics and a fun story centered around Pluto, a ship mechanic from the planet Voltra. When tragedy strikes, Pluto is thrown into a wild adventure to reclaim his old way of life. By stowing away on ships, Pluto stumbles on a plot that is larger than he could have imagined... <br><br>Throughout the game you'll come across geodes of various colors. Each color has it's own special behavior and method of claiming it:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Blue: A very common geode, every level has 15. Most are in plain sight, but keep your eyes peeled for a handful of more challenging ones!<br></li><li> Red: Each level has a specific number of Foxslimes. If you defeat them all without dying, you'll be rewarded!<br></li><li> Green: Race against the clock for this geode. However, you'll have to find the start and finish lines first!<br></li><li> White: We don't want to spoil everything, but be on the lookout for hidden areas!<br></li><li> Yellow: Trapped behind a plasma wall. You'll need a key... Surely some enemy within the level is carrying one!<br></li><li> Purple: This elusive geode teleports to new areas when touched. Rumor has it that finding it 5 times is enough for it to fully materialize!</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> As you play, you'll also enjoy: </h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Enjoy a Sci-fi story with equal parts drama and silliness, with wild characters throughout.<br></li><li> Explore open levels to find hidden geodes which have an impact on the story<br></li><li> Complete mini challenges to earn special geodes and unlock special endings for each color.<br></li><li> Enjoy forgiving gameplay, where there are no lives! Take a leap to try exploring a new area.<br></li><li> Play at your own pace: Enjoy casual gameplay, with some more difficult geodes available for those interested in more of a challenge.<br></li><li> Allow your ears to revel in the energetic soundtrack, inspired by classic platformers.<br></li><li> Grab your bindle and get ready for a wild journey!</li></ul><br>Note: This game is best played with controller, though keyboard is also supported. If you have issues with a controller setup, it is likely caused by Steam's Desktop Controller configuration, which causes controller buttons to also press Keyboard keys. Turning this off will provide the best possible experience.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2402900/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1699233406","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2402900/page.bg.jpg?t=1699233406","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2402900/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1699233406","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2402900/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1699233406","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Hoboman is a 2D collectathon platformer with SNES-like graphics and a fun story centered around Pluto, a ship mechanic from the planet Voltra.
