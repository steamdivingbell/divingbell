{"about_the_game":"<strong>Mimicry</strong> is a minimalist 2D puzzle-platformer where you control 2 characters at once in 100 levels.<br>However, one character's controls are inverted, so each level feels like a puzzle. <br><br><br>- Control 2 characters that move in opposite directions at the same time.<br><br>- Oh! One of those characters ALSO has reversed gravity.<br><br>- Play 100 levels with 5 boss fights that will test your puzzle-solving and platforming skills.<br><br>- A very unique final boss fight that is not like most out there. <br><br>- Not a gamer? No problem! The game's training wheels help you get ready to complete your journey.<br><br>- You are a gamer and want challenging puzzles? No problem! Good luck!<br><br>- Minimalist art and relaxing music to help cut the tension in the tougher stages.<br><br><strong><i>Update</i></strong>: To backout in the home menus, press \u201cBackspace\u201d on PC or \u201cDelete\u201d on MAC. <br>Gamepad controllers is my preferred way to play","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1381500/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1599197074","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1381500/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1599197074","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1381500/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1599197074","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1381500/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1599197074","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>Mimicry</strong> is a minimalist 2D puzzle-platformer where you control 2 characters at once in 100 levels.<br>However, one character's controls are inverted, so each level feels like a puzzle. <br><br><br>- Control 2 characters that move in opposite directions at the same time.<br><br>- Oh!
