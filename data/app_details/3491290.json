{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Unblinking: A Descent into Eldritch Horror</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Imagine yourself standing at the cliff of an unfathomable abyss, with the weight of mortality looming over you like a specter. You are a condemned soul, a death row inmate forced to participate in a twisted game of survival.

They are parts of an eldritch being, an ancient angel whose body you must literally dissect to reach the relic hidden deep within its core.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you delve deeper into the heart of this monstrous entity, you will encounter increasingly complex puzzles that require wit, strategy, and a willingness to confront the abyssal horrors that lurk within.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">But there is a glimmer of hope. If you can successfully navigate this twisted, ever-shifting landscape and retrieve the relic, you will be granted your freedom - a chance to escape the death sentence that hangs over you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Will you be able to overcome the eldritch horrors that lie within <strong>Unblinking</strong>, or will you succumb to the crushing weight of madness and despair?
