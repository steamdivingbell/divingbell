{"about_the_game":"This game has a relatively fast pace completion time. It's my first game put onto the store and for a cheap price too. I hope you can enjoy it for what it is. You are to go around in a spiral which has different scenarios/environments. Hence the name &quot;Shambled Spiral&quot; Its design is in first person and you will be expected to acquire weapons off enemies or in allocated areas to progress. It is currently only singleplayer with &quot;possible&quot; local hosting co-op in the future. I have implemented a couple of different image, sound and text triggers for a distinct immersion. The setting of the game is predominantly gloomy and medieval. There will be some difficulty, in a sense of slight puzzle solving. <br />\r\nIf you buy this version, you will have access to the new and improved version on the new and improved engine, when I can get around to do it.<br />\r\nDon't expect anything crazy. All feedback is greatly appreciated. I wish for you to enjoy!
