{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2653130/extras/01.png?t=1726466044\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>About the Game</strong></h2><br>You are a modern young adult about to start your second year at university when you are suddenly sent back in time to 1896 Goldfield County. This place is constantly attacked by a dangerous bandit called Charlie Adams and his gang of scoundrels. You quickly learn that you will have to adapt or die, <strong>but luckily there are several beautiful girls willing to help you.</strong><br><br>Throughout the story you will have to make several choices that will guide your destiny, being able to go alone, <strong>accompanied by a beautiful girl or all of them (If you want).</strong>  You will have to adapt to a life of constant shootings, robberies, fights and lots of drinking and fun at the Saloon.<br><br><strong>Will you find a way to return home? Or will you get used to life in the west?</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Features</strong></h2><br>The game has several systems that help you truly feel like you are in the wild west, you can hunt animals in the forests, ride horses, buy houses and properties, shoot different types of guns and even become a sheriff! <strong>The +18 animations are also fully interactive</strong>, which gives you the option to switch between movement speed, different camera angles, zoom in and out and even change positions in specific scenes. All rendered in <strong>Full HD (1980x1020).</strong><br><br>The game also has a big interactive map so you can move through different areas that are unlocked as you progress, a calendar and clock system with real changes in scenarios and interactions. (Stores that only open during the day, bars that only open at night, etc...) A complete financial system so you can get money in several different ways and also spend it in the game wherever you see fit. And some other auxiliary systems that facilitate gameplay, such as a Walkthrough that guides you throughout the missions.<br><br><strong>A Gallery is also accessible from the Pause Menu so you can revisit your favorite scenes.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Characters</strong></h2><br>Throughout the Gameplay you will find <strong>dozens of girls to corrupt</strong> but right from the start you will know the 5 main ones. They are:<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2653130/extras/06.png?t=1726466044\" /><br><br><strong>Kristal</strong><br>Kristal is the first girl to be introduced and you have interactions with her in the prologue and the first chapter of the Gameplay. She is the most popular girl in college and a legitimate American preppy, she was your friend during her first year of college, but now she dates a bully (Tyler Williams) but that's not a problem for you. When you go back to 1896 she still appears sometimes in dreams and visions and you can get to know her a little deeper. The decision is yours to continue investing your efforts into bringing her into your arms or moving on and finding better girls. (Like the ones below).<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2653130/extras/07.png?t=1726466044\" /><br><br><strong>Diane</strong><br>Diane is introduced to you in the first chapter when you need to buy guns to hunt animals. This girl came from London to the wild west to sell guns and try to run a business in the desert. Soon after she is introduced, she will accompany you through several scenes throughout the Gameplay and you will have options to leave her as just a friend, a faithful girlfriend or make her another one of the depraved girls in your harem.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2653130/extras/08.png?t=1726466044\" /><br><br><strong>Dakota</strong><br>You meet Dakota in the prologue right when you go back to 1896, their first moments together are a little atypical (You find her naked bathing in a lake, and she shoots you right after) but later she becomes more of a faithful companion who will follow you throughout the story. At first she will be a bit harsh and tough but as you progress she will open up more and more to you. (In every way you can imagine).<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2653130/extras/09.png?t=1726466044\" /><br><br><strong>Jane</strong><br>Jane, like Diane, also came from Europe to venture into the wild west, she was recently widowed and runs a local horse stable. You also meet her in the first chapter and she will teach you how to ride a horse, you will also help her to avenge the death of her late husband and you will be able to guarantee interesting rewards with this.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2653130/extras/10.png?t=1726466044\" /><br><br><strong>Clarice</strong><br><br>The sheriff of Goldfield (But not for long), you meet her in the first chapter when you go with Diane and her to the forest to look for bandits.
