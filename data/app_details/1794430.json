It is built around key historical events: Dracula's first ascension to the throne of Valahia. Vlad Tepes is held as a political prisoner / hostage at the Ottoman Court when he learns the Hungarians invade Valahia, killed his family and offer the throne to their own servant. In response, sultan Murad sends Dracula with an Ottoman army to take his rightful throne and stop Valahia from joining another crusade. But not everyone wants Dracula to rule, he has many enemies, even in the Ottoman capital of Edirne.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1794430/extras/2_-_playable_characters.png?t=1727287323\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Different play styles </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">First of all this is a platformer, so mastering the character's mobility and momentum while crossing the terrain is a challenge in itself, and is part of the core experience.
