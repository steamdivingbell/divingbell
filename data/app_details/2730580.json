{"about_the_game":"This a side-scrolling gal-shooting game, which is an old project I made in the past, and only has one level. Just earning a listing fee, and there will be no updates in the future. The game will last about 5 minutes, so if you don\u2019t like it, just refund it. If you are willing to support and keep this product, sincerely thank you! ! At first, I decided to sell it for US$0.2, but this is far lower than the minimum price limit on Steam. The game can only be discounted after launch, and the lowest discount at launch can only be 40%. <br>Accroding to Steam policy, discounts are allowed once every two months. Our original plan was to offer a 80% discount during the holiday/discount period. With the full price of the game at a low cost, unfortunately, Steam only allows a discount rate of 44%.<br><br><strong> WASD Move </strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2730580/extras/Move.gif?t=1705074355\" /><br><br><strong> K Shoot </strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2730580/extras/Shoot.gif?t=1705074355\" /><br><br><strong> U Switch </strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2730580/extras/Switch.gif?t=1705074355\" /><br><br><strong> L Dash </strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2730580/extras/Dash.gif?t=1705074355\" /><br><br><strong> J Charged Attack </strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2730580/extras/Charged_Attack.gif?t=1705074355\" /><br><br><strong> J Full Charged Attack \u00b7 Prification </strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2730580/extras/Prification.gif?t=1705074355\" /><br><br><strong> Shooting consumes MP </strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2730580/extras/MP.gif?t=1705074355\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Spikes! !","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2730580/8954874887c352ec50d8622d3f897e2a1b3f5f46.jpg"},{"name":"Do not enter!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2730580/196e581b825ff7712bd67b0cc8ae9a914fe70f10.jpg"},{"name":"\uff08\u25cf\u00b4\u2200\uff40\uff09\u266a","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2730580/32acd73ede2186f863fdd869186996269b714deb.jpg"}],"total":3},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2730580/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1705074355","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2730580/page.bg.jpg?t=1705074355","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2730580/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1705074355","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2730580/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1705074355","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This a side-scrolling gal-shooting game, which is an old project I made in the past, and only has one level.
