{"about_the_game":"Merry Christmas!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSanta Claus is ready to take over your soul and gain a few more years of life. He only needs two days to get all the resources he needs for the ritual, so this is your time to escape!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can escape on your own or finish off Santa, it's up to you, but we don't know how to finish him off yet... Just make sure he don't catch you or he will just make your life difficult.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTechnical details:<br />\r\nChristmas Horror is a short horror FPS (first-person-shooter) game where you must find a way to escape Santa's house using the scattered items around. You have two ways of escaping and even a way to finish santa forever! As a child, you have severe limitations such as carryng only 1 item per time and of course, being slowly than Santa. The game has no save system, so you just have one chance to escape.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGood Luck and remember, be a nice child and maybe he forgives you.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"By Sleigh","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1813140/c4a7d8af03ded5173923414896d4bf0ca2cf548e.jpg"},{"name":"By Boat","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1813140/931bc125e7da304feb487c8869da59847bea0286.jpg"},{"name":"The Old Man Fell","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1813140/9c729c3513019f188daafc6c917030b883ed50ee.jpg"},{"name":"Let's Call It a Day","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1813140/75d59ea8e73ceb73c4853448b22f62de87e662b8.jpg"},{"name":"Let's Call It a Day x2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1813140/97d66f58f25894c6dd48b886a2ad571101a4c9cf.jpg"},{"name":"Let's Call it a Day x3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1813140/f52803051b1063b12fa9c378ff1d8e1fa65bbad6.jpg"},{"name":"Bad Boy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1813140/bfd8f231c63568ca2488c5ae532cdb24625fd247.jpg"},{"name":"Dangerous Child","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1813140/cb49ae1e24f383ecd2110a7f1736904871e7f35a.jpg"},{"name":"Hard Way","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1813140/7922006b8d3a685543a4b3a0d9982b66e6b4cbc5.jpg"},{"name":"I Can Hear You","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1813140/4fa37a054878b20f09c4c1907dc84a191a5ac3c5.jpg"}],"total":10},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813140/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1707161439","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813140/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1707161439","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813140/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1707161439","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813140/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1707161439","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Merry Christmas!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSanta Claus is ready to take over your soul and gain a few more years of life.
