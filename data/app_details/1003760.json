{"about_the_game":"Aether Way is a 2D space RTS with action/roguelike elements. You play as some abstract life form, that travels across the space and evolves.

The heart was born by the Greater Sun and was sent out to explore the world outside. The heart lives in stars. Being in a star, the heart can control the flow of life and keep a star system alive. </i><br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br>- procedurally generated space.<br>- combination of strategy and action.<br>- a semi-abstract setting with no spaceships, but with space, full of living beings.<br>- auto control system, which allows you to focus on planning your actions instead of units' direct control.<br>- strategy with important role of front lines and transport routes.<br>- optional economy system with production chains, markets and resource flow.<br><br><br><strong>Activities:</strong><br>- strategy - control your forces and conquer star systems to overthrow enemy races because they will try to do the same to you.<br>- action - use your guardian to explore the space, fight enemies, find treasures and other stuff.<br>- events - happen randomly or can be triggered by a player.
