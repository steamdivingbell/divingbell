Set in a unique medieval dark fantasy universe, Gloomhaven rewards strategic planning and problem solving.\u00a0<strong>Face this dark world alone or in online co-op for up to 4 players!</strong><br><br>Explore the world in a band of 2 to 4 mercenaries. Each of the <strong>17 unique characters comes with their own skills</strong> and more than <strong>1,000 different abilities to master!</strong> Prepare your deck of ability cards before setting out to explore the dark caves and dreadful forest of Gloomhaven through quests and events. <br><br>Once inside a dungeon, <strong>engage in tactical turn-based combat</strong> by selecting two cards for each mercenary on every turn. You can only use the top half of one and the bottom half of another, so plan accordingly! <br>Move up your hired blades on the hex grid terrain to take advantage of the dungeon\u2019s environment. <strong>Set up deadly combos</strong> and unleash devastating powers but be wary of the cost. Cards are a resource as scarce and crucial as your life points, so watch out for exhaustion. <strong>Every choice has life or death consequences.</strong><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/780290/extras/GLH_pageSteam_03.gif?t=1736435069\" /><br>Hone your abilities during the game with enhancements and perks, while <strong>your power increases with level ups and new equipment.</strong> You need every advantage you can to survive here.
