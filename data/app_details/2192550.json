{"about_the_game":"<strong>MegaFactory Titan</strong> is a factory building game set on Saturn's moon Titan.<br><br>Strip mine an infinite world, build a sprawling smart factory, trade with colonists and merchants, and defend against pirates and scavengers who would steal your hard-earned resources.<br><br>Yet Titan is a prime spot for warring factions. Where settlers once purchased farms from you, soon you\u2019ll find factions requesting tanks, jets, and space warships. War may be inevitable, but for an industrial powerhouse like yourself, war is also profitable.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Smart Logistics</h2>No more conveyor belts. Build a factory with smart Maglevs that know where to send goods, sort automatically, handle loops, and count out exact quantities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Choose your Faction</h2>Each faction comes with its own unique play style. Try a maglev-oriented faction and build intricate webs of Maglevs Tubes. Or perhaps a faction focused on vehicles, and manage a fleet of automated rocket trucks. Or go all in aircraft and field a swarm of cargo quadcopters.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Infinite, Dynamic World</h2>The world is infinite, procedurally generated, and varies wildly with each playthrough. And it's completely alterable. Carve strip mines, flatten mountains, or fill in seas.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Enemies and Allies</h2>Build cities for colonists, sell weapons to rebels, or sell nukes to terrorists. But it's not all free trade. Pirates want your precious goods, scavengers want your scrap, and marauders want your land. Keep your guns supplied, your jets patrolling, or order up some orbital strikes!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">War is Brewing</h2>Two factions are in a battle for control of Titan. Pick a side and join the fight. Or if that\u2019s not your style, be an arms dealer, and supply weapons to both sides. Just watch out when the war spills over into your factory!","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2192550/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1666638070","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2192550/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1666638070","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>MegaFactory Titan</strong> is a factory building game set on Saturn's moon Titan.<br><br>Strip mine an infinite world, build a sprawling smart factory, trade with colonists and merchants, and defend against pirates and scavengers who would steal your hard-earned resources.<br><br>Yet Titan is a prime spot for warring factions.
