{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Call to Arms: The Warlord</h2> The time for battle is now! Monsters tumble out of the dark, wicked drow hatch vile plots, demons eager to invade the Material Plane clamor at the edges of reality, and bizarre aberrations pursue mad agendas that will plunge the world and all the planes into chaos. The people need champions to throw back the darkness, to take the fight to the dread enemies, and thwart their evil designs. While adventurers of all kinds answer the call to battle, from courageous fighters to cunning rogues, fell wizards and wise clerics, they aren't the only ones capable of take a brave stand. Joining them is a new breed of warrior: those brilliant tacticians and inspiring leaders known as warlords. These battle-hardened champions lead the charge into combat and through their insights, tricks, and stratagems, they enable all who fight at their sides to achieve their full potential to triumph in the face of any adversity.<br> <i>Call to Arms: The Warlord</i> returns a popular archetype from older editions of the world's most popular roleplaying game to the present. First and foremost a leader, warlords aid their allies through their design and implementation of brilliant combat plans. A welcome addition to any group, warlords can help turn the tide of battle, snatching ultimate victory from the jaws of certain defeat!","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2057320?t=1659447199","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2057320?t=1659447199","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2057320/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1659447199","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2057320/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1659447199","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Call to Arms: The Warlord</h2> The time for battle is now!
