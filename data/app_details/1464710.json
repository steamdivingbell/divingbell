{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Pathfinder 2 RPG - Society Scenario #1-08: Revolution on the Riverside</h2>A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 1-4 (subtiers 1-2 and 3-4).<br>Venture-Captain Bjersig Torrsen has set out the call for a group of Pathfinders to compete in a race known as the Balgirdtrek. Taking place in the Land of the Linnorm Kings, this race is an annual event that includes participants from both the Varki and Ulfen people of the region. Bjersig hopes that by having the PCs participate, they might not only bolster the Society's reputation in the Saga Lands, but also document this exciting event. Although the Society has the organizers' official permission, some of the Ulfen competitors in particular see the Pathfinders' participation as an intrusion on their time-honored pastime. The true challenge of this race is not monsters or villains, but the harsh nature of the grueling marathon itself.<br><i>Written by:</i> <strong> Steven Hammond</strong><br><strong> Scenario tags</strong> : Repeatable<br><i>This product is not a PDF or accessible outside of Fantasy Grounds.
