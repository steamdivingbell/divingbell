Soar through captivating landscapes, from mystical forests to scary mansions, in search of these malevolent spirits. Utilize your flying skills and shoot all the ghosts, restore peace, and bring harmony to the realms in this visually stunning game.<br><br>Paper Dash \u2013 Ghost Hunt is an interactive game experience that is designed to ease your mind and have fun finding and shooting little ghosts.<br><br>Fast, relaxed, chaotic - You are free to enjoy the game any way you see fit as the only enemies of the game are ghosts that stay in place floating ominously. The movement is fast but the world itself is somewhat peaceful. This enables you to lean back and enjoy the different levels and the sensation of flying. It is an excellent game for relaxing and blowing off some steam after an exhausting day of hassle.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The game also features:</h2><br>\u2022 Beautiful visuals and soundtrack<br>\u2022 The experience of flying as a paper plane<br>\u2022 Intuitive and relaxing gameplay<br>\u2022 A moment of inner peace and happiness shooting ghosts<br>\u2022 A game that is enjoyable but doesn\u2019t take itself too series \u2013 lean back and have fun<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay Description</h2><br>You start as a tiny paper plane in a giant world.<br><br>You move continuously forward and are free to fly wherever you want.<br><br>After you have played around a little and enjoyed the sensation of flying as well as explored the giant environments for the first time you start to discover nearby areas. Very soon you will find all those pesky ghosts floating around in the environment.<br><br>Soon you will figure out that there is a solution to the problem. Just shoot at them!<br>Keep an eye on the counter to see if you have enemies left to find and follow the arrow thats conveniently pointing you towards them.<br><br>Once you have destroyed all ghosts in a level, a second wave of them will spawn and later a third and a fourth wave. Every level is structured in 4 waves and once you have finished all of them you will be able to enter the next level and explore more of the giant world with your small paper plane.<br><br>The overall game is still pretty relaxing as after all your enemies are balloons and do very little to defeat themselves from your attacks. It\u2019s a unique mix of exploration, relaxation and a minimalistic ghost combat system that brings fun without the need of too much thinking or strategizing.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"World 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2396140/76ee6d462ced22c96667722c0c9aaf3bac9b216b.jpg"},{"name":"World 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2396140/76ee6d462ced22c96667722c0c9aaf3bac9b216b.jpg"},{"name":"World 3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2396140/76ee6d462ced22c96667722c0c9aaf3bac9b216b.jpg"},{"name":"World 4","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2396140/76ee6d462ced22c96667722c0c9aaf3bac9b216b.jpg"},{"name":"World 5","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2396140/76ee6d462ced22c96667722c0c9aaf3bac9b216b.jpg"},{"name":"World 6","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2396140/76ee6d462ced22c96667722c0c9aaf3bac9b216b.jpg"},{"name":"World 7","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2396140/76ee6d462ced22c96667722c0c9aaf3bac9b216b.jpg"},{"name":"World 8","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2396140/76ee6d462ced22c96667722c0c9aaf3bac9b216b.jpg"},{"name":"World 9","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2396140/76ee6d462ced22c96667722c0c9aaf3bac9b216b.jpg"},{"name":"World 10","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2396140/76ee6d462ced22c96667722c0c9aaf3bac9b216b.jpg"}],"total":11},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396140/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725288593","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396140/page.bg.jpg?t=1725288593","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396140/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725288593","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396140/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725288593","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Embark on an relaxing adventure as you take on the role of a courageous paper plane hunting down evil ghosts that haunt vibrant worlds across dimensions.
