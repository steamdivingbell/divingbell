{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Shadow of the Demon Lord Adventure Pack 2</h2>  Four Shadow of the Demon Lord adventures for Expert level characters <br>  <br> <br> <strong> He Sees You When You're Sleeping (Expert)</strong> <br> <br> The Demon Lord's shadow looms over Urth, growing stronger with each passing day, and every terrible deed and sacrifice performed in his name. As winter falls across the lands, old legends stirred by the Shadow come to life once more. Ancient evils that few remember rise again to resume their nocturnal wanderings, spreading darkness, suffering, and death wherever they roam. <br> This adventure is set in the small village of Hund, where a terrible monster threatens those among them who are the most vulnerable: their children. A fledgling cult has taken root in an abandoned asylum just outside the settlement, engaging in vile and dark magic to harness the essence of a horrific demon called the Krampus: a malevolent entity infamous for hunting, terrorizing, and killing children all across R?l. <br> Combat encounter maps included: Hirnschule Asylum <br>  <br> <br> <strong> Quintet (Expert)</strong> <br> <br> Time to Die! <br> The small town of Flenfeld was a prosperous farm settlement, blessed with good weather and harvests bountiful enough to keep its folk fed most years. But when the player characters discover the settlement deserted, with no immediately obvious signs of strife or skullduggery, they find themselves caught up in the dark aftermath of an unspeakable horror. <br> Flenfeld's shrine to the New God was built upon the broken ruins of an ancient monastery, beneath which are secret catacombs and caverns long lost to memory. Deep within these forgotten chambers a diabolical evil has bided its time, and is now set to rise once more. <br> Combat encounter maps included: Shrine of Virtue, Catacombs, Torture Halls, Halls of Fire, Sanctuary of Light <br>  <br> <br> <strong> The Gorgon's Tears (Expert)</strong> <br> <br> This adventure might either introduce a major player back into the politics of the world under the Shadow of the Demon Lord, or strike a blow against the darkness by eliminating her. It makes for an ideal bridge between expert and master levels of play. The characters complete the adventure when they confront the gorgon Lachrymosa in her lair and either defeat her or join her in conquering the city under which she lives. <br> Combat encounter maps included: Theatre, Sanctum, Upper Vault <br>  <br> <br> <strong> Wretched (Expert)</strong> <br> <br> Something dwells in the reeking swamp near the village of Fimmoran. The locals say it's a witch who has cursed their children with an unnatural disease. The people of Fimmoran want the crone's head and are willing to pay for it. There is a twist in this black-hearted tale, though--a twist the characters will discover when they venture into the swamp. The adventure ends when the characters determine the true cause of the children's sickness and deal with the repercussions of that discovery. <br> Combat encounter maps included: none <br>  <br> Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by: Kevin Heffernan <br> Requires: An active subscription or a one time purchase of a Fantasy Grounds Full or Ultimate license and the Shadow of the Demon Lord ruleset.
