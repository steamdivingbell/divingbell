I am a teacher and a fan of independent games. I have always wanted to develop independent games through my own efforts and integrate education into the games. <br>It took me more than a year to create more than 200 logical puzzles. At the same time, I used the basic RM game development technology to develop this pure puzzle game in my spare time outside of education. <br>The function of this game is extremely simple, and it doesn't even have a multilingual function, because I haven't learned it yet, but I will continue to work hard to learn the game development technology, and what I hope more is that you can experience the joy of logical thinking in solving problems through this game. I also hope to bring the fun of parent-child education to families with children. <br>Through the YATB series of games, we can combine games with education, teach for fun, and exercise the logical thinking skills of game enthusiasts and children who solve puzzles. <br>I hope this simple and challenging game can get your love and support, which will inspire me to continue to adhere to my concept and continue to develop independent games that integrate education into the game.
