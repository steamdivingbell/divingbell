{"about_the_game":"The story follows Francis Black, a down on his luck, borderline alcoholic, private investigator. He lives his life surviving one day at a time, doing odd jobs for anyone willing to send some coin his way, and spends what little money is left after paying for food and lodging in the nearby pub. The setting is a crime infested city in a fictional version of early 1900\u2019s United States.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne morning when Francis is woken up from a particularly bad hangover, he finds himself forced to investigate the grisly murder of a dancer from the local nightclub. She was found in her apartment with her head cut off, and the head is nowhere to be found. Said nightclub is owned by the criminal outfit running the city\u2019s booze and drugs, and they want Francis to find the killer before the cops. Francis normally stays out of gang related business; he\u2019s smart enough to not stick his neck where it doesn\u2019t belong, lest it risks getting chopped of. This time however, he has little choice in the matter. Francis will need to get his hands dirty whether he likes it or not. Sometimes you just need to take a deep breath and dive in to the dark waters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrancis will have to solve the case, all while keeping himself safe from both the gang, the police, and not to mention the brutal killer. It's a hard-boiled noir thriller, filled with sex, drugs, and violence, in a world of questionable characters, where right and wrong is balanced on a razor sharp edge.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1300720/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1597878767","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1300720/page.bg.jpg?t=1597878767","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1300720/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1597878767","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1300720/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1597878767","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"Partial nudity.\r\nDrugs and alcohol.\r\nViolence."},"detailed_description":"The story follows Francis Black, a down on his luck, borderline alcoholic, private investigator.
