{"about_the_game":"Get <strong>all animals</strong> of the Banana Drama universe! The DLC includes: <br><br>- The giraffe (balanced)<br>- The tiger (balanced)<br>- The alpaca (balanced)<br>- The cockatoo (strong offense)<br>- The lion (strong offense)<br>- The cow (strong defense)<br>- The deer (strong defense)<br><br>With the purchase of this DLC you are supporting the developers and the further development of Banana Drama. Thank you very much!<br><br>All animal descriptions:<br><br>- Helicopter giraffe! Get the incredibly excited Banana Drama <strong>giraffe</strong> with this DLC. She has incredible balanced capabilities and is one of the best allrounders of all Banana Drama animals (&quot;balanced&quot; type). Sometimes she gets so excited that she can't stop spinning her head like a helicopter. Let's hope she doesn't fly away!<br><br>- Wow a tiger! Get the incredibly cute and sleepy Banana Drama <strong>tiger</strong> with this DLC. He has incredible balanced capabilities and is one of the best allrounders of all Banana Drama animals (&quot;balanced&quot; type). He is particularly proud of his beautiful coat and regularly impresses many female tigers with it.<br><br>- Alpapaca! Get the incredibly fluffy Banana Drama <strong>alpaca</strong> with this DLC. He has incredible balanced capabilities and is one of the best allrounders of all Banana Drama aimals (&quot;balanced&quot; type). Unfortunately, he is allergic to bananas and therefore often sneezes - he would like to point out that his sneezing is often mistaken for spitting. Please keep this in mind. <br><br>- Fly cockatoo! Get the incredibly agile Banana Drama <strong>cockatoo</strong> with this DLC. He has incredible offensive capabilities and is able to run/fly faster than others (&quot;strong offense&quot; type). Similar to his best friend &quot;Kiki the cockatoo&quot; his abilities are often underestimated due to his cute looks!<br><br>- Roaarrrr - the Lion! Get the incredibly proud Banana Drama <strong>lion</strong> with this DLC. He has incredible offensive capabilities and is able to run faster than others. A lion throwing bananas is a little unusual at first glance, but he has learnt this effective fighting technique from the monke(y)s!<br><br>- Cow (moo)! Get the incredibly sassy Banana Drama <strong>cow</strong> with this DLC. The cow has incredible defensive capabilities and is able to collect resources faster than others (&quot;strong defense&quot; type). The cow is very self-confident and often likes to show off its beautiful udder! <br><br>- Oh deer! Get the incredible shy Banana Drama <strong>deer</strong> with this DLC. He has incredible defensive capabilities and is able to collect resources faster than others (&quot;strong defense&quot; type). It's lucky that there are no roads or cars in Banana Drama, because that would be fatal for the deer!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2689270/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1701197458","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2689270/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1701197458","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2689270/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1701197458","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2689270/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1701197458","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Stats","id":15}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Get <strong>all animals</strong> of the Banana Drama universe!
