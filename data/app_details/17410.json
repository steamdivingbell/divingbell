In this seemingly utopian paradise, a crime has been committed, your sister has been framed and now you are being hunted. You are a Runner called Faith and this innovative first-person action-adventure is your story.                    <br><br>Mirror's Edge\u2122 delivers you straight into the shoes of this unique heroine as she traverses the vertigo-inducing cityscape, engaging in intense combat and fast paced chases. With a never before seen sense of movement and perspective, you will be drawn into Faith's world. A world that is visceral, immediate, and very dangerous.    <br><br>Live or die? Soar or plummet? One thing is certain, in this city you will learn how to run. From the makers of the groundbreaking Battlefield franchise, Mirror's Edge is an action-adventure experience unlike any other.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2>\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Move yourself</strong>: String together an amazing arsenal of wall-runs, leaps, vaults and more, in fluid, acrobatic movements that turns every level of the urban environment to your advantage and salvation.                    <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Immerse yourself</strong>: In first person every breath, every collision, every impact is acutely felt.
