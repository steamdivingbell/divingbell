{"about_the_game":"Continent of the Ninth Golden is an action MORPG. Players take part in the game as heroes of Blenheim to stand against Nefer, an evil villain trying to open a gate to the Netherworld and swarm the land with his infernal legion. C9 showcases quality visuals, strategic combat, and a gripping story. Choose a character that best represents how you want to experience the game. The five base classes -- Fighter, Hunter, Shaman, Witchblade, and Mystic -- can each upgrade into multiple advanced classes, all of which are unique in their skills, visuals, and play styles. The console-like controls, various skill combos, and RPG-based elements make C9 a satisfying choice for all fans of action games.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2356310/extras/ezgif.com-resize.gif?t=1734324175\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Unrivaled Action RPG</strong><br><br>Continent of the Ninth Golden is a wholly unique action MMORPG experience.
