Players will have to dodge swarms of bullets and battle huge bosses as they traverse the 20+ levels of the Infectophage tower.

Players have a safety net to fall back on, taking inspiration from modern classics like Dark Souls; players can restore lost lives by reclaiming them up from where they fell. As intense as that sounds, VECTORLORD offers multiple difficulty settings, plus options to tone down the neon glow for photosensitive players.","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1340880/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1592510497","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1340880/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1592510497","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1340880/extras/art_logo.png?t=1592510497\" /><br>Bits &amp; Bytes<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Classic \u201890s DOS-era aesthetics meet modern shooter in a world of neon excess.<br></li><li>Combine any two weapon power-ups into an even deadlier bullet-spraying hybrid.<br></li><li>Ascend the deadly Infectophage tower before it destroys the Vectorlord\u2019s world.<br></li><li>Replay earlier levels to gather resources, but beware - enemies grow stronger with time.<br></li><li>Shoot, teleport, kick, and master a variety of powerful tide-turning consumable items.<br></li><li>Not just for the hardcore.
