{"about_the_game":"<strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Description</h2></strong><br>Kakuro Blend is exactly like the puzzle, Kakuro, but with colors instead of numbers. Each puzzle contains a grid with initially empty squares and colorful triangles. The goal is to fill the squares to the right or below the triangles, so they mix to create the color within their respective triangles. These puzzles are designed to be difficult, with some mixed colors looking exactly alike but having different answers. Kakuro Blend includes 40 increasingly challenging levels, from 6\u00d76 to 15\u00d710, and 8 different color palettes that change up the game slightly so the player doesn\u2019t get used to the same mixtures. Kakuro Blend is simple, colorful, and challenging. If you enjoy tough puzzles, this game will satisfy you for hours.<br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2></strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Contains 40 increasingly challenging puzzles of different sizes and color palettes.<br></li><li>Over 10 hours of gameplay.<br></li><li>Easy-to-use and easy-to-understand interface making it extremely simple to play.<br></li><li>Simple controls, can be played entirely with a mouse.

Each grid square is a part of a vertical and horizontal clue. The color selection area has nine colors which are equidistant from each other on the RGB color wheel. This is so mixing colors didn't result in a lot of browns and greys. Also important to notice how the greens look kind of similar. In a lot of levels, the greens are almost indistinguishable from each other, but the way they mix with other colors are very different. This area also contains a lot of helpful tools that will make sure no player gets stuck on a level.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1535910/extras/colorSelection_.png?t=1619694888\" /><br><br>The color lab allows you to mix any of the given colors to try and match that mixture with the color clue you are working on.
