Objects with applied &quot;technology element&quot; will have special physical states, such as being more elastic, smoother, and heavier. The game is divided into multiple levels, and players need to use these objects with &quot;technology element&quot; applied to help them reach the end of each level. At the same time, there will be some props on the way, and by collecting these items, players can unlock hidden levels and true endings, revealing the true plot hidden beneath the surface.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3455330/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1739074617","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3455330/page.bg.jpg?t=1739074617","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3455330/d7bc8e06f70078cf3f14d75ea2dfb931bd252f2e/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739074617","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3455330/d7bc8e06f70078cf3f14d75ea2dfb931bd252f2e/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739074617","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game is a PC based third person top-down puzzle game.
