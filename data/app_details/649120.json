Experience one of the world's favorite games of strategy in a beautifully rendered fantasy world where magic is the norm, wielded with just a flick of the wrist. You won't find any stylised icon interfaces here - this is the way chess against an AI is meant to be played. Even though it is still in Early Access, this is an exquisitely polished single player game. A full release is planned for the inclusion of multi-player gaming. Featuring numerous levels of difficulty, this game will pose a challenge for players of all abilities, from beginners to grandmasters. With graphics rendered in Unreal Engine 4 and AI powered by the Stockfish Chess Engine, Magician's Gambit provides plenty of eye candy for casual gamers whilst still providing a real challenge for serious chess players.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/649120/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1504857621","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/649120/page.bg.jpg?t=1504857621","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/649120/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1504857621","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/649120/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1504857621","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/649120/extras/Product_Detail_Page_10.3.png?t=1504857621\" /><br><br>Magician's Gambit is a virtual reality makeover of Chess, a game that has captivated players for centuries.
