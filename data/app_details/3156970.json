Something's off in the sewer though, out of place sounds and moving shadows. Something stalks nearby, and it can hear you. Navigate the sewer quickly and quietly, whatever it is could be around any corner. You will need to pick up some items along to way to get through the sewer faster, various tools to see and know where you're going.
