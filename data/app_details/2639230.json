{"about_the_game":"The American Arcadia Original Soundtrack by Eduardo de la Iglesia features 34 songs composed exclusively for the escape from a retro-futuristic dystopia. A single Jigle of four notes combined with the melody of the theme \u201cDon\u2019t be a Fool\u201d (performed by the great Broadway singer Kyra Da Costa) and the Main Characters themes (Trevor, Angela, Javert, Vivian, and more) makes the music of American Arcadia a unique experience and adds to the narrative of the game. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEduardo\u2019s references for this Soundtrack are Jerry Goldsmith, Hans Zimmer and John Williams. Combining the central themes of the game with distinct leitmotifs for each character and situation, Eduardo\u2019s music elaborates a musical tapestry that encapsulates both eras - the 70s and the present - through a fusion of electronic and orchestral components.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2639230?t=1700063496","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2639230?t=1700063496","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2639230/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1700063496","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2639230/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1700063496","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The American Arcadia Original Soundtrack by Eduardo de la Iglesia features 34 songs composed exclusively for the escape from a retro-futuristic dystopia.
