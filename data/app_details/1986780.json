Set to fulfill his hellish mission, our heavy metal warrior heads to the streets of Bl\u00fcdstock equipped with his Kilmister-blessed weaponry.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArriving at street level, he realizes that his house is the last bastion of the &quot;Metallic Fortress&quot;, the name by which Bl\u00fcdstock is known, the flagship place and cradle of Heavy Metal. Finding himself surrounded by minions of the evil goddess Lillith, Robert fights his way through the angry mob to the sources of power.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHaving the path to trace under his choice, Robert will decide which party to conquer which he used to attend as a child, as this became a source of power after the incident with Father Judas, which allowed parties and concerts to celebrate Lilith's Faith.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce there, and after bathing in the electronic blood of his enemies, our dark paladin performs the sacred act of &quot;The Disc Change&quot;.
