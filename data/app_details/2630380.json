{"about_the_game":"It is raining and pouring. It's not your average thunderstorm, but a primordial one. This storm doesn't seem to stop. At the same time, the storm is also producing gospel chanting, leading to people being attracted to the concert. The Land of Illusions ends up becoming empty, giving the local bands no opportunity to perform for their people.<br><br>Based on an original screenplay by Emiko Hosokawa, you take control of one of four humanoids to set out and find the source of the concert. Originally based on a fangame album featuring an original score by <i>Chuhou Joutai</i> creator Susumu Takajima, you must traverse six stages of varying terrain to find the concert's mastermind. Whether you're alone or with a friend*, your own danmaku is imperative. This will not be an easy journey - you must dodge your enemies' danmaku and overcome their spell cards.<br><br>*Additional accessories may be required for local multiplayer modes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Four playable characters spanning different backgrounds<br></li><li>Four difficulty modes with different spell cards<br></li><li>A six-stage main game plus a post-game extra stage<br></li><li>A series of original characters created by Susumu Takajima and Emiko Hosokawa to fight against<br></li><li>1990s-style musical score by Susumu Takajima<br></li><li>Controller support<br></li><li>Co-op mode</li></ul>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2630380?t=1701993612","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2630380/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1701993612","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2630380/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1701993612","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2630380/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1701993612","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"It is raining and pouring.
