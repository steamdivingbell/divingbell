{"about_the_game":"Help two poor soul mates apart by destiny find each other over the ages!<br />\r\nTake control of two characters simultaneously and independently! Pick up all items and reunite the characters anywhere in the mazes. Do it as fast as you can so the poor souls can enjoy the rest of their lives together. The destiny will separate them in case they find each other before collet all items. The goal is make the characters meet as fast as possible after collecting all items.<br />\r\nSoulmaze is inspired in the belief in soul mates exploring love definitions while challenge the ambidexterity and multitask skills of the player.<br />\r\nThe blue soul is controlled by the left thumb stick or by the WASD keys and the red soul is controlled by the right thumb stick or by the arrow keys. There are 50 mazes divided into 5 ages that progressively challenge the player. The reference times to move forward through the mazes demands the simultaneous control of the character!
