{"about_the_game":"Help the duck survive! DUCKLYTE is a retro-style top-down shooter with roguelite elements that will challenge your skills. You play as a duck trying to survive as long as possible in a farm crowded with different and never ending enemies. Each time you level up, you can pick a random powerup to buff the duck, and from time to time there might be rain on the farm, forming small ponds where you can regen the health of the duck for a short while, helping its odds of surviving - but not for very long!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&gt; Main features:<br />\r\n- Randomly generated map;<br />\r\n- Progressively stronger enemies;<br />\r\n- 10+ different powerups, generating hundreds of possible builds;<br />\r\n- Time survived and enemy killed counters;<br />\r\n- Time leaderboard;<br />\r\n- Level-based system;<br />\r\n- Retro-style graphics;<br />\r\n- Steam Deck Playable.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2395380/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1719252359","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2395380/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1719252359","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2395380/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1719252359","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2395380/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1719252359","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Help the duck survive!
