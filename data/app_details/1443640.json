{"about_the_game":"8-bit hero Horace is often considered the unofficial mascot of the ZX Spectrum.

Dangerously large trucks, crazy speeding ambulances and short-sighted drivers all add to the fun. Having made it across alive, you can pick up your skis\u2026 and now you\u2019re going to have to cross back over. Which idiot built the shop there in the first place?<br><br>The second stage sees Horace pelting his way through a flagged course; stay within the race zone and you\u2019ll score plenty of points, but watch out for bumps in the course that\u2019ll send you zinging off in the wrong direction.<br><br>Finish the race and you get the best news of all: you get to do it all over again. But watch out for Horace\u2019s nemesis \u2013 you never quite know when he\u2019s going to appear!<br><br>Despite its apparent simplicity, Horace Goes Skiing cemented its place in gaming history with its mix of simplicity, arcade-action gameplay and a unique graphical style that many retro fans still hold a candle for to this day.<br><br>This lovingly remastered version is faithful to the original, offering retro fans and casual gamers alike a chance to experience the same thrill as the first generation of players had back in the day.

After Horace has successfully crossed the road, guide him into the door of the hut where he will fetch his skis. The charge for ski hire is $10. Horace should not enter the ski hut unless he can afford the hire charge. If Horace has spent all his money on ambulance fees, then he can accumulate points and money by crossing the road repeatedly, as at every 1000-point boundary, Horace receives a $10 bonus.

If Horace fails to pass between the flags a warning note is sounded and Horace will lose points. Horace can parallel left or right using the chosen control method. Horace increases his points by passing between the flags and he can also receive a 100-point bonus by passing through the finish barrier. As in the highway section, there is a $10 bonus at every 1000-point boundary. If Horace should hit a tree then he can continue on the slope provided that his skis do not break. If his skis do break then Horace must again cross the road for a new set of skis and then return across the road to the ski slopes. If Horace successfully completes the course with his skis intact then he must cross the road once with his skis to the next slope.</i>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1443640/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1652870115","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1443640/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1652870115","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1443640/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1652870115","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1443640/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1652870115","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"8-bit hero Horace is often considered the unofficial mascot of the ZX Spectrum.
