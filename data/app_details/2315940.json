Command a variety of sheep flocks for you to fight your way through hordes of fairy-tale creatures on a brutal revenge quest for the sake of all sheep and animals. Use your necromancy powers taught to you by your old mentor, Baba Yaga - It must be because of all of her evil ways that all of your sheep were killed! Battle, train and learn new abilities to gain an advantage on the big trolls, spitting flowers or kamikaze frogs! Earn their souls to upgrade your abilities and unlock new ways of fighting to fit your own playstyle, such as riding your sheep into battle! You must discover the unique aspects of the land, including solving puzzles, platforming or discovering the long lost skulls.
