Now let us begin what is Project Nautilus.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What to expect</h2>Project Nautilus is a first-person underwater exploration game where you, a menial drone operator, navigate through the depths as directed by your employer, the shady mega-corporation, Isthmus Corp. As Isthmus Corporation lays claim to a previously undiscovered cave system deep below the surface, you are assigned to survey the hidden caverns and uncover their secrets. You are entrusted to expand the company\u2019s wireless network with the placing of signal beacons as you explore. Your \u201ctrusty\u201d managerial AI, PASSION, guides you to use your drone harpoon and drill to break open pieces of the environment and propel yourself further down into the depths below. As you explore the rich, biodiverse cave network you begin to discover remnants of a lost civilization and cultural artifacts including sculptures, etchings, and even old architecture. However, you must remember your one goal from Isthmus Corp., reach the bottom of this cave system and see what lies below. <br><br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1953870/extras/IsthmusLogo_Steam.png?t=1651846620\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1953870/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1651846620","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1953870/page.bg.jpg?t=1651846620","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1953870/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1651846620","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1953870/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1651846620","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features of this Game</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Immersive Drone HUD<br></li><li>Expansive World<br></li><li>Narrative Rich Immersion</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hello Drone Operator #4861!</h2>Hello, and welcome to the Isthmus Corporation Family.
