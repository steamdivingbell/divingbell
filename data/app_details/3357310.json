{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Step into the Thrilling World of Asuka: The Ascent</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In this adrenaline-fueled racing game, where you follow Asuka Sakai, a spirited college student from a picturesque Japanese farming village with a secret passion for street racing. Inspired by her father\u2019s legendary racing past, she dives into the underground world of speed, rebellion, and rivalry, all while reluctantly studying architecture at his insistence. With a natural talent for tuning cars and an unyielding drive to challenge any opponent, Asuka rises as a notorious racer, admired and feared in equal measure. Her journey takes a dark turn when she encounters the enigmatic Shaitan Shadow crew, a dangerous faction in the racing world, pulling her into a web of secrets, betrayal, and high-stakes confrontations. Race through iconic landscapes, face off against fierce rivals, and navigate the twists of Asuka\u2019s journey as she grapples with loyalty, ambition, and the shadows of the racing underworld. Will she emerge victorious, or will the darkness consume her? Get ready for the ultimate racing adventure!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">--------------------------------------------</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A Fusion of Old and New</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game blends a casual, stylized aesthetic with detailed physics, immersing players in a rich atmosphere filled with captivating characters and storylines inspired by the charm of classic-era games and Japanese manga.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Diverse JDM Cars and Customization</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Choose from over 50 unique JDM-inspired cars, and upo to 100 variants with extensive customization options available. Fine-tune engines, transmissions, suspensions, exhausts, and tweak advanced settings like camshaft timings and even tire pressure. Use a dedicated dynamometer to analyze power, torque curves, and air-fuel ratios, ensuring your car performs at its peak.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Iconic Japanese Locations</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Race through stylized recreations of Japan\u2019s countryside on long (6\u201310 km) and short (1\u20132 km) courses. Weather and time-of-day variations affect handling, demanding strategic adaptations. Unique locations, such as Nagano\u2019s frozen lake and Gymkhana stadium, offer thrilling challenges with lucrative rewards.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Authentic Gameplay Experience</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Step into Asuka\u2019s life, from the local internet cafe filled with racing tales to the local mechanic for installations and tune-ups. Order parts online, manage your racing pursuits, and stay immersed in the world without constant menu navigation.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Compete in High-Stakes Races</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Compete across diverse formats like precision runs, drift challenges, and head-to-head battles to earn in-game currency. Engage with over 200 distinct rivals, each with a unique personality and driving style. Night races bring intense showdowns in parking lots along mountain passes, with non-linear rival discovery allowing players to strategically choose their battles.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Immersive Game Atmosphere</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The proprietary physics model built solely for this game authentically recreates the clunky, weighted feel of classic JDM sports cars. It incorporates realistic mechanics like torque curves, aerodynamics, slip dynamics, and even tire deformation. Combined with custom-branded cars, parts, and racing teams, the game offers a seamless, immersive experience that brings Asuka\u2019s story and the racing world to life.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">ASUKA: The Ascent is an arcade racing game and a work of fiction.
