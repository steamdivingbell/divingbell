{"about_the_game":"Discover what it feels like to be a wildlife photographer chasing both common and completely unfamiliar animals in remote corners around the world! Search for them on striking and realistic 360-degree panoramas of pristine scenery with 3D visual effects. High replay and educational value. Go through scenes again: there will be at least 4 sets of animals to find. In-game access to encyclopedia pages with detailed information about animals.<br><br>   In this game, your allies are crisp HD graphics, and animals' names and outlines; special hints are available in case the task gets too challenging. If you just want to relax, take in the sights and the actual sounds of a living forest, jungle, or savanna, and if you have a competitive streak, collect your photographic trophies! We are convinced that even wildlife experts will encounter some unusual and fascinating creatures here. Whenever you want to learn more about any of them, you can access encyclopedia pages with detailed information without leaving the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong> Key features:</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Realistic 360-degree panoramas and 3D views<br></li><li> Take in the sights and the actual sounds of a living forest, jungle, or savanna<br></li><li> Replay!
