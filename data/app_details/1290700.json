{"about_the_game":"&quot;PWN'ong Duel of Balls&quot; is a fun and exciting DLC that completely changes the game to more of a table tennis type of game with multiple balls!  The goal here is still to score more points than your opponent when the timer runs out, but scoring points comes by getting balls past your opponent rather than by breaking bricks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe longer a ball stays in play, the more points it is worth!  This makes for constant struggle and priority between players for the most point worthy balls in play.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe blow attack remains in this version, but not to blow your opponent!  Instead, you'll both be using your blow attack to try and hit balls near your opponent to deflect them into the goal at ridiculous speeds!  This is a truly unique aspect of the game that creates furious and exciting battles!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery character including call the DLC characters you own can be used in &quot;PWN'ong Duel of Balls&quot;!  They will be stripped of their unique powers and abilities but keep their look and personal traits such as paddle size and movement speed.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\n...Can you &quot;PWN&quot; at smashing balls when and where it counts?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1290700/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1587187779","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1290700/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1587187779","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1290700/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1587187779","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1290700/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1587187779","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;PWN'ong Duel of Balls&quot; is a fun and exciting DLC that completely changes the game to more of a table tennis type of game with multiple balls!
