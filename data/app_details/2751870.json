{"about_the_game":"<strong>Dr Muddles and the Cursed Library is a single player puzzle adventure game set in a mysterious library.</strong><br><br>As the talented but confused sorcerer Dr Muddles, you awake in a strange library with no memory of who you are or how you got there. Explore the library, learn powerful spells, and try to find a way out. As you progress, you'll meet a few other inhabitants of the library, many of whom may not have Dr Muddles' best interest at heart. You will also learn a powerful spell allowing you to split your soul into multiple copies, which you'll use to solve puzzles and access new parts of the library. But beware, powerful magic like that may come with a terrible price!<br><br>Dr Muddles is  best played with a gamepad, but works with keyboard and mouse controls as well.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2751870/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1711742633","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2751870/page.bg.jpg?t=1711742633","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2751870/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1711742633","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2751870/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1711742633","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>Dr Muddles and the Cursed Library is a single player puzzle adventure game set in a mysterious library.</strong><br><br>As the talented but confused sorcerer Dr Muddles, you awake in a strange library with no memory of who you are or how you got there.
