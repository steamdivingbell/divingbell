{"about_the_game":"1. The inspiration for the production of this game comes from an ancient game. I think it is no worse than the game 'Push Box', but it did not catch on. I feel very sorry that it did not catch on. Therefore, in order to pay tribute, a game with a similar gameplay was specially created<br />\r\n2. The game controls are very simple. WSAD controls the character to move up, down, left, and right. The left mouse button launches a snowball to obtain a push ice block, and the right mouse button allows you to create a snowman in a blank space<br />\r\n3. The gameplay is also very simple. Pushing ice blocks onto the water surface can freeze the water surface, allowing you to pass the level by eating all the small stars. There are different props to help you succeed, and there will be many enemies to prevent you from passing the level<br />\r\n4. As it is the first version of the game, the difficulty is moderate, and there will be some difficulty in the later stages. However, with more operations and observation, you can pass the level<br />\r\n5. This is a huge team development with an investment of billions, developed by one person, myself. Thank you for the support of all players. This is my first official game to be launched, and I modified it overnight. After completing it, I personally tested it countless times, and I don't have high expectations for myself. As long as the negative review rate is below 50, it's good. There are also many game ideas, but this is only the initial version<br />\r\n6. If there are any bugs, please let me know directly because there are no dedicated testers, and there may be a lot of bugs. Once I find them, I will promptly correct them","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2631300/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1697797087","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2631300/page.bg.jpg?t=1697797087","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2631300/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1697797087","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2631300/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1697797087","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"1.
