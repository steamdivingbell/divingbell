{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Step into the chilling world of <i>Whispers of the Dead</i>, a psychological horror game that blurs the lines between love, fear, and reality. The story begins with Eve Levine, a college student caught in a nightmare after being abducted on a rainy evening in the shadowy St. Peters Park. Her fianc\u00e9, Adam Hale, a poet haunted by his own creations, must confront the darkness that emerges from his mysterious writings.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As Adam, you\u2019ll navigate his dimly lit apartment, gathering scattered poems that weave cryptic tales of the seven deadly sins. Each verse pulls you deeper into a web of eerie phenomena, unexplained sounds, and unsettling encounters. But the true terror lies in what these poems foretell\u2014a connection to Eve\u2019s fate and the horrors yet to come.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The nightmare intensifies as the story shifts to Eve, who awakens in a desolate forest, surrounded by whispers and shadows.
