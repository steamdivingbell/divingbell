{"about_the_game":"For the better part of a year, Bozo Gunk entertained guests outside the Pearl Sluggers stadium ahead of every home game. He quickly became a beloved and well-known character among fans, but one day he simply disappeared. When asked for information on what happened to their favorite mascot, the Pearl Sluggers management simply replied &quot;Wait, who? We never had a clown work here.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe fate of Bozo Gunk remained unclear and fans were left wondering what had become of him, but a mysterious crime spree and series of (still unsolved) kidnappings did come to an end around the time of his disappearance. Last week, old-time fans were surprised to see an old friend reappear near the Pearl Slugger stadium to spread cheer and happiness once more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis DLC contains a custom skin for Snork Gunk in Awesomenauts. You need to have Snork Gunk available as a playable character in order to access the skin in-game. Owning this skin will also unlock the special portrait for use in-game. This skin contains a fully customized voice set.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/634016/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1665422965","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/634016/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1665422965","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/634016/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1665422965","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/634016/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1665422965","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Valve Anti-Cheat enabled","id":8},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"For the better part of a year, Bozo Gunk entertained guests outside the Pearl Sluggers stadium ahead of every home game.
