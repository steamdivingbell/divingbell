{"about_the_game":"Former Future is a strategic 2D top-down shooter where you face an invading alien threat on the frontier world of Saturn and its neighboring moons.  The enemy has taken control of many of humanity\u2019s bio-dome cities by causing the city's robots to turn against the residents. For the good of humanity, you must retake control of these cities. After you dock your spaceship, you will only have a small time window to attack objectives within the city before the enemy discovers your presence and mounts a counter attack. You must strategically choose which objectives to attack, and the types character upgrades and defenses to construct. To recapture the city, you must destroy them in their final assault.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Intense and tactical 2D shooter combat <br></li><li>Strategize and plan your attack to recapture randomly generated cities<br></li><li>Unlock new equipment and abilities to customize your character<br></li><li>Innovative class and ability system allows for deep but intuitive character building<br></li><li>Stellar soundtrack<br></li><li>Take on challenging missions with a friend in local Co-Op </li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About the developer</h2>Former Future is the passion project of Quinn Morrison.
