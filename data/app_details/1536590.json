Right now everything's in Single Player BUT this will also be a jump-off point for Players to host their own Cyclotron Races and Crucible Battles later. There's a Materials Selector and a selection of different series of Accelerator Tunnel Prefab parts...

Right now most Prefabs go up to about Mark V or VI. I could easily see them going up to XIII. The speeds you can attain are really something.

Stay negatively charged, Friends!<br><br><strong><u>Isotope Chamber Minigame</u></strong><br>The Isotope Chamber Minigame is in full service, less the online Leaderboard Stats [which we plan on doing for sure, and we'll sync all top scores when that happens].<br><br>The Isotope Chamber is a simple Clicker Minigame where you fire subatomic particles and antiparticles at Atoms you have created to try to discover as many different Isotopes as you can. We already had it out with version 1.0.1, but our Atom system wasn't fully fleshed out and we only had a measly 1,200 out of the now nearly 3,200 Isotopes known to Science. (I hit the books and made sure we had every Isotope discovered).<br><br>Now that the Isotope Data Set is COMPLETE, you can start from a simple Hydrogen Atom and bombard it with Neutrons until it becomes Helium, then Lithium and so on up to the very heaviest elements, or go from the heaviest elements and get chain fission reactions and mayhem in the chamber that would absolutely kill you dead in Campaign Mode. Chip away at Atoms a bit at a time and watch them fall to pieces or detonate with the Antiproton and Antineutrons.<br><br>All of the Isotopes have real half-lives calculated in real time, so theoretically you could leave the game running for millions of years and never get some Isotopes to decay unless you shoot them.<br><br>Isotope Chamber now keeps track of your stats, showing:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>How many unique Isotopes you've Discovered,<br></li><li>The number of Atoms you manually Created,<br></li><li>The number of Particles/Antiparticles you Emitted in the Chamber, and <br></li><li>Elapsed Time.<br></li><li>Top Ten Scores as you continue playing. It weights scores by Discovered Isotopes over Time, with a minor portion being from Atom and Particle Spawns.</li></ul><br>We have more ideas on score weighting and future plans for how the Isotope Chamber works. Meanwhile...<br><br><u><strong>Improvements:</strong></u><br><br>Upgrades:<br>Atom Catalog has been overhauled to work more with our vision going forward where it will be a sort of Atomic Spellbook.

Messages happen once for each, etc.<br><br>Weapon switching priority likely optimized - I know people have opinions about that stuff. I made it so that if you had a weapon selected and run out of Particles, when you get enough Particles again, you'll automatically switch back to your last used Weapon.<br><br>Player Weapons updated with tracers.<br>Weapon burst code updated for Neutron Salvo and Gamma Ray Burst.<br><br>Neutrons now add +1 to maximum cycle damage [although they don't repair damage], in addition to their mass and use as &quot;ammo&quot;.<br><br>Antimatter upgraded with its own Chemical Symbol notation similar to Atoms, showing you a rough idea of its &quot;Hit Points&quot; i.e. Antiparticle Score you're trying to zero out with the S.C.I.E.N.C.E.

The notation also shows ionization charge as well so you know how many Positrons it may spawn when destroyed.<br><br>Downstream Interactions like collisions with Alpha Particles now result in the creation of a deionized Helium-4 Atom [after they damage your GyroCycle and remove some of your Electrons, that is], which floats away innocently, mocking you.
