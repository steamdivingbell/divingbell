{"about_the_game":"A 2.5D co-op puzzle platformer where the players control a small robot crab attempting to return back home to Earth. Unbeknownst to them, they are the sole survivors from a dilapidated space station. One robot crab harnesses the power of gravity manipulation, bending the laws of physics as they please. The other harnesses control over the space station, rotating the orientation to their liking. With these gifts, you must shift the world around you and explore every avenue if there is any hope of escape.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2988850/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1720871425","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2988850/page.bg.jpg?t=1720871425","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2988850/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1720871425","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2988850/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1720871425","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A 2.5D co-op puzzle platformer where the players control a small robot crab attempting to return back home to Earth.
