{"about_the_game":"Inspired by classics such as &quot;Monkey Island&quot; and &quot;Broken Sword&quot;, intriguing and seducing like a &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; parody, &quot;The Secret of Middle City&quot; is an adventure that takes place in a typical north-american mountain town and that sees the protagonist, the goofy and clumsy Federal Agent Cox, strive among mysteries and false leads in order to solve a weird case of presumed homicide.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the story unfolds, Agent Cox will interact with over 60 characters and will travel along the entire Middle City, its woods and its mountains in order to shed light on the plot and finally be able to solve the case.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd remember! In Middle City nothing and no one is like it appears: secret societies, presumed aliens, weird animals, beautyful girls and tyrannical characters will keep our hero in good company and they will guide him throughout 50 game locations.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/535370/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1494669898","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/535370/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1494669898","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/535370/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1494669898","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/535370/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1494669898","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":535450,"description":"The Secret of Middle City Demo"}],"detailed_description":"Inspired by classics such as &quot;Monkey Island&quot; and &quot;Broken Sword&quot;, intriguing and seducing like a &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; parody, &quot;The Secret of Middle City&quot; is an adventure that takes place in a typical north-american mountain town and that sees the protagonist, the goofy and clumsy Federal Agent Cox, strive among mysteries and false leads in order to solve a weird case of presumed homicide.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the story unfolds, Agent Cox will interact with over 60 characters and will travel along the entire Middle City, its woods and its mountains in order to shed light on the plot and finally be able to solve the case.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd remember!
