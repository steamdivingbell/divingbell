You\u2019ll need your wits and reflexes to make it out alive.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Attacks will never miss by random chance but an attack <i>can</i> miss if you select an empty target or attempt to attack an enemy while they\u2019re attacking. Be sure to pay attention and not rush! You can also toggle the speed gauges to fill more quickly to reduce waiting time.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You\u2019ll also need to be careful managing your items.
