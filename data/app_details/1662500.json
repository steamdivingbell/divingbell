It might not be the best sniper, but if you get close to your enemies, they\u2019ll be in some real trouble, because your DPM is pretty impressive. <br><br><strong>Firepower.</strong> The Tiger 131 boasts very good DPM, aiming time and accuracy. If you\u2019re all about damage dealing, then this is a perfect choice for you at Tier VI. This Tiger struggles to snipe at long distances unless you give the correct amount of lead. As they say, practice makes perfect\u2014you\u2019ll eventually get used to it.  <br><br><strong>Speed.</strong> A good traverse speed helps with angling your armor and will mean your enemies have less chance of penetrating it. <br><br>The <strong>Tiger 131</strong> was captured by the British Army\u2019s 48th Royal Tank Regiment in Tunisia. The British performed a full examination of the tank, and eventually it became part of an exhibit at the Bovington Tank Museum.
