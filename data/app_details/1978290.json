The obstacles you will find on the way will challenge your previously gained experience from other games and most likely give you a headache or some grey hairs.<br>Experience a different type of puzzle solving that you arent used to. By introducing the concept of second person puzzle solving you will meet and have to interact with puzzels that you cant solve from refrencing older games.
