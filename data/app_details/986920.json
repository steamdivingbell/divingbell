We have a LooOOoOOOOoong list of game modes planned, which will be implemented through free updates based on the game's success. <br><br>In v.1.0, we have the following game modes implemented:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Last Baby Standing - Survive the longest!</h2> A classic free-for-all, where the winner of the round is the last baby standing (duh). After a set time limit, a sudden death mode activates that makes explosions increasingly dangerous. Intense, short matches.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/986920/extras/lastBabyStanding1.gif?t=1635432305\" /><br><br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Deathmatch - Blow up the most opponents!</h2> The babies are DOOMED! A variation of Last Baby Standing with instant respawns and frag counters... The baby with the most kills after the timer runs out is the winner. Also, the NPC babies are bullets. Deal with it.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/986920/extras/deathmatch1.gif?t=1635432305\" /><br><br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Team Deathmatch - Blow up the most opponents! With a friend!</h2>Like above, but the player babies are split into two teams. Friendly fire is ON! Always! Again - the team with the most kills is the winner.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/986920/extras/deathmatch1.gif?t=1635432305\" /><br><br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Baby Of The Hill - Stay alone within the circle!</h2>Another classic. The aim is to stay alone in the circle (a.k.a. &quot;hill&quot;), which can move or change position depending on the level. The baby who reaches the score limit first is the winner.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/986920/extras/babyOfTheHill1.gif?t=1635432305\" /><br><br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Baby Pong -  Launch babies to opponent's goal!</h2>Also known as Baby Soccer, the aim of this 2v2 game mode is to launch the NPC babies (trapped in a bouncy bubble, obviously) to the goals on the other team's side. Cheating is allowed!<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/986920/extras/babyPong1.gif?t=1635432305\" /></li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Baby Boom","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/986920/02b9cf9b90cfdf0f882e3fcd57e2a90f46350ccb.jpg"},{"name":"The Pacifier","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/986920/5a1047b7fa63658093fa443b0ab4efb5e964427f.jpg"},{"name":"Boss Baby","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/986920/4e58ca788265c342313cbbeeb978459ebc9f560e.jpg"},{"name":"So many Exploding Babies","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/986920/36cc6ec0149baf7c788272385218a21e33b560fc.jpg"},{"name":"A Lot of Exploding Babies","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/986920/4c11f523c2f2c2a27aee821aa6330471eba90646.jpg"},{"name":"Ludicrous amount of Exploding Babies","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/986920/40b010280179e8b23b39acecdcc18803c9015fb7.jpg"},{"name":"Baby Beckham","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/986920/c9c1cc3b5b13d1eba422d3f9e8f3033200e94b7b.jpg"},{"name":"Baby Messi","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/986920/c43a08e97bb0ed4da30944b3997b8370dd33ca59.jpg"},{"name":"Baby Litmanen","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/986920/f11cf7eb775375d585268f76b679ef7ef65512ec.jpg"},{"name":"Newborn of the Hill","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/986920/22f97297e555106d2e6bbe322c77c55f9f2cd41e.jpg"}],"total":34},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/986920/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1635432305","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/986920/page.bg.jpg?t=1635432305","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/986920/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1635432305","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/986920/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1635432305","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Acts of comic violence - this game is about exploding babies.
