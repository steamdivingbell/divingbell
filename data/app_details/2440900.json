{"about_the_game":"Over thousands of years, mankind has invented several variations of tag. Experience one of the most amazing and unique of them - the Indian game of kho-kho - brought to life as a multiplayer experience. Your choices determine which parts of the field you can tag opponents in: use the switch-blocks in the middle section of the field and the bright-green free zones at either end of the field to transition between different areas and hunt down other players for points. The game has a time structure, with each player given 60 seconds to tag and score points; matches are 1v1 or free-for-all with 3+ players.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat you're getting:<br />\r\n* A basic text tutorial<br />\r\n* Practice mode (you can experiment with tagging a dummy NPC in different parts of the field and learn how the game works)<br />\r\n* Multiplayer (the basic idea is that each player has a 60-second turn to tag others, and the player with the most points at the end of the match wins. Defenders can evade taggers by going into the red parts of the field, and the taggers can use certain parts of the field to change which areas are red or green. Players that are tagged respawn, so a single defender can be tagged multiple times by the same tagger.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIssues with the game:<br />\r\nSome features don't work correctly. For example, the rematch feature does not work properly yet, the tiebreaking is nonfunctional, and the Survivor game mode (an additional game mode on top of the Classic mode described above) is only partially functional.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFuture of this game:<br />\r\nMore sports might be added, such as Langdi (a hopping form of tag).","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2440900/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1694198552","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2440900/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1694198552","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2440900/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1694198552","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2440900/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1694198552","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Over thousands of years, mankind has invented several variations of tag.
