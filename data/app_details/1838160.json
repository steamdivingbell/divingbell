But the gameplay design inspired by the &quot;Dark Forest&quot; law in the famous science fiction novel: &quot;Three Bodies&quot;, makes this game a change from the traditional RTS operation of troop combat, more emphasis on the collection and analysis of information, and the choice of strategic direction.<br><br>In this universe with the &quot;Dark Forest&quot; law, players need to reasonably build economic, scientific research, and military facilities, and choose the congressional bill to meet the situation, to improve the economy, develop technology, protect the people, and maintain social stability. However, although the universe is large, but the resources in a certain area is always limited. In order to survive, exploration, colonization and expansion are inevitable steps. Sending out exploration satellites to gradually explore the unknown areas around; building military bases, space ports and other facilities for force clearance and immigration expansion, how to plan the distribution of resources and the direction of science and technology is crucial. And in the process of development, expansion and war, it will certainly be accompanied by the problem of depleted resources, reduced cohesion and increased pressure of social opinion. If these problems are out of control, your civilization will fall apart from within. How to balance all aspects, it depends on the player's wisdom.<br><br>However, because of the &quot;Dark Forest&quot; law, all civilizations will deliberately hide their traces and information. Such as the environment of other galaxies, the state of civilization, the attitude of the other civilization and the actions of each round, the player will have very limited access to information. Therefore, by improving technology and exploring, players need to try their best to collect and integrate information and make judgments at the strategic level. Especially when you encounter a civilization, do you want to stay silent and hide in the shadows, or do you want to communicate with it and risk exposing the coordinates to gain more information and benefits? Your decision will affect the survival of the civilization.<br><br>For an unknown civilization in the universe, if it is just a fleet attack, enough technology may be able to help you detect the actions of the other side, defend your home and win the war. But what if it's a mass bomb big enough to destroy the galaxy? Or what about an almost unstoppable light particle attack? Whether your civilization believes in science or gods, domination of the nations or the union of nations, conquest by force or peaceful development, the exposure of coordinates means that your civilization is in danger of destruction at any moment. Of course, you can also reverse the initiative to broadcast to the whole universe a competing or rival galaxy, so as to hide in the shadows and let others help you to solve your enemies. Hidden and exposed, peace and war, friendship and betrayal, will accompany the entire game.<br><br>The future of civilization is in your hands.
