Quickly! Before your short finite existence on this small wet rock hurtling around the sun ends you can find new meaning for yourself by playing this G.A.M.E. Or at least have some fun for a while and chase away the specter of your own mortality with about five hours of &quot;polished&quot; simulation &quot;fun&quot;.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Live the Dream!</h2>Create your own coffee shop and grow it to a franchise! Will your brand sell overpriced fancy coffee in a luxurious shop or will you provide organic free-range donuts surrounded by comfy second-hand furniture? It\u2019s all up to you! Customize and build your brand and take it all the way to the big leagues!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Experiment and Unlock!</h2>Create and combine ingredients to find over 200 drink and food recipes that even the customers didn\u2019t know they wanted. From something as simple as an espresso to taste bud abominations like the Bagelcino! It\u2019s your imagination versus your patrons\u2019 stomachs in a caffeine-fueled endurance match.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Manage Like A Boss!</h2>Hire staff and train them to barista mastery. Create a motley crew of surfers, baristas, hipsters, and giant autonomous mechs to make your franchise dream come true!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Thrill!</h2>Follow Ruby through a story of murder, betrayal, redemption, and well, coffee. Thrust into the spotlight you have been given the chance of a lifetime - prove yourself as an exceptional business mogul and win the inheritance of the Coffeebottom Estate. That is if you can survive the competition. *Cue Dramatic Music*<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Put Your Skills to the Test!</h2>Crazy events will require you to be ready to change up your gameplay on the fly. Did a tour bus full of seniors just park outside? Or did you decide to host local bands for a jam session? New customers are flooding in and the lines are long and customers are getting impatient and are out about to leave! Identify what the customers want and deliver it. Give your employees new orders, set out more chairs and tables, put more on your menu, and get those sweet sweet tips!  That master's degree isn't going to pay for itself!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Move on and Create New and Different Restaurants!</h2>If you can build and manage your coffee shop well enough you can move on to bigger challenges in more lucrative locations that may require strategic planning on your part. Will you run a coffee shop on a university campus the same way you would in a busy shopping center? It\u2019s up to you to brew your own destiny, but six unique bosses may stand between you and coffee riches!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/549240/extras/banner2.png?t=1680722210\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Who Has Time For Paragraphs?
