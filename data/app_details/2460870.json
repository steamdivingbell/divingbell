{"about_the_game":"&quot;Pathfinder 2 RPG - Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-02: Return to the Grave<br> <br> A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for 1st- through 4th-level characters. <br> Following the desolation of Lastwall at the hands of the Whispering Tyrant, untold horrors wander the woods and roads of the region now known as the Gravelands. Many small refugee settlements are scattered throughout the area, their citizens either helplessly trapped behind enemy lines, or stubbornly hoping that they won't be noticed by Tar-Baphon's undead armies. <br> One such settlement became a new home for a Pathfinder agent--a dedicated member of the Radiant Oath faction--who had been traveling in Lastwall when the nation fell. The agent decided to help those in need rather than flee the Gravelands, and they've managed to keep the settlement protected... so far. <br> Now, with the settlement burgeoning with refugees and the Whispering Tyrant's forces drawing near, the agent has made a desperate attempt to reach a Pathfinder lodge in Ustalav. They barely made it out alive--and now they're asking for agents to return to the Gravelands and aid their stranded friends! <br> Written by Joseph Blomquist <br> <br><strong> Scenario tags</strong> : Faction (Horizon Hunters, Radiant Oath) <br> \u00a0This product is not a PDF or accessible outside of Fantasy Grounds.
