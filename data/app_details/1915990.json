{"about_the_game":"5225 is an indie 2D pinball-platformer where your choices matter. Using a &quot;pull back and release&quot; launch mechanic, you'll navigate 5225's sphere through a wide array of environments. Precision is key - one failed launch could send you sliding back down to where you started. Along your journey, you'll collect upgrades for 5225's sphere, solve puzzles, defeat bosses and attempt to beat high scores on &quot;classic pinball&quot; levels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou'll periodically come across questions during your playthrough and how you answer those questions will alter your experience (visuals, dialogue and more) and ultimately determine the final personality analysis you receive. Who knows...maybe you'll learn something about yourself (or 5225) along the way.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1915990/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1671470997","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1915990/page.bg.jpg?t=1671470997","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1915990/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1671470997","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1915990/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1671470997","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"5225 is an indie 2D pinball-platformer where your choices matter.
