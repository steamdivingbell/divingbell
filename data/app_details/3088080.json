{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>OpsCam</strong> is a multiplayer first-person shooter (FPS) game with photorealistic graphics, developed using the latest technologies from Unreal Engine 5. Players engage in fast-paced combat in close-range environments, in game modes such as:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Free For All</strong>: In this game mode, all players compete against each other individually, without teams. Each player attempts to eliminate others to earn points or win the match, without the help or collaboration of allies.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Gun Game</strong>: In this mode, players start with a basic weapon and, with each elimination they achieve, are automatically promoted to a more powerful or different weapon. The goal is to progress through all the available weapons.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Zombies</strong>: In this mode, players must survive waves of zombies that increase in number and difficulty with each new wave. As the waves progress, the zombies may become stronger.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Players can also customize their weapons before or during each match through a loading system with an intuitive interface, allowing for adjustments to their preferences. The game also offers options to adjust graphics, sound, and keyboard shortcuts, providing a personalized experience.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Players have the option to create a self-hosted server, allowing them to be their own servers and invite friends to join their matches. Each confrontation within OpsCam can be decided with a single fatal shot, as the hit system has a lethality rate of up to 100%, making hits deadly and requiring quick reflexes and surgical precision to hit opponents.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Like it? Then get ready for a first-person multiplayer experience where every movement counts.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3088080/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736638345","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3088080/page.bg.jpg?t=1736638345","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3088080/efb9ac85ce441d7a4477ae1517c72a6081e929c4/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736638345","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3088080/efb9ac85ce441d7a4477ae1517c72a6081e929c4/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736638345","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Content Warning\r\n\r\nThe game \"OpsCam\" is a multiplayer first-person shooter (FPS) that features a realistic and intense approach to combat.
