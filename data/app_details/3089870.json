{"about_the_game":"Battle strategically in this 2.5D action adventure rogue-lite platformer against the manifestations of the seven deadly sins. Choose your upgrades carefully. In order to succeed you'll need to defeat the sins as well as their leader. The sins will change their availability each time the timeline is reset, but the one constant is the timer on the bomb's they've laid throughout the city and it's outskirts. Which way - which upgrades to take - use the clues from the opening and transitionary levels to determine which sin you'll do battle against and plan accordingly. Don't worry, your AI ship has your back with the ability to purchase permanent upgrades which carry over from play-through to play-through.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3089870/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1721220080","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3089870/page.bg.jpg?t=1721220080","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3089870/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1721220080","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3089870/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1721220080","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"HDR available","id":61}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Battle strategically in this 2.5D action adventure rogue-lite platformer against the manifestations of the seven deadly sins.
