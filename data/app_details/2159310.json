{"about_the_game":"<strong><i>Dungeon of Final Glory</i></strong> is a combination of roguelite and turn-based RPG. The player will fight big waves of Lovecraftian monsters and explore the randomized dungeon. All of this in catchy pencil drawn graphics. Each run should provide a slightly different experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>STORY</strong></h2>You play as the unholy demon hunter <strong><i>Klaudius</i></strong>, who was summoned as the last resort in the final moments of the battle for Earth. The gate to the Underworld has been opened and horrors from the deep fought with humankind. While the vast army is guarding the land, your quest is to go deep down to the dungeon. Fight the evil and seal the gate to hell. As a smiling mad man, enjoy the battle of Final Glory.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>FIGHT, EXPLORE AND LOOT</strong></h2>You will explore corridors and rooms of a side-scrolling dungeon. Find loot, traps and encounter dangerous enemies. You will fight small groups of monsters, difficult bosses and big hordes of enemies attacking in waves. You play as an overpowered character, but you also need to protect your weak companions, who are important supportive characters.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>UPGRADE YOUR CHARACTER</strong></h2>Collect experience points to level up. At each new level, you will be able to choose one of the skills or upgrades from a random selection of four. Each run you will need to use slightly different build for your character.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2159310/extras/Screen01_small_CC.png?t=1737688110\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>BATTLE SYSTEM</strong></h2>This game has a turn-based combat inspired by JRPGs.
