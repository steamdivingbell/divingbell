In 1451, the Eastern Roman Empire, the successor of the ancient Great Roman civilization in the East, isolated from the West, was experiencing the worst period in its history. The empire, which suffered from regression and great territorial losses with the great defeat against the Turks in Manzikert, had been dealing with internal problems and intrigues since its establishment. In 1451, Eastern Rome was too small to be called an Empire, but it was able to stand with the aid of a walking stick, thanks to those determined to keep the Roman aristocracy alive. Constantine, who came to the throne with the death of the previous Emperor Manuel, could not show the Roman aristocracy with great lust, even though he had the same name as the capital of his country.  Still, the emperor knew his responsibility. Protect the city! Whatever happens! While the Catholic pressure of the Vatican in the west is concentrated on Constantinople and while the Greek people's adherence to Orthodox ties with great respect was a nightmare for the Emperor, whose his city is surrounded by the Turks on both sides. But this is not the time to give up. The right decisions can raise the prosperity of the country again. Will help be sought from the Pope? Will the Greek peoples rise up on their own? Or will Constantinople be doomed to this terrible fate of ruin? Which path to choose? Be on the side of the Emperor Constantine in this tale of intrigue and adventure.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1792530/extras/story.png?t=1728076726\" /><br>The Fall of the Cross will take you to Europe's most complex period for an ultra-medieval feel.
