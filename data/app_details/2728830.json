{"about_the_game":"At a solitary crossroads stands an unassuming inn. Its modest wooden fa\u00e7ade, the flickering glow of candles warding off the encroaching night, and the surrounding dirt roads winding through dense forests might seem commonplace. Yet, unbeknownst to many, this inn is a beacon of safety on these perilous paths. Hidden within the looming trees lurks a malevolent presence, an evil held at bay by only the sacred threshold of the inn.<br><br>As the inn's proprietor, your duty extends beyond mere hospitality. Your task is to safeguard weary travelers by vetting each guest before granting entry. While genuine guests offer coin for shelter, an ever-present threat looms \u2014 the darkness also seeks an invitation. The question stands: can you discern friend from foe and keep the darkness at bay?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Rich Characters</h2>A diverse cast of characters awaits you, each with their own backgrounds, motivations, and secrets. You'll engage in dynamic conversations, making choices that could make or break your relationships.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Interactive Storytelling with Branching Narratives</h2>You aren't just managing an inn; you're embroiled in an ever-evolving story where your actions and choices influence the outcome. These choices can expose deeper mysteries just as easily as they can lock away forbidden secrets.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mystery and Suspense Driven Gameplay</h2>Experience the suspense of identifying the evil attempting to gain entry to the inn without losing travelers to the darkness. Elements of mystery, horror, and strategy keep the mood tense as you piece together clues and make critical decisions under pressure.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cultural and Historical Exploration</h2>Delve into folklore and historical elements of rural Edwardian England, providing an experience that digs into the era's superstitions, social norms, and daily life.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2728830/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733772791","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2728830/page.bg.jpg?t=1733772791","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2728830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733772791","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2728830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733772791","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"At a solitary crossroads stands an unassuming inn.
