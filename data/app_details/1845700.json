This is <strong>not</strong> your typical &quot;fighting&quot; or &quot;first person&quot; game. You are not a ninja, or have magic, or some mythical creature with special powers. You are a regular human being. You fight like a regular human being. You can be hurt like a regular human being. There are things that are difficult as they would be in the real world. Choose to fight or be stealthy or come up with a different gameplay strategy all on your own. This game is a simulation of an experience.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1845700/extras/abilities-banner.jpg?t=1738298729\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Abilities</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Crouch/Walk/Run</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Climb/Slide</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Swim/Dive</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Fight</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1845700/extras/weapons2-banner.jpg?t=1738298729\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Environmental Weapons</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Branch: A branch given by the trees to whip whoever comes near you.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Dowel: A rounded rod of wood to whack those who dare. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Rock: A hard broken piece of earth ready to smash anyone. </p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1845700/extras/weapons-banner.jpg?t=1738298729\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Weapons</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Axe: A sharpened steel blade affixed a strong wooden handle that will cut down anyone in its path.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Baseball Bat: A deadly hard piece of spun wood that will crack the head of even the strongest.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Crowbar: A curved, hardened, piece of steel, although small, can break a bone or a back in a single swing.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1845700/extras/environment-banner.jpg?t=1738298729\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Environment</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">From hot and cold to falling and drowning, the environment can cause some big problems.
