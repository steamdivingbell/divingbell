{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get ready to go on the adventure of a Lifetime</h2><br>The Last Train is a Survival Adventure Game where you take the role of one of the last surviving train pilot in a post world War 2 America. The game is set in Alternate History, post the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. In this emotional journey, the story explores how war affects ordinary citizens who want to go about their day to day lives, not just the brave soldiers who fight on the front lines. As a train pilot you are tasked to go around the country to help as many people as you can. Will you help the remaining survivors reach their families, help the terminally ill or will you be greedy and make the most out of the dire situation by hoarding all the supplies you get from them? All the decisions that you take will shape the story and affect the world around you.<br><br>Team Smash Game Studios would like to thank each and every one of our supporters on Indiegogo who put their faith in us and believed we could deliver this game.
