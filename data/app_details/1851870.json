To find out who wants it and why, characters must locate the ruined elven city of Thorn and brave the dangers of the legendary Chamber of Tomorrows.<br> <strong>TO WAKE WAR (LEVEL 7)</strong> Dust goblin tribes are gearing for war in the Wasted West. It's up to the characters to infiltrate the dust goblins' remote territory, discover their secret, and put a halt to their plan before it dooms the entire region.<br> <strong>BLOOD OF A FALLEN STAR (LEVEL 8)</strong> Infection from space is ravaging the Northlands!
