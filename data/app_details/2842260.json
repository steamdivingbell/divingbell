{"about_the_game":"Mid Death Crisis: A strategic, turn-based couch co-op game for three players. Command skeletal minions aiding Zeborius Zelgon, a lich battling the amphibious Rana Empire. Redirect Zeb's waning magic to empower allies, conquer foes, and reignite his evil fervor amidst a cryptic adventure.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Strategic Collaboration</h2></strong><br>Mid Death Crisis is a strategic, turn-based couch co-op game designed for three players. Play with two friends to strategically redirect, and empower the lackluster spells sent out by Zeb. Each of the three players commands a skeleton with a unique set of skills, adept at their own tasks. Just one can\u2019t take on an army, but with many your might can grow to even surpass that of the Lich himself!<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unique Roles</h2></strong><br>Each of the three skeletons, the Zealot, Thief, and Warrior, have learned abilities from Zeb. The zealot is a master of damage, amplifying spells to the fullest of their potential with deranged genius. The thief is all about positioning, a magic-juggling aficionado who never misses their target. The warrior is a master crowd controller. Choose your favorite and work directly with your teammates and discover which loadouts mesh well with others to perfectly defeat the waves of enemies that come your way!<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Lich Who Lost His Way</h2></strong><br>Embarking on this adventure, players take command of skeletal minions serving Zeborius Zelgon, a once-powerful lich now plagued by sorrow. Zeb's crypt has fallen under the invasion of The Rana Empire, a formidable species of frogs intent on claiming his domain. As Zeb's sorrow saps his magical abilities, players, serving as his most loyal minions, must harness, empower, and strategically redirect his spells to their comrades, enhancing their collective strength. By overcoming hordes of frog enemies, escorting Zeb through his crypt, and rekindling his malevolent passion for evil, players confront the trials of the Mid Death Crisis.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2842260?t=1715700700","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2842260/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1715700700","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2842260/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1715700700","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2842260/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1715700700","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Mid Death Crisis: A strategic, turn-based couch co-op game for three players.
