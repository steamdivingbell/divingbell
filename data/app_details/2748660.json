Grab your...Flute and get going! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story takes place on the planet of Pangaea where you'll travel from a small bardic farm town to a power plant (filled with robots!), to the lava world called Styx beneath the surface. Travel between 2 world maps using your airship and take down The Opus Quintet before they unlock the secrets of the instruments!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith a throwback to classic turn-based RPGs, you adventure along picking up allies along the way. Topping out at 16 recruitable characters, you'll have to manage a roster of characters each with unique passive traits and a unique selection of skills.
