{"about_the_game":"At the core, Haymaker is a boxing game. Starting from a young kid in the city, to working his way to the top. However, we want there to be room to explore the city and for you to check out other activities in the game. Explore the town, talk to many people living around the city, take on tasks that people need help with, hang out with friends; but remember you need to practice your boxing skills, so managing your relationships can hurt you, should you ignore your training. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1310500/extras/giftest4.gif?t=1589541764\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1310500/extras/Features2.png?t=1589541764\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Train for your next fight in the gym to bring stats up.
