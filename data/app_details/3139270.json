{"about_the_game":"Dice with the Devil is a party-based, dice-chucking, deck-building roguelike. Assemble your crew of adventurers, each with a different dice requirement. Some adventurers have simple requirements but offer limited attack benefits. Other adventurers require you to press your luck to fulfill their requirements, but can really dish out the damage. Adventurers can combo with other party members, allowing a clever player to perform massive attacks in a single turn. However, Dice with the Devil is a game of timing - make sure your combos pop off at just the right time, as opportunities like this may not come around again soon. Adventurers become more powerful after each use but only have a limited number of uses before they retire - adding an additional wrinkle to the timing puzzle. Between battles, upgrade your party with new adventurers, powerful items, and unique relics - all to help you defeat increasingly more powerful enemies.","achievements":{"total":0},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3139270/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732233760","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3139270/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1732233760","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3139270/221e04c9bb420e227bda4be97e9845c4df59ede8/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732233760","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3139270/221e04c9bb420e227bda4be97e9845c4df59ede8/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732233760","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Chain Attacks</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3139270/extras/Chain_Attacks_ff.gif?t=1732233760\" /><br>Certain attacks can trigger adjacent adventurers in the same turn.
