Among them, the castle and landscape of the Edo-j\u014d, a dark cave that has fallen into oblivion, a sinister graveyard forest that turns into a mountain plagued by winds, and even hell itself (in which the final boss could possibly be placed). <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1597960/extras/World.gif?t=1736515535\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Onification</strong></h2>The special thing about Ninja Brigade is the onification of the world.

To defeat them in action-oriented battles, Jonah uses both the speed and agility of a ninja and the strength and brutality of an oni.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1597960/extras/Fighting.gif?t=1736515535\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Bosses</strong></h2>Each region is guarded by the largest and most vicious Yokai.
