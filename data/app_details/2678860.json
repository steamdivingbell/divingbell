{"about_the_game":"<strong>Gameplay</strong><br>nope rope takes the classic snake formula, and pits you in mortal combat against up to three other slithering beasts.<br>When your snake eats, its tail grows. Tails are vulnerable and can be bitten off by other snakes, though. Only once your tail turns into a full body part is it safe.<br><br>There are different ways to feed and grow your snake: Regular food pickups reward you with 1 to 4 food. Multi sided food pickups reward you a different amount of food, depending on the side you enter them from. Food patterns are shapes on the ground that your snake must slither through in order to be rewarded food. There are also maps where you must capture flags in order to be rewarded food every couple turns.<br><br>On top of that, you can bite other snake's tails off and feed yourself this way. If you're looking for other ways to mess with your scaly adversaries, there are four different types of bombs that can bring the pain by the power of poison, explosion, lightning and fire.<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>lots of levels<br></li><li>local multiplayer for up to 4 players<br></li><li>networked multiplayer through Steam<br></li><li>networked multiplayer supports multiple inputs per PC (e.g. two players on PC A can play against two players on PC B)<br></li><li>easy to use level editor<br></li><li>all included and user built levels can be played in custom games where players can override everything</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2678860/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724916807","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2678860/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1724916807","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2678860/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724916807","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2678860/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724916807","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>Gameplay</strong><br>nope rope takes the classic snake formula, and pits you in mortal combat against up to three other slithering beasts.<br>When your snake eats, its tail grows.
