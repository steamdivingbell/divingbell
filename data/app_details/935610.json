A few brave citizens belonging to this future world agree to devote their lives to this aim. Secluded in the colony of UT-OP-I4, they and their offspring will try and live independently and in harmony. Yet, they ignore that their every move will be scrutinized and analyzed.... And that, after every birth, the genome of their descendants will be modified to create the perfect individual. For a perfect society. In a perfect world. You are the demiurge of UT-OP-I4, a servant of humanity. Decipher the secrets of our genetics and show us the way.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Gameplay</strong></h2>&quot;Eugenics&quot; works like Mastermind board game : first, you'll have to identify every gene and its effect. Then, you'll be able to modify and edit the genome. As a demiurge, you will however have to render account to the company that employs you. But you can decide if you want to make the world better place, make money, or even if you just want to follow the latest fashion !
