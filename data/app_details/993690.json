{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About this Game</h2>In transport services, you take on the task of providing transport for goods or passengers among contracted cities.

Also once your city reaches a bigger size, you will build a factory producing resources, which you can distribute into your other cities to make a profit.<br><br>You will be able to build roads for buses and trucks, as the cheapest variant for the short distances.
