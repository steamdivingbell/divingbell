{"about_the_game":"Do you like a protagonist that can jump, dodge roll, punch, kick, and fart? Well Buff Huckem can do just that. Buff is Brown Ops special forces with orders coming straight from the president himself. Buff will fight his way through enemies and dodge any obstacle in his way. Keep his stomach full of burritos for a more gaseous form of combat while searching for hot sauce to upgrade his already impressive abilities. If Buff is low on health a quick drink of piston dew can get him back in the fight. This short roughly two hour game will have you exploring the heights, and depths of the conspiracy to turn the world to crap. Can Buff stop the crappening, or is he playing right into the skull and boners hand? This game has mystery, combat, platforming, and crap jokes, what else could you want from a game?","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"You can't flush stink","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2608140/25cbf743fa333ac0c46443c1f5d13bcf6123148b.jpg"},{"name":"That's one crappy rat","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2608140/ea318a1de76a3dbf774944b860ff767e03d05a88.jpg"},{"name":"That was super saiy...tisfying","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2608140/8a9d8262eab423e3f532a2fcf708ceab6ec96680.jpg"},{"name":"Couldn't have seen this coming","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2608140/07e39f20ed290def23657be69fd383815f938eb7.jpg"},{"name":"Was that a barking spider?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2608140/dfc54a91f78a47aa274c053e4f5e2984f69cc214.jpg"},{"name":"Just the tip of the burrito","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2608140/2eb21cc550f055f195fe5e9904f34ee699578a50.jpg"},{"name":"A true specimen","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2608140/7355451779c03f83ddfe6b218486fdda6341a178.jpg"},{"name":"Wow you figured it out all on your own","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2608140/e6418ba019a287e31382e559be528643aa289f53.jpg"},{"name":"I hope you're proud of yourself","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2608140/4d153eea4e2d92a7f82c23c3bb2438d464a734bd.jpg"},{"name":"Wow just Wow!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2608140/fb40a3bd6d53470884e2023d41add0acaa0a274a.jpg"}],"total":13},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2608140/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1701115119","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2608140/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1701115119","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2608140/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1701115119","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2608140/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1701115119","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"The story cut scenes contains cursing and crude language.
