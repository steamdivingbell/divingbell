Over 10 songs are available to enjoy the game with rhythm and varying moods.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Curiosity","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3157360/6d370a72cbca2a73aab2e45d71c33d0560f2cb7d.jpg"},{"name":"Terror","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3157360/187c8feb6f0ab6b5ad43baf06af1ed7eb43d79ce.jpg"},{"name":"Fuchsia light in the shadows","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3157360/98a38faeae4294f495340c700da4b0607bc38879.jpg"},{"name":"Brainiac","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3157360/7d8f7969c2a87597ee41484f238d447129626e87.jpg"},{"name":"Quite a show","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3157360/31c9b2f4b9e8911e75982cc6b2ac0bd277b3cc7c.jpg"},{"name":"No deal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3157360/0c049ca3cc260d2cb31471f9631d05a1a1098aef.jpg"},{"name":"*Clich\u00e9 movie explosion*","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3157360/0259ae346ecb8f2407a995538e1e130a02e977f0.jpg"},{"name":"Not extracting anything today","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3157360/3fbb8f7af314a037912ccd79b390ba9b7dca502e.jpg"},{"name":"Rescue","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3157360/ebd145940d8e3a29c9cdc4a9a671cbb306d2f337.jpg"},{"name":"Destination Darkness","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3157360/71ef5e97aa42bdc9b92080922b07bd4c0b30a4a2.jpg"}],"total":100},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3157360/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737345918","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3157360/page.bg.jpg?t=1737345918","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3157360/7f2289c83a3c63a49a7ad43216dda7c307f48d90/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737345918","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3157360/7f2289c83a3c63a49a7ad43216dda7c307f48d90/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737345918","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Synopsis</h2><strong>Almohadin: escape from the basement</strong> is a hard platformer game featuring fun mechanics, a variety of levels and enemies, and multiple ways to complete each stage!
