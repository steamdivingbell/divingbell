We've made it super easy to use without being over complicated.

Using fractal mathematics it can create random terrains in an instant. When making a new level you first choose a biome style for your level and then, using a range of sliders, you can define the general layout of your game level. Finer control is then possible with terrain sculpting and texture painting tools. Levels can be up to five kilometre squared in size with further procedural drawn terrain rolling majestically into the far horizon. Biomes styles include Forest, Desert, Arctic, Canyon, Mountain, Rainforest and Plains. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1247290/extras/TERRAIN.jpg?t=1737400832\" /><br><br><strong>TREE AND VEGETATION RENDERING</strong><br>Trees and vegetation can be auto-populated into your game. With one click you can add whole forests and grasses to your level. Finer control is available with the easy-to-use tree and vegetation tools.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1247290/extras/WATERFALL.jpg?t=1737400832\" /><br><br><strong>CHARACTER CREATION AND BEHAVIORS</strong><br>Game characters can be designed using the built-in Character Creator.  Make characters to fight with you as allies or against you as enemies. Choose male, female, or zombie-style characters and then change how they look with many different choices of head, hair, facial features, headgear, eyeglasses, body, legs and feet. Characters come AI-ready with high-quality animations for walking, running, gesturing, fighting, shooting and more.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1247290/extras/CC.jpg?t=1737400832\" /><br><br>Male and female Zombies are easy to create from their component parts, ideal for a Horror Zombie game. There's a selection of different clothing choices and a range of animations - from slow meandering walks to fast running Zombies.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1247290/extras/ZOMBIE.jpg?t=1737400832\" /><br><br><strong>REALISTIC PHYSICS</strong><br>Game physics is handled with the integration of the acclaimed Bullet Physics Engine. The physics simulation manages the player and character controllers, game object collisions, impact forces and ragdoll death. With the support of convex hull shapes the physics processing is kept fast and efficient.<br><br><strong>GAME STORYBOARD EDITOR</strong><br>Every aspect of your game can be controlled by you. From the loading splash screen, to how the various game levels link together. The Game Storyboard editor lets you easily link these different areas by just connecting them up with visual wires. It's from here you can edit any screen and level. Test your game from this editor as well, then save it as a standalone executable that can be played by you (and even your friends who don't need to own GameGuru MAX).<br>You can even publish the games and you don't have to pay any license fees!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1247290/extras/STORYBOARD.jpg?t=1737400832\" /><br><br><strong>VISUAL LOGIC</strong><br>With the Visual Logic system, there's absolutely no coding or scripting required. Link objects together and choose how they interact. From an enemy patrol area that uses flag way-points to guide the NPCs, to keys linking to doors that they can open. Lines show the links between the connected objects with all the logic handled internally. Key values from scripts are exposed as values that you can change such as the speed of an enemy fighter.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1247290/extras/GAME1.jpg?t=1737400832\" /><br><br><strong>AWESOME GRAPHICAL FIDELITY!</strong><br>GameGuru MAX supports correct real-time lighting, PBR rendering shadows, screen space ambient and parallax occlusion and more - bringing a greater sense of realism to your game creations.
