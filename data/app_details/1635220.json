{"about_the_game":"You're a circle. You're the good guy. But you're surrounded by squares. Some are irrelevant. Others are useful and/or annoying. Then there are the black squares. They want to kill you. They are the bad guys. Be a good guy and pulverize those baddies, will you?<br><br>Survive and shoot all enemies in 200 levels (or make them shoot themselves). Each level cleared opens the next one permanently (autosave). Enemies come in a variety of types, speeds and action patterns, while other squares do a multitude of things, ranging from reflecting bullets to teleporting you. Enemies are killed with a single hit, and so do you. Failing a level has no consequences. While the first levels are easy and often, very quick, difficulty increases greatly in later levels.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Elements</h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1635220/extras/Character1.png?t=1644231325\" /><br>This is you.
