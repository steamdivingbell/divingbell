With enhanced physics and cutting mechanics you will be able to put your swordsman skills to the test with one of the most famous and deadliest weapons in history. This game mainly focuses on proper Katana handling, physics interactions and cutting mechanics, where speed, acceleration, rotation rate, weight, travel distance, and edge orientation are taken into account to achieve the most realistic experience.<br><br>You will be able to improve your skills in the Japanese art of Tameshigiri which was known as the practice for testing the quality of Japanese swords, but now as a martial art which tests the skill of the wielder.
