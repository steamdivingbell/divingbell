{"about_the_game":"Plow through endless, fog-infested rooms as an interstellar custodian known as a Grasher in this twin-stick roguelike. With the help of a half-vacuum, half-cannon known as HADOS, inhale every last speck of junk, blast bizarre creatures known as foglins, and fling stuff in a randomly generated galaxy of endless possibilities. Beneath the fog lies the story of a universe where humans are scarce, foglins have run rampant, and the planet Earth appears to have gone missing.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2606680/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1695738010","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2606680/page.bg.jpg?t=1695738010","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2606680/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1695738010","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2606680/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1695738010","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Plow through endless, fog-infested rooms as an interstellar custodian known as a Grasher in this twin-stick roguelike.
