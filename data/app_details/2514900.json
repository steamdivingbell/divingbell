{"about_the_game":"<strong>Your Journey of Survival</strong> is an open-world game that is a fun combination of the best elements of first person shooter (FPS), survival, and roleplaying (RPG) games. It presents building, mining, crafting, combat, looting, and exploration. Set in the year 2400, you awake in a post-apocalyptic world where everything is seemingly unknown or all memory is lost and all of humanity &amp; civilization must be rebuilt from the ground up. The world and all of it\u2019s former history and memories\u2019 existence seems to have ceased. <br><br><strong>Exploration:</strong> <i>Explore large and unknown worlds, starting with the wilderness of Njarovik. Scavenge the environment for resources to build new structures and craft new items. </i><br><br><strong>Building:</strong> <i>Build structures as massive as you can imagine and upgrade them with resources found in the world. Just be aware that gravity is a thing, so you will need to take into account the structural integrity of your buildings.

Buildings, and most environmental objects can be destroyed. Go up against and raid other player's bases in PVP or go up against AI in PVE. </i><br><br><strong>Character:</strong> <i>You will start out naked with nothing but your underwear on.
