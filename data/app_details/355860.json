{"about_the_game":"Albino Lullaby is a horror adventure game that doesn't rely on jump scares or gore. A Lynchian psychological nightmare where you play as yourself. Escape from a dark and surreal Victorian town that clings to the precipices of underground cliffs. The gamespace dynamically twists and contorts around you in real time, as you unravel an equally twisted narrative. Discover the hidden spaces haunted by 'The Grandchildren' as you uncover clues to understanding just where and what you are. Albino Lullaby is set for initial release on the PC and will be fully VR compatible.  <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/355860/extras/garden2.png?t=1478193061\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Game Features</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>The Next Gen of Adventure Games</strong> - Player driven pacing, no cutscenes.<br></li><li><strong>Transforming Gamespace</strong> - Mechanical mansion deconstructs around you.<br></li><li><strong>Environmental Storytelling</strong> - Deep background of characters and events, conveyed through the gamespace.<br></li><li><strong>Different Play Styles</strong> - Sneak or gung ho!<br></li><li><strong>Episodic Releases</strong> - Pay as you go or get a season pass.<br></li><li><strong>VR Ready</strong> - Built from ground up to play great on the Oculus Rift, Vive and Morpheus.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Developed by Ape Law.</strong></h2>To make game for to give to man!
