{"about_the_game":"A hidden object game where you must find all the bees to complete each level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2>\u204d 1000+ bees<br><br>\u204d 10 unique artworks<br>\u204d Unlimited hints if you get stuck<br>\u204d Restore a small number of bees to a painting so you can find them again! <br>\u204d Additional bee related objects to find<br>\u204d Music and ambiance for each artwork<br>\u204d Achievements<br>\u204d Use your keyboard to move/zoom in if you have no scrollwheel<br>\u204d 3 save slots<br>\u204d Reset progress entirely and play again<br>\u204d Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Context:</h2>The brief was simple. I commissioned artists to create a fantasy world, and hide as many bees as they can inside it. Now it\u2019s your job to find them all! With 10 art pieces to choose from, and 1000+ bees, you will have a lot of searching to do.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Controls:</h2>Use your mouse to move around the image and zoom in / out. When you find a bee, click it and it will disappear. You can also use WASD to move and the arrow keys to zoom.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Difficulty:</h2>A full range of difficulty is included, but all levels start unlocked, your progress is saved as you play, and you can use hints if you get stuck.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get immersed:</h2>Each painting has its own music and ambiance to help you connect with the world, as you search for all the bees.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Replayable</h2>You can restore a small number of bees back into a painting so you can find them again! It\u2019s much harder when there are only a few bees left (especially randomly). You can also use up to 3 save slots so you can replay without progress loss. Alternatively, you can reset your progress for the entire game if you\u2019d like to start over.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Perfect","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2173870/10c3d1c007ef54db811ce47b2c2eb4edb0601031.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the City Crossroad","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2173870/aa5aab2ae45f6708975cf068c2cca4564a442439.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Skateboarding","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2173870/c396a941c92c8f0b499bb635d35e3500adccf493.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Many Pipes","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2173870/f4640b9fa7a90950c1f1947fee3c1a09494ca50e.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Living Room","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2173870/b43e5465dd7de086108ade0af08e9aaab193fd19.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Bottlecaps","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2173870/293586fd6d443ce192064b6858edcbfb560492b2.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Floating Fortress","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2173870/305ed9c34d6db1e0fbccb7074ae49bab6556fdab.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Reefs","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2173870/ba20759102885043902ee426234358e59a6ae4d3.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Pumpkin Forest","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2173870/baa8a5c573fd36438f0a53a9dfceabeee6bd932d.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Lakehouse","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2173870/388a174dcbd1b0649dce269a2c379ae9053e6723.jpg"}],"total":11},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2173870/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714855276","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2173870/page.bg.jpg?t=1714855276","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2173870/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714855276","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2173870/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714855276","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Recommended for you</h1><p><br><br></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>A hidden object game where you must find all the bees to complete each level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2>\u204d 1000+ bees<br><br>\u204d 10 unique artworks<br>\u204d Unlimited hints if you get stuck<br>\u204d Restore a small number of bees to a painting so you can find them again! <br>\u204d Additional bee related objects to find<br>\u204d Music and ambiance for each artwork<br>\u204d Achievements<br>\u204d Use your keyboard to move/zoom in if you have no scrollwheel<br>\u204d 3 save slots<br>\u204d Reset progress entirely and play again<br>\u204d Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Context:</h2>The brief was simple.
