{"about_the_game":"<strong>Serpens: Eternal Thievery</strong> is a retro immersive first-person stealth game where you embody Anika, a thief gifted with the power to loop back in time. You are part of the Circle of Serpens, a legendary thieving order that worships the serpent god. In return you are granted an ancient heirloom: the <strong>Amulet of Serpens.\u00a0</strong><br><br>Use it to rewind time and prepare your heist with minute detail. Combine your unique ability with an arsenal of weapons and become one of the most feared Thieves in the Sphere. The outcome of each heist unfolds based on your decisions in highly non-linear levels graphically inspired by late 1990s games.<br><br><strong>Story:</strong> After being released from the royal prison, a lifeline is offered to you by an unknown client. Steal the Ancestral Staff from Scree Abbey, a monastery perched atop Mt Scree. The Staff carries a detailed record of the royal family tree, and you suspect your client desires it in order to start a leadership claim on the Kingdom. A claim that will surely bring war and desolation to the Sphere. Trivial matters to you: as long as you\u2019re thieving, you are deserving of Serpens\u2019s grace.<br><br> <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2642850/extras/Steam_Explore.png?t=1697649660\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2642850/extras/Explore.gif?t=1697649660\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Highly non-linear levels.
