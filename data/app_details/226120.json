{"about_the_game":"Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space is a hybrid &quot;roguelike&quot; game of space exploration and starship combat set within a peculiar, as-yet-unvisited region of the galaxy known as the Purple Void. Each time it is played, a new and different &quot;sector prime&quot; and its vast frontier are randomly generated. Locations of stars and nebulae, homeworlds of alien races, distribution of lifeforms and artifacts, plot-twisting quest events--the whole game is remixed. <br><br>Note that unlike common roguelikes that last dozens of hours, Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space plays to its conclusion in less than thirty minutes - it's the perfect lunch break game! Features also include a fully animated star map, a unique turn-based movement system, real-time starship battles (at naval battle speeds, not &quot;Super-Melee&quot;), award-winning music and sound, and a robust battle simulator. Weird Worlds also has built-in support for community-created mods that can change anything and everything in the game!<br><br>Check out some of the best Weird Worlds mods here.<br><br>Windows 10 users: If you're experiencing mouse issues, right click the launch icon or shortcut and set compatibility mode to Windows 8.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/226120?t=1575869691","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/226120?t=1575869691","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/226120/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1575869691","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/226120/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1575869691","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space is a hybrid &quot;roguelike&quot; game of space exploration and starship combat set within a peculiar, as-yet-unvisited region of the galaxy known as the Purple Void.
