{"about_the_game":"Dead Room is a cutesy-horror shooter game with rogue-lite elements. In this game, you defend a single room from hordes of zombies. You do this by boarding up windows, and killing them with your shotgun. You can then feed the zombie corpses to a creature in the cellar, which will reward you by either spitting out a decoration (which can be deconstructed into more boards for the windows) or an item (which changes or alters a mechanic of the game in your favor, giving you an upper hand).<br><br><strong>Gameplay</strong><br>Dead Room combines rogue-lite elements with wave based monsters. The game introduces a unique spin on these genres by letting you sacrifice the corpses of slain monsters to a creature that lives in the cellar. After receiving enough of these sacrifices, the creature will reward you by giving you either an item (which improves some of your stats or modifies a core mechanic of the game in your favor), or by giving you a decoration (which you can deconstruct for boards in order to board up the windows, giving the monsters an obstacle before they're allowed into the room).<br><br>Dead room has 50 items to unlock and use, along with 10 different decorations to collect, and 2 playable characters.<br><br><br><strong>Story</strong><br>While trying to escape a horde of the undead, you find yourself and your trusty turtle companion, Sheldon, trapped inside an old log cabin in the woods. In your confusion, Sheldon falls through an open floor hatch, lost to the darkness of the cellar and held captive by an evil creature who resides in its depths. It's up to you to fight your way through waves of monsters, offering their corpses to the creature in order to appease him, buying time until you're ready to face the beast and recover your loyal shelled friend.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"It's Alive!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2986390/8af20791f07ec3fd79a82d7f1ed3a3467df48110.jpg"},{"name":"Jones","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2986390/0940343da49bd6b8d829eaf0d6c2fbae5746783f.jpg"},{"name":"Sheldon","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2986390/576ab1de53bd7c589f425af64ef74a625e5ee7d7.jpg"},{"name":"On A Roll","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2986390/89a4db038833339be8facfa24ec9d20f84002db7.jpg"},{"name":"Complete Dictionary","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2986390/9cc8bde284c36afdd9759762df79f44aad40ab7c.jpg"},{"name":"Thrifty","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2986390/6aea4102f7d0700ecb6443d31864d683d6ac2191.jpg"},{"name":"Adept Reader","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2986390/3b215afb343b8c201f3f56b8985cbb962475ee6a.jpg"},{"name":"Survivor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2986390/d5dafd2a895e01265d345073e014a5523276a5e4.jpg"},{"name":"Garlic Lover","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2986390/4a33e924c38894972f38babbc2f800946c910b6d.jpg"},{"name":"Card Collector","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2986390/094fedf12d9e34b79411310a0d7261c4796bb452.jpg"}],"total":10},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2986390/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1717589158","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2986390/page.bg.jpg?t=1717589158","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2986390/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1717589158","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2986390/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1717589158","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Dead Room is a cutesy-horror shooter game with rogue-lite elements.
