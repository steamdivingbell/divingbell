{"about_the_game":"Sharpen your mental math and logic skills with this new and unique number game! Seqitaire combines math, pattern-matching, and card-draw mechanics of Solitaire to bring you a fresh gaming experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Play:</h2>Add, subtract, multiply, or divide using number tiles in a tile grid to produce the specified number. Be wary of what tiles you select though, as each tile is associated with a suit: diamonds \u2666\ufe0f, clubs \u2663\ufe0f, hearts \u2665\ufe0f, spades \u2660\ufe0f, or wild. Cards drawn from a deck determine the target number and other criteria for math submissions. For example, in addition to outputting the number 2, the tiles submitted may need to be all of the hearts suit, use at least one multiplication operator, or be submitted by swiping (i.e. click and dragging to connect adjacent tiles) only. Cards become earned after submitting all of the number results for the given card. Earn all of the cards in the deck to win the game!<br><br><strong>How is Seqitaire like Solitaire?</strong> Just as card stacks in Solitaire must alternate between black (\u2663\ufe0f\u2660\ufe0f) and red (\u2666\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f) suits or must be ordered in numerical sequence, certain cards in Seqitaire require selected tiles to alternate between black and red suits, or form a &quot;Run&quot; where the number tiles are consecutive when rearranged in numerical order. By default, the number and operator tiles in each level are predetermined to ensure each level has multiple solutions. However, every level can optionally be played with randomly-generated tiles, giving the game high replay value. With random tiles, not every level may be beatable for the given tile set generated just as success at Solitaire depends on cards dealt. You can increase your success rate with greater skill though. The tiles disappear after being used, so the challenge is to maximize points by using as many tiles as possible in number submissions, while still being able to earn all of the cards with the tiles available.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Key Features:</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>10 individually-crafted levels (more coming!) including 9 untimed levels and 1 timed level<br></li><li>Submit math equations by selecting tiles in a tile grid to output the number specified by cards drawn from a deck<br></li><li>Tiles can be selected individually or by swiping (clicking and dragging to connect adjacent tiles).

The most common Action card is the Add Tiles card (shown below on left), which adds a row of number and operator tiles to the tile grid when drawn. The Shuffle card shuffles the tiles in the tile grid, and the Switch Operator card changes the default operation performed when selected two consecutive number tiles. The dots at the bottom of the card indicate how many times the Action card can be drawn from the deck before it exhausts (at which time it is removed from the deck).<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1732170/extras/actionCardGraphic_616x243.png?t=1707104839\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiple Card Draw:</h2>The multiple card draw mechanic functions similarly to the way cards are drawn from the deck in a game of Solitaire. Either 2 or 3 cards are drawn at a time and are revealed in a stacked configuration.

Most new players are able to learn to play Seqitaire quickly without completing the game tutorial, so do not be daunted by the appearance of complex rules.
