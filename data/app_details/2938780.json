{"about_the_game":"Encounters: Music Stories is a two-handed casual music rhythm game with cute characters. You must pave the way so the characters can advance and arrive to the final encounter platform. Each character plays a part of the song. Perhaps they play different instruments, or perhaps one plays the melody and the other the accompaniment. You can train each character separately but to win a level you must coordinate both hands.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the developer is also a music composer, music in the game is tailor-made, combining adaptations of classical songs and original music.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you have learned a song, you should be able to play it even with your eyes closed. Trust your ears more than your eyes!  The game even features a &quot;night mode&quot; where you can play entirely in the dark. Are you brave enough to give it a try?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this game, precision in rhythm and coordination are key. If you enjoy challenging rhythm games, you'll love it. If you're unsure if this game is for you, give the demo a shot and experience three out of the thirteen levels available at the moment.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2938780?t=1716283847","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2938780?t=1716283847","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2938780/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1716283847","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2938780/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1716283847","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Encounters: Music Stories is a two-handed casual music rhythm game with cute characters.
