{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Hello adventurers!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Start a charming journey to the world of Dragons Reef. Play as one of eight captains and set off on your own ship into a fantasy world full of dragons, pirates, various sea creatures and gold to be won. Each captain has their own unique skills that will give them an advantage in certain situations. Skills can be developed to the next level. Choose a captain that suits your play style and chosen level. In this unique gameplay, you can acquire 24 powerful magical artifacts that can change the way you play and the strategy of completing tasks. You can only have 4 artifacts active at a time, so you must carefully adapt your character to the challenges ahead. Position your ship to make the perfect shot at the perfect moment and defeat the pirates. Each round is an exciting adventure that you can complete multiple times, in different ways. The high randomness of events in the game means that the gameplay will look a bit different every time. Your ship can use eight fantastic cannonballs, each of them has special properties and spectacular animation. Explore this atmospheric land with your golden dragon companion, who will fly by your side, help you fight pirates and remove some water obstacles.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3437470/extras/Dragons_reef_adding_artifacts.gif?t=1740224800\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dragons Reef is a charming, family-friendly and colorful action game that features:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">a recreational adventure about delivering goods</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">a spectacular naval combat in the style of Tower Defense games, where the gameplay is about defending yourself from pirates, with the additional challenge of having to protect dragon eggs</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">a game of skill and focus &quot;Capture the Flag&quot;, in which the player must bring as many dragon eggs as possible to their base</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">An exciting race against other ships, full of obstacles and optional tasks to complete, for which we receive additional gold</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A fun chase after thugs stealing goods</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A strategic gameplay, in which the player must capture and hold control points</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">An adventure consisting of escorting an allied ship to its destination, while pirates try to stop it</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A satisfying gameplay consisting of destroying the pirates' base</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Two special levels of the game, in which the player can take on the role of pirates</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3437470/extras/Dragons_reef_krysztaly.gif?t=1740224800\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">During the game, collect crystals, whose extraordinary power will allow you to increase the level of your ship and unlock additional special abilities.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3437470/extras/Dragons_reef_plaszczka.gif?t=1740224800\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In this relaxing and atmospheric world, you will also find many different threats.
