Hit by a meteorite, you\u2019re ejected and your food scattered all around 5 orbiting moons. <br><br>Your only chance of survival is to grab energy food to propel yourself forward. Too few energy and you'll starve to death, too much and you'll explode! When you eat, your cat gets stronger and bigger, but deflates each time you propel.
