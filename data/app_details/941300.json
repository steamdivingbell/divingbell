Let\u2019s see two examples. Rumia can hide barrages, which means palyers can\u2019t see her barrages completely. As a result, players have to deduce trajectory of barrages according to their acquaintance with barrages and then dodge them. Hon Meirin is good at knockback, so chances are that even if players have dodged barrages, Hon Merin can still use her skills to beat them back to the area surrounded by barrages or even to a barrage.

For example, we design some skills which allow players to eliminate barrages in a certain area, and some spell cards which can attack bosses while eliminating barrages in a large area.

At most five characters are permitted in one team. More characters will be unlocked with the exploration of storyline. Each character has different position and feature. Using these features properly to foster strengths and circumvent weaknesses will make your combat more efficient.

Putting different items into right slots can considerably raise characters\u2019 statistics, which will do help to your following battles. Here is some information about items:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The only way to gain items so far is: First, win a battle. Second, go to Kourindouand get some dormant items. Third, infuse \u2018Nil Soul\u2019 into items and waken them. Now you can use them.<br></li><li> Wakened items have random statistics.<br></li><li> Different levels will randomly drop different items. For example, if you get a Reimu\u2019s weapon in \u2018Hakurei Shrine\u2019, then next time you may see this weapon in another level instead of \u2018Hakurei Shrine\u2019. The reason why we design this mechanism is that we hope we can avoid letting players play one level repeatedly just for one specific item.<br></li><li> So far, each character has her private weapon but armors and accessories can be used universally<br></li><li> All dormant items you get from all levels will only exist before next time you get new dormant items. In other words, if you don\u2019t waken dormant items you get from the last battle during the period between the last battle and next battle, these dormant items will be replaced by new dormant items</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/941300/extras/gameIntro18.jpg?t=1650424695\" /><br>\u25b2 fter you win a battle, you can get some dormant items in Kourindou.

At most five characters are permitted in one team. More characters will be unlocked with the exploration of storyline. Each character has different position and feature. Using these features properly to foster strengths and circumvent weaknesses will make your combat more efficient.

Here is some information about items:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The only way to gain items so far is: First, win a battle. Second, go to Kourindouand get some dormant items. Third, infuse \u2018Nil Soul\u2019 into items and waken them.

For example, if you get a Reimu\u2019s weapon in \u2018Hakurei Shrine\u2019, then next time you may see this weapon in another level instead of \u2018Hakurei Shrine\u2019. The reason why we design this mechanism is that we hope we can avoid letting players play one level repeatedly just for one specific item.<br></li><li> So far, each character has her private weapon but armors and accessories can be used universally<br></li><li> All dormant items you get from all levels will only exist before next time you get new dormant items.
