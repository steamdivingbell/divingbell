The UHD image captures the original illustration in great detail and you will be able to observe even the finest of details exactly as the artist has painted them on the canvas. The puzzle is of a medium to high difficulty especially using the larger puzzle tile sets. There are two distinct color areas that will help you organize the tiles and start building but after that, the many similar details in each area can prove challenging. Overall, this puzzle box offers a great balance between straightforward assembly strategy and detailed complexity.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1025730?t=1589663356","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1025730?t=1589663356","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025730/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1589663356","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025730/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1589663356","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"For your enjoyment, we present <strong>The Being</strong> - another beautiful artwork from the Polish illustrator <strong>Elwira Pawlikowska</strong>.
