You and David don\u2019t have the greatest relationship, but you go back for Vanessa. When you get there, things feel off. Headaches, visions, and feelings you\u2019ve never had before sporadically hit you like a tonne of bricks.

This left it up to Selena, one of your oldest friends. With all that had been going on, you haven\u2019t seen Selena in the house, and it\u2019s already been a couple of days since she's been home.

Something strange is going on with the people working at ETMI Corp, and you can\u2019t leave till you find out what\u2019s going on, and more importantly, where Selena is.

This leads you on an adventure to find proof of your friend\u2019s innocence. Along the way, you\u2019ll be re-acquainted with your friend Ellie, a rambunctious young woman who does things her own way and doesn\u2019t take no for an answer.

Vanessa feels the same and organizes a dinner party with you, Selena, Ellie, and her friend Kacey, to occupy her mind. For some reason, Vanessa begins to get nervous each time you\u2019re near, like she\u2019s guilty of something. Selena and Ellie share whispers throughout the night, holding whatever secrets they're discussing, between the two of them. Unbeknownst to anyone else, Kacey had heavily invested in David\u2019s new prototype without even knowing what it was. With David in the hospital, Kacey scours the house looking for the prototype, in hopes of making some money off of it.
