Good forest ranger needs to take care of animals living in the woods. Give some food to hungry birds, build a bird feeder, and remove the traps left by poachers.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Build bee yards in the forest, buy and build birdhouses, and repair hives. Don\u2019t forget to take care of animals and remove animal traps, make sure you prevent fire and do more, so much more. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Real-life simulation </strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Discover a unique in-game but known in-life trash sorting mechanic, proper day and night differences, where night means is really dark, special immersive lifting and carrying objects. Heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads. Explore the forests, discover and learn about plants, herbs, and mushrooms. Meet and observe animals.
