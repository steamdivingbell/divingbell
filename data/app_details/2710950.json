{"about_the_game":"You are a respected gastroenterologist at the height of your profession. You have seen it all and treated it all. There is nothing you cannot handle. You do not know it yet but this is your final week.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>You will spend your time deep in the claustrophobic colons of your patients. You will have to identify and treat any and all ailments you discover in order to ensure the future health of your patients. You will have access to a range of specialized medical instruments to aid you in this task.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story Driven</h2>The game is played in five chapters. Each chapter focuses on treating the ailments of a different patient. The week starts off normally but as the week progresses you encounter the things of a gastroenterologist's nightmares.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiple Endings</h2>How you play the game makes a difference to the ending of each chapter and to the ending of the game as a whole.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Body Horror</h2>It is not just about generic blood and guts. Each chapter of the game focuses on different aspects of body horror so that players will have something different to encounter with every patient.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Visual Style</h2>We chose the retro PS1 style because we know it is much enjoyed by fans of the indie horror genre. The crudeness of the visual style combined with the game's subject matter helps to create an atmosphere of nostalgic unease.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Happy Retirement","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2710950/4d8f44c338e61b0f618fc3e341af498ee8da8f17.jpg"},{"name":"Quietly Asked To Leave","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2710950/4dafce57cfae5130ccf600960f6a813a4d64811f.jpg"},{"name":"Oops!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2710950/1075f05682782cddfff3ed428e26f485cabf5530.jpg"},{"name":"Need To Know","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2710950/044decb8390316f0a7079d5822a5017cdf0a201c.jpg"}],"total":4},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2710950/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1717442100","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2710950/page.bg.jpg?t=1717442100","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2710950/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1717442100","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2710950/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1717442100","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"The blood and gore in this game is depicted as the result of surgical procedures.
