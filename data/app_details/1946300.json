{"about_the_game":"Masks of Deception is a 6 player horror game where you must use teamwork, equipment, and sensing abilities to identify then exorcize the demon in your group... or the demon will slay you first. You\u2019ve been sent to disrupt and purge a demon before it claims three lives and fulfills its ritual. Purgers (innocents) must be cautious in performing their task as the demon isn\u2019t the only one looking to slay them.

Time is of the essence to figure out the Demon\u2019s type, with both uncovered you can vote and cast the incantation to exorcize the Demon. Performed correctly the Demon will be purged from this world and the Purgers will win. However if the vote is cast incorrectly the Purgers will lose and the Demon will be freed.
