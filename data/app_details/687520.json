{"about_the_game":"Realm Quest was a free online role-playing game designed by and built for the players. If you're curious more about what the game was like it's all over on the website.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI took a hiatus from all social media and developing the game after losing the job I had and catching my partner at the time cheating on me. Lost most of my friends after calling her out, the rest slowly stopped talking with me over the years. By the time Covid hit, I didn't really have anyone left in my life to talk with.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter a few months of being locked inside with no one to share anything with I ended up throwing together a simple chat app using html/nodejs where anyone could meet random strangers with similar interests. It got a lot more popular than I ever thought it would, and ended up having a lot of fun engaging with users, listening to their feedback, messing around with cool features they would suggest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe only annoying part of it all was constantly dealing with bots, scammers, hackers, all sorts of annoying activity. Having to go through and review user reports was mostly just repetitive, some losers would cry online insulting me because I banned them and it didn't bother me, some of the posts were hilarious. At least, it didn't until until a pedophile started spamming adult websites with links to my projects, impersonating me, posting my contact information on social media, harassing people in the community. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDealing with the crazy and mentally unstable is part of life, but somehow this predator has managed to piss people off and convince them they're me. I've tried to keep this creep away from the community but I can't keep up with them making new accounts and using bots to spam my personal information online. Nearly everyone that joined the Discord server or posted on the Steam forums would share what my stalkers up to or insist I kill myself. Only a few people were interested enough to ask what was going on.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhenever someone did reach out I would share their chat logs where they're offering to buy pictures or videos of children doing what they want. Hoped that would stop people from flaming the servers with what my stalker is doing but it's only escalated the situation and made things worse. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt's just depressing dealing with people when nearly every interaction is a reminder that no one is interested in anything I'm doing, most people seem to hate me for something I can't control, and that a pervert harassing children has more friends and support in this world than I ever will.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cThere is no real ending. It's just the place where you stop the story.\u201d \u2015Frank Herbert<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI'm really sorry, the game is a passion of mine and I would love to share it with others but mental health is far more important than being surrounded by people who remind me we live in a society.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/687520/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1718773426","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/687520/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1718773426","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/687520/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718773426","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/687520/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718773426","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Supported","id":53},{"description":"Stats","id":15}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Realm Quest was a free online role-playing game designed by and built for the players.
