{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Meet the Seaweed:</h2>Slice of Sea is a a peaceful adventure and puzzle game. You play as Seaweed, a sea creature in a metal armor clearly out of their element, as you find yourself at the beginning of the game in desolate mountains with no sea in sight.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">World:</h2>This is the world of Daymare. Most of structures you'll find are abandoned. Entropy has set deep within its walls and it seems that as native inhabitants left long time ago, completely new menagerie was ready to settle in.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story:</h2>Seaweed desperately needs to get back home, to the sea. There's a desert in between him and the shore. It's up to you to help him.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Puzzles:</h2>Seaweed's armor has legs, but no arms. That means that while you traverse this world by walking as Seaweed, he's counting on you, the overseeing omnipotent witness to solve all puzzles. Use keyboard to move around and mouse to interact with surroundings.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Graphics:</h2>Entire game was hand-drawn with ink on paper, which gives very specific character to all locations and creatures. There's nothing auto-generated nor procedural. Each location was thoughtfully designed. Stylized drawings give the game its eerie atmosphere.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Music:</h2>Ambient music was created by Thumpmonks and main theme song written and performed by Cat Jahnke.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Parkour!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/750290/8a190fbd213368fedd63055206926fcae1cca83d.jpg"},{"name":"Daredevil","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/750290/83170064451523a18b879f2666f29a34ee8802f0.jpg"},{"name":"Code Breaker","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/750290/b18a0a464b01bb18fa606b98d396b896c5596a64.jpg"},{"name":"Seaweed, not Tumbleweed","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/750290/72c985cf4b302ced1ca74baccc3191cf61c222c2.jpg"},{"name":"Gardener","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/750290/406144d179c2642fb8cb7e41ecc19620b5f29b49.jpg"},{"name":"Bouncy!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/750290/c36742b99934ab77c5ca33c74951808e8aed71bf.jpg"},{"name":"the Last Gnome","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/750290/41dad681a94a1042e1a37dd9a95e173597f31236.jpg"},{"name":"In the Darkness","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/750290/efaaf20796ef652d3ed74e0ac89c06f9a33c466a.jpg"},{"name":"Ornithologist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/750290/5a1f2e52b2adb23ce6db794740d0ab68f6111209.jpg"},{"name":"Tourist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/750290/208665aa1de871165469dae1d29a7dda0dd69e9c.jpg"}],"total":18},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/750290/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732886533","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/750290/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1732886533","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/750290/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732886533","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/750290/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732886533","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Meet the Seaweed:</h2>Slice of Sea is a a peaceful adventure and puzzle game.
