{"about_the_game":"\u200bHave you ever wondered what it would be like to play air hockey with bumper cars? Then Laser Cup is the ideal game for you!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSelect one of 8 teams from all over the solar system to compete in high paced, physics-based matches against your best friends. But be warned: They might not be your best friends once the match is over. There's no need to worry though because even when you inevitably run out of friends you will still be able to compete in public matches or against AI enemies. Use crazy powerups, like magnets and shockwaves, to get an edge over your opponents.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game looks and sounds like it's ripped straight from an 80s arcade with its vectorized, neon graphics and its early-techno soundtrack. But don't be fooled, the game is action-packed to the brim combining the best elements of the last 5 decades of sports video games.\u200b","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1496220?t=1613655155","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1496220?t=1613655155","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1496220/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1613655155","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1496220/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1613655155","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"\u200bHave you ever wondered what it would be like to play air hockey with bumper cars?
