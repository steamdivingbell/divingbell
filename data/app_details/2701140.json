However, internal dissent grew as some questioned the need for a singular global authority. To manage this, the Republic started relocating separatists to these new colonies. You are now assigned to establish and manage a colony on MORA under the World Republic\u2019s directive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>The game includes two modes: First-Person and Government.
