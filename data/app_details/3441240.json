{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">START IN 1980-1990</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Enter a football world visually set in the 90's. The big pads, the neck rolls, waffle sole cleats, teal colored turf and larger than life sports personalities! Immerse yourself in the story, strategy and sports nostalgia.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Generate a world, create your coach, set your scheme, start as a high school coordinator in any U.S. state and see where your football coaching story goes! 32-64 high school teams, 100+ in 10 college conferences and 32 in the National Football Association! </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">COACH CHARACTER</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your character has 20 skills that must be organized into 4 categories which will determine their starting value and how expensive they will be to increase later. They also have 5 attributes of Leadership, Charisma, Management, Development and Tactics. These attributes scale your skills and increase along with them.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TEAM MANAGEMENT</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There are 43 players on your team, each has 10 basic skills like Running, Coverage or Passing. In addition, each player has a number of traits and abilities that will make them valuable in various ways. Equip them with coach actions or abilities to tailor certain players to your needs. To top it all off, each player has three modifiers which are Morale, Install and Health. A player is dynamic and can't be summed up by an OVR rating. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">COACHING STAFF</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You will be a part of an actual coaching staff made up of a head coach and two coordinators. Each head coach will delegate duties differently so being under one coach won't be like another. As an OC, maybe you set the offensive depth chart, maybe not. Maybe you oversee the off season training, maybe not. It all depends. As an HC, you can set these duties how you wish but even then coordinators have wants too. Some will want more responsibility while other less. Ai coaches don't just make optimal decisions either. They each have their own priorities for what they value in a player of a certain position. Maybe it's Coverage for a linebacker or Shedding for a defensive lineman. Maybe they take into account a player's modified skill, maybe they don't. Maybe they value weight more than height for another position. No two coaches do things exactly the same.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TV SHOWS</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Keep up to date on events, news, scores and controversies with a full slate of tv shows from CSPN for high school, college and pro football. Watch as the show hosts layout the scores, stats and game analysis. So grab some pizza or whatever your pleasure is and watch the show! Don't forget the remote!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">COACH CONTRACTS</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">At the end of each season, decide if you want to honor your contract and continue the season or resign but be careful as you will get a reputation penalty. At the end of each contract, your results will be evaluated and you'll be offered an extension with a raise or fired. You might even get promoted if you are a coordinator. If you happen to leave the team, look for more jobs in the newspaper while reading the articles about other coaches around the country. Apply for available jobs and even compete in an interview mini-game against other candidates!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3441240/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737120442","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3441240/page.bg.jpg?t=1737120442","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3441240/292f7ebcfeaccdb88f6f3e7cf1e923dfa20dc3a9/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737120442","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3441240/292f7ebcfeaccdb88f6f3e7cf1e923dfa20dc3a9/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737120442","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">START IN 1980-1990</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Enter a football world visually set in the 90's.
