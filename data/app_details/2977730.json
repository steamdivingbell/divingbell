{"about_the_game":"9 new in-game music tracks to enhance Flatspace. Like any in-game music for Flatspace, these will trigger at random when you enter a new sector. Three music packs were designed for the Flatspace and Flatspace II games, and this pack is the original Music Pack 2 for the first Flatspace game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe music of the Flatspace IIk packs overlaps the former packs to a great extent; but not exclusively. Each pack had new and unique tracks, or alternative edits. When Flatspace IIk was released on Steam, the three Flatspace IIk Music Packs were revised, but the packs for the first game were forgotten. Now they are back for you to enjoy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack includes a full description of the music as a pdf booklet. Here is an outline of the music included:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChina Syndrome Edit<br />\r\nThis music was written for a game called Martian Rover Patrol II, a sequel to (you guessed it) Martian Rover Patrol. That was one of my first PC games, a 2D game which itself was not available for over 15 years until its 2023 remaster.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMusic For Supermarkets<br />\r\nThis track and Binary Race are the oldest tracks in the collection. It was the main theme to wireframe shooter Outliner. The title comes from a Jean-Michel Jarre album; I chose the name because it reminded me of Christmas shopping!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBinary Race<br />\r\nCreated using Noise Station in 2002, this was the main theme to Breakout Velocity, one of the first batch of Cornutopia games. A slower variation of the music was used in the game's sequel, Fallout Velocity. Both games were (and are) breakout variants.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFlatspace Tango<br />\r\nAnother track not present in the Flatspace IIk sound packs, this is a variation of the main Flatspace theme in strong electronic instruments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDeflexion Highscore<br />\r\nDeflexion was a game prototype that crossed Bool, Pong, and Breakout to make a sort of multi-player battle version of breakout. The game didn't make it into production but the main theme was used for Gunstorm. This music was written for the high score table, but not used, so here it is.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYinyang<br />\r\nYinyang was another early game for me, and one that is on Steam right now. The game idea dates back to my first ever Amiga public domain game, The Challenge of the Matrix from 1991.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStarflight Edit<br />\r\nA thrilling tune of joy and space adventure. Created as a general action theme, it became the finale to my album Stupid Computer Music. This edit is new for 2024 and this sound pack.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLost Child<br />\r\nAn atmospheric studio track created in 2003.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJourney Through Fractional Space<br />\r\nCommissioned by a Flatspace II player, the brief was to create an action tune that crossed two existing tunes from the first game: Catacombs and Cobra.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHighscore Happiness<br />\r\nWritten as a general theme for a high score table, this was never utilised.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2977730/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737553933","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2977730/page.bg.jpg?t=1737553933","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2977730/5b84d5a13c01b73ac029fc2fa1cab6bc4ac2adcd/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737553933","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2977730/5b84d5a13c01b73ac029fc2fa1cab6bc4ac2adcd/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737553933","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"9 new in-game music tracks to enhance Flatspace.
