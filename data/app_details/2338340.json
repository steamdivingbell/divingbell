{"about_the_game":"Fill your cities with neon decorations and proper signage with the Sci-Fi and Modern Tileset - Exterior! This pack is stuffed with tiles, with full A1-A5 and B-E sheets ready to create incredible cities with waterways, colorful flower beds, and buildings built from stone and steel. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBuild a city center where skyscrapers with huge glass windows and topped with solar panels tower over a popup market filled with canopy tents and important supplies for your heroes to buy. If your players are lacking in money, you could direct them through a hole in a chain-link fence to explore the dark and trash-filled alleys hidden behind a train station. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, 14 alternate sheets can help you make a bunch of towns without having each one look exactly the same! Create two rival towns with similar layouts but different color schemes, or grow a magical garden with bright crystals and colorful bio-engineered bushes!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack also includes animated sprites for doors, cars, traffic lights, and even moving sidewalks to add some movement to your maps! Make traveling around the map quick by letting your players jump into a car to race to the opposite side of the city, or force them to obey red lights (or let them jaywalk and have to avoid getting hit by speeding cars). And keep your NPCs safe from hay fever with masks that you can add to their sprites! Choose from 16 different colors, from plain white and black masks to striped and even rainbow-colored ones, to help disguise your heroes when they need to lay low. This pack comes sized for both Ace and MV/MZ, so what are you waiting for?
