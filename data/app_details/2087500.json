{"about_the_game":"You were created to purge all that defile. Slaughter hoards of such filth during your ascension, gaining powerful items and abilities with every drop of blood.

Share in this virtuous crusade with up to three friends in Online multiplayer co-op!<br><br>Born of the divine and locked away, you know only of killing. Instilled with some form of morality, you must rise above your creator to protect the crumbling world around you. Something or <i>somethings</i> have trespassed on this holy ground, and it's your responsibility to see to their removal. Starting weak and frail you must hone yourself and your surroundings to benefit your hunt. Craft powerful weapons and abilities, and build up the land you stand on to suit your strengths.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Unlimited Potential</strong><br>With tons of customizable items, abilities, and passives there's endless room for character improvement!
