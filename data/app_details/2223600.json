{"about_the_game":"<strong>Recruit a team!</strong><br>Unlock from a roster of 23 units and pick 9 to take into battle!  A variety of attack, defense, health, speed, cost, and range stats gives every unit a place though not every unit is required. What will be your favorite team?<br><br><strong>Direct your troops!</strong><br>Your troops will move on their own initiative to engage the enemy at their castle, but the entire battlefield is full of resources! Move troops around with the UI or keyboard to capture tiles for more resources! These resources can in turn be spent for a greater quality or quantity of troops!<br><br><strong>Play through a variety of levels!</strong><br>Conquer 28 levels as the battlefield evolves and the enemy focuses on different units! As you progress the levels will get larger and more complex, however the rewards for completion will increase as well!<br><br>Sales have been discontinued due to sounds licensed from one company that may have been stolen from another company. They may continue once issue has been resolved or sounds replaced.
