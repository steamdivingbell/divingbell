{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3174830/extras/Wishlist_Now.png?t=1733436241\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Embark on a dark, brutal quest in this first-person, party-based dungeon crawler. Choose from 42 classes to form your 6-member team and conquer the Dark Tower in Original Mode. Every decision matters in this medieval world where insanity and death are commonplace. Will you survive, or fall like the adventures of the past? </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In tamer mode, you only get one party member. But you will be able to recruit one of the 58 recruitable monsters along your way.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3174830/extras/The_Tower.png?t=1733436241\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Before the great coming of despair, everything was normal. Then the sun began to blacken, the skies were full of blood, and light became the most traded resource among those who lived. The vile beasts entered the world, kingdoms fell and new villages prospered. Humanity banded together to march to the Gate of the Abyss, sending parties to explore and to kill whatever Dark God created the Abyss.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Those who enter will gain broken bones, infections, and will bleed to death, unless they are prepared.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3174830/extras/The_Town.png?t=1733436241\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Town is a nameless place where those who go into the Abyss rest before they die a painful death. Its short history is randomized when you start, impacting everything in very small ways, so it has a life of its own. It has everything a traveler would need. Stores, a church, a prison, a town hall, and more. Get quests to do things in the town, or help out the people. They give many gifts and new teachings to survive. Go to stores to buy and sell, or to loot and slaughter whoever runs them. Ignore the cries from the prison, or help them with revenge against the shopkeepers and the Church. The stores run on a stock market simulation in the background, impacting if they stay around or not. \u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You are going to need  lots of food, steel, and courage to survive. Make sure to always be  prepared, always be sane, and to eat before your food rots. \u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Outside  the town, the beasts may make your party go insane. Maintaining a  sanity level of each party member is key to survival. Set up Campfires  for everybody to speak their mind, search for goods, and more depending  on what they are. If not, then when they go insane they will leave the  party as they shout unknown phrases into the night. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">How much you can purchase or get loans depends on your credit score with the people, and how much debt you get yourself into. Buy things and you will look better for loans. Loans give money but debt that quickly compounds. If you get into too much debt, a debt collector will come to collect a soul.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3174830/extras/The_party.png?t=1733436241\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your 6 crew members are fragile, but with time, they may become strong.
