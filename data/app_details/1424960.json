{"about_the_game":"This game is minimalist in every aspect. No enemies, no points, no time limit, no collectibles, only jumping! But that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll have an easy time!<br />\r\nAll levels filled up with platforms randomly, and those platforms are tricky. one can change its length, the other its visibility but there is also one that changes its position. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you choose a difficulty level you decide how many lives you start the game with. But beware, because one mistake is one life, and there is 40+ levels in the main game! Your progress will be saved automatically, but just locally. Steam Cloud isn't available.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is developed by one person. Except for music. All music track is created by Eric Matyas. I would like to thank him again!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1424960/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1604471924","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1424960/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1604471924","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1424960/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1604471924","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1424960/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1604471924","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":1462770,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"This game is minimalist in every aspect.
