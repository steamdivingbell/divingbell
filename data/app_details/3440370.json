Eat and digest them. Cozy up with your favorite character? Stuff yourself down her throat and get inside her belly. It's not just fetish content, in this game vore is practical, purposeful, and leads to interesting mechanics that are unique from other Strategy RPGs.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A mix of classic turn-based gameplay with modern Gacha design</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why emulate gacha design? Don't worry, it's <strong>not</strong> for the monetization. Vessel Tactics will always be completely microtransaction free. It's a clean, seamless way of giving you a lot of units to play with. It would dampen the fun if you had to be too conservative with your units, so this way units that are digested can always be pulled again. Any dupes can be used as food to strengthen your favorite characters, or recycled by feeding them to the giantess that dwells within the heart of your base. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Weak Are Meat and the Strong Do Eat</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Battles are contests between teams to completely consume one another. Every enemy is capable of churning up your units as well, so you'll need to keep your wits about you if you don't want to lose anyone to their hungry maws. It's not the end of the world if they are digested, in fact, many units may strategically be used as prey. A good commander will leverage their team as needed, allowing their units to eat each other- or even be eaten by enemies -as suits the situation.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Coming soon...</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vessel tactics is still early in development, but if you like what you see please wishlist the game!
