Some rooms have obstacles, treasure, travelling merchants, fields, and more.<br>In battle rooms, fight creatures using an autobattling system or use your pets' skills in real time. Encounter treasure rooms where you can collect loot: money, gems, or items to aid in your travels.

You can also transfer over skills, passives, and even the breed or element of a pet!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Create Stuff</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1929720/extras/craft00.png?t=1670588982\" /><br>Own a home, and purchase fixtures for it!
