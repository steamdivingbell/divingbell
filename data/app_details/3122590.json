{"about_the_game":"Site 17 is an indie scifi-horror game developed by Fallen Crown Games. <br><br><strong>The Gameplay</strong><br>Site 17's gameplay is relatively simple. You are trapped alone in a room. You cannot run, and you cannot fight. You can view the cameras, electrify the corridors, and close the doors. You must survive from 12:00am to 6:00am for the entirety of your mandatory minimum employment period, while avoiding the robotic worker drones trying to reach your office.<br><br><strong>The Story</strong><br>In the year 2047, 90% of the workforce across the entirety of the I.R.C is automated. Robotic drones roam the corridors of ships and stations across the cosmos, performing their tasks without complaint, guided by an interconnected network of drones linked by the central computer (The Meshnet). Under I.R.C law, 10% of the workforce must consist of organic workers. With such little importance placed on the safety of disposable drones, the facility is poorly maintained. Unfortunately for you, this means that getting drafted into employment as the Facility Operations Manager is the worst thing that can possibly happen to you. <br><br>On your first day, the facility's central computer goes offline. The bots take over regulation of the Meshnet using their internal systems, but as fate (or the accountants) would have it, their data drives do not contain any copies of the Security Database. Your employee ID badge is flagged as invalid, and you are marked for experimentation as a trespasser on I.R.C. property.<br><br>With the bots trying to kill you and the facility in lockdown mode, you must survive until the end of your shift, when the central computer resets.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3122590/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725361890","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3122590/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1725361890","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3122590/82be514c493518e0c5ab684566fff567eab41aa1/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725361890","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3122590/82be514c493518e0c5ab684566fff567eab41aa1/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725361890","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Site 17 is an indie scifi-horror game developed by Fallen Crown Games. <br><br><strong>The Gameplay</strong><br>Site 17's gameplay is relatively simple.
