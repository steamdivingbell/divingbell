{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Starfinder RPG - Starfinder Adventure: Junker's Delight</h2> The first stand-alone adventure for the Starfinder RPG is here! Centuries ago, the <i>Stellar Flare</i> --a science vessel researching the strange dimension known as the Drift--crashed on the surface of Akiton. Now, Vari-13, an android with a claim to the <i>Stellar Flare</i> , wants to find the wreck and rescue its valuable research. But Vari-13 will need help, and that's where your heroes come in. The <i>Stellar Flare's</i> remains lie in the middle of an enormous junk field filled with malfunctioning technology, inhabited by predatory creatures, and fought over by territorial space goblins. And there are whispers of an enormous robot made entirely of junk that wanders the scrapyards, immune to magic and eager to destroy everything in its path. Can your heroes broker a peace, reach the wreckage, and defend it against an army of scavengers? <i>Junker's Delight</i> is a complete Starfinder adventure for 1st-level characters written by Jason Keeley and Misha Bushyager. It features strange new alien creatures, new spells and equipment, and an in-depth look at Khefak Depot, a rough-and-tumble Akitonian settlement home to countless adventures!<br> <i>This product is not a PDF or accessible outside of Fantasy Grounds.
