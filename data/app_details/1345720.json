{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CITY OF CRIMES</h2>Enter the city of sin and corruption and find your way around it. Stroll down the grey streets, trying not to get lost in this this sad, concrete town, and be prepared to be called into the field office. Murders, thefts, kidnapping, drug businesses, mafia and organized crime \u2013 all of these cases are your daily bread, but it\u2019s high time they were no more.<br>Are you ready to face the ugly truth and deal with the consequences?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WHO ARE YOU?</h2>What kind of agent do you want to be? In this game you will be able to choose your approach and follow your instincts. Should you put the arm on the suspect or pretend to befriend him? Or maybe let him loose, only to follow him and make an ambush? It\u2019s up to you, but remember \u2013 time is of the essence and the lives of the people hang entirely on your success\u2026 or failure.<br>So, are you going to be a good cop, or a bad cop after all?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">INVESTIGATE</h2>As soon as you receive the call \u2013 pack all the high-tech stuff and examine the crime scene. Who could do it better than an FBI agent, right? Especially since you are well-prepared and own a bag full of specialized tools that will allow you to look for the finger prints, test the blood samples, hack into the devices or instantly look through the police records. Gather all the evidence from the crime scene and take them to the lab!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SOLVE THE PUZZLE</h2>After running through the evidence, you have to try to find a pattern. Maybe it\u2019s about the look of the victims? Or the location of the crime scenes? Or the suspect\u2019s background? The reason behind the murder is different each time and solving the puzzle requires both analytical thinking and perceptivity. Use the old-school, cork board mind map and look for the similarities. The more evidence you have, the easier the task will be!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">INTERVIEW</h2>If you have enough data, it\u2019s time to narrow down the list of the suspects and set up some interviews. Prepare yourself and don\u2019t lose your nerve. The culprit may want to put you off your stroke! Decide on the right approach and choose the dialogue options that will allow you to find out more about the crime and define whether the person sitting across the table is guilty or not. You may use the polygraph to help you out!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FIND AND ACCUSSE</h2>Having found the culprit? Great! All you have to do now is to arrest them and put them behind bars. Let\u2019s just hope that you have done everything right! It would be such a shame to frame someone\u2026 However, even if you manage to choose the right person, you cannot rest on your laurels. As soon as one criminal lands in jail, the other one just starts doing atrocious things. The job of the FBI agent is never done\u2026 So you\u2019d better brace yourself and brew some coffee!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PREVENT AND REACT</h2>Try to prevent the crimes from happening by using the information provided by the counterintelligence and infiltrators, but be prepared for the worse. And when it happens - solve the puzzle and find the criminal by connecting all the dots. Interview, accuse and put them in jail to make sure, that they never hurt anyone again.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1345720/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1711453375","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1345720/page.bg.jpg?t=1711453375","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1345720/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1711453375","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1345720/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1711453375","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Add FREE game I Am Your President: Prologue to Wishlist</h1><p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CITY OF CRIMES</h2>Enter the city of sin and corruption and find your way around it.
