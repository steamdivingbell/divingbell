Choose directions wisely and apply force carefully to minimise rocking and tilting and avoid capsizing. Go around obstacles with the surgeon\u2019s precision to keep the boat in one piece. Mistakes cost precious live cargo and materials, and the old man's stamina is a finite resource. Every decision is critical.<br><br>RESCUE AND SIT RABBITS<br><br>Finding the perfect time to pick rabbits is one side of the problem. How about sitting jumpy animals around the boat to achieve balance? The boat's behaviour depends on it, and therefore your life! Don\u2019t miss a safe zone to release your fellow travellers or drown together and be forgotten.<br><br>FIGHT FATIGUE<br><br>Mental and physical fatigue are your eternal silent companions, that you have to deal with to survive. Collect and identify Siberian herbs and berries, mix them and brew a cosy cup of tea in safe zones to ease physical fatigue. Or not too cosy and get some unexpected side effects. Live through events of your past as mini-games to reduce or increase mental fatigue when dreaming next to the bonfire.<br><br>UPGRADE AND MODIFY<br><br>Your only ally, a mysterious prosthetic arm, holds the key to survival. Upgrade it with unique mods, and unleash its potential to travel further, push stronger, and save more lives. The boat barely stays afloat, but natural wit and a bit of luck will get you some cool artefacts increasing the boat\u2019s stability or strength when it is needed the most.<br><br>LIVE THROUGH APOCALYPTICAL EVENTS<br><br>Fight the forces of nature to save it and give humanity another chance. Find a new meaning in life and watch how the broken old man transforms physically and mentally.
