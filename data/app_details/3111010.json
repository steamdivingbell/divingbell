In his grief, he returns to the county town's Hongqiang Hospital, where he passes through numerous trials to enter &quot;Ward No. 9,&quot; in order to fulfill his girlfriend's last wish and find out the cause of his own never-seen daughter's death. <br />\r\nHongqiang Hospital is a public-private partnership hospital converted from a temporary shelter during the flood five years ago, controlled by the major shareholder, Medical Bureau Director David Ma , and the hospital director Fred Xu. &quot;Ward No. 9&quot; is rumored to be haunted by a LakeLady, and children are often said to be taken away by it. Salvio suspects that his daughter Selene's disappearance is related to the water ghost incidents...<br />\r\nThe patients in Ward No. 9 are all children, and Salvio has developed a bond with them. Taking advantage of his position, he begins to investigate and unexpectedly encounters the water ghost! Soon after, a girl mysteriously disappears...<br />\r\nWith a common goal,  Salvio , with the help of his girlfriend's sister Ryann Zhang, his university friend Melinda Gu , and the single mother Yarona Lin who has lost her child, gets closer to the truth. In the missing list, he finds his daughter's name, and more and more clues related to the disappearance case are emerging...<br />\r\nIs it the work of the LakeLady? Or a conspiracy within the hospital? Is it a power game involving organ trafficking and corruption among the elite? Or an underground deal that cannot balance emotions and interests?
