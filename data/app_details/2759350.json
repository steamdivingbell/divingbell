{"about_the_game":"E-flite\u00ae Timber\u00ae models have become some of the most popular and best-selling RC aircraft of all time. Known for their friendly handling, Short Take Off and Landing (STOL) capabilities, and sporty flight performance, they\u2019re some of the best all-around fun-to-fly models for a wide range of pilots. The E-flite\u00ae Turbo Timber\u00ae SWS (Sport Wood Series) 2.0m is the largest Timber model from E-flite yet, plus it offers the advantages of lightweight, stiff and strong wood construction to deliver flight performance unlike similar class foam models. It\u2019s available in an ARF version that bolts together and is ready for installation of your preferred power system and electronics, or in a BNF\u00ae Basic version that\u2019s equipped with six factory-installed servos, a 4S to 6S compatible Spektrum\u2122 Avian\u2122 motor and Smart ESC, plus an 8-channel receiver with AS3X and SAFE Select technologies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis model is equipped with Horizon Hobby and Spektrum exclusive AS3X (Artificial Stabilization \u2013 3-aXis) and optional-use SAFE (Sensor Assisted Flight Envelope) Select technologies, and when SAFE Select is turned on using the mode switch (B on the Spektrum InterLink DX controller) it offers:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPitch and Bank Angle Limits<br />\r\nThese envelope limits keep the airplane from rolling or pitching upside down.
