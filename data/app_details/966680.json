Puzzles aren't terribly difficult, but usually come to a satisfying enough resolution, and always feel necessary to the overall narrative. While the game's commander, a voice over guide, can grated on my nerves, it's an easy defect to ignore in the face of an overall excellent sci-fi thriller adventure.\u201d<br>8.3 / 10 \u2013 Road To VR<br><br>\u201cIt is pretty damn clear by now that I am impressed with this game. When it comes to design, this team nailed the most important aspect of a VR game. It has to feel natural. This goes into every area of game design, from world building, to narrative, all the way to how the player interacts with a button on a desk lamp. Red Matter is a shining example of what making the correct design decisions, for the story your trying to sell, looks like.\u201d<br>9.6 / 10 \u2013 VR the Gamers<br><br>\u201cAll in all, Red Matter is a very high calibre VR experience, neatly weaving its story and puzzle elements together. It by no means perfect, following the line of other puzzles in VR that are seemingly unable to offer plenty of reasons to come back for more. So like a good meal take it slowly and savour the moment.\u201d<br>8.0 / 10 \u2013 VRFocus<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/966680/ss_27f3e52af165782270cdc9d3b78a5e31a82e6aab.1920x1080.jpg?t=1727912175","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/966680/ss_27f3e52af165782270cdc9d3b78a5e31a82e6aab.600x338.jpg?t=1727912175"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/966680/ss_c30f0f7e6aac9dda0e9e8dad40fd0c252df46737.1920x1080.jpg?t=1727912175","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/966680/ss_c30f0f7e6aac9dda0e9e8dad40fd0c252df46737.600x338.jpg?t=1727912175"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/966680/ss_b6812026fbcc844c6ff8c92b0d13cb76028a7331.1920x1080.jpg?t=1727912175","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/966680/ss_b6812026fbcc844c6ff8c92b0d13cb76028a7331.600x338.jpg?t=1727912175"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/966680/ss_7247ecc9b3d9fd29edcd9201935ea2c218d960bc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1727912175","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/966680/ss_7247ecc9b3d9fd29edcd9201935ea2c218d960bc.600x338.jpg?t=1727912175"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/966680/ss_e06f34977799b5b173eeb65bf2fc800699d7c618.1920x1080.jpg?t=1727912175","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/966680/ss_e06f34977799b5b173eeb65bf2fc800699d7c618.600x338.jpg?t=1727912175"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/966680/ss_30402b2baa4743f82e06699e43ac6843880184fa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1727912175","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/966680/ss_30402b2baa4743f82e06699e43ac6843880184fa.600x338.jpg?t=1727912175"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/966680/ss_0e3084137f2589aca9ec41532ac05d860c22359b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1727912175","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/966680/ss_0e3084137f2589aca9ec41532ac05d860c22359b.600x338.jpg?t=1727912175"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/966680/ss_30f7da1a455bf477d19175bdf05f2982bf10c1f0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1727912175","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/966680/ss_30f7da1a455bf477d19175bdf05f2982bf10c1f0.600x338.jpg?t=1727912175"}],"short_description":"Red Matter is a story-driven VR puzzle adventure game set during a dystopian sci-fi Cold War.
