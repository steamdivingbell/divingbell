{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Push 3D is a digital re-creation of the Push board-game, created by Dave Shedden. In this game, players take turns moving a game piece around a Hex-based board. On their turn, a player can make two out of three choices. They can flip a tile, making it a &quot;Slip&quot; surface, where moving across them will cause the piece to slip to the other side. Alternatively, players can move their piece in a given direction, or, if they are in a direct line with each other, they can &quot;Push&quot; their opponent backwards. <br><br>Can you out-think your opponent as the board fills with Slip tiles? Are you cunning enough to be the Player that pushes the other off the board, sealing your victory as champion? Prove it now, by playing a friend in this online multi-player game.</p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Ah, Push it...","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3253340/e4ed5f80d7bc3e5dd75c212a75ed2b888d8260d5.jpg"},{"name":"Ooh, Baby Baby...","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3253340/dd003fb49437e23b40004c04b6619b770c387506.jpg"},{"name":"This dance ain't for everybody","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3253340/b2f4abd1740e8e1c8c64009cac2b34cb69f45f6d.jpg"},{"name":"Cooling by day","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3253340/c4d045105f485377419d8e2383514cbbc556dbdb.jpg"}],"total":4},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3253340?t=1738448115","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3253340?t=1738448115","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3253340/46da3d4803f6f106a836561df598617fc22856a2/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738448115","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3253340/46da3d4803f6f106a836561df598617fc22856a2/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738448115","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Push 3D is a digital re-creation of the Push board-game, created by Dave Shedden.
