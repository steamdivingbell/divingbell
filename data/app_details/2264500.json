{"about_the_game":"GUACOMOLE is a classic arcade shooter with a twist... Survive endless waves of chip enemies with only one bullet. A seamless cross between classics such as Pong and Asteroids. Enjoy a challenging and strategical experience that will leave you hungry for more!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay as Guaco, the ultimate chip destroyer, with a single bullet. Your bullet bounces off of walls and enemies. Plan your shots carefully, as you need to catch your bullet in order to shoot again. Watch out as bosses will drop chip shards in order to block your escape. If you're lucky, a defeated boss will reward you with an extra life... or even a nuke. Survive as long as you can while increasingly difficult waves of enemies try to overwhelm you. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay your best to break your high score. Earn challenging achievements to show off to your friends. Play with mouse and keyboard or sit back on the couch with a controller.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Fresh Guac","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2264500/7c1e727638e6462f8cc77f94e8abe17d0ef6a1d6.jpg"},{"name":"Nacho Friend","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2264500/7c1e727638e6462f8cc77f94e8abe17d0ef6a1d6.jpg"},{"name":"Guac Addict","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2264500/7c1e727638e6462f8cc77f94e8abe17d0ef6a1d6.jpg"},{"name":"Bankshot","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2264500/7c1e727638e6462f8cc77f94e8abe17d0ef6a1d6.jpg"},{"name":"Rebound","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2264500/7c1e727638e6462f8cc77f94e8abe17d0ef6a1d6.jpg"},{"name":"He Looked Mad","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2264500/7c1e727638e6462f8cc77f94e8abe17d0ef6a1d6.jpg"},{"name":"Too Easy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2264500/7c1e727638e6462f8cc77f94e8abe17d0ef6a1d6.jpg"},{"name":"Nuked","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2264500/7c1e727638e6462f8cc77f94e8abe17d0ef6a1d6.jpg"},{"name":"Second Life","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2264500/7c1e727638e6462f8cc77f94e8abe17d0ef6a1d6.jpg"},{"name":"Nukaholic","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2264500/7c1e727638e6462f8cc77f94e8abe17d0ef6a1d6.jpg"}],"total":20},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2264500?t=1675795491","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2264500?t=1675795491","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2264500/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1675795491","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2264500/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1675795491","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"GUACOMOLE is a classic arcade shooter with a twist...
