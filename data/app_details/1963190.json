{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Introduction </h2><br>This game is a high-depth walking simulator at the moment with some delirious and often times maddening labyrinth levels. Especially for level 0, which is the epitome of the Backrooms world. Now this world of existence is simply put, a race to explore your way out? -in? -somewhere... wherever you noclip to...or take the elevator. Yes... there are elevators. <br><br>Point is, players will experience the world of backrooms in a much more meaty and passionate experience from the developer(s). That's basically it, this is a community-oriented game project. So soon enough, more gameplay features and systems will emerge over time, depending on generous donors. As per usual, this is a liminal horror and mind numbingly curious world in regards to finding out what more can be explored. An adventure of sorts, into the backrooms. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1963190/extras/0ebec8de1ee42a1146cc817a3b8d1c5e.png?t=1728506060\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Idea Concept</strong></h2><br>On a serious note, this game world is an attempt to make a more comprehensive and calculative approach to the design of how the backrooms world will function as a cohesive world level design. The framework will utilize some unique design systems that we're researching and hoping to implement in this game project. Fractal generation to name a few. With some fancy additional algorithmic optimizations and formulas to better improve the framework of the game world. Not to mention a performance focused game using multi-threaded generated level helps in the design aspects of large maps complicated maps. In short, this isa bout a meaningful and unique design project with a backdrop theme for players to enjoy themselves as we explore the backend research of game systems. A win-win scenario. <br><br>Now here's a scope of what you may expect for gameplay in the future:<br><br>\u2022 Research Exploration, Hunting/Bounties, Rescue and/or Courier Missions<br>\u2022 Multiplayer Clans/Organizations system for Roleplay<br>\u2022 Custom-made levels, entities, and possible lore for backrooms world. (Mod support?) <br>\u2022 Survival with core stats such as thirst, hunger, stamina, sanity, and so forth. -but with more in-depth animation and simulative style. (Little to no HUD)<br>\u2022 My own story lore for Backrooms, with future DLC story missions to the backrooms world. <br><br>These are just some speculative ideas; the game development will still heavily involve community feedback and community-based creativity to build up on. As we are surely certain we'll be bombarded with numerous ideas and suggestions. This is just some of many implementable aspects to the gameplay.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Purpose and Development</strong></h2><br>It is vital to ensure that the players feel the motivation needed to traverse within these head-inducing and often times-maddening levels. Especially since boredom will decay the enthusiasm of an individual's fun within the game. It's still not going to be meant for most people, since this is basically a walking simulation for our early-testing development, but it'll soon grow to be a well-intended craft with purpose behind it. <br><br>So, with that in mind for the future game development- Level 0 will feature the comprehensive design that will be vital to understand our backrooms world. (Lore-related in mind and framework specialty) The idea would be to challenge players to a highly focused level where the unique level design will be featured, and additional supportive features will keep players at a sadistic level of &quot;speed-run&quot; exploration. The same can still apply for most levels but will feature level 0 as the centerpiece level of it all.
