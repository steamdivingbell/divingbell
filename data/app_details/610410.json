{"about_the_game":"<strong>IN A WORLD</strong> where the Council rules the nations with an iron fist, you play as Axo, pilot of the legendary ship Chukaru. Experience her fight with the limitless armies of the Council, become the master of Chukaru\u2019s power and find the true meaning behind all your actions. A dark secret is yet to be revealed!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong></h2>Accessible to the simple press of a button, Pawarumi offers you three different weapons and one super attack to rain divine fire on your enemies! To protect you in your intense journey, a shield will automatically trigger when you're about to be hit. It will annihilate any bullet around you! True to the shoot'em up genre, that shield is powerful but depletes very quickly so you'll still have to be very careful!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>THE TRINITY MECHANIC</strong></h2>By shooting with the right weapon on the right type of enemy, Chukaru's unique Trinity Mechanic enables you to deal extra damage, heal your shield or recharge your super attack at any time! Not unlike the famous game of rock-paper-scissors, this original gameplay mechanic gives a whole new tactical layer to the genre.<br><br>Mastering these three mechanics will be key to your success in Pawarumi.
