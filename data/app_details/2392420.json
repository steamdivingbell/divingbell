{"about_the_game":"Tired of playing the hero who\u2019s out to beat some bosses? Why not take the role of a boss instead!<br>This is what Wisplight is all about. It\u2019s an action-adventure game with a pretty interesting twist. Unlike most action-adventure games where you take on the role of a hero whose quest is to vanquish evil, Wisplight will have you play as the boss that humans have to fight against.<br>However, it\u2019s more than just your typical action-adventure game. Wisplight also features a bunch of interesting mechanics that will help reinforce your status of becoming the ultimate creature that human invaders will come to fear.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Monster Transformations</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2392420/extras/transformF.gif?t=1697581406\" /><br>You start off as a helpless wisp who\u2019s trying to fend off human settlers who are occupying your lands. In your attempt to ward off these unknown invaders, you need to enlist the help of various monster transformations which you unlock as the game progresses.<br>For now, we have a total of 5 monster transformations, each featuring different characters that will also change the overall gameplay of the game.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Ent \u2013 A tree-like creature, the Ent is the very first transformation you unlock. It specializes in stealth, allowing you to move through the forests undetected.<br></li><li>Skeleton Necromancer \u2013 This transformation focuses on conjuring skeleton minions to fight by your side. You can also assign a lot of them to various tasks in your dungeon.<br></li><li>Armor \u2013 A melee-focused transformation, the Armor is a master of both dual blades and two-handed swords. You can freely switch between the two anytime, and your weapons will even follow you and attack your enemies automatically. This transformation also allows you to disguise yourself as a human so you can spy on settlements with ease.<br></li><li>Rock Golem \u2013 A siege-focused transformation, the Rock Golem excels in raiding human settlements. However, it has very slow mobility, making it susceptible to focused attacks from human enemies.<br></li><li>Water Elemental \u2013 An agile ranged water elemental with the power to control the weather. It also has the ability to fast travel throughout the island by using various water sources.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Build Your Dungeon</strong></h2>During your adventure throughout the island, you\u2019ll come across caves, ruins, and other points of interest that you can claim. You\u2019ll then be able to set them as your base, allowing you to expand your influence throughout the area.<br>We have a wide variety of prefabricated structures that you can place, though we also give you the freedom to arrange them however you see fit.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>There will be dedicated spots in your settlement where you can assign workers such as blacksmiths, lumberjacks, crafters, and a whole lot more. They will be the ones to perform most of the brunt work involved in expanding your base.<br></li><li>You can assign wisps to gather resources for you which your other workers will then use for various purposes such as crafting, upgrading, etc.<br></li><li>As you continue expanding, human settlers will attempt to raid your settlement. It will be your responsibility to fortify your defenses and assign your minions to defend the base. You also have the option to set devious traps and other obstacles to thwart your enemies\u2019 advances.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Raid Human Settlements</strong></h2>If your enemies can raid your base, why can\u2019t you?<br>With the raid mechanic, you can also launch a raid on enemy human settlements to pillage for loot, rescue captured wisps, or simply wipe them off the map.<br>However, don\u2019t make the mistake of going unprepared. Human enemies will also attempt to fortify their base, and if you come unprepared, you\u2019ll end up getting yourself captured.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Multiple Endings</strong></h2>Wisplight isn\u2019t just all about action, it\u2019s also about telling a rich, engaging, and compelling story that you\u2019ll want to follow throughout your playthrough.<br>You can get yourself immersed in the narrative and even find tidbits of lore scattered throughout the game\u2019s world.<br>Each of your actions will have consequences that will gradually affect how the story will proceed and end. With multiple endings available, you can end up going through multiple playthroughs just to unlock all of them.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2392420/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1697581406","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2392420/page.bg.jpg?t=1697581406","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2392420/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1697581406","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2392420/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1697581406","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Tired of playing the hero who\u2019s out to beat some bosses?
