{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mini-Dungeons Bundle #191-195</h2> Mini-Dungeons are short, setting-agnostic adventures for 5th Edition which can be easily inserted anywhere in your campaign.<br> This bundle contains five such adventures for use with Fantasy Grounds Classic or Fantasy Grounds Unity (line of sight included).<br> <strong>MINI-DUNGEON #191: Penumbra Enclave</strong> <br> <i>4-5 characters of levels 8-9</i> <br> Designed to work with Rise of the Drow, this adventure takes place in the Underworld.<br> The Academy of Shadow, based in the drow capital of Holoth, is a renowned school of wizardry for drow of all genders.<br> Its students do not stay confined to its halls, however; on occasion, its students journey under a watchful guardian to an outpost known as the Penumbra Enclave. Here, they learn powerful magic from an unlikely source that forged an alliance with the Academy decades ago: a coven of Upperworlder hags that elected to, as they say, 'put up with the sniveling brats' in exchange for learning magic only the drow can teach.<br> The heroes just may stumble upon this educational field trip and end up gathering information on the school and Holoth, or simply take what rare drow-made magic items they can find.<br> <strong>MINI-DUNGEON #192: RePaiR'D a MaGe</strong> <br> <i>4-5 characters of levels 5-6</i> <br> When young, Twiskaz loved marionettes, turning childhood curiosity into adult obsession. But her tutelage into constructs swung wildly between assembly and dismantlement, evoking chronic indecision about her future.<br> Mainomai, an automata devil, sensing a soul for its factory, revealed myriad ways to &quot;make or break anything&quot; to Twiskaz. But this duplicitous gift drove her beyond working with inanimate objects; now she lures living creatures to her workshop. With humanoids her next targets, she sends her mechanical familiar to ask the heroes to help remove &quot;fiendish automata&quot; damaging her workshop.<br> <strong>MINI-DUNGEON #193: Maiden's Inn Massacre</strong> <br> <i>5 characters of level 8</i> <br> When wizards go to war, it is the common folk who suffer most. But when an aging assassin-turned-innkeeper is also caught in the crossfire, heroes are needed to prevent an all-out massacre. Can the characters negotiate a truce among the opposing factions, or will the stand-off at the Maiden's Inn end in tragedy?<br> Indrazma the Unforgiving is the city's foremost collector of arcane tomes.<br> The moniker &quot;Unforgiving&quot;? Turns out it's well-deserved, as Daharo the greedy, former apprentice is about to find out.<br> Add a retired assassin, copious amounts of explosive alchemical supplies and a party of adventurers.<br> What could go wrong in this highly volatile situation?<br> <strong>MINI-DUNGEON #194: Rime Cairn's Return</strong> <br> <i>4-6 Character Levels 1-2</i> <br> Far to the south in the lands of encroaching ice, favorite stories involve the Rime Cairn, each as varied as the teller. Most claim it is an ancient warlord's tomb, haunted and cursed, that phases in and out of existence.<br> Over the years it has eluded many a treasure hunter, but now it was finally found:<br> Not in some undiscovered valley or rift, but an area well-known by the locals. It melted into existence--a cairn surrounded by an icy lake, heated volcanic springs. The mist smells of sulfur and shifts in the air, morphing into foul apparitions.<br> A brutal place, the early grave for many a foolhardy soul, the legendary cairn holds the secret of an ancient tragedy, a love that transcended death, but only the most stalwart and skilled adventurers will live to tell the tale of the Rime Cairn's Return.<br> <strong>MINI-DUNGEON #195: Chaos at the Gates</strong> <br> <i>5 characters of level 1</i> <br> A gong resounds, an endless array of torchlights emerges from the woods. The beastfolk are here!<br> Ironcourt is under attack!<br> A horde of beast-headed savages has broken through the northern gates and now lays waste to the city. The king's guard struggles to repel the invaders, but in doing so they have left Ironcourt's southern approach undefended, as the calls echo through the night:<br> Chaos at the Gates!<br> The heroes must hold the southern gates until reinforcements arrive. Should the party fail, the beast-folk's unexpected assault may claim even more lives. Can they hold the line?<br>   <i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by:</i> <strong>Ryan Yingling</strong>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1999330/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1658842184","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1999330/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1658842184","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1999330/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1658842184","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1999330/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1658842184","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mini-Dungeons Bundle #191-195</h2> Mini-Dungeons are short, setting-agnostic adventures for 5th Edition which can be easily inserted anywhere in your campaign.<br> This bundle contains five such adventures for use with Fantasy Grounds Classic or Fantasy Grounds Unity (line of sight included).<br> <strong>MINI-DUNGEON #191: Penumbra Enclave</strong> <br> <i>4-5 characters of levels 8-9</i> <br> Designed to work with Rise of the Drow, this adventure takes place in the Underworld.<br> The Academy of Shadow, based in the drow capital of Holoth, is a renowned school of wizardry for drow of all genders.<br> Its students do not stay confined to its halls, however; on occasion, its students journey under a watchful guardian to an outpost known as the Penumbra Enclave.
