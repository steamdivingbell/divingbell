So far, it\u2019s a bigger sequel that improves on the original in every way. New environments only pull players deeper into Schell Games\u2019 special universe. There\u2019s no better way to feel like a spy than outsmarting Zoraxis at every turn.\u201d<br>CG Magazine<br><br>\u201cI'm here to tell you this: If you loved the original, you're absolutely going to love what the developers brought this time around. It's funnier, wittier, and spy-ier than the original, oftentimes feeling like it was cut from the same cloth as classic 70s Bond films in many ways \u2014 sans the fairly inappropriate female antagonist names, of course.\u201d<br>Android Central<br><br>\u201cThe best thing I can say about my first few hours with I Expect You To Die 2 is that it's just more I Expect You To Die. Schell Games\u2019 classic secret agent VR puzzler still holds up, and while the sequel has its fair share of fresh ideas, the fact that relatively little has changed between them is a testament to the quality of the series\u2019 design and execution.\u201d<br>TheGamer<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1499120/ss_05ae3918630b23c660cf6ed11c6aae41ec56b9e6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725372961","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1499120/ss_05ae3918630b23c660cf6ed11c6aae41ec56b9e6.600x338.jpg?t=1725372961"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1499120/ss_6087c9b662ac3150e0afe355099286df062e051a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725372961","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1499120/ss_6087c9b662ac3150e0afe355099286df062e051a.600x338.jpg?t=1725372961"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1499120/ss_b6efa9eab27df316e13db027a18eaeaa21b5c202.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725372961","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1499120/ss_b6efa9eab27df316e13db027a18eaeaa21b5c202.600x338.jpg?t=1725372961"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1499120/ss_d9b64eb428477c635bb9b290bb9ccb38505a8637.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725372961","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1499120/ss_d9b64eb428477c635bb9b290bb9ccb38505a8637.600x338.jpg?t=1725372961"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1499120/ss_f48623862b3c61e12e48324c1d0f171db28cf66a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725372961","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1499120/ss_f48623862b3c61e12e48324c1d0f171db28cf66a.600x338.jpg?t=1725372961"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1499120/ss_ec2b01ffee6e4b080a9083be10755f991b3160f0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725372961","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1499120/ss_ec2b01ffee6e4b080a9083be10755f991b3160f0.600x338.jpg?t=1725372961"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1499120/ss_a18dba4631440f458f3207bc9754c5c5dd50459c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725372961","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1499120/ss_a18dba4631440f458f3207bc9754c5c5dd50459c.600x338.jpg?t=1725372961"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1499120/ss_d18e3fb7e2e8e68b8c1143d2ed4055557cb22e69.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725372961","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1499120/ss_d18e3fb7e2e8e68b8c1143d2ed4055557cb22e69.600x338.jpg?t=1725372961"},{"id":8,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1499120/ss_632b41cfd5087139b44564f08fe470c0d44ceb2b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725372961","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1499120/ss_632b41cfd5087139b44564f08fe470c0d44ceb2b.600x338.jpg?t=1725372961"}],"short_description":"Become an elite super spy ready for espionage, explosives, and gadgets galore.
