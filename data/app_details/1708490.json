{"about_the_game":"Step into the dynamic world of customs enforcement across three bustling locales: the Airport, the Port, and the Post Sorting Facility. As a fresh recruit under the guidance of Reggie, your seasoned mentor, you're thrust into the heart of the action.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHarness the power of shared international intelligence as you sift through the throngs of incoming travelers at the Airport. Your keen eye must spot those flagged in the daily intel report, individuals exiting through unauthorized doors, or displaying suspicious behavior. Every interaction is a puzzle to solve, with no margin for error.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the Port, the pace is relentless as trucks roll in one after another. Armed with state-of-the-art X-ray technology, you'll scrutinize every detail of the cargo manifests against the contents revealed by the scans. Prepare to uncover surprises hidden within seemingly innocuous shipments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMeanwhile, a surge in incoming packages keeps the Post Sorting Facility bustling. With sniffer dogs by your side, you'll delve into parcels flagged as suspicious, those originating from outside the EU, or with questionable declared values.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFear not the challenges ahead, for Reggie and a network of European intelligence are there to support you every step of the way. Embrace the excitement of the hunt and the satisfaction of safeguarding your nation's borders.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Completed Day 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1708490/8a326be2d9435f40873793c68e717c0986a9bee9.jpg"},{"name":"Fun At The Airport","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1708490/74334e887cf3909d9ddc5fabe16c5c26ade71623.jpg"},{"name":"Giving Credit Where Credit Is Due","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1708490/21f21054d8f4dbea759e11e7821a9346dcd4640b.jpg"},{"name":"Completed Day 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1708490/177eeebe01143b50ba0d84f0b0c837904ca62608.jpg"},{"name":"Completed Day 3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1708490/c77fa462f65175c2382758d8ab4ad83559ac1728.jpg"},{"name":"Completed Day 4","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1708490/6e02b9f6edd423ac1ba571921ddb31aec69d32b9.jpg"},{"name":"Completed Day 5","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1708490/2e54b0026a2aae00346ee2a58ee523178a98ef59.jpg"},{"name":"Completed Day 6","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1708490/567797e02fa8bef16b845d1c289bb827d9b37734.jpg"},{"name":"Completed Day 7","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1708490/5b4bc1dd8ded937ffa497a6f64714647d08157bf.jpg"},{"name":"Completed Day 8","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1708490/e5c4c4ef9079d6973ec9851e4df567048bb873c5.jpg"}],"total":37},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1708490/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734681429","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1708490/page.bg.jpg?t=1734681429","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1708490/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734681429","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1708490/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734681429","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Step into the dynamic world of customs enforcement across three bustling locales: the Airport, the Port, and the Post Sorting Facility.
