{"about_the_game":"I HATE (other) Animals! is a reverse bullet hell game with roguelite elements with focus on exciting loot in a survivors-like setting where the fun comes from finding the best synergy between character, weapon, and talent trees!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay through campaign to unlock talent trees, new characters and gain new items. Defeating campaign for the first time unlocks difficulty multiplier which can be used to make game harder, and increase your loot luck! Sell items to buy permanent character upgrades to make the next run a bit easier. Going through campaign will unlock maps for the unforgiving farm mode: pick a map and and farm 30 minutes for loot!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame features 27 characters, 12 talent trees, 18 weapon types, 19 armor types, and 21 different artifacts, and millions of variants of them to make getting new loot always exciting!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow far can you get? Or can you break the game completely?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame offers full controller support, but for the best experience using the menus mouse &amp; keyboard is recommended.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTips to get started:<br />\r\nDon't get disheartened if the game feels too difficult/slow at first. Getting your first item can change that drastically depending on your luck.<br />\r\nBigger enemies can drop loot.<br />\r\nLoot and HP items can be collected by shooting at them, and they won't disappear until collected.<br />\r\nLegendary items can have hidden abilities (such as freeze and knockback), and every legendary elemental weapon will do their elemental damage to nearby enemies.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2435710/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1689662710","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2435710/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1689662710","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2435710/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1689662710","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2435710/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1689662710","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":2449200,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"I HATE (other) Animals! is a reverse bullet hell game with roguelite elements with focus on exciting loot in a survivors-like setting where the fun comes from finding the best synergy between character, weapon, and talent trees!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay through campaign to unlock talent trees, new characters and gain new items.
