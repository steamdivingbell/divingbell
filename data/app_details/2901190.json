{"about_the_game":"**Every Design or Picture of this Page is subject to change because the Game is still in Early Developement**<br><br>You are an Operator. As part of the House-Safety Incorporated, you were moved to one of their Facilities deep down in the Ground. The Only Thing they want you to do is look at the Monitors and don't make any Problems. They call you the Observer for a Good Reason. You Observe a Home of People who were evacuated a long time ago. Your Instructor says that you need to find anomalies and Report them. But in addition, you are an Operator. So you need to assign certain Special Task Forces to the Anomalys which then will be removed. But the Anomalies get stronger every Shift. And your Days just go by and by.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Info</h2>This Game is inspired and built on the Base of Observation Duty but tries to make its Universe out of this concept. An Instructor tells you the Way this will work. Then your First Shift starts. Every Morning after your Shift ends at around 6-8 AM you must do your last Maintenance Work before going home for the Rest of the Day. But you slowly start to realize that the Anomalies you are watching aren't dangerous for you behind the Monitor.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Camera System</h2>This Game has 5 different Night Shifts where the Cameras are your best Friend. Use the Cameras to look into each Room and find anomalies. Maybe it's the Chair that moved? Or wait... was the Picture always like that? Or maybe something you only can hear? WHO KNOWS? find it out!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Report and Taskforce Menu</h2>If you found an Anomaly you need to Report it. If there is an Anomaly you will be able to Assign a Taskforce to it. That will be the Thing you'll be doing the most in the Game. There are (4-12) Anomaly Types Scattered around (4-12) Rooms. The Rooms get harder each night and will face you with a different Challenge. Hopefully, you are ready.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Shift End</h2>Of course, you also have a Normal Life in the City. Since Humans died in most countries because of the anomalies it's even more important that you do your job right. The Whole City counts on you. Sometimes you may need to get something to eat or otherwise do something in the Morning, before you need to return to your Work.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Anomalies</h2>From Light to real Shapeshifter Anomalies almost everything will be there waiting for you. Fight for your Job and the Life of Innocent Civilians who are counting on you.<br><br>So. Operator. What are you Waiting for? Hop in and help Humanity survive one of the most critical Situations you were ever found in. And. DONT. GIVE.
