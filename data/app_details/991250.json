Even though I would have loved to work with a team, I want to make the first game in the franchise all by myself to test myself. If people likes this game and supports me financially, I would love to expand the franchise with a sequel and a team of professionals!<br><br>You can add the game to your wishlist if you want to support me, and by doing so, you can get notified about the early access discounted sale! I don't plan on making huge discounts to the game in it's first years, and early access sale will be the cheapest you can get it to show my appreciation for the early supporters!<br><br>For those that want to see more, I'm documenting the evolution of characters in the game on my ArtStation account.

There are a lot of visible and realistic blood in the game, blood pools on the ground, blood decals on the walls, drinking blood from a wine cup etc. Some audiences might find this as violent or gore content.\r\n\r\nBurning: You play as a demon that burns enemies to death. There are realistic fire effects, sound effects and death animations. It might disturb some audiences as you can also burn real humanoid characters.\r\n\r\nDecapitation & Amputation: You play as a beast that can rip her enemies apart with her bare hands, maim them with her claws, or even cleave body parts off with a great sword. Some audiences might find this as violent or gore content.\r\n\r\nMature Dialogues: There are some dialogues containing suggestive sexual innuendos, explicit sexual themes, excessive swearing, insults etc. Our story writing is not censored in any form or shape, so it can be considered as offensive by some audiences.\r\n\r\nNudity: There is an actual strip club in the game. Some characters wear very revealing clothes. Some scenes contain topless characters; however there is no genitalia or visible sex scenes in the game. There are pole dancing and lap dancing scenes.
