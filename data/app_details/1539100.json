{"about_the_game":"Noah has been commanded by God to put two of each animal aboard his ark to save them from the flood. However unhappy people from around the world have captured different animal species, preventing Noah from doing his job. Noah will need to visit these different locations and free the animals from the people holding them captive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNoah's Ark is a side scrolling action game. The player, as Noah, must choose which level from several world locations to play. Once in a level, Noah can move left right, duck, jump and fire pellets directly in front of him. These pellets can be used to defeat enemy creatures and uncover hidden items. At the end of each level, Noah will encounter a stronger enemy creature who must be defeated. Noah's ultimate goal is to rescue the designated captive animals listed for each level.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1539100/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1643921433","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1539100/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1643921433","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1539100/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1643921433","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1539100/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1643921433","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Noah has been commanded by God to put two of each animal aboard his ark to save them from the flood.
