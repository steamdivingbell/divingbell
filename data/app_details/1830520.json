After the cards are flipped over, you can give your unit action points to control the unit's movement and attack. This design also allows the hand to be completely free of wasted card hands, while the pieces do not have a limit of 1 action per turn, taking care of both the card and wargame systems at the same time.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1830520/extras/1\u6b63\u9762\u51fa\u724c.gif?t=1674108292\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1830520/extras/2\u7ffb\u9762.gif?t=1674108292\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1830520/extras/4.png?t=1674108292\" /><br>While traditional card games have cards that all require <strong>[cost]</strong> to be played, White Night Starry Souls uses a different <strong>bandwidth draw</strong> mechanic. At the start of the round, you are required to manually draw cards, which are divided into four colors - white, blue, purple, and gold - that cost between 1 and 4 bandwidth points, respectively, and the bandwidth will automatically fill up at the start of each round. This design changes the excessive randomness of the <strong>cost limit</strong> + <strong>auto-draw</strong> mechanic, giving players more control over their hand and allowing for more flexible and strategic grouping.<br><br>For example: you can always keep only 1 purple card in your entire deck, so that at the beginning of the turn, there is always only 1 card in the purple deck, and you can draw that card at any time you want, and draw it every turn as you wish. Of course this also requires you to pay more bandwidth and you will get less cards in your hand. Thus, by controlling a deck of 4 colors, you can adjust the randomness of DBG to a certain extent, ensuring that the DBG experience is integrated with a highly strategic wargaming system.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1830520/extras/3\u5e26\u5bbd.gif?t=1674108292\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1830520/extras/6.png?t=1674108292\" /><br>The game is in the form of Meat Pigeon + DBG, which traditional Roguelike card players should be comfortable with. You will start with a weaker initial deck, and as the game progresses, gradually acquire powerful cards and adjust the deck to increase your combat power and validate it in the next levels.<br>In the process of exploring each level, you will gradually obtain a variety of special technology, some will strengthen a particular card, and some is to bring some kind of global increase, so through the collection of technology is also one of the ways to become stronger.<br>Of course, in addition to cards and technology, there are also a wide variety of random events, enemies, boss battles, facilities, weapons, miracles, plug-ins and more, making each game a different experience.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1830520/extras/4DBG.gif?t=1674108292\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1830520/extras/8.png?t=1674108292\" /><br>The first thing you need to do at the start of each round is to create a character.
