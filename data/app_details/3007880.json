{"about_the_game":"Legend has it that an ancient scroll discovered in the ruins of the Library of Alexandria reveals that when Daedalus escaped from the Labyrinth of the Minotaur, he hid his flying machine in a temple dedicated to the god Apollo, built over the caverns of the powerful witch Sibyl.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGuarded by the arcane power of magic and the mechanical ingenuity of Daedalus, the winged artifact has remained hidden in the temple, until now...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNineteenth day of the third month in the year of our Lord 1134.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing the scroll found in Alexandria, the treasure hunter Sir Mathew Wheel sets sail in search of the lost myth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere begins the adventure...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA 3D medieval adventure where the main character is a knight known as Sir Quest, famed for his treasure hunting. The game takes place inside a Greek temple where we must find a mythological artifact against the clock by solving puzzles while facing various enemies from Greek mythology.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSword fighting with a mouse movement system, randomly generated puzzles, an upgrade shop, a mini-game to save progress, and a very original story.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe flying artifact is protected by a door with a hydraulic mechanism of chromatic density combination devised by Archimedes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe objective is to pour the liquid corresponding to the chromatic density of the locks into the fountain and obtain the artifact before the time of the destiny hourglass runs out. Archimedes' hydraulic screw will transport the liquid from the fountain to the opening mechanism.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo obtain the chromatic liquids from the lion fountains, you must solve the temple puzzles while battling the temple's protectors.
