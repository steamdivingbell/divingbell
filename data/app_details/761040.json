{"about_the_game":"Wolf Gang is a tactical turn based game where you play as a band of wolves as they make their way around the mountain, pursuing their territorial aspirations while fighting other animals. The combat revolves around a unique rule set that puts the tides of advantage constantly in flux. Knock outs are only temporary, and the traditional rock-paper-scissors strength and weakness hierarchy is subverted with a system of constantly rotating attunements.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Accessible pick-up-and-play puzzle game-play<br>    </li><li>Story driven single player campaign<br>    </li><li>Additional challenges for completionists<br>    </li><li>Tons of unlockables and character customization</li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Journey of the Sheep","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/761040/fc684fd107c88716f4e3afc866a1ca122affbdb3.jpg"},{"name":"Sheep in Wolf's Clothing","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/761040/88cbabb9d7f08f54a974c43ef8133ce6725e24b0.jpg"},{"name":"Level Mastery 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/761040/5c026b4874a371d9f9875768c1c57cf1400b2df8.jpg"},{"name":"Level Mastery 3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/761040/a0239ab54bf70864f10e0e14c568634c168d0570.jpg"},{"name":"Level Mastery 10","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/761040/ff1b752e2b5ed5617f5810bbdd66770eaaa5bbb4.jpg"},{"name":"Coin Collector 3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/761040/ababb47b1a55a645092928791a8592a6d7450aca.jpg"}],"total":6},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/761040/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1634416346","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/761040/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1634416346","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/761040/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1634416346","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/761040/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1634416346","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Wolf Gang is a tactical turn based game where you play as a band of wolves as they make their way around the mountain, pursuing their territorial aspirations while fighting other animals.
