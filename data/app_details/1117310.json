{"about_the_game":"Presented by Cracking The Cryptic, YouTube's most popular Sudoku channel, here is the brand new &quot;Sandwich Sudoku&quot; game that has become an internet sensation! <br><br>In Sandwich Sudoku, the puzzle is presented with extra numbers outside the grid next to each row and column.  These numbers indicate the SUM of cells sandwiched between the 1 and the 9 in that row/column.  The logic required to solve the puzzles will appeal to anyone who enjoys normal sudoku and a bit of basic maths.  Each puzzle here has been lovingly hand-crafted by Mark Goodliffe and Simon Anthony, the hosts of Cracking The Cryptic.  They've even included their own hints on each puzzle to help if you get stuck.  Mark and Simon have both represented the UK many times in the World Sudoku Championship.<br><br>Features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>40 hand-crafted levels<br></li><li>5 new levels every month for the first year (a total of 100 levels!)<br></li><li>Many themes to choose from<br></li><li>Hints written by Mark and Simon!</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117310/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1566230544","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117310/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1566230544","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117310/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1566230544","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117310/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1566230544","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Presented by Cracking The Cryptic, YouTube's most popular Sudoku channel, here is the brand new &quot;Sandwich Sudoku&quot; game that has become an internet sensation! <br><br>In Sandwich Sudoku, the puzzle is presented with extra numbers outside the grid next to each row and column.
