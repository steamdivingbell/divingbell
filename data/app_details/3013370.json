{"about_the_game":"In this game, you need to fight monsters in small arenas, where, having placed mercenaries, you just have to watch the battle. It sounds simple, but in reality, it matters who and where you place before the fight. Planning is the most important part of a fight. You have to fight against various opponents who are capable of attacking both close and from far away. Some enemies explode when they get close to your soldiers, some can heal, and some create new enemies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Dynamic gameplay<br />\r\n-Crowds of enemies<br />\r\n-Interesting gameplay","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Level 5","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3013370/c22a185697628a807a3bbf5e759f4adf287691fb.jpg"},{"name":"Level 15","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3013370/546927a09b04bc615ce10e7de2d5fc871c57d0b0.jpg"},{"name":"Level 25","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3013370/ccda8ba47ed099a148c1069dd08803994165a7df.jpg"},{"name":"Level 35","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3013370/fb11b5cf480f03c6a973e5ade7b1feea8c6be024.jpg"},{"name":"Level 50","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3013370/7870fe6251d61c7c8885744d8f5cdc0b1be1177e.jpg"}],"total":5},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3013370/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734769379","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3013370/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1734769379","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3013370/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734769379","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3013370/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734769379","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In this game, you need to fight monsters in small arenas, where, having placed mercenaries, you just have to watch the battle.
