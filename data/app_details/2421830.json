{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>A driving game that gives the player a manual transmission car to drive with. After each playsession, you'll understand more of the car and how it handles. Also you'll get more familiar with the roads, which helps you to take better lines. As you get these skills under control, it's time to push and reach the finish as fast as possible.<br><br>Whether you are a fan of rally stages or race tracks, we got you covered. Scenery changes keep the game fresh, from twisty country road down at ground level to looping road high in the valley.<br><br>The game includes a long rally stage and 4 race tracks. Rally stage is playable in Stage Rally and race tracks in Time Trial. Race tracks are located in 2 different places with 4 different routes in total. In Stage Rally mode, the player will drive through the valley collecting time bonuses along the way, which helps you get further in the valley, perhaps all the way to the finish. The game ends if time runs out. In Time Trial mode, player is given 3 laps to drive through the track. The car has manual transmission. Using 2nd and 3rd gear is the most efficient way of driving this car.
