{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Demo Overview</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Welcome to our first game\u2014a wild ride fueled by passion, perseverance, and a year of hard work. Two noobs, one game engine, and zero sleep later, we\u2019ve brought to life a vibrant 2D/2.5D platformer that\u2019s all about fast-paced parkour, sneaky puzzles, and a whole lot of chaos. You\u2019ll dash, slide, wall jump, change sizes, ragdoll into a bouncy ball, and even throw pipes like it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business. This demo isn\u2019t just a game; it\u2019s a snapshot of our journey from clueless beginners to slightly less clueless developers. Get ready for a taste of what\u2019s to come as we keep pushing boundaries, breaking stuff, and having a blast along the way. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Key Features</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- Fast-Paced Action: Dash, slide, jump, and even bounce your way through levels at breakneck speeds. Expect chaos, but the fun kind. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- Parkour Mechanics: Master wall-jumping, rooftop sprinting, and precision leaps. Because walking is overrated. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- Size-Changing &amp; Ragdolling: Shrink, grow, and turn into a bouncy ball for some seriously fun physics shagabalongies. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- 2D/2.5D Platforming: Enjoy buttery-smooth animation in a world that\u2019s part flat, part fancy. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- Light Puzzle Elements: Flex those brain muscles with puzzles that require both speed and strategy. Who said parkour wasn\u2019t cerebral? </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- Dynamic Gameplay: Whether you\u2019re a speedrunner or a \u201clet\u2019s take it slow\u201d ahh type, the game adapts to your vibe. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- Skill-Based Progression: The better you play, the cooler you\u2019ll feel. Nail the mechanics, and watch your score soar. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- Adrenaline-Pumping Obstacles: Traps, hazards, and other nasties await. But hey, what\u2019s life without a little danger? </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- Exploration and Discovery: Go off the beaten path, find hidden spots, and unlock new adventures as you go. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- Fun for All Ages: Simple controls (Maybe), endless fun (of course). Whether you\u2019re 5 or 50, this game\u2019s got you covered. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Our Journey and Vision</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This demo is our baby\u2014created by two devs who had no clue what they were doing a year ago. We\u2019re stoked to share it with you, bugs and all, as we continue to level up our skills. Consider this a sneak peek into our world, where we\u2019re dreaming big, aiming high, and promising you more games that are as innovative as they are fun. Your support keeps us going, and we can\u2019t wait to show you the crazy stuff we have planned next. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Thanks for being part of the madness.
