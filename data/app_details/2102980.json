{"about_the_game":"Have you ever wanted to play the villain? Ever wanted to conquer the land? Make allies ranging from Goblins, Kobolds, Dragonkin, and who knows what else.  Then this is the game for you! Play as Thrusk, an orc who has lost his tribe and seeks revenge for what the human race has done to his people in this classic RPG/Dungeons-and-Dragons-styled conquest. Obtain a Keep of your own and upgrade it. Craft Potions, Weapons, and Armor to help yourself in combat. Find companions who are interested in your cause and see where they lead you. You can be a benevolent force or a malevolent crisis in this morality system, but it doesn't change the fact: You're a warlord now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCombat: Enjoy classic turn-based combat, giving you time to strategize between each round and to help you learn from your opponent.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Linear&quot; World: Galariel is a Small Country in a larger world, with a linear storyline unlocking new areas and new allies to join you in your conquest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKarma system: Choices in this world matter. Will you intimidate a shopkeeper to give you a discount, or will you persuade him? Both choices help decide if people believe you are a benevolent or malevolent person. Some people may give you special quests or help unlock classes if you are kind to the people around you, while other may find you weak. While if you choose to act like a foul Demon people may close their doors to you, hide within buildings, and close shops, as they fear you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLoyalty System: Some companions may show loyalty to you by actions you take. Rob a church and your Cleric may think foul of you but a Barbarian may see this as a sign of strength. Run from battles a battle-hungry companion may see you as a coward, while if you fight everything in sight they gain trust in you.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2102980/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1703726666","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2102980/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1703726666","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2102980/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1703726666","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2102980/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1703726666","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Strong Language\r\nDrug use\r\nTorture\r\nSlavery\r\nBrothel"},"demos":[{"appid":2241320,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Have you ever wanted to play the villain?
