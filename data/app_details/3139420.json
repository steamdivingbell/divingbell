A girl found her conviction, but never the chance to act on it. <br> <br>Alex and Alex meet at a low point in both their lives, in a random online encounter that neither could have ever seen coming. An in-person meeting is inevitable as their connection swiftly grows, but the girl's smiling face only intensifies the dark cloud of guilt in the trapped boy's mind. <br> <br>One keeps a dark, pressing secret, and the other is struck by tragedy. Their connection is forged stronger than steel by hardship, and they continue to grow closer with each and every day they share. <br> <br>The boy's fate now pursues the both of them, but as a familiar black cat joins them in their new life together... a spark of hope remains.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3139420/extras/characters.png?t=1738010467\" /> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3139420/extras/tombstone1.png?t=1738010467\" />A 20 year old boy raised more by the internet than his own parents, Alex still managed to grow up into a kind and empathetic young man, even if a bit socially inept.  <br> <br>He's long relied on escapism when feeling down, and is obsessed with any kind of fictional world he can get himself lost inside.
