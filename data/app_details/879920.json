This past year proved difficult to test further in public VR arcade settings, so we're lowering the price to reflect the lack of hoped for additional features. \r\n\r\nIronically perhaps, the real life virus of 2020 locked this version of Trakker into it's current game loop for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nWe hope people will enjoy this active VR arcade game and that the new price reflects the value. While we will not likely add new features to Trakker we will keep channels open to hear if there are ever any major bugs found and potentially host high-score events at some point. \r\n\r\nThis version is optimized and tested for the HTC Vive family of VR sets, and reported to work with the Valve Index. There are some known height setting issues for use with the Oculus Rift and WMR family of VR sets that have reported work-arounds by changing WMR (Windows Mixed Reality) height settings. \r\n\r\nThank you for coming on this journey with us, buckle in Trakker, it's time to go virus blasting!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Guardians of the digital realms, called TRAKKERS, navigate the maze-like node structures, defending against the insidious, viral intruders out to consume all life.\r\n\r\nImmerse yourself in this cyber landscape (with synthwave music supplied by Dashcam), defeating enemies and collecting files before escaping through the exit.\r\n\r\nIs your goal simply to escape, collect files to slow down the attack or become the ultimate hero and save the system completely?
