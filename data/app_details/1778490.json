This game has no winning or losing. You play at your own pace, gaining points for placing tiles wherever you want. You place some pumpkins here, some goats there, and haybales everywhere. This game was meant to be played on a chill, autumn Sunday morning with a coffee next to you. I hope you try it out and enjoy the game.<br><br>For those more strategically inclined, there is definitely some strategy involved with maximizing points. I've added dailies and a mutliplayer scoreboard if you want to show the rest of the community your sweet score in Hexagourds.
