By collecting resources, improving your buildings and ships, and expanding your empire to new planets, you will use your fleet of ships to try to destroy the enemy before they can destroy you. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2236170/extras/Asset_4.png?t=1737988172\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2236170/extras/Grey_Galactic_Branding_Description_Text_4_a.png?t=1737988172\" /></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Strategic Real Time Battling</strong> - Build your fleet of upgradeable ships to explore, expand, and conquer! Ranging from simple ships to attack with, scout ships to explore the galaxy, and settler ships to take new planets, you can strategically position your fleet to defend your planets, and take down your enemies! </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Heroic Capital Ships</strong> - The powerful Capital Ship is your secret weapon in battle, as a free moving ship that can hold other ships as a mobile base. With unique abilities to help in battle, the Capital Ship can be the ultimate force to turn the battle! </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Unique Consumable Artifacts</strong> - The universe is full of mystery, and powerful artifacts from both ancient civilizations and modern science will aid you in different ways. Want to quickly spawn in an extra few ships? Maybe instantly settle a new planet? With research into these powerful items, you can use them throughout the game to become an even greater captain! </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Varied and Numerous Battlefields</strong> - With a powerful map generator, Grey Galactic features both randomly generated and hand crafted systems to explore. Including planets, moons, asteroid fields, ship-destroying-voids, pirates, space stations, wormholes, and more, each battle is a unique experience! </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Scenario, Campaign, and Survival Modes</strong> - In addition to Scenario maps where you'll have to overcome a unique enemy and challenging Survival games where you try to outlast the onslaught of enemies, there will also be a 3 part, story driven campaign that explores the themes and history of this universe. Learn about the tumultuous past between the human factions of the UFMC and The Skeptics, the desperate fighters of the alien faction of The Proditum, and the mysterious and incredibly dangerous Grey.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2236170/extras/Asset_4.png?t=1737988172\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2236170/extras/Grey_Galactic_Branding_Description_Text_1.png?t=1737988172\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2236170/extras/Comp_1.gif?t=1737988172\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Claim planets and build up to 12 different structures on the planet surfaces to collect resources, build ships, and advance your research towards newer buildings and ships.
