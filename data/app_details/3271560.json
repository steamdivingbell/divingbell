{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Goon Company has you working under a Supervillain along other players to rob banks in this First Person Shooter. You'll use their Supervillain weapons and abilities to get the job done. The game allows you pick up nearly any item you can see and utilize it to your advantage. Every item has a special use, whether its practical or silly, and at the same time you can throw every item you get your hands on. Like throwing a readied weapon to a friend in need.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Waves of Robot Police will attempt to apprehend you, including crowd controllers, ranged combatants, and specialists. If the Robot Police Force can't stop you then it is up to the Superheroes. Every level will have a Superhero join the fight if you linger too long or gain too much attention. These Superheroes cannot be stopped or injured, merely slowed in their inevitable march to stop you. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each level has an objective such as breaking open the Vault. These missions offer you different ways to approach the mission and have some random starting variables to help with replayability. The levels offer clues and items that help you discover these different approaches.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Between levels is the Hub which acts like a trophy room displaying all the gold and scores you've collected over the course of your career.</p>","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3271560/54a193053b6c6328555eea3ddf87519026790d35/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733512879","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3271560/54a193053b6c6328555eea3ddf87519026790d35/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733512879","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Goon Company has you working under a Supervillain along other players to rob banks in this First Person Shooter.
