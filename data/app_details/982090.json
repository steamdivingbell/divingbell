{"about_the_game":"Noms the Fish\u2122 is a casual game. While it is also fun for adults, Noms is focused on being an appropriate game for kids of all ages. It allows for segmented periods of gameplay; making it easier for parents to control game time. It also features an in-game currency system that teaches kids how to handle money while still having fun building aquariums. Unlike many other aquarium games, Noms the Fish\u2122 does not use microtransactions. Players are able to add fish to their aquariums simply by playing through the levels. They can then sell the fish to earn money to buy decorations, themes, and new aquariums. Players avoid larger fish and eat the smaller ones to help Noms grow through a story driven level system. The game also features achievements, twenty replayable levels, and four customizable aquariums to build.<br><br><strong>FEATURES</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>20 Unique Levels<br></li><li>95 In-Game Achievements<br></li><li>4 Customizable Aquariums<br></li><li>Add &amp; Sell Fish<br></li><li>Add, Move &amp; Sell Decorations<br></li><li>20 Aquarium Themes<br></li><li>No microtransactions!<br></li><li>Appropriate for all ages!</li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Guppy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/982090/24a55ad275c1b761edc744e4bdb7654bd793f1ed.jpg"},{"name":"Barracuda","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/982090/b0be87967f958be9cfe6a845950de65973328752.jpg"},{"name":"Shark","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/982090/a64cd4a3db4c9624a4490574f118b793ce16dd79.jpg"},{"name":"Famished","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/982090/0529de84bc7217f6636036ec06583de5fe8a8f36.jpg"},{"name":"Hungry","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/982090/8e852553001f11d4e5843d74d66be27f8010dcb7.jpg"},{"name":"Predator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/982090/de7e9ce9a18ddaf919737fad5a90d63a165dc308.jpg"},{"name":"Nom Nom","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/982090/a823245326d5ee099baf0aca8a0fb146e1114fc2.jpg"},{"name":"Score 5k","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/982090/3d67134bdae6187ef23e7efb45c46e3e9bfc5217.jpg"},{"name":"Score 10k","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/982090/e4f836bc6bd40c85fabc70edcbaebf0cca28d156.jpg"},{"name":"Score 20k","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/982090/db8281a0da8cb52bd930624152213217835b008c.jpg"}],"total":15},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/982090/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1667672022","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/982090/page.bg.jpg?t=1667672022","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/982090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1667672022","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/982090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1667672022","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Noms the Fish\u2122 is a casual game.
