{"about_the_game":"With the help of Steve Bannon  and Cambridge Analytica, Trump has been groomed to appeal to a broad mass of people, at a time when the general public has lost faith in media and politics. Bannon has admitted to close associates that he modeled his campaign on the one crafted for Adolf Hitler, who was a puppet of dark forces, at the very least &quot;like&quot; those who created Trump. Through meticulous investigative journalism, John Hankey explores the reality of said claims, and how the media circus following Trump is but a strategy for dividing a \u201cUnited\u201d States.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/998680/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1553557600","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/998680/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1553557600","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/998680/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1553557600","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/998680/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1553557600","categories":[{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Native Steam Controller Support","id":33},{"description":"Captions available","id":13}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h1>Steam Video</h1><p>This content is only available in an online streaming format.
