{"about_the_game":"This is the Skirmish Pack for Dwarfs!? It adds in the following 3 extra modes for you to play:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Sandbox</strong> - here is your chance to create your own caves and populate them with whatever bad guys you feel like!<br></li><li><strong>Rush Mode</strong> - digger dwarfs will continuously spawn, without pause. And you can only let 200 of them die - just how long can you last in this mode&gt; And how big will your score get!?<br></li><li><strong>Dark Mode</strong> - if the standard Arcade mode is not enough of a challenge for you (or you just want life for your Dwarfs to be a little bit more scary) then play this mode. In this mode, the unexplored sections of the map are ALL dark - nothing is marked for you. Send your dwarfs forth to explore and collect gold and loot. Or die. Or both, of course!</li></ul>And remember - the core game is always FREE! You buy the add-on packs once and can play them with no restrictions, for ever after!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/213661/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1447355952","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/213661/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1447355952","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/213661/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1447355952","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/213661/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1447355952","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This is the Skirmish Pack for Dwarfs!?
