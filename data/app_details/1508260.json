TH is long, complex and difficult. Before spending any kind of money, it's a good practice to watch Fluent's or Wizard Worm's game play videos (see below) and download the free demo (see above) to see if it has anything you may enjoy without risking anything. Thank you<br>PS: Please, read all the information on this page!</p><br><h1>WARNING: Cheat Engine</h1><p>There is this so-called Cheat Engine. Many players use it to hack into running games and change values or just speed up the game. Here's the deal: if you use the Cheat Engine, it will corrupt your entire game. Most probably the inventory items (I've seen examples), but there may be other issues as well. The more you use it, the more corruption it causes. So, don't use it! Thanks.</p><br><h1>Game Play Videos</h1><p>Fluent created a few game play videos. The first few were made before the official release. Check them out here:<br><br>Some issues seen in the videos are gone.<br><br>Wizard Worm has also added his own vids:<br><br><br>Thank you, guys!<br><br>The comments have valuable information!</p><br><h1>DirectX 12 &amp; GFX cards</h1><p><strong>New Info: </strong> The information below seems to be a thing of the past. I have been working on the enhanced version of the game for more than half a year, and experience shows that the new editor has eliminated the previous graphical problems. This version is not yet finished, but it is relatively close.<br><strong>Old info: </strong> Tthe game runs fine with DirectX 12 on most of the Nvidia cards, although &quot;Nvidia RTX 2080 Super&quot; produces crashes. Also, we noticed that some Radeon cards may have problems to render lights. Whichever is the case, please make sure you try the demo first. (Which is a good practice regardless of the problem.) We're investigating this issue and trying to find a way to force the cards to use DX11. Thank you.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong>Tortured Hearts - Or How I Saved The Universe.
