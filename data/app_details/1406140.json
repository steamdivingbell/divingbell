{"about_the_game":"Wiggly boy is an interactive way to test the power of your gaming computer. Phase one: spawn boys at your leisure until your frame rate has had enough, the more boys you can handle the better your setup is. Phase two: the boys are mad and they're going to get you, banana them until you're overcome. It's a simple concept, but the higher the score the more alpha gamer you are.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1406140?t=1600885334","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1406140/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1600885334","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1406140/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1600885334","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1406140/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1600885334","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Wiggly boy is an interactive way to test the power of your gaming computer.
