{"about_the_game":"Vacation Season expands on the strengths of <strong>Highrise City</strong> and adds a new group of citizens to the mix. A group which needs to be satisfied as well: Demanding tourists. Get them into your towns to cash out but keep in mind that they have different requirements and needs as they are obviously on vacation and want to experience an adventure!<br><br>Build hotels and resorts of different quality levels to make sure you've got something for everyone available. Connect them to your complex sightseeing tours which hopefully will also include the various tourist spots and attractions of your city. And make sure that the tourists spend a lot of money in your city. May it be in Japanese restaurants or through buying products exclusively produced for them.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3079070/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734452827","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3079070/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1734452827","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3079070/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734452827","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3079070/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734452827","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Vacation Season expands on the strengths of <strong>Highrise City</strong> and adds a new group of citizens to the mix.
