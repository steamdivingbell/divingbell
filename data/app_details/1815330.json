{"about_the_game":"<u>Swelter</u> is a story-driven modification for Half-Life 2, with events taking place a few years before Gordon Freeman's arrival in City-17.

A series of armed riots in City 545 has spurred scattered resistance groups to unite towards the common goal of liberation from the aliens.

The average playthrough will take about two hours.<br><br>The visual aesthetics aim to please with a seldom-represented Central Asian environment featuring spacious steppes, rocky deserts, and a city where oriental and socialist architecture intertwine.
