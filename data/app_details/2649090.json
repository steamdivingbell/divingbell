{"about_the_game":"SANGI is a fast paced platformer, merged with an innovative combat system. You can choose to experience a very short story, or jump into the arcade mode to get the best score that is possible. <strong>It's focus lies on it's combat systems</strong> and how every mechanic blends in with each other.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combat System</h2><br>This is the focus of the game. You have 4 different weapons, each with 3 different abilities. These abilities use their assigned color bar. Everytime you damage an enemy, there's a big chance that they will drop an orb. This orb comes in 3 colors and fills the corresponding color bar a lot and others a small amount. <strong>Here's the catch</strong>, it fills all bars and other weapons' color bars, even if its a small amount. You can activate the ability even if it has a really low ability color bar. If you activate an ability with a really low color bar, it results with it being less effective. For example, a shield ability mitigates a really low percentage of incoming damage with a low bar, and a damaging ability deals less damage with a low color bar.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2649090/extras/weaponshowcase.gif?t=1699563636\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2649090/extras/resizedColorExample.png?t=1699563636\" /><br><br>In this example above, we chose to catch the particles with the first and third weapons. To do this efficiently, we chose to use the Compaction reaction, which happens when air and fire statuses cancel each other, and it spawns an orb particle that can fill the color bars. You can see how 2 and 4 weapons' color bars are similar since we didnt catch these particles with those weapons. Since every bar has some charge, you can activate every ability you have.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combat System: Abilities</h2><br>There are 12 abilities in this game. Some abilities have really unique activating conditions, and some abilities are extremely simple to use. For example, water weapon's second ability (or, it's green bar ability) activates a <strong>drawing field</strong>. You can draw a straight line to create a slash at the position. Or, you can draw a special symbol to create a water ball trap that detones after a while, dealing damage and applying water status to enemies, which you can vaporize twice with your fire weapon, because it applies 2 instances of water status! Before vaporizing your hits, you can activate the second ability of air weapon to buff your normal attacks, dealing even more damage with the vaporize reaction. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2649090/extras/vaporizeslash.gif?t=1699563636\" /><br><br>You can use the sword area ability of albeni weapon to deal albeni status extremely quickly, which enables lifesteal (Siphon reaction), black hole (Graviton reaction) and homing particles which deal damage to enemies (Vinefoam reaction). You can combine this sword area ability with fire weapon's first ability; which is a laser that constantly applies fire status to enemies to create vinefoam reactions <strong>extremely quickly to deal massive damage.</strong><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2649090/extras/vinefoamshowcase.gif?t=1699563636\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combat System: Triple Regenerative Jump, Dash and Super</h2><br>In addition to the unique abilities you get, you also have triple jump, which if you use too quickly, there will be a small cooldown before you can jump again, but if you plan your jumps, you wont hit this cooldown. This enables you to fight against airborne enemies efficiently. In addition to this, you have your dash, which can help you evade attacks, and it can also reset the jump, enabling you to <strong>infinitely stay airborne.</strong><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2649090/extras/triplejumps.gif?t=1699563636\" /><br><br>And lastly, your super! During its duration, your outgoing damage gets doubled. This ability also has unique visuals. It runs a style transfer AI model in the background to stylize your screen in the style of famous painting, &quot;Kanagawa-oki Nami Ura&quot; by Hokusai, 1837. This is computationally taxing, but you can turn this setting off in the settings menu.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2649090/extras/styletransferexample.gif?t=1699563636\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2649090/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1699563636","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2649090/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1699563636","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2649090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1699563636","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2649090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1699563636","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"SANGI is a fast paced platformer, merged with an innovative combat system.
