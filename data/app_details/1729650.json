{"about_the_game":"Have you ever wondered what life is like in a two-dimensional world? Take out a pen and draw a square, then draw a little person inside and another one outside the square. There you go! The two little people cannot see each other because they are separated by the frame, but we, three-dimensional beings, can see both of them clearly. In this game, your task is to move a two-dimensional circular shadow to guide a three-dimensional sphere to its destination! This seemingly simple task is full of challenges: while the ball can move freely in three-dimensional space, its shadow is subject to various constraints on three two-dimensional planes. You may need to switch between different projection planes from time to time to break through walls and spikes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnprecedented game experience: a decryption game combined with platform jumping does not seem to cause any uproar, but the idea of using the relationship of spatial projection to instantly cross the mechanism is rarely seen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nColorful scene elements: lasers, spikes, portal and &quot;entities&quot; that we may need to spend a lot of time introducing are all part of your performance. Making good use of the tab key may prevent your shadow from faltering.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEclectic map editor: use your excellent talent and unique insight into various obstacles to create your own script. You can also share these levels with us. Let's see what you can do!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1729650/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1690013891","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1729650/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1690013891","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1729650/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1690013891","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1729650/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1690013891","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Have you ever wondered what life is like in a two-dimensional world?
