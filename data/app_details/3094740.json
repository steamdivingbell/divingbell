The pantheon of the most famous and charming superheroes are dead or AWOL. Who's left? Well, uh\u2026 <i><strong>you guys are.</strong></i> Pick a 'hero' and fight to save Mayor McTrinkle and the, like, two untouched buildings left in the city. You know the drill: step up to the plate for once in your life, pick a sidekick, improve your super-hero game, and survive at least until one of the other Second Rates wakes up at noon and takes over your shift. Keep it up and maybe you'll get your own comic one day... if there was anyone left to write it. With intricate, interwoven and deep gameplay, crazy weapon combos, 20 heroes, 4 sidekicks, 4 levels, 3 difficulties, more than 400 upgrade cards, 82 permanent upgrades, and sweet, sweet hand drawn art \u2013 you\u2019ll die over and over from anything but boredom.
