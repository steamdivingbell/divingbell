{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/493520/extras/01_steam.gif?t=1728027032\" /> <br><br>Your team of prisoners is dropped into the Rundown when a new Work Order is issued by The Warden, the mysterious entity holding you captive. The Rundown is a series of expeditions, each one taking you deeper into a decayed research facility called The Complex. You descend level by level, scavenging tools and resources that help you survive in a perilous network of tunnels where gruesome creatures lurk in every shadow. Complete all the expeditions to fulfill the Work Order and clear the Rundown.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/493520/extras/00_WARNING.png?t=1728027032\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/493520/extras/01_COOP.png?t=1728027032\" /> <br>GTFO is designed for prisoner teams of four, putting cooperation at the core of the experience. Bots can fill your lineup if you\u2019re short one or two players. They\u2019ll follow you through expeditions, sneak when you sneak, collect resources, and fight alongside you. They\u2019re a good fallback, but the level of communication and tactical combat in GTFO means it\u2019s best to play with people.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/493520/extras/02_PREPARE.png?t=1728027032\" /><br>A strategy is necessary to clear the Rundown. Before you drop into The Complex, your team needs to decide what gear, boosters, and weapons to bring. You must also balance the team, identifying the function of each prisoner so that you know what to do when things go wrong. And they will. They always do.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/493520/extras/03_SLEEPER.png?t=1728027032\" /><br>Stealth and coordination are necessary to survive as you maneuver through The Complex. Many of the creatures of GTFO are suspended in a state of hibernation, so light, noise, and vibrations can easily wake up these Sleepers. And if one of them knows you\u2019re there, they all know. That\u2019s when things get messy.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/493520/extras/04_FIGHT.png?t=1728027032\" /><br>You\u2019ll need heavy weaponry and a clear mind when the shit hits the fan. Check your line of fire, force them through bottlenecks, set up your kill zones and reload every chance you get. These creatures stop at nothing, and neither should you. Once the mayhem starts, you have no choice but to put every last one of them down.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/493520/extras/02_steam.gif?t=1728027032\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/493520/extras/05_SCARS.png?t=1728027032\" /><br>Clearing expeditions and Rundowns will reward you with new cosmetic gear. Wear it with pride, as it proves to your peers you\u2019ve been to hell and back. The Sleepers, on the other hand, will not care for a second.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/493520/extras/06_CONNECT.png?t=1728027032\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Bare Minimum","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/493520/327c1c751129f45cb37058cf0bebeb88e7b7f1ca.jpg"},{"name":"Indirect Course","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/493520/5175482c9c36f725ed4cde7677cf0856bd7ded96.jpg"},{"name":"Beyond Range","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/493520/8edcaa756b1d901451ee98899c17774ae109c714.jpg"},{"name":"Deviation","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/493520/afc57c27a9c30971e4e3a9a2e2b623ed9556e3d2.jpg"},{"name":"Infection","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/493520/f44052f61b4d607c83b9e9867854ec4cfe53035f.jpg"},{"name":"The Vessel","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/493520/4a5f894f7e12fe10cdb2060222e334380bca9478.jpg"},{"name":"Contact","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/493520/10d7a04374a6b2718c2cd0a37d17b7cfc75ed763.jpg"},{"name":"Rebirth","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/493520/ad5f178b0ce85bde8766fa10f9127d5fbde26fa6.jpg"},{"name":"Destination","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/493520/0071e8779d71acd1e3ac047779bbee0695fa68c1.jpg"},{"name":"Rise","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/493520/4b83dfc34d4ca512f8c3e3f063622f44d492bbdf.jpg"}],"total":57},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/493520/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728027032","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/493520/page.bg.jpg?t=1728027032","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/493520/a90c1895f07c2ea0075f3295540701a17981a83a/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728027032","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/493520/a90c1895f07c2ea0075f3295540701a17981a83a/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728027032","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Contains violent and gory content that is not appropriate for all audiences."},"detailed_description":"<h1>FINAL EDITION</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/493520/extras/GTFO_2312_R8_Rundown-overview_616x2259.png?t=1728027032\" /><br><br><strong>Rundown 8.0 \u2013 Duality</strong> brings the story of the prisoners in the Complex to its riveting culmination.
