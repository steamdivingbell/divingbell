{"about_the_game":"Operation Outsmart is a physics-based sandbox adventure game set in a snowy open-world filled with koalas. The game has a main story line in which you need to help the koalas with their environmental issues. In order to do so, you need to use the build stations to construct machines from smaller engineering parts. You can use different materials for the building parts that affect their physical properties such as weight and strength. You can then hop on your machine and drive it to the quest areas to accomplish those missions. The koalas will reward you for your kindless, and give you further quests.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are 3 koala villages in the world, and a total of 26 koala characters that you'll be interacting with. The quests that the koalas give you progressively get more difficult so you need to constantly improve your machines or craft new ones. You can also find new metal ores which you can smelt and mix with other metal elements in any proportion, thus being able to create infinitely many new alloys.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome of the key features are:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Koalas: Interact with koalas to reveal stories, hear gossip, learn about their history, get quests from them, and recruit them to fight for you. You can place the recruitable koalas on your machine and they will fight relentlessly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-  Walking and Driving: You can either explore the world on foot, or hop on your build and drive it around. Get on and off at your convenience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Main missions: There is a main story line driven by the main missions you do. Although it is an open world, every mission unlocks new items that are necessary to tackle the next one.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Side quests: You can always go on to do smaller side quests that will reward you with useful items.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Build stations: There are several build stations in the world that you can walk up to and unleash your creative mind. Craft the most ridiculous and wacky machine you can think of. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Key bindings: Some parts are operable, which means you can assign key binds to them and operate them by pressing those keys.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Skins: Customise your machines by applying a variety of skins.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Save/load machines: Save your machines to use them at a later time, or come back to work on them as you wish.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Material Foundry: You will discover metal ores in the world that you can take to one of the koalas to smelt it for you. You can then mix the metal elements you have unlocked in custom compositions to create new alloys.  These alloys will have entirely new properties, generated by a machine learning algorithm. You can then improve the physical properties of your machine parts by applying improved materials on them.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1729010/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1676453089","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1729010/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1676453089","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1729010/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1676453089","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1729010/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1676453089","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Operation Outsmart is a physics-based sandbox adventure game set in a snowy open-world filled with koalas.
