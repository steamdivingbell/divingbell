I do not want to force multicellularity by having dedicated types of cells. Each cell can perform multiple things, can decide which organelles to grow.

At the beginning of the simulation, random species are generated and spawned in. Sadly most of the random generated DNA is garbage, and most species die out very fast. But after a while, there are some winners. First these are very simple creatures, as there are a lot of gas bubbles and dead cells floating around, and both can be broken down for energy, with the correct type of organelle. There is a chance that DNA mutates when a cell divides. If we are patient, complexity emerges. Food becomes more and more scarce. Species differentiate, as they find different niches to fill. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This simulator is my pet project, 10 years in the making! It is running entirely on the video card. You don't need a supercomputer, just a mid range card to simulate hundreds of thousands of cells. The world in the trailer is the result of running the biggest world preset on my RX 6750 XT for a week. Hopefully the advancement of video cards makes even bigger worlds a possibility!</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2102770/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729326034","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2102770/page.bg.jpg?t=1729326034","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2102770/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729326034","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2102770/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729326034","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3291610,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EvoLife - Demo</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">I am just a solo dev, I could test the simulation on an RX 6750 XT, a GT 710 and an NVS 4200M.
