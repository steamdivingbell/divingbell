While the game contains no explicit gore or blood, the use of these weapons implies a level of violence. Enemies are typically 'knocked out' rather than killed, but certain scenarios suggest implied deaths. While the game avoids graphic content, the nature of its combat and themes are suited for a mature audience."},"detailed_description":"HEARTSHOT is a high-octane VR espionage thriller where chaotic gunplay meets retro-inspired cinematic environments.
