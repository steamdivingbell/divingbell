{"about_the_game":"The Lost Cube is a challenging platformer which takes inspiration from classic titles such as Super Meat Boy and Celeste.  The story unravels in a small village nestled somewhere in northern Europe. Each day, a special melody is played upon a magical guitar bringing prosperity upon the land. <br><br>One day the magical red cube that holds its power goes missing and it is the quest of one brave adventurer to retrieve it and restore life to his village. You play as Ulrik, a somewhat ordinary hero on a mission. You have no weapons, so you must jump or dodge your way out of trouble. Your agility will be tested to the limit as you face a barrage of enemies over 60 levels and 2 boss fights all the while constantly avoiding unforgiving traps. <br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1399280/extras/TLC_Creatures_Steam.png?t=1688478815\" /><br><br><strong>Features</strong><br>The Lost cube will test your patience as you navigate 60 handcrafted levels spread through a variety of seasons.
