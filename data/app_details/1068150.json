With their past love crushed and household seemingly splitting at the seams, an exhausted wife seeks sexual validation. A faultless young woman begins her inevitable sexual awakening. Choose your role and witness two perspectives of one household falling to pieces, grasping for any possible signs of love in their descent.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE GAME</h2>Dual Family will repeatedly test you with a multitude of scenario-based choices that will influence the relationship with your friends, as well as the ending of the story arc. Do you just want a hug, something platonic? Or perhaps you desire something fiercer, more intimate; a kiss on the lips without hesitation.

Many of the earlier installments in the story are far shorter than those found later, the most recent being the longest yet. The complete story (three acts!) will be added to steam as development continues, each act being released as its own game.<br><br><br>For the sound/soundtrack, the steam build has only a handful of in-game sound effects and no music; original tracks as heard in the trailer will be included in future installments, but our priority has always been story first.<br><br><br>Enjoy! :]","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1068150/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1667635394","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1068150/page.bg.jpg?t=1667635394","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1068150/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1667635394","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1068150/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1667635394","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,3,5,4],"notes":"This game contains age-restricted content solely intended for legal adults 18 years and older.
