{"about_the_game":"Create vehicles in real-time using an intuitive node-based approach. Fine tune suspension geometry and drivetrain characteristics to create an unique driving experience. <i>Exhibition of Speed</i> is a racing game designed with modders and content creators in mind, where creating and modifying vehicles do not require messing around with extensive, complex and undocumented configuration files.<br><br>The foundation of the multi-body vehicle simulation engine is designed from the ground up to support all kinds of wheeled vehicles and drivetrain configurations. The flexibility of the simulation is explored through nodes, which are the building blocks of every vehicle. Nodes of different types can be arranged and connected together to form a graph which describes the vehicle you want. As the graph is modified it gets evaluated and the results are reflected immediately on the vehicle being built. The vehicle can be driven while it's being formed and it may be saved and shared with others.<br><br>The dynamic physical tire model ensures realistic driving behavior and detailed force feedback on the steering wheel. It is capable of producing effects such as camber thrust and relaxation length, which are usually only present in the most advanced racing simulators.<br><br>In the upcoming multiplayer mode, you'll be able to join online races against other players with your custom car and put it to the test. Other players will be able to see your creation but it's up to you to prove it's the best car in the grid!<br><br>As the game evolves, more types of suspensions, tires, engines, transmissions and all-wheel-drive systems will become available, enabling a greater variety of wheeled vehicles to be built.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2947450?t=1728316139","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2947450?t=1728316139","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2947450/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728316139","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2947450/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728316139","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Create vehicles in real-time using an intuitive node-based approach.
