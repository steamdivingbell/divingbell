{"about_the_game":"&quot; <br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> D&amp;D Classics: U2 Danger at Dunwater (1E)</h2>   <br>  The little fishing town of Saltmarsh is threatened! Why are lizard men gathering force nearby and why have they been buying large quantities of weapons? A party of bold adventurers must answer these questions or the people of Saltmarsh will never live in peace! &quot;Danger at Dunwater&quot; is the second part in a series of three modules designed and developed in the United Kingdom for beginning adventurers with the AD&amp;D rules. Its plot follows direct from that of the first part (U1: &quot;The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh&quot;). This adventure can be played by 6-10 characters of levels 1-4.
