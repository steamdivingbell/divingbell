What better way to relax than to take your beloved pet out for a fishing trip? Omoide Island has a variety of water sources that yield different fish, so feel free to explore and catch them all! Don\u2019t forget to continuously upgrade your fishing rod to tackle bigger and rarer fish.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1586340/extras/fishingGif.gif.png?t=1713806565\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1586340/extras/d27d3fade22bc7f0b0834264f5b15111_original.png?t=1713806565\" /><br><br><strong>Relationships</strong><br><br>You don\u2019t have to be isolated on your farm, feel free to speak with and befriend the townsfolk. You may have items to trade with those in town, or perhaps you just wish to visit. Every island resident has a unique personality and backstory - it\u2019s up to you to learn all about them!<br><br>By completing side quests for your neighbors, you may fetch a better buying and selling price or unlock special rewards. Friendship may even turn into romance when you least expect it.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1586340/extras/villagerGif.gif.png?t=1713806565\" /><br><br><strong>Quests</strong><br><br>The residents of Omoide Island will need help on occasion. If someone is in need, you can view their request on the bulletin board in town or you may receive a letter directly. Don\u2019t worry if you are busy with another task as side quests and missions are optional.<br><br>Currently, there are two types of quests available: the main quest linked directly to your character\u2019s storyline and optional side quests. The former will lead your character to uncover their forgotten memories and answer the question: what happened before arriving on the island? The latter quests will allow you to improve your relationships and unlock unique items that cannot otherwise be crafted. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1586340/extras/9e3756873b796f81656c2bb4c9ce19a8_original.png?t=1713806565\" /><br><br>What is life without a furry companion at your side? Pets are, and will always be, your most loyal companions. Explore Omoide Island together, give them endless pets, and play until the sun sets. Your pet, aside from keeping you company, can also assist with farming duties. <br><br><strong>Pets Currently Available:</strong><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1586340/extras/f487306f12efb827f4d25c144b6d042b_original.jpg?t=1713806565\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1586340/extras/87a7549e5e994c385f784b3ae796e63b_original__1_.jpg?t=1713806565\" /><br><br><strong>Animals</strong><br><br>In addition to planting and managing your crops, you can also raise farm animals.
