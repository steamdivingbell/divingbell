{"about_the_game":"You play as a feudal lord in 14th century Europe, entrusted with managing your land by the King. Starting with just a castle keep, you grow the economy and population of your fiefdom. At the same time, an invading army is roaming and plundering the entire kingdom. You must ensemble your army, build your defences and defend your land. As you satisfy the King's requests, your military power grows and eventually you liberate the entire kingdom.<br><br>One campaign takes place on one map with procedurally generated layout. Successful completion of a campaign can take many hours. Every playthrough unlocks special gameplay tweaks, which influence the mechanics of the next playthrough. During one campaign, short-term goals are specific requests from the King and handling of periodically occurring events.<br><br>Your society consists of 2 social classes: Peasants and Lower Nobles.
