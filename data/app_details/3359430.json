{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Prologue:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A wizard who caused a problem and was banished from the magical world must clear several trials to clear his name.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the otherworld where he was banished, the wizard must collect hats that his enemies have, collect the essences he needs, and defeat the King of the End who reigns over the land.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Game Features:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A third-person shooter game where you can enjoy thrilling battles using guidance magic in a field where meteorites are falling and tornadoes are rolling around.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can defend against enemy attacks by deploying or avoiding shields using two types of magic.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The bat transformation, like a parry, can stun enemies by transforming into a bat at the timing when an enemy attack hits you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The most distinctive feature of this game is the use of roulette. The player's attack power is determined by a three-layered roulette. The attack power multiplier varies depending on the layer.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">It also sometimes becomes the enemy's turn, and at that time the enemy's attack power is determined by the roulette.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game uses a roguelite-style reward system, and you can see each reward from &quot;RESOURCES&quot; on the title screen.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Game objectives:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">1. Collect 60 or more hats that may drop when you defeat enemies.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">2. Fill the red sphere at the base with essence that you can obtain by successfully completing quests until it is nearly full.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">3. Defeat the large King of the End that exists on the field.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>\u25a0 Explore the base.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can do several things at the base, such as accepting quests, hiring allies, and practicing combat. Let's explore on foot.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>\u25a0 Go to the field.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can go to the field at any time with a single button. There are two ways to go: after accepting a quest, and without accepting one. Going without accepting a quest is suitable for collecting hats, etc.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>\u25a0 Spin the roulette.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The player's basic attack power is determined by the roulette. The roulette has three layers, each with a different multiplier. Attack power is not displayed as it is by the number on the roulette, but is displayed as the combined attack power of all elements including the player's level and other elements. The roulette can only be spun when the yellow bar is full. Also, as you deal damage to enemies, the blue bar will increase, and when it is full, the roulette layer will change.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>\u25a0Fight the enemy.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Enemies attack using two types of magic. Guidance magic and magic that deploys a magic circle near the enemy. Enemy attacks and tornadoes can be defended with a shield. You cannot attack while using a shield. Bat transformation: If you receive an enemy attack while in bat transformation, you can stun the attacking enemy. However, bat transformation consumes some stamina. Some enemies cannot be damaged unless you deal a certain amount of damage.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>\u25a0Collect hats.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When you defeat an enemy, they sometimes drop a hat. There are 80 types of hats. You must collect at least 60 of them. When you obtain a hat, you will wear it for a certain period of time. While wearing the hat, your attack power will increase significantly. During that time, you can damage specific enemies or damage the King of the End all at once.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>\u25a0Collect flowers if you have the time.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There are flowers on the field. You can collect those flowers. The collected flowers are transferred to the base of your base. If you get a certain number of flowers transferred to the base, your physical strength limit will increase slightly. Try it if you have time.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>\u25a0Complete a quest successfully.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can accept quests at your base. There are two types of quests: defeating enemies and collecting gems. If you complete a quest successfully, you can obtain essence. Four types of quests are presented, and one of them is a secret quest. If you succeed in a secret quest, you can obtain a large amount of essence.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>\u25a0Unlock rewards.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game uses a rogue-lite style reward system. You can see the rewards from &quot;RESOURCES&quot; on the title screen. There are various tasks in the game, and by clearing them you can get various rewards that will give you an advantage in the game.
