Players can also engage in stealth combat sequences involving a close-up camera view. Weapon and explosive attacks can result in decapitation and/or dismemberment. Scenes depict intense acts of violence, including themes of suicide and torture. Cutscenes depict further instances of violence, such as a human captive bound and hung from a noose before being disemboweled and a scene where a young woman is restrained while an enemy smashes her arm with a hammer. The game contains some sexual content: a couple disrobing and briefly engaging in a sexual act; the couple is heard grunting/moaning as the screen turns black (depicted from the waist up with female toplessness). Some of the infected characters designs are depicted with exposed breasts and genitalia. A scene is shown where two characters are seen smoking a marijuana joint in a room full of marijuana plants."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h1>Pre-Purchase Offer</h1><p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Pre-purchase and receive these early in-game\u00b9: </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Ammo Capacity Upgrade </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Crafting Training Manual</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00b9 Supplements required to unlock recipes, skills, and upgrades</p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Edition includes: </p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Last of Us Part II Remastered</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ELLIE &amp; ABBY\u2019S JOURNEY NOW ON PC</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2531310/extras/T2R-PC_Announce-trlr_HQ_GIF_003.gif?t=1738173620\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Experience the winner of over 300 Game of the Year awards now with an array of technical enhancements that make The Last of Us Part II Remastered the definitive way to play Ellie and Abby\u2019s critically acclaimed story.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2531310/extras/T2R-PC_Announce-trlr_HQ_GIF_006.gif?t=1738173620\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Five years after their dangerous journey across the post-pandemic United States, Ellie and Joel have settled down in Jackson, Wyoming.
