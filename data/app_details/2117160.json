As the leader, you will set up several camps, and conquer or defend survivor territories in order to protect yourself against up to 7 greedy factions. If you manage to keep your companions alive, you can even pursue a romantic relationship. But at night, the undead will come to feast...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">IMPROVED SURVIVAL MANAGEMENT</h2>Loot various locations to find equipment and resources. You\u2019ll need these resources to build bases and craft equipment. Pay close attention to levels of food, water, stress, and morale. You can do this by building a water treatment center, a canteen, a bar, or a relaxation center. You can also keep livestock and care for them on a farm in order to get eggs or milk, and slaughtering the animals provides additional food and leather which you\u2019ll need to craft gear. Iron from mines will allow you to make even better equipment.<br><br>Sometimes survivors will want to experience a little luxury in the form of fresh meals that you can prepare using various ingredients, but none of this will be of any use if you are not carefully monitoring the amount of fuel needed to power your essential generator.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">RPG STORY WITH DECISIONS AND ROMANCE</h2><strong>Dead Age: Survivors</strong> is not just about setting up camps, stories and quests play an important role. The story takes you deep into the abyss of a human civilization left behind after the apocalypse, into a world of seedy human trafficking, extortion, and murder. The story focuses on your companions; your actions support them, and the decisions that you make may impact your camp. Will survivors die? Or can you save them? You can even become romantically involved with story survivors as time goes on.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FAST-PACED AND STRATEGIC BATTLE SYSTEM</h2>The turn-based party battle system ensures nail-biting action while allowing for strategic attacks. You\u2019ll need a small group of daring adventurers while scouring the world for resources and equipment. You can now fight with up to 10 survivors into a battle of conquest.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TRAINING SURVIVORS</h2>You can find new survivors through radio transmissions, poach them from the factions, or they will join you as a reward for completing quests. You first need to build a training center to train your survivors as workers or soldiers. You can give workers different abilities so that they can work as miners or equipment suppliers. There are different classes of soldier that survivors can specialize in. These range from martial artists to guardians with an axe and shield, and death commandos armed to the teeth.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2117160/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732286039","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2117160/page.bg.jpg?t=1732286039","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2117160/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732286039","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2117160/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732286039","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"In Dead Age: Survivors you may encounter violence against \"zombies\" and humans.
