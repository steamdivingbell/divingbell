{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CLAM MAN 2: OPEN MIC</h2>is the prologue to the upcoming Clam Man 2, a stand-up comedy RPG adventure, and the first day in a week of jokes, quests, and saying a lot of really odd things. It's a combatless, narrative RPG that takes you on an unlikely quest in a very unlikely world. Play as the titular Clam Man and uncover a secret lurking in the basement of Snacky Bay Prime Mayonnaise that will change the course of your life! Do quests, get jokes, and do stand-up!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1278360/extras/ezgif.com-resize_(3).gif?t=1737782507\" /><br><br>If any of that sounds remotely interesting, give the game a shot! <strong>It's free!

Dialogues also feature tons of static skill checks that only unlock with the right stats; if a conversation only has a couple of available response options, chances are that other outcomes and absurdities hide behind a different character build!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GATHER MATERIALS</h2>In order to do stand-up, you need jokes! In Clam Man 2, quests are character-based with choices to be made and errands to be run, and finishing a quest rewards you with material you can use in your shows! Every quest has multiple endings, and depending on your choices, the resulting joke loot will change, and it's impossible to see even half of all the jokes in a single playthrough! <i>(Completionists beware - it could take around six fully optimized runs to see everything in the game!)</i><br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1278360/extras/ezgif.com-resize_(2).gif?t=1737782507\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GET ON STAGE</h2>Each joke you receive from quests will measure your abilities, with classic RPG dice rolls. High stats and the right joke makes all the difference! Succeeding will give you multiple options of where you want to take the joke, and even failing will allow you to choose your destiny in a spiraling maelstrom of stuttering, awkwardness, and pure bad taste. <i>Will you land every joke, or will you bomb your way through your shows?</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">NO FIGHTING</h2>Clam Man 2 is a narrative RPG, with zero combat! (Apart from a part where you can slap a guy in the face.) Furthermore, bombing jokes doesn't lead to a game over - instead, it leads to changes in how characters perceive you, with larger ramifications on the story in the full game! Oh, and you'll also be embarrassing yourself on stage.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1278360/extras/ezgif.com-resize.gif?t=1737782507\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">YOU ONLY GET A TASTE</h2>Clam Man 2: Open Mic is the entire first day of the full game currently in development, but even so has tons of quests, characters, and dialogue to see!
