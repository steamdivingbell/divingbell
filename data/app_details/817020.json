The beautiful graphics and unique character design make for an immersive experience. While the lack of traditional jump scares may disappoint some horror lovers, the scary atmosphere and constant threat from all kinds of enemies makes up for it. The puzzles are generally doable, although the stealth sequences can be challenging at times. Sometimes you just don't have to think too far. Unholy offers a fascinating story that gives a fresh look at the cult setting.
