Instead of XP grinding, it introduces a Tainting Mechanics. While traveling through the shattered reality of the Sanctuary, you will receive personality traits based on your choices. These will be the main source of your strength. To harness them, you will have to act accordingly. Becoming an alcoholic means that you will be rewarded for getting drunk, but from that point being sober might prove to be unbearable.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/530930/extras/GIF_01.jpg?t=1730368624\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Main Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> A unique Tainting Mechanic designed to encourage role playing<br></li><li> Tons of weapons, armor, and utility items<br></li><li> Dynamic and tactical combat build around stamina management and distance control<br></li><li> Optional stealth approach that complements fighting<br></li><li> Randomly generated, visually breathtaking levels<br></li><li> High difficulty level emphasized by permadeath mechanics<br></li><li> Gameplay\u00ad-driven narrative</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>Before entering each level of the Sanctuary you get to choose a Taint that represents a certain personality trait.

For the most part players can\u2019t miss an opportunity to get precious loot or XP knowing that the game will penalize them for it. That\u2019s why no one expect players not to fight a giant spider just because their character might have arachnophobia. So if we want players to actually role\u00adplay there needs to be a special mechanic that will encourage them to do so. That is how our Tainting Mechanic came to be.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Gluttonous","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/530930/e7897d019b49f7a1009291fd4a332c76e06402ef.jpg"},{"name":"Cowardly","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/530930/0be17b9f20ab23cc376e074cb0d8257d843d9ebb.jpg"},{"name":"Reckless","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/530930/942a0a5c4ca93e6aadb254f173e4ef5edbb173c5.jpg"},{"name":"Prying","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/530930/73df88924e647c66bc5e7d231271012bcaba7572.jpg"},{"name":"Unquenchable","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/530930/667a4db17a0ffbc6fd17e2fe86dc3dfb18092e43.jpg"},{"name":"Conniving","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/530930/15d03ae82c78f355016d15fbc4b3d8005e318735.jpg"},{"name":"Impulsive","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/530930/c5e500bca8f3a92fc5aafd6ebe8ad7ec7fc4a5dc.jpg"},{"name":"Acquisitive","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/530930/66fd7afd7be3539a28debc8dfeb7d69df9e65bfc.jpg"},{"name":"Vengeful","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/530930/84da40b0f42934b82a8bc4dc0bf560c9befef211.jpg"},{"name":"Greedy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/530930/25c05444faf944877c9d8071bf2fc7632784cdf8.jpg"}],"total":40},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/530930/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730368624","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/530930/page.bg.jpg?t=1730368624","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/530930/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730368624","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/530930/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730368624","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":533100,"description":"Soulblight Demo"}],"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/530930/extras/gold_element2.png?t=1730368624\" /><br>Soulblight is a dark, unforgiving, top-down action roguelike luring you to cross the thin line between good and evil.
