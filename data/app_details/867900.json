{"about_the_game":"Tennis Tune-Up: City Park - The second step in the continuing development of a real world simulation of tennis action.  We've added a two handed serve for more realism with a Club House height check,  and a City Park scene for more variety.  Tennis Tune-Up incorporates real world physics so that ball action and reaction is as good as it gets.  Your voice commands take you to the action. In Tennis Tune-Up you &quot;say what you see&quot; to take control of the action.  The Command Board in each scene gives you the voice commands to use.  <br><br>The action starts in the Club House where you can view the video tutorials and then continue off to the stadium to practice or head out to the park for some action.  <br><br>In the stadium or park you can have coach drop balls for you to hit at the targets or you can have the balls hit from across the court for rally practice.  Move the targets in, earn points and develop your game. With &quot;Practice Serve&quot; you develop your ball placement in the forehand or backhand courts.  Pick  up points by bringing in targets and firing away! <br> <br>In this latest upgrade we have added a two handed serve with one controller holding the racket and the other used to toss the ball.  When you choose this option in the Club House you will test your play area to make sure you have enough head room.
