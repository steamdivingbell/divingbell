Play as Brie, a spunky pink haired girl who recently gained the ability to magically summon cheese sandwiches out of thin air.  That\u2019s it. It\u2019s literally her only power. <br>AnB:RT is heavily inspired by the Persona series, and features an in-depth time management system. You\u2019ll need to keep an eye on Brie\u2019s mood while you\u2019re working through each chapter\u2019s dungeon, and if you play your cards right you can pursue a relationship with one of 10 potential love interests! Alluna and Brie ReTentacled is a massive 40hr RPG filled with tonnes of content, if you enjoy party based JRPGs or have played any of our other games set int the shared Axon City universe then you\u2019re bound to love this game.<br><br>Features: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Five Massive Chapters to play through, each with unique dungeons to explore and terrifying bosses to conquer.
