There are 48 structures in total and once you build them all, you get to place an epic Monument!<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2231790/extras/structure_600.gif?t=1696422515\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Free your imagination</h2>Being creative and letting your imagination take over is what\u2019s at the core of the game.
