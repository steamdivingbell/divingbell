{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Hammercock City has fallen. Bloodthirsty hordes of demons, criminals, clowns, and undead have flooded the streets of the once semi-relevant metropolis. The pantheon of the most famous and charming superheroes are dead or AWOL. Who's left? Well, uh\u2026 you guys are. Pick a 'hero' and fight to save Mayor McTrinkle and the, like, two untouched buildings left in the city. You know the drill: step up to the plate for once in your life, pick a sidekick, improve your super-hero game, and survive at least until one of the other Second Rates wakes up at noon and takes over your shift. Keep it up and maybe you'll get your own comic one day... if there was anyone left to write it. With intricate, deep gameplay, crazy weapon combos, 20 heroes, 4 sidekicks, 4 levels, 3 difficulties, more than 400 upgrade cards, 82 permanent upgrades, and sweet, sweet hand drawn art \u2013 you\u2019ll die over and over from anything but boredom. Ain\u2019t nothing wholesome here: be prepared for a heart pounding urban adventure that juices up the action roguelike genre. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong><i>Featuring:</i></strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>A new twist on the genre, giving you a Taunt mechanic and the use of Turrets to defend the Mayor, rather than just yourself.</strong></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Choose from 20 heroes (16 of which are unlockable), each of which plays entirely different. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Choose from 4 different Sidekicks to customize your runs with various benefits.  </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Choose from 4 different sidekicks / unpaid interns with different bonuses - provided they stick around. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">20 minute anxiety inducing runs which can be made even harder with certain in-game cards or purchasable bonuses. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Combine 16 Core weapons, 12 Rare weapons, 4 Superweapons, and 4 Side weapons at your fancy. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Over 400 \u2018cards\u2019 to choose from, in multiple rarities. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Metaprogression in the form of 82 permanent upgrade points, plus purchasable one-time items, to turn your Second Rates into eventual First Rates. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">86 unlockable weapons, cards, lore and even music. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">4 different stages in 3 different difficulties. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">18 heart-pounding musical tracks </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Hours upon hours of frustration, challenge, and heart-pounding fun. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">100% original hand drawn art. </p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong><i>Potential Future Roadmap:</i></strong> </p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">New Stages. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">New Unlocks. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Multiple new heroes that must be unlocked with late game achievements. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">New weapons. </p></li></ul>","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3299650/9f4bc4fc7e9a21bbd9316b4a6312d808356aa082/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730923137","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3299650/9f4bc4fc7e9a21bbd9316b4a6312d808356aa082/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730923137","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Hammercock City has fallen.
