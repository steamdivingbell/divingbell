{"about_the_game":"Telecom Tycoon is a single-player business simulation game, where you take on the role of CEO of a telecom company and build up mobile networks (cellular networks). Starting from a small startup, you may expand your services, manage resources, build a thriving telecommunications group and outcompete your AI controlled rivals to become the leading telecom provider in the world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Starting the game - randomly generated worlds</h2>Each time you are playing, you can start with an existing or a newly generated random world map, based on several adjustable parameters. The world map contains cities, villages, roads and most importantly, a population which are your potential customers.<br>When starting the game, you can customise your company's name and colour and choose your initial region. Each region might come with its own unique challenges and opportunities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build up your network</h2>You will be building base stations (on top of existing buildings or new towers) and connecting them through microwave or landline. Your stations then send out mobile signals and allow your customers to use them to make calls on your network.<br>Your core network will include e.g. mobile switching centers and home location registers.<br>The simulated population will then start signing up to the different operators. The most relevant factors will be network quality and pricing. You will receive money from the subscribers on a regular basis, however, don\u2019t forget you must also pay for the maintenance of the network.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Progressing and expanding</h2>The game starts in 1992 with 2G technology. As the player, you will get to experience how several generations of mobile technology are developed and brought to the market. You will have the choice between adopting a technology early, later or not at all.<br>During the course of a playthrough, licences will be awarded for the various regions and the newest generation of mobile technology, e.g. by way of an auction.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Your success as a telecom tycoon</h2>The main game will cover the years from 1992 to 2009. When concluding a playthrough in 2009, you will get a score, based on the value of your company, difficulty mode and bonus goals achieved. Playing beyond this date is possible, but will not change the score any further.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Further features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Set your pricing, balancing earning money and attracting more customers<br></li><li>Provide good service to make sure your customers are happy<br></li><li>Manage your finances and make sure you always have enough money<br></li><li>Special abilities, some of which are unlocked by reaching certain milestones<br></li><li>Various events which happen throughout the years will provide you with additional challenges and opportunities.<br></li><li>While similar to games in the genre, there can - and usually will - be competition almost everywhere in the world.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Current status</h2>Telecom Tycoon will offer a rich and immersive experience for players interested in strategy and management games. By balancing infrastructure development, service management, market competition, and financial oversight, players can experience the complexities and rewards of running a successful telecom company.<br>The project is still at an early stage. As of June 2024, we have a working pre-alpha prototype containing the most important features and are running the initial tests on it. However, there is still much work ahead of us and we hope you\u2019ll join us on the journey to bring this game to life.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2894430/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726340331","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2894430/page.bg.jpg?t=1726340331","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2894430/6f032245bf94659502bffa4bad6769eaa8526d8e/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726340331","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2894430/6f032245bf94659502bffa4bad6769eaa8526d8e/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726340331","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Telecom Tycoon is a single-player business simulation game, where you take on the role of CEO of a telecom company and build up mobile networks (cellular networks).
