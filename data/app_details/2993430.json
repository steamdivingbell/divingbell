{"about_the_game":"GMU Blastmaster Battle by Studio 410 is a colorful reimagining of the classic Bomberman formula with a healthy dose of GMU spirit.  Play as one of four GMU-themed characters and blast your way to victory using a multitude of powerups over three beautiful stages!<br><br>Here are some features to expect from Blastmaster Battle:<br><br>- Fight Your Friends: Up to four players can play via keyboard or controller in local PvP or virtually through a third party such as Parsec. Only XBOX or similar controllers are supported; button 1 is A, button 2 is B. Back is the Start button.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2993430/extras/bmbcontrols.png?t=1730396338\" /><br><br>- Gamemodes: The major gameplay change that's being implemented in v1.1 is the addition of optional gamemodes. They can do many things, from changing small stuff like what drops when to big things like starting a match with no blocks or even changing bomb types every couple seconds! They can be disabled in settings for the classic Blastmaster experience.<br><br>- Tutorials: We've completely overhauled the tutorial screen, adding looping instructional videos introducing the bomb types, powerups, and general ways to play.<br><br>- Win Tracking: For everyone doing those sick all-night Blastmaster LAN parties, the game tracks who has won the most games with a nifty little crown floating above their character.
