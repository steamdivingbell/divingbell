{"about_the_game":"The Spitfire Mk. XIV, which entered service at the end of 1943, was originally built with a \u201chigh back\u201d rear fuselage which restricted visibility to the rear of the plane. To rectify this problem, the Mk. XIV with a cut-down rear fuselage and tear-drop canopy began to be developed and built at the end of 1944.<br><br>These improved Spitfire Mk. XIVs featured full-span wings and were equipped with 2x .50 cal. machine guns and 2x 20 mm Hispano cannons; they could also be fitted with bomb racks to carry 250 lb. and 500 lb. bombs. The same Griffon engine that powered the original Mk. XIVs also powered this new model. For reconnaissance work, a camera could be fitted behind the canopy; such planes were known as Fighter Reconnaissance Mk. XIVs and were fitted with clipped wingtips as standard.<br><br>Spitfire Mk. XIVs with the cut-down rear fuselage and tear-drop canopy started entering service with the Royal Air Force\u2019s 2nd Tactical Air Force in March 1945 and continued in operational service after the end of the war in Europe in May 1945. These improved Mk. XIVs also began to be sent to the South-East Asian Theater in June 1945 but arrived too late to see any combat against the Japanese.<br><br>In addition to Quick Mission Builder, Advanced Quick Mission Generator and Multiplayer modes, you can fly it in Career mode during the <strong>Battle of Bodenplatte</strong> timeframe.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2366321/extras/SpitfireXIVe.png?t=1734531234\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Default armament: two 20mm guns &quot;Hispano Mk.II&quot; (150 rounds per gun, 650 rounds per minute) and two 12.7mm machine guns &quot;Browning .50&quot; (250 rounds per gun, 850 rounds per minute).<br></li><li>Bombs: 250 lb general purpose bombs &quot;250 lb.

This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.<br></li><li>The aircraft is equipped with a siren that warns a pilot if the throttle is set to low position with landing gear retracted.<br></li><li>It is impossible to open or close the canopy at high speed due to strong airflow.

The angular deflection will be calculated correctly only if the target range is set properly. To set the range, adjust the target base first using separate controls and then set the range by adjusting the size of the range finding reticle to be the same as the target size.<br></li><li>Both gunsights have sliding sun-filters.</li></ul></li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2366321/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734531234","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2366321/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1734531234","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2366321/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734531234","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2366321/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734531234","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Spitfire Mk.
