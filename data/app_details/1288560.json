She knows, despite her sister's teasing, that there must be a prince out there for her. She's determined to find him this year, and with his support write a wonderful romance story.<br><br>Then, on one sunny morning, while she's walking to work, Momoka meets a handsome boy on the beach. She feels drawn to him at once, and she's certain he must be the one she has been waiting for...<br><br>But Momoka soon learns that his handsome boy is, in fact, a handsome girl.<br><br>The girl's name is Hattori Aoi, and though she lives in Tokyo, she will be living in Omorishima for two weeks while her overworked father takes a much-needed vacation.<br><br>Aoi begins to work at the same caf\u00e9 as Momoka, she lives in the same house, and as time wears on, Momoka finds herself growing closer to Aoi than she ever imagined.
