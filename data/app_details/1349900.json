{"about_the_game":"<strong><u>Top features</u></strong><br><strong>Realistic population structure</strong><br><br>In no other grand strategy game are so many details and impacts in the own game strategy than in Feudal Kingdoms. The villages / settlements with their inhabitants need food to survive, most of which is grown on fields. The season will also influence the possibilities. In winter for example the ground will freeze, this will lead to starving inhabitants as soon as the stock goes empty. If you want to expand your kingdom and will start a battle against other kingdoms you need soldiers. Soldiers are farmers which need to be recruited. But the farmer will be missed as a food producer. Soldiers who died in battle will be gone. Therefore the birth rate and population density can go down or even decrease.
