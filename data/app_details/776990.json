{"about_the_game":"Every epic story has its beginning\u2026<br />\r\nWe had a few boxes of Jack Ahros, two  machine guns and unlimited amount of bullets, along with this huge red musclecar convertible we\u2019d just rented off a parking.<br />\r\nAll this had been rounded up the night before, in a frenzy of high-speed driving all over county. We picked up everything we could get our hands on. Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious zombie apocalypse and all that can save you are strong drinks and hard toys you involuntarily find an excuse for all your inner demons.

Endless fields of american Corn Belt, covered with fog where you can meet a lot of dangers - lonely abandoned cars, burning barrels and don\u2019t forget about hordes of the ravenous undeads.<br />\r\n - New gameplay mechanics - death race. Ride through the fear and loathing, crush and shoot enemies, hold as long as possible and remember  that only moving can save you and every stop can cost you a life.<br />\r\n - New easter eggs for the true genre-fans. A lot of obvious and secret cultural references which will remind you a favorite movies of yours.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/776990/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1515613684","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/776990/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1515613684","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/776990/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1515613684","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/776990/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1515613684","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"VR Supported","id":53},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Every epic story has its beginning\u2026<br />\r\nWe had a few boxes of Jack Ahros, two  machine guns and unlimited amount of bullets, along with this huge red musclecar convertible we\u2019d just rented off a parking.<br />\r\nAll this had been rounded up the night before, in a frenzy of high-speed driving all over county.
