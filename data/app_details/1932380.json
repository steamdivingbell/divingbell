{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Deep in fantastical lands of fairy tales and danger, a curse is rising once again as an old enemy returns. These peaceful lands are now beset by baked beasts, from gingerbread zombies to vicious animal crackers, drawn in by the cursed sugar. The Witch of the Candy Woods has returned, as she threatened upon her defeat, and she aims for revenge. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The lands\u2019 only hope are the Bakorcists, trained in the arcane recipes of the SucroNomicon by Hansel and Gretel themselves. Called to action, only you can perform the ancient recipes to bake/exorcise (Bakorcise) the evil from these sugar repositories. Travel to fairy tale kitchens with your team\u2014or brave the heat solo\u2014to fend off the baked beasts in a sugary showdown while you bake the curse away!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">SucroNomicon is a co-operative multiplayer VR game where players can team up with up to 4 friends in kitchen-based arenas where they must bake a specific confection to end the curse. While players bake, they must fend off the baked beasts as they storm the kitchen through open windows and doors. You can board up windows with baguettes for a short reprieve, lay milk traps to slow your foes, fling cookie cutters to dice, and more! Players must balance both the baking and the brawling, wielding kitchen utensils to fend off the fiends.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">All the recipes in SucroNomicon will be based on actual recipes that players can make in the real world. Players must fetch ingredients, mix, bake, chill, and frost their way to victory! </p>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1932380?t=1731345581","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1932380/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1731345581","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1932380/4fad5a1d8254f640a0afcab65b68afa15594ba36/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731345581","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1932380/4fad5a1d8254f640a0afcab65b68afa15594ba36/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731345581","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Deep in fantastical lands of fairy tales and danger, a curse is rising once again as an old enemy returns.
