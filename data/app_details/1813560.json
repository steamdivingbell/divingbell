The title has a lot of the classics like Amnesia and tries to add new forms of challenges that will surprise you. Its level of difficulty is very high, something that I have already mentioned but that is worth emphasizing again so that it does not take you by surprise. But despite this it is an adventure that is left to enjoy. It will keep you alert from the beginning and you will not be calm, especially after the first scare, since you will be waiting at all times for that hallucination to appear that will make you jump out of your chair. If we put it in the right context, taking into account its development and budget, we can assure that Deranged is a great job and, more importantly, it can be the starting point for great future games by its creator.\u201d<br>4 \u2013 ExtraGamers<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813560/ss_f526158bde4244c9b0b8a817187c2cfa3843d5fe.1920x1080.jpg?t=1645555943","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813560/ss_f526158bde4244c9b0b8a817187c2cfa3843d5fe.600x338.jpg?t=1645555943"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813560/ss_ce20c0cdbc8686d5f9f6b932a465b9a2609aa005.1920x1080.jpg?t=1645555943","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813560/ss_ce20c0cdbc8686d5f9f6b932a465b9a2609aa005.600x338.jpg?t=1645555943"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813560/ss_6165aef77f0ff1fc9c94d1f516cf5cbd4bce6f37.1920x1080.jpg?t=1645555943","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813560/ss_6165aef77f0ff1fc9c94d1f516cf5cbd4bce6f37.600x338.jpg?t=1645555943"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813560/ss_dd9e52e2591d0384139db778866901a64cd9a324.1920x1080.jpg?t=1645555943","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813560/ss_dd9e52e2591d0384139db778866901a64cd9a324.600x338.jpg?t=1645555943"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813560/ss_5b5cf2b5de94e0eea5e2f234b631a2c1e5eeea6b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1645555943","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813560/ss_5b5cf2b5de94e0eea5e2f234b631a2c1e5eeea6b.600x338.jpg?t=1645555943"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813560/ss_f8afc9a187662ef161b6d242998aa7fce3de94e8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1645555943","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813560/ss_f8afc9a187662ef161b6d242998aa7fce3de94e8.600x338.jpg?t=1645555943"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813560/ss_f364d310e7934e00ebe903c5a417b9f678676970.1920x1080.jpg?t=1645555943","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813560/ss_f364d310e7934e00ebe903c5a417b9f678676970.600x338.jpg?t=1645555943"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813560/ss_371a8791b0b3e7a323c29007de673a3fac6eecb7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1645555943","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813560/ss_371a8791b0b3e7a323c29007de673a3fac6eecb7.600x338.jpg?t=1645555943"},{"id":8,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813560/ss_c9ed4214611ac0148f42c91a3f45fb0aeee11b40.1920x1080.jpg?t=1645555943","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813560/ss_c9ed4214611ac0148f42c91a3f45fb0aeee11b40.600x338.jpg?t=1645555943"},{"id":9,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813560/ss_70c16d9dbac563635ab09c2a83cd550cefe9615c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1645555943","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813560/ss_70c16d9dbac563635ab09c2a83cd550cefe9615c.600x338.jpg?t=1645555943"},{"id":10,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813560/ss_1359f6e4f3838ed3878b7ca0c8985c0c5690b500.1920x1080.jpg?t=1645555943","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813560/ss_1359f6e4f3838ed3878b7ca0c8985c0c5690b500.600x338.jpg?t=1645555943"}],"short_description":"Deranged is a single player puzzle and psychological horror video game.
