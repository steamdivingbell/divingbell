{"about_the_game":"<strong>Giant Defense: Battle for Survival</strong><br><br>In a distant past, when giants suddenly emerged and ruthlessly invaded cities, humanity faced an unprecedented threat. To survive, humans were forced to sail far and wide, seeking remote islands where they hastily constructed fortresses to protect themselves from these colossal creatures. <br><br>For a time, these giants found themselves unable to assault these isolated islands, allowing humans to survive. However, a mysterious change has occurred. Giants now tread upon the once-protected shores, launching ferocious attacks on the carefully built castles and settlements of humanity. <br><br>As humans fight for survival, you must confront the giants. Embark on a heroic journey in &quot;Giant Defense&quot; to defend your homeland and loved ones.
