Don't be afraid, but look and listen carefully.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExploration: Exploration in this game means that the player sees something. By seeing what you need to see in the gradually changing game world, you will get closer to escape.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnding: There is only one ending to this game. The game will continue to loop until it is cleared, no matter how many times the game is over.
