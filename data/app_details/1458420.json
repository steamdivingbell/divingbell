{"about_the_game":"Social deduction for 4-12 players where the Humans must find the Werewolves and vote them out before they transform at night!

Humans need to vote out all the Werewolves, before they all transform and kill everyone during the night! Includes special Human roles such as the Sleuth, the Thug and the Hoarder, or maybe even a Neutral role such as the Executioner or the Clown!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1458420/extras/invis.gif?t=1619622068\" /><br>With each objective you complete, you have access to a wide variety of tools at your disposable to take out the opposing faction! <br>Will you Disguise - steal another player's identity and appear as them to everyone else? Or maybe you prefer Invisibility - disappearing at just the right time and escaping the Werewolf's attack! Perhaps you are a photographer and prefer the Camera - take photos of suspicious activity - or even the Werewolf - and use them to prove your case! Instead of just having to trust other players, you can gather Evidence which allows you to further your case. <br>You can present Evidence during each Trial (if you are alive!) which can be created by using Equipment, such as the Camera or Blood Test.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1458420/extras/barrel.gif?t=1619622068\" /><br>When night falls, make sure to stay away from those you don't trust! Each round has a full day/night cycle, followed by a trial to decide who to vote out. During the night a thick fog beckons, making vision almost impossible, and a perfect condition in which Werewolves can hunt.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1458420/extras/sample.gif?t=1619622068\" /><br>Nightfall gameplay content is entirely Free To Play, and always will be.
