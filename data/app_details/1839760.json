{"about_the_game":"<strong>Cursed Crew is a crew management roguelite where you\u2019re a captain sailing the untamed seas!</strong> You\u2019re responsible for giving orders, managing the ship\u2019s resources, keeping your crew happy, fighting pirates and beasts, and taking charge when all hell breaks loose. But you and your crew are cursed, destined to sail endlessly, unless you can find a way to break free!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Cursed Crew</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1839760/extras/GIFSteam1.gif?t=1709129736\" /><br>A ship needs both a captain and a crew. As the captain, you command your crew and stock the ship with supplies and food to keep everyone happy and healthy. You also plunder and spend treasure, plot your ship\u2019s course, and pick story events that lead to battles, treasure, or secrets. <br><br>Your crew takes care of the ship with or without orders: they steer, build, repair, go fishing, and prepare meals. In battle, they put out fires, haul supplies, load and man cannons, and defend your ship from beasts and enemy sailors. Your crew is an asset\u2014so long as their morale is high. Positive events like well-fought victories, a good night\u2019s rest, and delicious food and grog boost your crew\u2019s morale, whereas unpleasant situations like lost battles, shipmate deaths, sleep deprivation, and starvation hurt it. A resentful crew member is a problem: they might ignore your orders, throw destructive tantrums, lose all motivation to work, or even start a mutiny against you!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Bombarding Action</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1839760/extras/GIFSteam3.gif?t=1709129736\" /><br>These waters are infested with danger, so do whatever it takes to defend your ship! Order your crew to construct and man the cannons and fire at anything that moves. Batter your enemies with grapeshot and hull-breaching artillery, and use harpoon guns to reel in and board enemy vessels for a proper swashbuckling battle. Clear out those scallywags by arming your crew with daggers, cutlasses, flintlock pistols, muskets, and bombs.<br><br>Prepare for many deadly encounters on your journey. The high seas are filled with murderous pirates, skeleton crews, ghosts, rat men, packs of killer sharks, violent winds and storms, ravenous megalodons and more!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Ship</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1839760/extras/GIFSteam8.gif?t=1709129736\" /><br>Set sail in a vessel that tells the world what kind of captain you really are.
