The first game developed by DarkShot Studios, the game follows the adventures of our protagonist, ROTii; a 4 inch-tall cleaning robot who is programmed to clean germs and eradicate bugs! Its creator, the brilliant, yet lazy Dr. Nida has armed ROTii with the mighty Vac-Pack, a high-powered vacuum backpack that can suck up objects and spit them out at high speeds. ROTii is truly a product essential for any modern household!<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/603220/extras/gameplay.png?t=1516731624\" /><br><br><br>In ROTii, each of the levels is something of an obstacle course within one of Nida\u2019s rooms. Objects, enemies, and traps stand between ROTii and the exit, and the player must use their mighty vacuum cleaning to get through them all. By using it, ROTii can push and pull heavy items to create new paths. The vacuum is also capable of sucking in certain enemies and objects, then spitting them out as high speed projectiles.<br><br>The puzzles are made up of ordinary objects found in Nida\u2019s ordinary home. The player must think about old concepts in a new light to make it to the end. All the while, Bite Mites are chasing you, shooting at you, or even trying to crush you.<br><br>ROTii will have nearly 20 environments to explore, as well as some epic and giant boss battles.
