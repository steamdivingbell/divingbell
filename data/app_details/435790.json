{"about_the_game":"10 SECOND NINJA X is a shockingly fast, overwhelmingly intense action/puzzle game. In this thumb blistering sequel, the nefarious Captain Greatbeard has kidnapped you and trapped your forest friends inside of his army of robots like some kind of psychopath. Greatbeard doesn't think you're the fastest ninja who ever lived - he is WRONG. Destroy all of Greatbeard's robots in each level in ten seconds or less. Be fast enough to get the coveted three star rating in each. Fight through 100 levels, explore Greatbeard's airship, discover secrets, climb the leaderboards and show everyone what it means to be THE FASTEST, COOLEST HERO EVER.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/435790/extras/des_Pic1.png?t=1733498689\" /><br><br>\u2981\t100 thumb blistering, mind bending levels over 11 game worlds<br>\u2981\t11 \u201cMarathon Modes\u201d with back to back ninja madness<br>\u2981\tPlayer ghosts and unlockable ghost hints for the trickier levels!<br>\u2981\tExplore the magnificent Greatbeard's ship in the retro styled hub.<br>\u2981\tOnline leaderboards for every level!<br>\u2981\tHidden minigames - with a 100% chance of Nun themed mayhem.<br>\u2981\t8 different character costumes to unlock and play<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/435790/extras/des_pic2.png?t=1733498689\" /><br><br><i>&quot;10 Second Ninja X is slick, quick and compulsive&quot;</i> - Telegraph, \u2158<br><br><i>&quot;Sprinkled with humour, colour, and secrets to uncover, this action platformer is an addictive little time-waster &quot;</i> - God is a Geek, 9/10<br><br><i>&quot;A great sequel...
