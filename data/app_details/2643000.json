{"about_the_game":"Mirrors of Epiphany is a puzzle game where you guide light beams to their designated goals by placing mirrors on a board.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Core gameplay</strong></h2>Light sources and detectors (paired up by a given colour) are placed around an empty board. The challenge is to place mirrors in positions and orientations so that each source and detector pair is connected.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Rich in content</strong></h2>There are 100 unique puzzles, ranging from the simplest possible to larger boards with multiple pairs of light sources and detectors, requiring a complex setup of mirrors to connect everything properly.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Choose your own challenge level</strong></h2>Most puzzles have a lot of <strong>workable solutions</strong>, but each puzzle has only one <strong>optimal solution</strong> (i.e. using as few mirrors as possible). Explore and play around to find solutions that just get the job done, or satisfy your puzzle solving instincts by reaching for perfection.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Unlimited number of moves</strong></h2>You can place mirrors, change their orientations, and remove them again as many times as you like. The number of moves are not counted. The only scoring measure is the number of mirrors placed on the board when all pairs of light sources and detectors are connected.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Relaxing</strong></h2>There are no time limits. You can enjoy solving all the puzzles at your own pace.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2643000/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732452583","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2643000/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1732452583","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2643000/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732452583","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2643000/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732452583","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2790070,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Mirrors of Epiphany is a puzzle game where you guide light beams to their designated goals by placing mirrors on a board.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Core gameplay</strong></h2>Light sources and detectors (paired up by a given colour) are placed around an empty board.
