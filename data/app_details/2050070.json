{"about_the_game":"Rusty Seas is a retro-style game reminiscent of the 16-bit console era with a splash of 90's computer gaming, drawing inspiration and design philosophy from some of the great classics of that time, as well as plucking a few bits from more modern games to bridge the gap.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay as Mirig, a diner waitress whose afternoon off is interrupted by a mysterious (and very profitable) offer to collect high-tech junk washing up on the beaches of Northshore.  But her venture is fraught with a colorful cast of competitors who also want to lay claim to the salvages.  To overcome, Mirig will need to throw her weight around, dunk her adversaries, buy outfits and items, and make friends and allies along the way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to action-based gameplay, Rusty Seas also features a splash of visual novel style content, through which the player can learn that the lore of Northshore runs a little deeper than its cozy sands.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2050070/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733689438","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2050070/page.bg.jpg?t=1733689438","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2050070/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733689438","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2050070/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733689438","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"Contains some coarse language and suggestive content."},"demos":[{"appid":2053730,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Rusty Seas is a retro-style game reminiscent of the 16-bit console era with a splash of 90's computer gaming, drawing inspiration and design philosophy from some of the great classics of that time, as well as plucking a few bits from more modern games to bridge the gap.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay as Mirig, a diner waitress whose afternoon off is interrupted by a mysterious (and very profitable) offer to collect high-tech junk washing up on the beaches of Northshore.
