You have the freedom to build barricades and turrets to create mazes and launch attacks on the enemy, as well as place traps on the ground for added defense.<br><br>During the construction phase, you can experiment with different combinations of turrets and barriers to come up with the most effective obstacle course for your attackers. And don't worry about time limits or wasted resources - you can sell everything you build for a full refund until the next combat phase begins.

With a huge arsenal of guns at your fingertips, each featuring different ammo types, you'll have to make split-second decisions to take down waves of zombies. Full metal jacket rounds can pierce through multiple enemies and even objects, while hollow points send foes flying and give you some breathing room. Incendiary rounds ignite zombies and keep them burning, and grenade and rocket launchers can deal massive damage to groups of enemies - but watch out, they may also destroy valuable cash pickups.<br><br>In addition to all these guns, you'll also have access to a range of active abilities that give you even more ways to defeat or distract enemies, move around more efficiently, or manage your resources. With over a dozen weapons to choose from, gunplay in our game is always exciting and rewarding.
