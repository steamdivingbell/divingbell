{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Advanced Adventures #4: Prison of Meneptah</h2><strong> <i>Advanced Adventures #4: The Prison of Meneptah</i> </strong> is an OSRIC(TM) module designed for 4-7 adventurers of levels 8-10.<br>When news came that an army led by a secretive cabal of war wizards failed in their attempt to unseat one of the rulers of Hell, the leader of the arcane order rallied his remaining forces so that another assault could be put into motion. In preparation for the eventual assault, he elected to further explore one of the planes newly discovered just a few months prior, which detected as highly magical in nature. Perhaps, just perhaps, this mysterious desert-like plane would provide him with the powerful magicks needed to overthrow the dreaded Lord of the Flies himself! A force of twenty men and women was eventually dispatched to the plane on a mission of exploration. None have yet returned...<br>Can a hardy band of adventurers journey to the strange desert-like plane and bring home with them any surviving members of the lost expedition?
