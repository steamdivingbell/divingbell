In <i>The Watcher's Curse,</i> you step into the shoes of Artem, a duty-burdened watcher tasked with protecting the world from nefarious forces. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As a watcher, Artem's responsibilities are twofold: learn the secrets of the world along with any lost knowledge and remove any threats posed by the aforementioned nefarious forces. Most common amongst said forces are the puritanical technotheists, a fanatical order that believes technology brings them closer to god.  Whether stationed in an overlapped hell forest or chasing ancient horrors through an ageless monolith, Artem faces a relentless barrage of esoteric threats.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Our tale begins with Artem in a precarious predicament, unexpectedly transported across the world after a chance encounter with a seemingly innocuous tome. Stranded in the gloomy confines of Grimm's Briar, nestled amidst the foreboding Noctemura mountains, Artem crosses paths with Mayor Barkeep. Eager to return home, Artem finds himself entangled in the mayor's plea for aid in unraveling the enigma shrouding the disappearance of local villagers.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As Artem delves deeper into the mystery, he uncovers a dangerous plot involving the Technotheists, who have been corrupted by an ancient force. These zealots, obsessed with merging their bodies with cyborg technology to achieve divine grace, believe that through machinery and metal they will transcend their mortal forms and come closer to god. However, unknown to them, Chaos, locked in a stalemate for eons with its primal counterpart Order, has been manipulating their faith to summon him from the ephemeral plane. The Technotheists have long had a deep-seated hatred for the Watchers, who have always stood in direct opposition to their beliefs about the gods and how best to gain their favor.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Embark on a perilous journey through haunted graveyards, pestilent sewers, and eerie forests as Artem dives deeper into the heart of the mystery. Along the way, he encounters a motley cast of characters, from a god of rot masquerading as a raccoon to a morbidly obsessed innkeeper, each offering their own unique brand of assistance in his quest to avert impending catastrophe.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Will you uncover the truth behind the land of Hollow Veil, or will the ever-encroaching doom prove to be too much for even Artem's calloused hands?</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2935690/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735494154","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2935690/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1735494154","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2935690/82382419851dd80428edc8f69010f9e6f34c6969/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735494154","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2935690/82382419851dd80428edc8f69010f9e6f34c6969/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735494154","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Depiction of self-harm"},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":2974630,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Play the free demo now!</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2935690/extras/desc_features.png?t=1735494154\" /></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Distinct art-style that brings the haunting world of Hollow Veil to life.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Immersive narrative-driven gameplay unfolds a grim tale of mystery, ancient gods, and supernatural peril.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Turn-based combat challenges players to destroy their foes in whatever manner they see fit.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Unravel what secrets lie in the land of Hollow Veil as you explore its haunted landscapes and encounter its gently-deranged inhabitants.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Level up to increase your base stats and unlock powerful new spells.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2935690/extras/desc_story.png?t=1735494154\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Welcome to the mysterious land of Hollow Veil, where darkness thrives and hopeless souls wander endlessly.
