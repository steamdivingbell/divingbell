{"about_the_game":"Simple racing is an online racing game made for your keyboard and mouse. Race against your friends or play against AI, either way, you will be earning credits to purchase a better ride. Race cleanly to improve your Simple Rating while keeping in mind that winning is everything. Dozens of different races await your triumph!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Online races with up to 8 player simultaneous action<br></li><li>Quick 2 to 6 minute races<br></li><li>Fun gameplay with just your keyboard and mouse<br></li><li>Fast paced action<br></li><li>Earn credits to buy faster cars<br></li><li>Race cleanly to improve your Simple Rating<br></li><li>Simple graphics to run smoothly on every computer<br></li><li>18 unique cars to attain<br></li><li>5 different beautiful tracks to master<br></li><li>Several race variations</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/907040/extras/ss7.PNG?t=1555437493\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How to Play</h2>Use you arrow keys or wasd keys to drive. Its as simple as that, and thats how it was made. From the beginning our intention was to not offer any controller support to give every casual player a level playing field. Its also more fun for just a quick race, no need to spend time setting up any controllers!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Simple Rating</h2>Simple Rating is an individual player rank that goes from 0 to 99. Everyone starts on 45, but depending on whether you finish or not your races and drive cleanly this can rise and fall. Simple Rating is visible to all players in a lobby.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Developer and Future Updates</h2>As Simple Racing is a hobby project and therefore an indie game, updates will be small and irregular. However, there is already a plan to add wet weather races and different tyres! Dont be panicked though if it takes time because this is a side project I have been working on while in middle school.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/907040/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1555437493","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/907040/page.bg.jpg?t=1555437493","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/907040/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1555437493","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/907040/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1555437493","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Simple racing is an online racing game made for your keyboard and mouse.
