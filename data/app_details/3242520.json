Score big points but eating big combos. How high of a score can you get?<br><strong>Time Attack: </strong>Similar to Normal Mode but with a timer that is constantly ticking down. Once it reaches zero the game is over. Add on more time by eating big combos. Extra time is added on at the end of each wave as well (1 second x how big your combo is that you ended the wave on).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What will be in the full game?</h2><strong>More Enemies:</strong> We have at least 3 more enemies planned for the final release. <br><strong>More Levels: </strong>We have at least 5 unique levels planned for the full game. We are emphasizing quality, diversity and replayability in each level. <br><strong>Challenge Mode:</strong> Each level will have another mode called Challenge Mode that will have a pre-set number of waves that can be completed. Whenever a level's Challenge mode is completed, the other modes for that level will be unlocked, as well as the next level.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3242520/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727191620","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3242520/page.bg.jpg?t=1727191620","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3242520/67a0eed8351f8fe6ba9dd1ad9049e7f5fbada6df/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727191620","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3242520/67a0eed8351f8fe6ba9dd1ad9049e7f5fbada6df/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727191620","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Thank you so much for trying out Kelp Keeper! </h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Controls</h2><strong>Move Otter </strong>- Left Analog Stick / D-Pad<br><strong>Dash</strong> - A button<br><strong>Clam Bomb</strong> - B button<br>It is recommended that you play the game with a controller but you can play it with just a keyboard as well (move around with WASD, use spacebar for all A button inputs, and use the E key for all B button inputs).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What's in the Demo</h2>This demo features the first level of the game and 2 modes of play: Normal (Endless) and Time Attack. <br><strong>Normal Mode: </strong> An endless wave-based survival mode.
