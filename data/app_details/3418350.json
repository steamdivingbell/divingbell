{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Description:\u00a0</strong>Hello, my name is <strong>Over</strong>, the host at <strong>Tricky Hotel</strong>, a 2.5D puzzle game where you play as <strong>Scarlet</strong>, exploring a mysterious, non-Euclidean hotel in search of her lost cat. Solve puzzles that range from easy to hard, with each floor introducing new mechanics as Scarlet progresses.<br><br><strong>Story:\u00a0</strong>Oh, hello again! It\u2019s me, <strong>Over</strong>! Curious to hear the story? Well, it all begins with <strong>Scarlet</strong>, a little girl searching for her beloved cat who ran away. During her search, she comes across a <span class=\"bb_strike\">strange</span> beautiful place called <strong>Tricky Hotel</strong>. Could her cat have wandered inside? Without hesitation, <strong>Scarlet</strong> enters the hotel and rings the bell at the reception.<br><br>No one shows up, but a voice over the megaphone greets her, and yes, that\u2019s me, <strong>Over</strong>! <strong>Scarlet</strong> asks if her cat has been there, and I tell her yes\u2026 but there\u2019s a small problem. This hotel isn\u2019t normal, no, not even close. In fact, it\u2019s much more TRICKY than it seems. Her cat is trapped on the 10th floor, for a mysterious and somewhat\u2026 non-Euclidean reason.<br><br>To reach him, <strong>Scarlet</strong> will have to solve puzzles and challenges. The question is... is she smart enough to make it? Well, that\u2019s for you to find out! Haha! I don\u2019t believe in luck, but\u2026 good luck anyway!<br><br><strong>Features and Concepts:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Puzzles</strong> Every floor introduces new puzzles that range from hidden compartments to non-Euclidean challenges. Some puzzles might require you to manipulate objects or decipher encryption, while others might change the environment itself! But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m here to help whenever you need! Probably all the time, haha!</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Interactions</strong> Do you like inspecting items? Well, here you can do that! Pick up objects to add to your inventory, then rotate, move, and zoom. Open compartments to solve puzzles and analyze clues. You can also interact with doors, light switches, levers, and more!</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Non-Euclidean Geometry</strong> I\u2019ll let Scarlet explain this one for me... Scarlet: &quot;Non-Euclidean geometry is a kind of geometry that doesn't follow the usual rules we're used to, like hallways that loop back on themselves, or doors that lead to places that weren't supposed to be there. It's like environments in Escher\u2019s art, where things don't make sense, like dream spaces and portals!&quot; Well, that\u2019s Scarlet\u2019s explanation, and yes, that whole non-Euclidean thing will appear on some floors of this hotel.</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Floors</strong> Each floor is different from the others, with styles ranging from vintage to modern. Classic elements can be found, but always with a reimagined style. I promise, you won\u2019t get bored!</li></ul></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3418350/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736192791","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3418350/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1736192791","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3418350/ebb427cbbe57c98d1129e2238c9924e891fa7283/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736192791","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3418350/ebb427cbbe57c98d1129e2238c9924e891fa7283/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736192791","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Description:\u00a0</strong>Hello, my name is <strong>Over</strong>, the host at <strong>Tricky Hotel</strong>, a 2.5D puzzle game where you play as <strong>Scarlet</strong>, exploring a mysterious, non-Euclidean hotel in search of her lost cat.
