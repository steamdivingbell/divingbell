{"about_the_game":"Thundering cannons, sails flapping in the wind, and the ship\u2019s deck creaking \u2013 one of the most dangerous sea voyages of the 19th century lies ahead. Walk in Captain Ivan Kruzenshtern\u2019s shoes, recruit a ship crew, secure the Emperor\u2019s backing and sail out on Russia\u2019s first, history-making circumnavigation. Kronstadt, Nuku Hiva\u2019s indigenous cannibal tribes, snowy Alaska, unapproachable Japan, and China with its perils, and all this against the backdrop of violent storms, major sea battles, geographic discoveries, overcoming the challenges of maritime navigation, and a delicate interplay between onboard diplomacy and international relations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKruzenshtern. A Stellar Sail is a monumental immersive project that tells the story of Russia\u2019s first circumnavigation, undertaken by captains Kruzenshtern and Lisyansky on board Nadezhda and Neva. We re-enacted the chronicle of this historic voyage by relying on the protagonists\u2019 diaries and hundreds of historical documents. The two ships spent over three years at sea, sailed through six seas and three oceans to accomplish a legendary feat. It is now your turn to become part of Russian naval history.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2193270/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1680075868","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2193270/page.bg.jpg?t=1680075868","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2193270/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1680075868","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2193270/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1680075868","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Supported","id":53}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Thundering cannons, sails flapping in the wind, and the ship\u2019s deck creaking \u2013 one of the most dangerous sea voyages of the 19th century lies ahead.
