And, of course, try again to save the world from falling into darkness. We have kept the atmosphere, but upgraded the visual style, as well as added more game mechanics, which will give the passage a completely new emotion.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1623360?t=1630119096","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1623360/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1630119096","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1623360/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1630119096","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1623360/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1630119096","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"Kaigrad contains physical abuse, blood, drug abuse, self-harm, as well as nudity, sexual materials, and a bit of torture."},"detailed_description":"\u00abKaigrad.
