{"about_the_game":"This game offers two distinct genres for players to enjoy: an &quot;Action Part&quot; where you gather ingredients in a fairy tale world, and a &quot;Management Part&quot; where you run a restaurant using the ingredients you've collected.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the &quot;Action Part,&quot; we\u2019ve utilized post-effects to create a mood that makes you feel as if you\u2019ve stepped into a storybook. The ingredients you find in the stages can either be taken back to the restaurant or used to cook dishes on the spot. These dishes range from items that restore your health when eaten, to ones that can cause status effects on enemies when fed to them. Skillful use of these dishes can give you an advantage in battles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers can also unleash spectacular &quot;Fairy Tale Skills&quot; as special moves. Famous fairy tale characters will appear and fight alongside the player.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the &quot;Management Part,&quot; the goal is to run a profitable restaurant using the ingredients you\u2019ve gathered. By serving dishes to customers, your staff can earn revenue. However, if you keep customers waiting too long, they\u2019ll get angry and leave. Additionally, poor table turnover can result in long lines outside the restaurant, so managing your staff efficiently is key to success.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3173430/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736311581","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3173430/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1736311581","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3173430/f144032f425da07da6d7583848ce823cade16ba2/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736311581","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3173430/f144032f425da07da6d7583848ce823cade16ba2/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736311581","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"This game offers two distinct genres for players to enjoy: an &quot;Action Part&quot; where you gather ingredients in a fairy tale world, and a &quot;Management Part&quot; where you run a restaurant using the ingredients you've collected.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the &quot;Action Part,&quot; we\u2019ve utilized post-effects to create a mood that makes you feel as if you\u2019ve stepped into a storybook.
