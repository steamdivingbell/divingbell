{"about_the_game":"Every planet is a choice.  Every choice has a consequence.  The Zenith Remnant is the first expansion to Arcen Games' hit space-based indie RTS/4X hybrid, AI War: Fleet Command.  This expansion includes a massive amount of new content that bring the galaxy to life in exciting ways.
