{"about_the_game":"The inhabitants of the planet Ayrlin are simple, kind, and indisputable, but the land under their feet is barren and desolate. Deserts, hills, and swamps are spread throughout the continent, with short summers and long winters, and the rest of the time the weather changes rapidly, even in just a few days it will experience the alternation of severe cold and scorching heat. The people of this land have survived kindly and hard for generations, enduring this untold suffering for generations.<br><br>I don't know when it was rumored that a violent explosion occurred in the corner of a certain continent, and since then, some space-time rifts have appeared on the planet Aerlin. After an unknown amount of time, an energy core that no one had ever seen before was produced in these space-time rifts, which contained endless arcane energy. Soon, it was discovered that these violent, powerful, and unstable arcane energies could biochemicalize all things, with a power that turned decay into magic. Where these energy cores gather, deserts turn into fertile soil, hills bloom with flowers, and swamps turn into streams. People who settle there have forgotten the feeling of cold and heat, and enjoy the weather in all seasons like spring and rain. The Arcane Core brought hope and life to this land for the first time.<br><br>More fortunately, as more and more people came into contact with the enrichment of arcane cores, gradually some people discovered that they had special abilities that could sense with arcane cores, and it was even said that some people could already master the power of arcane cores. As a result, almost everyone on the planet Aerlin desperately went to find the Arcane Core, believing that they were the lucky ones who could master the power of the Arcane Core and change the fate of themselves and even the entire planet.<br><br>[GamePlay]<br>The game belongs to the turn-based squad tactical category, with a total of six levels, each level has a certain number of rounds, players must collect all the arcane cores on the map within the limited number of rounds.<br><br>Players can choose from 8 basic classes to form squads, each class has different class talents, and as players level up, they can unlock 8 advanced classes.
