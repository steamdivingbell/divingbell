{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2263120/extras/StoryTitlev2.png?t=1718461191\" /><br><br>Captured by 'The Rune-less', a dark and powerful being, you must take Orillia on her journey to escape imprisonment while struggling to keep her grasp on reality due to a broken and faded memory caused by years of torment and failed escape attempts. To escape this nightmare, you must vanquish rooms of minions, who are only alive to serve the bidding of their master whilst he experiments with different ways to increase his power. Along her journey, Orillia will encounter many obstacles that you, the player, must help her overcome, including mysterious powers and curve balls from The Rune-less that could completely change your approach. In the universe of OutRune, every person is born with a powerful rune encased into an item/artefact that becomes that person's 'AfterFact'. During Orillia's escape, she will find these AfterFacts along the way. She can upgrade her AfterFact and the ones she finds by utilising the machines created by the Rune-less and his following of Greheem tinkerers.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2263120/extras/OR_GameplayGIF_3.gif?t=1718461191\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2263120/extras/AfterFactsTitlev2.png?t=1718461191\" /><br><br>AfterFacts are magical items that the Rune-less is trying to deconstruct and use for his evil deeds. When a person is born, the afterbirth contains a calcified magical rune that is infused into an item. These items can be anything, but they are often personal to that person. In Orillia's case, her AfterFact is a bracelet. You will find them on your escape attempts, and they bestow powerful effects onto Orillia that can be upgraded at the AfterFactum machines.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2263120/extras/AfterFactsLayoutv2.png?t=1718461191\" /><br>(Only a few of the planned AfterFacts)<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2263120/extras/OR_GameplayGIF_6.gif?t=1718461191\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2263120/extras/AfterFactumTitlev2.png?t=1718461191\" /><br><br>This upgrading system will empower you without breaking focus.
