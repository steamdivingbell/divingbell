The roaring twenties are a time of possibilities, if you are willing to take them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Welcome to the underworld. </h2><br>Money, Power, Glory, Women. These alone move the wheels of history. Writing history is the last thing on your mind right now though. A lowly criminal doing everything to get by... your pockets are empty, your stomach makes a large noise at night, but all that doesn't matter. Money, Power, Glory, Women... you know what you are capable of. Money, power, glory, women... these are never given, only taken. Fearless man with a gun and a big ambition can get it all... question is, do you have what it takes?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Make your own character</h2>Choose your nationality, playstyle and way to get to the top. Over 250 encounters where you will choose your own destiny, and the destiny of your syndicate. Became a politician, or a cunning master ready to deceive and backstab at all times, turn enemies against one another, be so brutal and organized that no one can win a war against you, or make your business squeeze every dime from the customers. But there is always time for some dollface to charm, or maybe gamble.

Maybe force him to put a new police chief, because the old one is connected with your enemies. Having good relationship with the police chief always comes in handy, whether to get someone out of jail, or to put someone in there, depending on your needs. An ally has a strong case against them? Having the judges in your pocket will turn allies into friends in need.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Different systems colliding</h2>In this world, everyone wants a piece of the action. Money, power, whatever you can give to them. Politicians, judges, media. But that's not so bad. You can use them all to your advantage. Some faction decided to get in war with you? No problem, use the media to bring heat and for the public to want justice. They have good relationship with the police chief? No problem, just kill him, and maybe bring someone you have good relationships with?  How about bribing the media so they will always defend you action? You can always try sending the police to raid an enemy of yours so you cut their supply and attack them just at the right time, when they are the weakest. The world is your oyster.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Petty Thief 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2573030/af5086c9f2dc980a8f59dab17118511f0410666f.jpg"},{"name":"Petty Thief 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2573030/af5086c9f2dc980a8f59dab17118511f0410666f.jpg"},{"name":"Petty Thief 3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2573030/af5086c9f2dc980a8f59dab17118511f0410666f.jpg"},{"name":"Walker Robber 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2573030/af5086c9f2dc980a8f59dab17118511f0410666f.jpg"},{"name":"Walker Robber 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2573030/af5086c9f2dc980a8f59dab17118511f0410666f.jpg"},{"name":"Walker Robber 3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2573030/af5086c9f2dc980a8f59dab17118511f0410666f.jpg"},{"name":"Finish Tutorial","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2573030/08149ceb6fa4fd6d97a71b9cb445750680f89089.jpg"},{"name":"No Honor Among Thieves 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2573030/08149ceb6fa4fd6d97a71b9cb445750680f89089.jpg"},{"name":"The Adequate Finch 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2573030/08149ceb6fa4fd6d97a71b9cb445750680f89089.jpg"},{"name":"Swindle 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2573030/08149ceb6fa4fd6d97a71b9cb445750680f89089.jpg"}],"total":20},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2573030/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737132495","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2573030/page.bg.jpg?t=1737132495","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2573030/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737132495","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2573030/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737132495","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Implication of violence(non graphical, only text)"},"detailed_description":"<h1>ROADMAP</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2573030/extras/Roadmap2.png?t=1737132495\" /><br>Unfortunately it doesn't allow me to upload higher resolution image.
