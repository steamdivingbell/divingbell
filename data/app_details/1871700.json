This is a sequel to that mythical game.</i><br><br>As Kyonshi Hui and Jiangshi Bo, it is your quest to banish all evil in all 100 levels - 10 original stages, including the boss -- a mutated mass of pure evil. Hui prefers zapping foes while Bo prefers absorbing their life force.<br><br>Yeah Yeah Beebiss II is a new retro homebrew game created as a love letter to the whole retro game scene!<br><br>Fight your way through various platforming arcade levels and avoid obstacles such as spikes and enemies on the ground below. Use the platforms to avoid being hit and use your zap ability to defeat the enemies and raise your high score! You'll eventually face off against bosses and never ending waves of enemies as you try to defeat one. <br><br>You can team up via local co-op and get through the levels with a little help from a friend!
