{"about_the_game":"16-bit a gogo! Harken back to the days of old-school fun with a modern twist! Lured by a vengeful spirit of a defeated witch, Duckles, and his friends, find themselves trapped on a mysterious island full of deadly sorceresses! What heinous plans does this gruesome Witch have for him? This is NO place for a colourful 16-bit  duck-hero to be but he's all the more determined to prove otherwise when he learns of the oppressed island's true origins. Discovering new allies and formidable foes along the way, Duckles must save the Winged Folk, restore peace to the island and vanquish the evils that pulsate in the blackest of hearts, of the Jigsaw Witch!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/512700/extras/jigsaw.png?t=1572473018\" /> <strong> <br>WHO'S THIS GAME FOR?
