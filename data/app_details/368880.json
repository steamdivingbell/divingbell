{"about_the_game":"<strong>Friends always manage, because they stick together, no matter what. </strong>Five friends are walking through the ancient Castle Balthasar, that is embedded in Europa-Park, one of the largest theme parks in the world. They enjoyed a fabulous day together filled with stunning rollercoaster rides, spectacular shows and lots of fun. While having a break at Balthasar Castle they step on a hidden trap door and are falling into the underground of the castle. Below the castle they get lost in a mysterious maze of forgotten dungeons. They are all alone but they know they can escape only together. Watch out the &quot;Nightgrabber&quot; on the way out, that is trying to keep them in the dungeon and putting obstacles into their way.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Puzzle and Skill game mode\t<br></li><li>All characters with different exclusive abilities\t<br></li><li>Combination of different character skills required \t<br></li><li>Control of  all characters\t<br></li><li>Intuitive control and tutorial</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/368880/extras/nightgrabber.png?t=1528290760\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/368880/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1528290760","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/368880/page.bg.jpg?t=1528290760","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/368880/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1528290760","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/368880/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1528290760","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Friends always manage, because they stick together, no matter what. </strong>Five friends are walking through the ancient Castle Balthasar, that is embedded in Europa-Park, one of the largest theme parks in the world.
