{"about_the_game":"In the early 2000s, &quot;flat foamy&quot; models were extremely popular because they could be scratch built from foam sheets you could buy in many stores. Today, most foam models are fully-molded sport and scale aircraft \u2013 and few can match the unique capabilities and performance of flat foam models, especially those designed and built for aerobatic plus 3D flying! The E-flite\u00ae Eratix 3D FF (Flat Foamy) 860mm is perfect for experienced pilots who already build and fly flat foam models, intermediate pilots who are interested in them but don't want to undertake a complicated build, and less experienced pilots who have always wanted to try but were intimidated by the extra effort and skills required to buy, build and fly such a model. The Eratix 3D FF is the easiest-to-fly, most convenient, and best value in a flat foamy model yet!<br><br>This model is equipped with Horizon Hobby and Spektrum exclusive AS3X (Artificial Stabilization \u2013 3-aXis) and optional-use SAFE (Sensor Assisted Flight Envelope) Select technologies, and when SAFE Select is turned on using the mode switch (B on the Spektrum InterLink DX controller) it offers:<br><strong>Pitch and Bank Angle Limits</strong><br>These envelope limits keep the airplane from rolling or pitching upside down.
