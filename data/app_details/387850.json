Sure, you are brilliantly gifted. But are you safe? Can you handle real pressure? You are the world's last line of defense against inevitable air disaster! You are paid the big bucks for your visualization skills and guts. Just like the real job of an air traffic controller, you must pay attention and keep your eyes moving.
