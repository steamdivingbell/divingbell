{"about_the_game":"<i>&quot;It doesn't take a hero to order men into battle. It takes a hero to be one of those men who goes into battle.&quot;</i><br>-Norman Schwarzkopf<br><br>On August 2, 1990, Iraq\u2019s ground forces invaded and occupied Kuwait. 40% of the world\u2019s oil production, and the developed world\u2019s economy, was placed in imminent threat by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. In response, the United States promptly assembled an international coalition to attack and expel Iraqi forces out of Kuwait, and to eliminate Hussein\u2019s capability to repeat such an act in the future. What followed would forever transform the face of war.<br><br>Desert Storm was the first truly high-tech war. It was the first conflict watched live by millions across the world, 24/7. It was the first time that air power decisively defeated ground forces on its own. It featured a logistics build-up that exceeded WW2\u2019s D-Day. For the first time an entire nation\u2019s command and control apparatus was abruptly and effectively removed at the very start of a conflict; and the first time that stealth, standoff and precision-guided weapons were used on a mass scale. For students of military technology and art, this was effectively the first war of the 21st century.<br><br>Relive the pivotal events of the conflict that sealed the Cold War and radically changed the Middle East geopolitical landscape: The massive coalition build-up following the Iraqi invasion; The first night over Baghdad on January 17, 1991; the \u201cdo or die\u201d strike that stopped Iraq\u2019s chemical retaliation in the nick of time; the frustrating \u201cScud hunts\u201d all over the Iraqi desert; coalition attacks on Iraq\u2019s airfields; the annihilation of the Iraqi navy at Bubiyan, the \u201chighway of death\u201d during the Iraqi retreat from Kuwait, and much more. Additionally, step into the unknown as you probe the great unanswered questions of the conflict: What if Iraq had pre-empted the coalition build-up and rolled right into S.Arabia? What if Israel had retaliated for the Scud attacks against it? What if Iran or even the Soviet Union had intervened against the coalition?<br><br>\u201cCommand - Desert Storm\u201d is a DLC for Command: Modern Operations, the premier game of air, naval &amp; strategic warfare and the choice of serious hobbyists and defence professionals alike.
