{"about_the_game":"The plan was simple - the ship would wake you from your cryocapsule before you arrived at a potential new home. A planet for humanity to start a new life on. But when you awaken, you are already on the ground amongst the wreckage of your ship with no one else in sight. Stranded and surrounded only by debris, you start your journey under an unfamiliar sky.<br><br>The planet has a breathable atmosphere, which is a good start. Strangely enough, it is also already filled with plants and animals. The old seedlings from Earth must have survived the crash somehow. What happened to the ship? How long have you been frozen in cryo since your arrival? You don't have the answers, but...for now, you have more pressing concerns.
