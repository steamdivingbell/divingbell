It's just a clear and objective statement that cannot be disputed. So, since we all agree that the game is awesome, let me tell you what it's all about.<br><br>And now, the story of the gameeeeeee!<br><br>The game is set in a world full of shapes, not like our world where people walk around, but one where different shapes live, like squares, circles, and so on. You get the idea. In this world, there's a kingdom called &quot;Shapeland,&quot; which, I must admit, sounds pretty cool. I came up with the name myself. Oh, and just in case you're wondering, it's called &quot;Shapeland&quot; because of the shapes that live there.<br><br>And then into this kingdom came a little king named Six-Sided, here I'm playing with the name to say that he's so cool and has edges like sunflower seeds. Anyway, he came in and caused a lot of trouble, saying:<br><br>-&quot;Come with me if you want to live!&quot;<br><br>Or maybe that's from &quot;Terminator&quot;? Nevermind, but Six-Sided established his rules, took all the shapes and divided them up, telling the Squares to live in Squareland, the Triangles in Triangleland. He was strong and mighty, but not very smart, so he came up with strange names for everything.<br><br>The inhabitants were naturally upset:<br>-&quot;How could you do this? This is our home, we've lived here, and now you come and make all these changes.&quot;<br><br>He immediately beat up all the dissatisfied ones, explaining that he was the &quot;king&quot; and his word was law. And to keep them in check, he put his henchmen in charge, I didn't come up with names for them, but if you really want, you can call them Squarey, Triangley, Roundy, and Rectangley, not very original, but he asked for it, so now he lives with it, or rather, plays with it.<br><br>And everything would have been great for Six-Sided if it weren't for a small &quot;square&quot; named Waiter, the name is not made up either, think about it. And Waiter is not a circle, not a diamond, and not really like a square, he's kind of white, with no corners, but he jumps like a god, and has all kinds of skills, he grows twice his size, he flies, he shoots, you just need to eat the right bonus. What do you say?<br><br>You're at your computer:<br>-&quot;This is just like in Mari\u2026&quot;<br><br>Don't continue, let's keep this between you and me, these are all REFERENCES, some are big and bold, others are also cool, play the game and you'll find out.<br>Let's continue, and Waiter says:<br><br>-&quot;What's going on here in my native kingdom, who are you, I didn't invite you...&quot;<br><br>He said something else, but it wasn't clear, so I didn't write it down, let's skip that part. So he decided to beat up everyone, enemies, bosses, and even Six-Sided, and probably the inhabitants too, this Waiter is a tough guy, and he's really fast, one swoosh he kicks one, another swoosh he kicks another. But the enemies are not stupid, they set traps, and train their bosses to be a challenge for Waiter.<br><br>Let's play and find out what happens, will Waiter succeed, or is he not cut out for platformers?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1731190/extras/\u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438_Eng.png?t=1676653138\" /><br><br>Let me try to be as objective as possible about the game's features:<br><br>- Simply amazing graphics, the first zone is just stunning - the bushes, trees, grass, and the characters' animations, have you ever seen anything like it? Well, every frame was animated by hand. But enough with the compliments, let's agree that it's cool and move on;<br>- Dynamic gameplay, this is not just some boring jumping game, you need agility and quick thinking, jump here, hit there, pick that up, shoot here, oh so cool, I envy whoever gets to play it;<br>- Did I mention the graphics already? Well, I can say it twice, who's going to stop me? And I also added some amazing effects, it looks awesome;<br>- A unique world, Vayter is an original game, not just some assets from a store. Everything was designed, drawn, and made to walk and jump just for you to enjoy. I'm so proud of it.<br><br>It sounds amazing in the description, so why don't you play it yourself? But no, it's all for you, the best of the best. And there's so much more, the sounds are perfectly chosen, each level is hand-crafted and played through hundreds of times, as they say, &quot;play and enjoy!&quot;<br><br><br>The world is huge, 20 levels - I'm not sure if you've seen that many in any game before!
