A supervolcanic eruption devastated the Earth\u2019s surface, rendering it uninhabitable. Nations now teeter on the brink of extinction relying on the Terranauts - miners sent into the hellish depths of this dying world-. Their mission: extract petroleum, crucial to sustaining humanity's essential infrastructures and survival.<br><br>It's 1988 and humanity fights on, as the Earth's state deteriorates. Your crew is part of an international group of Terranauts sent to a demilitarized neutral zone. Heading into extreme depths and braving intense radiation, heat, and shifting rock, they discover an enormous abandoned mining station and information about a massive deposit of crude oil that could fuel humanity's salvation.<br><br>But first they need to find the deposit. That means enduring conditions in the most inhospitable place known to man, while mining resources to support themselves and the remnants of mankind. The extraction must never halt, no matter the cost.  <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2924310/extras/anoxia_01.gif?t=1738324608\" /><br><strong>Mining Beyond the Extreme</strong><br>Your goal is to rip apart the dark depths of  Earth, producing resources to keep your workers alive and humanity surviving another day.
