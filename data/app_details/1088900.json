{"about_the_game":"* Flying Slime ! Developer\u2019s Game Description<br />\r\n<br />\r\n Hello, we\u2019re SHB Soft.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n Flying Slime! is a 2D Platform Game that moves Slime to  the target point through mouse manipulation(Drag the mouse like a bow and fire). <br />\r\n It can be played in Windows and only supports single play.<br />\r\n In Flying Slime! we tried to provide users with cute pixel graphics and tranquil sound. <br />\r\n But unlike the cute image, it is a difficult game and requires high concentration and control. <br />\r\n Even users who are confident in mouse control will find it difficult, and later in the game, they will start to feel pain their fingers. <br />\r\n We tried to provide users with a difficult challenge while also providing them with a high sense of accomplishment and fun. <br />\r\n <br />\r\n Flying Slime! has four stages in spring, summer, fall, and winter. Each stage is made up of 20 sectors. <br />\r\n The image graphics and sounds of each stage are configured to the concept of that stage, and of course, as the stage moves on, the difficulty increases.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n We hope it will be an interesting experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n <br />\r\n<br />\r\n Thank you.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1088900/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1561141084","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1088900/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1561141084","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1088900/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1561141084","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1088900/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1561141084","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"* Flying Slime !
