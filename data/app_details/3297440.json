{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Wooden man is a traditional Chinese folk game that emphasizes the ability to make people move still. This kind of 'wooden man' game is like a few children gathered together, muttering words with their mouths: one. Two. Three. We are all wooden people, no talking, no moving. &quot;Then we pose and stop moving. Whoever can hold on until the end is the winner. Although I have never won, I always enjoy it endlessly.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The background and plot of the game mainly revolve around the cultivation of children's interaction and rule awareness. Through games, children learn how to act according to rules and also exercise self-control. The game's strategy includes how to tease the &quot;wooden man&quot; and how to keep oneself still, which increases the fun and challenge of the game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Firstly, establish a starting point and an ending point. A person is blindfolded and called 123. At this time, others can take action and reach the finish line as soon as possible. The person who reaches the finish line can move freely. Otherwise, when the blindfolded person is called a wooden man, when he turns around, he will see that others cannot move until he turns back and blindfolds again. If it moves, this person will be eliminated. There is a nursery rhyme that reflects the rules of the game: &quot;We are all wooden people. We cannot say, laugh, move, or scream. We are all wooden people. Let's see who does the best</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">1. Let's all be wooden people, no talking, no moving, no walking, no laughing</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">2. After completing the password, immediately maintain a stationary state, regardless of the original posture, and keep still.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">3. If someone can't help but speak, laugh, or act first, then that person is a game loser. Others can punish him by hitting his palm and issuing a command: &quot;Why are you bullying us wooden people? Wooden people don't speak</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">4. Then start the next round of wooden man swimming\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This is a puzzle game of the fantasy and horror genre, which uses puzzle solving mechanisms to create the stimulating feelings that players want. The background is set in a closed space where a mysterious wooden figure appears in front of you. Only by knocking him down and running away without him noticing you can you achieve ultimate victory. When you turn around, you must not move.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As the plot progresses, a big demon will eventually appear on the map, and the wooden man must save his own big demon. Players must defeat all the despicable wooden figures. Only by defeating the great demon can we save the world!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Usually, the wooden figure standing in front of the player counts numbers with his back to the player, and when 123 wooden figures finish speaking, he quickly turns around. When the wooden figure looks at the player, the player must stop all movements. If there is movement or jumping, the game will fail. The game will end and start again. The player can only move when the wooden figure in front of them is facing away from the player, so it will not be judged as a failure. When approaching the player and pressing the attack button to touch the wooden person in front of the player, the wooden person will be activated to pursue the player. Players need to quickly escape and retreat to the designated evacuation location. If you are not hit by pursuing wooden figures or machines during the escape process, you will ultimately win! After victory, the next level will be opened.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The main features of the 123 Woodman game are diverse game props and various types of NPCs that can participate in interaction. When approaching the wooden figure, there are random mechanisms that trigger or multiple random mechanisms that cut into the escape process when escaping. Surprise players slightly and increase the playability of the game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The more levels you clear, the more rewards you will receive with various props and random skills</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The biggest feature of the game is easy decompression.
