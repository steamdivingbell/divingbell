{"about_the_game":"Ruin or Victory is a modern take and evolution of the classic RTS genre with added detail, continuity, and strategic depth while remaining accessible and well-paced.  Devise your strategy, manage and expand your economy, and choose your warriors' equipment and tactics.<br><br>Adapt to the map and your opponent each game, where there are no obvious moves or simple counters.  Each mechanic is easy to use, but you will need to balance many as well as plan where to focus and how to be efficient.  Manage risk and reserve contingencies, as your enemy's strength and the outcome of every battle is uncertain, yet one mistake will not doom you.<br><br><strong>Game Modes</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tA Journey mode with a turn-based map layer in which you fight AI tribes for control of a continent.  Face strategic, tactical, and economic challenges over many games, as you build the persistent strength of your tribe through technology, units, and resources.<br></li><li>\tA scenario mode against one or more AI with settings for AI personality, difficulty, starting and maximum strength, and teams.<br></li><li>\tA quick battle mode with field, siege, and naval battles against a random AI army.<br></li><li>\tA free-build mode with no opponent and optional tutorial hints.  A complete user manual and how-to guide will be accessible in game while paused.</li></ul><br><strong>Features</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\t\tRandom map generation with different terrain, resources, and starting positions each game.  Fight on varied ground from sand to snow, in forests and swamps, and around rivers, lakes, and boulders that create natural chokepoints.  Cross the water and expand to islands in the open ocean.  Save your own custom map configuration that controls many parameters of map generation.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tWarriors are equipped with custom sets of equipment that you design.  Create armored archers or light spearmen to fend of cavalry.  Every piece of a warrior's equipment will impact their speed and combat abilities.

You will have to balance your population's growth, food production, military size, and face natural hardships such as disease and crop failure.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>    Build ships to gather fish and fight the enemy.  Crew your galleys with the warriors you trained and equipped to defeat your foes in ranged and boarding naval action.<br></li><li>\tAn AI that does not cheat, but uses all the same mechanics that the player does.  The AI will make decisions based only on what it has spotted and use various strategies and equipment to make each game different.

Various crafters make high quality items and are a strategic target, while skilled warriors take time to train but are deadly in battle.<br></li><li>\tLure and tame wild animals into domesticated animals that serve as more efficient farm and transport workers and enable the use of cavalry, but require food and training.
