{"about_the_game":"<strong>Get Nyah Home</strong>: Nyah is walking home from school when she's suddenly cast into an uncanny world where dangerous spirits linger restlessly in bottomless canyons and moonlit deserts.

Forming a telekinetic beam between them, you\u2019ll create a powerful connection that can swing Nyah to new heights, destroy barriers, thwart spirits and light the way to secret locations. Your coordination with these two characters is key, as disembodied spirits can appear without warning and hurt Nyah or her light.
