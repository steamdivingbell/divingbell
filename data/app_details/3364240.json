{"about_the_game":"Upgrade your cutscenes and visual novels with expressive characters thanks to the Galefire Characters - NPC Pack! Michael Galefire is back with a new set of 28 full body pictures to add more people for your players to interact with in your fantasy worlds. A variety of species and jobs offer up all sorts of possibilities for NPCs for your heroes to meet, from a gruff orc sailor dressed in fur-lined clothes to stave off the chill when sailing the icy Northern trading routes to a short and cheery dwarf brewmaster decked out in her favorite colorful outfit so she can head off to the beach when she closes up shop for the night. Have your heroes chat with a grinning human fishmonger, a skilled dragonborn chef armed with a holster of spices, and an elf musician to learn the latest rumors in the city, or stick to business by meeting with a serious forgemaster for some new equipment and an elf merchant who\u2019s selling mana from tanks she carries around the market square. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach image is high resolution so that you can make sure your players can see every important detail and so you can resize them to perfectly fit your game\u2019s screen size! Or shrink them down for a sudden battle if you want to give your heroes more options than just talking their way into new places. Pick up the Galefire Characters - NPC Pack and get ready to have your heroes befriend unique shopkeepers, learn new skills from armored warriors, flirt with armed troublemakers, and more!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nContents:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* 28 NPC characters<br />\r\n* covers many archetypes","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3364240/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733419431","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3364240/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1733419431","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3364240/c3c9abfd7e5e3e45381c385f495e4e626d15704d/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733419431","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3364240/c3c9abfd7e5e3e45381c385f495e4e626d15704d/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733419431","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Upgrade your cutscenes and visual novels with expressive characters thanks to the Galefire Characters - NPC Pack!
