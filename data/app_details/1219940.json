{"about_the_game":"This is the most frightening humorous game of all.

You can't even imagine the hard reality and actual state of things. Young female teachers approach an official of the leading party in the country to inform him that their salary of around $300 per month is nothing. However, he has a bit of sensible advice for them. He just tells those young teachers to find rich men to live in prosperity and forget about any problems. It turns out that being a teacher and educating new generations is not enough to have a normal level of living in Russia. Young ladies need old and rich lovers, who will satisfy all their needs and demands. <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1219940/extras/slider.png?t=1719955947\" /><br>In July 2019, forest fire covered more than 9 million hectares in the Krasnoyarsk Region in Russia (it's 70 times larger than the total area of Los Angeles).
