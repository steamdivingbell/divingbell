{"about_the_game":"In this box-by-box physics simulation, you build ships out of crates to blast enemies and carry cargo. With two modes available, work your way up from a dingy to a battleship in adventure mode or arrange a battle in the sandbox!<br><br>Build ships using an array of components with different stats and an assortment of weapons with their own strengths and weaknesses. Each box moves independently so damage to any ship will greatly affect it's performance; using the targeting feature, you can instruct your ship's hardpoints to strike critical blows. You are also able to save and load your designs into any mode, allowing you to test your adventure mode designs in sandbox battles to reveal their weaknesses. This game was designed to be very &quot;menu-light&quot;, so most interaction takes place directly with visual objects to create a smooth and simple take on the vehicular build-and-battle genre.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1774410/extras/desc_img1.png?t=1668047946\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Available Modes</h2><br><strong>1.
