These fungi and vines seem to have life, spreading and growing freely on the bodies of mechanical organisms.

Once one detects the presence of &quot;living creatures&quot; around them, they will launch a reckless charge, relying on their own mechanical strength that is still retained after being infected by fungi, and charge forward recklessly. And the attack methods are simple and crude, often using rusty and fungal limbs or weapons to fiercely smash or swing towards the target.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3390690/extras/GIF88.gif?t=1734579918\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3390690/extras/d13.gif?t=1734579918\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">3\u3001 Measures to deal with crises</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\uff081\uff09 Creative weapons and intricate traps</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The protagonist will not face many dangers barehanded, and those exquisite traps and creative weapons are his powerful helpers in dealing with enemies.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The protagonist can transform discarded firearms by piecing together the advantageous components of different firearms to create a new weapon with greater power, faster firing rate, or higher shooting accuracy. Alternatively, some special energy devices can be used to attach energy blades to melee weapons, allowing them to not only inflict physical damage but also carry energy impact during attacks, enhancing their lethality.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Exquisite traps and creative weapons play a crucial role in combating enemies and protecting one's own safety.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3390690/extras/201.gif?t=1734579918\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\uff082\uff09 Drive the mecha deep into the tiger's den</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When ordinary means are unable to cope with more difficult situations, the protagonist will choose to control mecha creatures and head towards the depths of the infected area.

You can even modify everything in the game and share it with other players.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In terms of prop mods, players can add various novel props, equipment, or weapons. For example, in a swamp area filled with radiation, designing a firearm that can absorb radiation energy and convert it into attack power gives players an advantage in dealing with dangerous creatures there. Or create a device that can instantly clear a safe area, allowing players to have a brief respite and change the battle situation when surrounded by numerous enemies.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3390690/extras/bc1d36dda3cc7cd9a08f0f8b2e01213fb90e9177.jpg?t=1734579918\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Map mods can open up new exploration spaces for games. Players may create an underground world map filled with high-tech relics, containing various advanced technologies waiting to be discovered and unlocked, greatly enriching the exploration content of the game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There are also character mods that can change the appearance, abilities, and skills of game characters. Players can transform the appearance of the protagonist's cyborg into a classic mecha warrior from science fiction movies, not only making the appearance cooler, but also endowing it with new special skills.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3390690/extras/41.gif?t=1734579918\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3390690/extras/42.gif?t=1734579918\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Functional enhancement MODs should not be underestimated, such as improving the game UI to make operations more convenient and the interface more beautiful, enhancing the overall gaming experience.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In short, homemade mods allow every player to become a &quot;creator&quot; of the game, creating their own unique wasteland world and enjoying different gaming pleasures.
