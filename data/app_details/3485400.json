{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Would you like to experience how books were once printed? Take the role of a printer as you are guided step-by-step through printing on a 19th-century cast iron printing press. The printing press you will operate is a virtual reproduction of one owned by William Morris (1834\u20131896), who used it to print <i>The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer</i> (1896) for his Kelmscott Press. The \u201cKelmscott Chaucer,\u201d as it is more commonly known, is one of the most beautiful books ever produced, and you will print its title page. The printing press was later owned by type designer Frederic Goudy (1865\u20131947). The press\u2019s association with Morris and Goudy led it to be nicknamed the Kelmscott/Goudy Press.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Kelmscott/Goudy Press now lives an active life at the Cary Graphic Arts Collection at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT).
