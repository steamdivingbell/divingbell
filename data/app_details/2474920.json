{"about_the_game":"Battle 3D - Zombie Edition is a military strategy game with lots of units, spectacular scenery, advanced artificial intelligence and more fun than ever:<br />\r\nNow dead soldiers turn into zombies that attack your soldiers, they are faster and more resistant, but need to be close to attack. As a group they are very dangerous.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main feature of this game is that you can handle the battle from above or handle the unit you want whenever you want.<br />\r\nThis is what we had always dreamed of doing in strategy games, entering the battle in the first person with the unity you want.<br />\r\nIn addition, if you handle the unit, it is more resistant and shoots faster, so in some missions it is convenient to handle it to pass the mission.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSeveral types of battles:<br />\r\n-Big battles with hundreds of units: You will have to try to place your armies so that everyone shoots at the enemy, trying to make the enemy only fire with few units.<br />\r\n-Battles for control of industrial areas: Factories produce units every so often, you have to defend yours and conquer those of the enemy before enemy makes a large army.<br />\r\n-Nuclear battles: Destroy tank armies by launching the atomic bomb in the right place.<br />\r\nIn other missions the enemy has the bomb, move your army to minimize the damage of a nuclear attack.<br />\r\n-Soldier battles, where aiming is the most important. Use sniper mode to kill enemy soldiers from afar.<br />\r\n-Aerial battles between aircrafts, helicopters and anti-aircraft.<br />\r\n-Even naval combat, and aircraft carriers that you can fill with zombies and send helicopter troops to recapture them.<br />\r\n-Switch sides and control the zombies!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWide variety of scenarios: Cliffs, mountains, lakes, cities, deserts, plains, oceans.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMission editor where you can create your own battles by selecting number of units, zombies, battle scenario, atomic bombs available on each side, number of factories ...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn missions created with mission editor, you can also add units directly to the battlefield with a dropdown menu.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll this makes Battle 3D - Zombie Edition an essential game for strategy lovers, don't wait any longer and play it now!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2474920/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1689756218","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2474920/page.bg.jpg?t=1689756218","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2474920/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1689756218","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2474920/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1689756218","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Battle 3D - Zombie Edition is a military strategy game with lots of units, spectacular scenery, advanced artificial intelligence and more fun than ever:<br />\r\nNow dead soldiers turn into zombies that attack your soldiers, they are faster and more resistant, but need to be close to attack.
