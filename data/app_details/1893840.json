{"about_the_game":"<strong><br>When you purchase this DLC, you get access to the developer room in the game, in which all game mechanics were tested and not only. You will also be able to examine in detail each model from the original game, find various concepts that we used when creating the game and much more.</strong><br><br>This game is a psychological horror in which the main character wakes up in an unfamiliar house and must pass all the levels by solving puzzles. Puzzles are miniature tests of finding objects and comparing facts to solve the main problem - opening the door leading to the next level, deeper into the ground and the depths of the character's consciousness. At the same time, the player will be frightened by frightening sounds and an oppressive atmosphere.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1893840/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1672448752","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1893840/page.bg.jpg?t=1672448752","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1893840/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1672448752","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1893840/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1672448752","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong><br>When you purchase this DLC, you get access to the developer room in the game, in which all game mechanics were tested and not only.
