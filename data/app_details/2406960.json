{"about_the_game":"Yugowave is an art installation where the viewer moves through a dystopian, abandoned, industrial virtual space in which there are TV screens where music videos from the '70s-'80s Yugoslavia are playing. These products of pop culture are a part of the collective memory and nostalgia for &quot;carefree times&quot; and contrast not only with the apocalyptic space itself, but also with the sound material: the space is reactive, and passing through certain spaces the visitor hears real audio inserts from the Yugoslav wars, which testify to realities of war horrors (speeches of politicians, generals, testimonies of civilians).<br><br>The time required to tour the entire virtual installation is 15-20 minutes.<br><br>Combining vivid fragments from Yugoslav popular culture with documentary testimonies from the war, this work shows that in addition to civilians and soldiers, it\u2019s also culture, music, film, literature, and everything that makes the life and the identity of the people, that also perishes.
