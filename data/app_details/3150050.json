One day, the main character starts having strange dreams every night. In his dreams, bizarre dolls chase him, the cozy attic he used as a childhood hideout becomes too big to see in real life, and other unrealistic things happen.<br><br>Players must step into the protagonist's shoes and move back and forth between dream and reality to find out why they're having these dreams and why these bizarre things are happening. The dream world is governed by different rules than waking life, and places and objects appear with a twist based on the protagonist's childhood memories and feelings. These unrealistic elements are related to secrets hidden deep within the protagonist's mind.<br><br>The player must solve various puzzles, collect clues, and progress through the story. The main character's companion, a cute teddy bear, plays an important role. Teddy is not just a toy, but a friend who has been with the protagonist since he was a child and helps him in his dream world. Teddy can give you hints or protect you in dangerous situations.<br><br>The atmosphere of the game is unique, combining cozy fairytale elements with a bizarre and spooky atmosphere. The visuals and sound design also effectively convey these two moods, making the player feel tense as they progress through the game, straddling the line between dream and reality.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3150050/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724864761","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3150050/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1724864761","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3150050/79cef58c4edec3b2c6fddce02f1bf080f606885b/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724864761","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3150050/79cef58c4edec3b2c6fddce02f1bf080f606885b/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724864761","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3150050/extras/Scene_GIF.gif?t=1724864761\" /><br><br><i>Goodnight, Sweetie Share your childhood memories with us</i><br><br><br>The game tells a mysterious and creepy story that takes place when the main character starts having strange dreams.
