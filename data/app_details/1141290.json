medals which can then be spent to make your character stronger in ANY of the towers, contributing to a &quot;meta game&quot;. So the idea is once you've gone through those twelve towers once and earned twelve medals, you can then go back and replay all of them to earn even BETTER medals, then go through them all again, so on and so forth, forever. (Some towers you can't really &quot;finish&quot; until you come back with tons of medals.
