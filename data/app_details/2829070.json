{"about_the_game":"This is a Third Person action game with real life visual effects.  You are roll playing a wolf who has the ability to sneak up to or past enemies, attack them,  or howl for back up from other wolves in the forest.  Your wolf cubs have been captured by hunters.  To free them, you must follow the dirt path and successfully complete all the levels of the game.  As you go along the path in each level, you can either sneak past the hunters or attack them alone or with your allied wolves.  Be careful as the hunters can shoot and kill you which will require you to restart that level.  You will know you have successfully passed a level when your screen pauses temporarily.   Each level is more challenging with more hunters and other enemies crossing your path.  At the last level you will see your cubs in a cage.  You must kill all the hunters that are holding your cubs in the last level before they can be released from the cage.   The goal of the game is to free your cubs.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"The Pack Is Back","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2829070/36de8162e60fdea63e6e1cab35b06d34547cdc59.jpg"}],"total":1},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2829070/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1709214309","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2829070/page.bg.jpg?t=1709214309","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2829070/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1709214309","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2829070/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1709214309","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This is a Third Person action game with real life visual effects.
