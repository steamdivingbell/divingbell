{"about_the_game":"In the not-so-distant future, robots have become integral to the day-to-day lives of humans while also observing and recording everything they see into their encrypted memory banks. The player is the newest addition to the Robot Forensics Division, deployed to different locations to assist the authorities with solving crimes. Based on the characteristics of classic mystery novels and stories such as Nancy Drew, Sherlock Holmes, and Clue, the player must decrypt a robot\u2019s robot\u2019s last memory in the form of a single snapshot. In the world in which MoriA.I.RTy takes place, technology has advanced to the point where forensics specialists no longer have to examine a physical crime scene to solve a mystery. Instead, they can utilize the memory snapshots of any household robot by decrypting the last image viewed and recorded. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn each scenario, the player must scroll through a robot\u2019s memory bank to piece together a visual story and solve the mystery of what happened. The snapshot features variables generated by machine learning. Along with the snapshot, the detective can also interview witnesses to the crime through branching text dialogue to collect variables and deduce who is telling the truth or who is lying.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile generating a copy of the robot\u2019s last memory snapshot on one part of the screen, the player must also complete the descriptive narrative of the crime by filling in blanks, similar to a Mad Lib. The player guesses the variables by selecting from a dropdown list of possibilities they collect from interviewing the witnesses. Each time the player guesses a variable or series of variables, the A.I. generates a new image incorporating those details to either further clarify the image or show the player new and helpful clues.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3074070/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724491475","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3074070/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1724491475","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3074070/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724491475","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3074070/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724491475","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In the not-so-distant future, robots have become integral to the day-to-day lives of humans while also observing and recording everything they see into their encrypted memory banks.
