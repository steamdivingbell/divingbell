{"about_the_game":"<strong><i>Anandala</i></strong> is not a game. Anandala is an interactive virtual reality art experience where you explore a vast labyrinth of ever-changing, psychoactive abstract art. Fly, as if in a dream, through this psychedelic world in the sky, where complex shapes and colors flow and evolve over every surface.<br><br><strong>Encounter the Blorts</strong>, the curious and expressive artificial lifeforms that inhabit Anandala. Inspired by research in neuroscience and artificial-life, these intelligent beings interact with you and each other through mesmerizing movement, changing color textures, and their own musical language. Some Blorts can even bestow visions of mystical symbols. Experience the surprising emergent behavior of 130 unique, autonomous, living artworks that are aware of themselves, each other, and you. <br><br><strong>Unwind and explore:</strong> Anandala offers a rejuvenating refuge from reality. Explore at your own pace and immerse your mind in a calming musical soundscape as you discover an awe-inspiring world of evolving beauty and wonder and commune with its unusual inhabitants. The ever-evolving textures and original ambient music provide a hypnotic source of brainwave entrainment to support presence, relaxation, and transcendent states.<br><br><strong>Portals and Sky Shrine:</strong> Within the labyrinth of Anandala, there are 12 portals of varying shapes. Moving through them will transport you to different areas of the labyrinth, and can transform the textures, colors, and lighting in the world. One special portal, located near the highest point in the labyrinth, will teleport you beyond the labyrinth to the Sky Shrine, where you can commune with the chanting High Priests of The Five Sacred Shapes and The Five Colossal Blort Deities. The golden rings around the rim of the Shrine are also portals that will transport you back to various locations in the labyrinth.<br><br><strong>The freedom of natural flight:</strong> Explore Anandala using an intuitive, physics-based flight system that makes flying simple and comfortable even for most motion-sensitive people. Point the controllers in the direction you want to go and gently squeeze the triggers (For Valve Index controllers, squeeze the grips). Squeeze a little to go slow, more to go faster (Just like an accelerator pedal). Use either controller or combine them for greater speed and maneuverability. To turn, simply turn your body, or use the right joystick/thumbpad for snap turns like in VRChat. <br><br><strong>Converse with the Blorts:</strong> You can speak to the Blorts in their own language.<br>Aim  your controller at the Blort you wish to speak with and press the appropriate button for your controller type.<br>\u200bPress once for each syllable.
