{"about_the_game":"Idle Chess Story is a strategy game with fun decisions.  Players take on enemy AI Players in a gauntlet where the goal is to reach the highest amount of rounds possible. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the shopping phase, you chose what units you want to buy and place on the chess board, then, during the fighting phase, your units fight against enemy units to the death. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe player with the last unit surviving wins the duel and is rewarded a hefty gold bounty. Careful with losing too many units! Reach 0 HP and the game is over. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery unit belongs to two tribes. Gather enough units of the same tribe and unlock powerful bonuses for your allies. Having 3 or 6 units of the same tribe is enough to unlock the bonuses.  Use your gold wisely on units of the same type to quickly attain these bonuses to take control over your enemy.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"On Your Way Up!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1067110/36ff58a43a66a7e9d39d48e80b61fb19b3834d70.jpg"},{"name":"Rookie","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1067110/d3a44059c4cd210bc530a72c6d6de753d6b4c15e.jpg"},{"name":"Pawn","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1067110/8a965f7d97047bac5fbf48dcf13121fc8870c525.jpg"},{"name":"Knight","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1067110/9f7a2f2491874fabe22dfd0a6807ad9574bbe0d9.jpg"},{"name":"Bishop","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1067110/c400f3b47ae970b9e9aca5b86f78979226d217d4.jpg"},{"name":"Rook","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1067110/c4d09b8339badd090d7d9a0541be63a05b18f772.jpg"},{"name":"Queen","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1067110/5dc6f4458f4c3522b64fca94bd65d7815ae811fb.jpg"},{"name":"King","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1067110/a8c17062fade8392f23a1db153d138816d29d29a.jpg"},{"name":"Warriors","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1067110/690ce0dc72a117e2c184308d5fa7cd58f5c845b0.jpg"},{"name":"Wizards","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1067110/8c1765cffccdd6f679399ac7391113189fd1213e.jpg"}],"total":19},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1067110/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1564719081","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1067110/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1564719081","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1067110/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1564719081","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1067110/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1564719081","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Idle Chess Story is a strategy game with fun decisions.
