{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">ATTENTION: THIS GAME REQUIRES HIGH-SPEED CONTROLLER TRACKING</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Unfortunately, Steam removed some VR compatibility indicators, so we have to put it plainly here: Rainbow Reactor uses extremely accurate physics that only work with high-speed controller tracking.
