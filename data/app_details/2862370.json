{"about_the_game":"\u201cThe Milliner\u201d is a noir gunslinging metroidvania set in the oppressive and broken world of Anfransone. Explore a handcrafted, interconnected world full of mystery and melancholy, from crumbling cities to eldritch asylums. Engage in fast-paced combat that\u2019s tightly interwoven with slick movement, where guns are as important for traversal as they are for combat. Unlock game-changing abilities as you delve deeper into Anfransone, each uniquely recontextualizing how you play.
