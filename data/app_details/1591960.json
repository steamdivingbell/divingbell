My buddy Randy (aka 3D BLAST), a popular figure in the vaporwave music scene, was hosting the #3DBLASTisOverParty, a roast-style Twitch stream where viewers would submit tongue-in-cheek videos or songs to \u201ccancel\u201d Randy once and for all.<br><br>At the time I was looking to experiment further with Unreal Engine and saw Randy\u2019s stream as the perfect opportunity for some mischief. With only two weeks until the submission deadline, I had the idea to create a parody of a first person shooter game. . I found a basic UE4 template with simple mechanics and crude sprites that were perfect for some silly photoshopping! My initial photoshops weren\u2019t too great, so I commissioned a talented sprite artist named Atina to create custom Randy enemy designs and environment sprites that set the tone. My concept: \u201cCanceling Randy isn\u2019t enough. He has to die!\u201d<br><br>The date of Randy\u2019s stream ended up getting pushed back significantly. Originally, I planned only to submit a brief video capture of the gameplay, but I saw the extended timeframe as a challenge and pushed myself to make Randy Blaster 3D fully playable.<br><br>In this early version, the player objective was to fight through Randy\u2019s evil minions and gather his \u201cvinyl records of power\u201d to unlock new areas, eventually leading to the final boss: Randy himself. The platforming grew more intense in later levels as larger swarms of enemies pursued the player. The climax was a showdown with Randy himself! Easter egg cameos from vaporwave artists added surprise and flair. There was even a speedrun timer for competition with friends.<br><br>On stream day, it all hit me. I had created a complete, albeit short, retro FPS in just one month! To make things even more chaotic, the stream aired while I was moving from Virginia to California, and I caught the broadcast from an Oklahoma City hotel. The trailer (parodying a vintage Doom ad courtesy of our pal Discoholic) kicked things off strong. When Randy revealed the game was available for download, chat went wild! Randy played the game on stream for hours as viewers cheered on the zany carnage. This early version of Randy Blaster 3D still lives on itch.io as \u201cThe Bootleg Version.\u201d<br><br>I pondered where to take things next. I adored the mechanics and wanted to bring Randy Blaster 3D to Steam, but this brief story mode didn\u2019t seem substantial enough for a Steam release. After contemplation, I settled on creating a wave-based survival mode to add tons of replayability.<br><br>What followed was an explosion of new features over months of passionate work.
