After your shift has ended you try to use the elevator, leave the building and head home. Unfortunately this does not seem to be easy because you find yourself in an endless loop and end up returning to the 9th floor. To reach a lower floor you need to identify random anomalies and use the correct elevator to descent. Are you able to escape this horrible night shift or will something happen to you? </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Golden Retreat is basically a first person walking simulator where you have to <strong>identify anomalies</strong> to proceed. Although you can interact with some objects, it's not necessary to find things that have changed.  </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Play Time</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">30-60 minutes  </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you progress you discover more and more anomalies that fill up your collection.
