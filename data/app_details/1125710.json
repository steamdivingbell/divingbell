{"about_the_game":"Gatewalkers is a unique mixture of cooperative game, survival and RPG. You, as a Gatewalkers, travel across different worlds in order to save your own. Explore procedurally generated worlds, face hostile inhabitants, face challenges like extreme weather conditions, toxic atmosphere, lack of water and more.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TEAM CO-OP</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1125710/extras/Team_Coop-600x200.gif?t=1700567461\" /><br>As a Gatewalker, one of the chosen few, you can go through the Gate and explore the worlds that lay on the other side. Team up with up to 3 other players in this team-based survival. Fight terrifying monsters, survive extreme weather conditions, follow the orders given by the Guild, and most importantly, stay alive!<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1125710/extras/Ancient_Constraction-600x200.gif?t=1700567461\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WORLD EXPLORATION</h2> <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1125710/extras/World_Exploration-600x200.gif?t=1700567461\" /><br>Explore the procedurally generated worlds with unique terrain features, plants, and creatures. Discover new resources and crafting materials. Face various environmental hazards: toxic or unbreathable atmosphere, terrifying darkness, penetrating cold, and much more. Each world type introduces a unique survival mechanic that forces you to adapt. Finding food, water or wood to start a fire may be impossible. Consider carefully what to bring with you on the expedition, as no one really knows what  awaits on the other side of the Gate.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TEAM SURVIVAL</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1125710/extras/Team_Survival-600x200.gif?t=1700567461\" /><br>Surviving alone in an unknown world is really hard. But with teammates at your side, you at least stand a chance. Share the responsibilities: start a fire to let others warm up, build a tent to let your mates rest, warn them about the dangers lurking in the night. The key to surviving is cooperation between you and your team.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SKILL BASED COMBAT</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1125710/extras/Skill-based_Combat-600x200.gif?t=1700567461\" /><br>Isometric skill-based combat without auto targeting. Your skills may miss, and you can dodge enemy attacks! Good positioning during combat, balanced use of skills, proper timing and team synergy are all crucial to victory.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CRAFTING</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1125710/extras/Crafting-600x200.gif?t=1700567461\" /><br>Choose an item to craft. Discover the appropriate recipe. Raid different worlds to gather required resources. Find or create a crafting station. Finally, build the item and use it!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">YOU ARE WHAT YOU WEAR</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1125710/extras/You_are_what_you_wear-600x200.gif?t=1700567461\" /><br>There are no predefined character classes. Each item gives you a unique set of skills, so try tinkering with different builds. Take heavy armor and a healing staff to support your mates in the front line by tanking and restoring health. Remember, you are, what you wear!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PROCEDURALLY GENERATED WORLDS</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1125710/extras/Procedural_Worlds_Generation-600x200.gif?t=1700567461\" /><br>Each time you pass the Gate you will land in a different, procedurally generated world. This gives you countless opportunities, offers constant challenges, and forces you to adapt in order to win in changing conditions! Always stay cautious, modify your strategy, make fast decisions and face their consequences, because you never know what waits around the corner.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Become a Gatewalker","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1125710/69cfd97e4513197878247826de7328565d4cb220.jpg"},{"name":"Hidden truth","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1125710/0a38cb3aad8323dde902e7d146dfdaa9e74f68d8.jpg"},{"name":"Fighting for life","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1125710/84ed148f7ae7c7e129b31356de50ca2e1de9fc75.jpg"},{"name":"New hope","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1125710/0772bfd7f298fafd7aed2e66156f734613e8afba.jpg"},{"name":"Final clash","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1125710/6aba3999b81765a1832c6196107f84457a375017.jpg"},{"name":"Ancient's Junk Collector","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1125710/61dc8bd0fbf7769df914a5d54fddb8c3a385393a.jpg"},{"name":"Ancient's Probe Constructor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1125710/a28c15944936e6d9ab48fd0669772e29cb96f513.jpg"},{"name":"Ancient's Puzzle Solver","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1125710/0885963da01c96c82df703833947d911085fc18f.jpg"},{"name":"Ancient's Creatures Killer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1125710/b80069d439f158999ad8ece59e16cf6bb38fbb15.jpg"},{"name":"Ancient's Machines Tamer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1125710/6e48d99545d3c30b0937419524d7f9880843ded0.jpg"}],"total":40},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1125710/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1700567461","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1125710/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1700567461","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1125710/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1700567461","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1125710/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1700567461","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Only when fighting mobs."},"demos":[{"appid":1527990,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<h1>Special message from the Gatewalkers team</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1125710/extras/AddUsToWishlist-600x150.gif?t=1700567461\" /></p><br><h1>Feature List</h1><p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Team Co-op - team up with up to 4 players, fight terrifying monsters, survive extreme weather conditions and stay alive!<br></li><li>World exploration - each world type introduces a unique survival mechanic that forces  players to adapt<br></li><li>Team survival - share the responsibilities, surviving is easier together than alone<br></li><li>Skill based combat - no target system: all of the skills may be missed<br></li><li>Crafting - choose an item, get the materials and appropriate recipe in order to build it<br></li><li>You are what you wear - there are no character-classes, (with your clothing) you (can) decide what your strategy will be<br></li><li>Procedural worlds generation - you never know what will happen after you cross the Gate...</li></ul></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Gatewalkers is a unique mixture of cooperative game, survival and RPG.
