{"about_the_game":"Error Found is a genre-redefining psychological-horror game that takes the place of a normal clicker game. When a seemingly normal clicker game gets hijacked by a character, players are forced to search for the truth within the game and make decisions that will forever impact their gameplay. Players and characters struggle to find what is real as the line between the game world and the real world becomes infinitely thin. Error Found creates an unforgettable replaying experience. With diverse endings and stories that depend on your own actions, Error Found is unforgettable.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2093750/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1660348526","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2093750/page.bg.jpg?t=1660348526","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2093750/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1660348526","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2093750/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1660348526","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Gameplay includes adult topics such as suicide, drug abuse, and alcohol abuse.
