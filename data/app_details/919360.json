{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In <i>Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms</i>, the fate of a land ravaged by ancient rivalries and dark forces lies in your hands. Step into the beautifully brutal world of Plamen, a realm divided among  kingdoms, each with its own unique cultures, mysteries, and conflicts. Guided by tales of honor and vengeance, you take on the role of a mighty champion, forging your path to glory and fighting to withstand the ever-growing corruption of Alaloth, a malevolent god imprisoned in the mortal realm.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/919360/extras/game_world.png?t=1734545266\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The vast, fully explorable world of Plamen awaits, a realm of sprawling kingdoms and wild frontiers, each filled with unique inhabitants and dangers at every turn. Journey through lush forests, towering mountains, and barren wastelands where the four distinct races have carved out their own domains, each with complex histories and turbulent relationships. Alongside warriors and rogues, you\u2019ll encounter powerful mages who have honed their skills across diverse schools, from elemental mages wielding fire and lightning to necromancers drawing power from dark realms. As you venture deeper, prepare to face deadly mobs and legendary beasts twisted by Alaloth\u2019s corruption, their very existence a test of your skill and strategy. Everywhere you go, ancient ruins, sacred sites, and thriving cities offer stories waiting to unfold tales of lost civilizations, epic rivalries, and secrets guarded for centuries. Each region brims with lore, quests, and characters that reveal the layered history of Plamen, creating an unforgettable experience in a world where every decision shapes your journey.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/919360/extras/plamenupdated.jpg?t=1734545266\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/919360/extras/combat_system.png?t=1734545266\" /> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A hardcore combat system combines with a brand-new isometric gameplay, featuring spectacular moves in challenging fights against various enemies.
