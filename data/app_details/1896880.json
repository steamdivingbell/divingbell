It's a truly unique experience, twisting genres and building on its own mechanics to create an experience that is both incredibly satisfying and near-impossible to put down. It's one of the best puzzle games on the Switch, and easily in the top ten on PC and mobile too.\u201d<br>9/10 \u2013 vooks<br><br>\u201cDungeons of Dreadrock is a well-designed puzzle game that cleverly builds on its formula throughout its brief run. Gameplay has been compared to a dungeon crawler, but this is really a puzzle game with swords \u2018n\u2019 sorcery set dressing.\u201d<br>8/10 \u2013 nintendolife<br><br>\u201cI really enjoyed Dungeons of Dreadrock, because it's a game that knows exactly the experience it is trying to deliver and does so expertly. There are 100 levels of puzzles, all unique, with mechanics and solutions that ramp as your character progresses deeper and deeper into the mountain, while delivering on a cute storyline with clever 32-bit animation.\u201d<br>9/10 \u2013 gamingnexus<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1896880/ss_152e17fe94f904b1adca625b0def913e07736721.1920x1080.jpg?t=1728475090","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1896880/ss_152e17fe94f904b1adca625b0def913e07736721.600x338.jpg?t=1728475090"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1896880/ss_800ebc047bf36d4df1a455b95509ff45d603dac7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1728475090","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1896880/ss_800ebc047bf36d4df1a455b95509ff45d603dac7.600x338.jpg?t=1728475090"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1896880/ss_8637198b75e3b8e8c058e8a49d54877d23043bb2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1728475090","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1896880/ss_8637198b75e3b8e8c058e8a49d54877d23043bb2.600x338.jpg?t=1728475090"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1896880/ss_f8ae2093e46a45d0a1d9bb5d84a4347c81a9a858.1920x1080.jpg?t=1728475090","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1896880/ss_f8ae2093e46a45d0a1d9bb5d84a4347c81a9a858.600x338.jpg?t=1728475090"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1896880/ss_d4ec19f03aad080c2dfb6f59c159bd7d63969d6e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1728475090","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1896880/ss_d4ec19f03aad080c2dfb6f59c159bd7d63969d6e.600x338.jpg?t=1728475090"}],"short_description":"An immersive puzzle dungeon adventure in the spirit of 1980's home computer games.
