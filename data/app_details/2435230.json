{"about_the_game":"Your name is Arlo, Arlo P. Barnaby. You and a crew of sixty other Miners are sent out to the outer reaches of the solar system and stationed on an obscure desolate moon for the next six months to mine for valuable moon rock deposits. While mining, you and your crew unearths an ancient evil and it awakens to wreaks havoc upon the living! Scared and alone you barricade yourself inside of your living quarters and hide from the evil for days. When you realize it is either you make an escape attempt or wait to die, that is when you venture out into the abyss of evil to save yourself!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Single Player-Action-2D Platformer!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Reminiscent of those games that used to be played on those 8 bit consoles of yesteryear!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Three different weapons to utilize! (blast rifle, bolt shot, super missile)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Nine different levels, featuring six different boss fights!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* One epic escape attempt!!!!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n***For best playing experience use wired-USB, NES style controller!!!! You can also use the keyboard, but I highly recommend a NES style controller. For some reason XBOX and PlayStation type controllers with a lot of different buttons doesn't map out correctly. Feel free to experiment though!!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n***Also game might not play in &quot;Full Screen&quot; mode. You might have to play it in &quot;Windowed&quot; mode. Then just maximize the window to fill your monitor's screen.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2435230/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1685841882","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2435230/page.bg.jpg?t=1685841882","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2435230/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1685841882","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2435230/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1685841882","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Your name is Arlo, Arlo P.
