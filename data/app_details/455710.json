Ahead of you is a dirt path, so you follow it. You walk right into a village. You look around and inquire if anyone can help you, but no one is interested in assisting unless you have copper to pay them in return. You go and talk to the ammunition dealer, and he makes you a deal. If you can complete a series of risky quests for him, he will pay you for them individually.
