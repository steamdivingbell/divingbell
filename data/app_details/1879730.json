{"about_the_game":"Notice!  This program is made for boaters !<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis program is an advanced radar simulator, mainly intended to be used in Screen Mode. The PC screen is divided into 3 windows.Radar window, Map window and a Visual window. The program is operated with a mouse in Screen Mode.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe radar simulates a rotating antenna that &quot;scans&quot; a 3-dimensional map (the surroundings you see in the Visual window), and creates a realistic radar image&quot;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThen it is necessary to interpret what you see on the radar screen. Are there land, boats buoys or other objects shown? This interpretation comes with experience and this is what you can get by using this simulator.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour position is shown on the Map window, and in the Visual window you see the surroundings. Compare this with what you see on the radar screen, and eventually you will interpret the radar image correctly and trust what you see there. Then you will feel safer sailing at night and in poor visibility.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith this simulator, you can also practice night sailing where you have to identify beacons and light buoys (characteristics and sectors) so that you can verify your position. You will also see the other boats' navigation lanterns.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis program is a useful aid for those who want to practice basic navigation, and for those who participate in courses to obtain a certificate for boats less than 24m (D5L).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVR Mode is an add-on for those who have a VR headset and would like to see how it works. You must have an Xbox controller to operate the boat and instruments in VR Mode (if not - you will select to run in Auto-mode).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou will find a comprehensive and detailed user manual on our website -&gt; https://www.enavsim.com","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1879730/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1698312215","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1879730/page.bg.jpg?t=1698312215","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1879730/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1698312215","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1879730/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1698312215","categories":[{"description":"VR Supported","id":53},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Notice!
