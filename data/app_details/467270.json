{"about_the_game":"Weaves of Fate is a unique and epic blend of isometric role playing and tactical strategy. In the far future, a demonic invasion throughout all of time has been triggered as a result of humanity\u2019s actions. With the timeline shattered and paradoxes cropping up, the game follows multiple characters in different time periods as they deal with the resulting challenges and conflicts. As fate\u2019s weaves fall apart and the timeline fractures, the incarnations of reality decide to intervene. To preserve fate and destiny, Death himself must become mortal and enter the human realm to fix things.<br><br><strong>Key Features</strong><br>- Level-up system: Make your heroes more powerful by upgrading their stats or unlocking new abilities and spells for them to use in battle.<br>- Replayability: Replay levels for a better rating and extra upgrade points to spend on making heroes more powerful.<br>- Powerful abilities: Teleport your character around the battlefield and obliterate enemies with powerful spells.<br>- Deep and engaging story, spanning across multiple characters and time periods.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Loyalty to the Kingdom","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/467270/1ed5363b4cc103298b7ac41c3a69443480af8a7b.jpg"},{"name":"The Sorceress","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/467270/ca8f79661a0f337dbed4ec00083dc3912439d388.jpg"},{"name":"The Wizard of Old","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/467270/39656e88f311b6d6993c3464524dc24e4410c2ba.jpg"},{"name":"The Thief of Templar Relics","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/467270/60bb60aac5b02c4d21b883451a29937fbe75c76f.jpg"},{"name":"CHAPTER 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/467270/72527bebc3045282c985b8a9b8cd2fd0a5aa43a0.jpg"},{"name":"CHAPTER 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/467270/0b1ab069252bc494e3db188388a8e2f4e1beb1cd.jpg"},{"name":"THE END","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/467270/7297d71af23f99e63851bb446925282c09450e16.jpg"}],"total":7},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/467270/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1653766057","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/467270/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1653766057","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/467270/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1653766057","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/467270/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1653766057","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Weaves of Fate is a unique and epic blend of isometric role playing and tactical strategy.
