{"about_the_game":"You are a soldier who opens his eyes in the middle of darkness. The castle you are obliged to protect is completely buried in corruption, fear has penetrated into you by a creature you have not seen before and you have become unable to even see. While everything was normal a few hours ago, now you don't understand how all this happened. Despite the pressure on you, you have to look ahead and fulfill your duty.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNOREN is a simple key finder game. The map of the game consists of several different regions and some of these regions have special game mechanics except for finding keys. Some features trigger each other so you have to guess the correct sequence of actions. Any changes you make will affect the end of the game. Despite the creatures scattered around, you have to do all of this in a dark atmosphere, with the lantern that slowly fades out, and keep your sanity.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1595270/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1619169143","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1595270/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1619169143","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1595270/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1619169143","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1595270/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1619169143","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You are a soldier who opens his eyes in the middle of darkness.
