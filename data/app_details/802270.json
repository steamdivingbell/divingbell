{"about_the_game":"Do you know what would make every sport better? Playing it in a tank! Battle your friends in Volleyball, Soccer, Football, and Basketball to see who can be the best! This game can be played locally with a shared screen, over the internet, or any combination of the two with up to three friends (4 players total). If you just want to get some practice in, you can play by yourself against the CPU. For the best experience, plug in an Xbox controller. If you don't have one, the game will revert to keyboard controls.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is played with a variable game length of 1 to 5 minutes set by the hosting player. Players shoot or bump the ball onto the other team's side and score a point when the ball hits the ground in a scoring area. Players can jump, or launch each other with missiles to their heart's content. If the other team is doing a good job of keeping the ball up try sitting on it! There's nothing to stop you from invading their half of the court!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJump, Aim, Shoot, and Slow Fall your way to victory!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/802270/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1618258597","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/802270/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1618258597","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/802270/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1618258597","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/802270/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1618258597","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Do you know what would make every sport better?
