{"about_the_game":"Building the Universe is a time travel and building game that starts at the Big Bang, the beginning of the universe as we understand it. The player arrives in the Cosmic Egg, a ship capable of traveling through time anywhere in the universe, and even altering its scale to shrink below the size of an atom or larger than the stars<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe objective is to build the universe starting from the first fundamental particles and ending with a Solar System and habitable Planet Earth.  From a first-person perspective, players will need to capture sub-atomic particles floating through space and combine them to make the first elements in the universe in this indie, puzzle-solving adventure.  Tools include an extendable claw, and electromagnetic tool, and a particle launcher, all of which, when used in the right order on the right particle, can create new particles in the universe.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Welcome To The Game","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1237700/bce9b43db9f357d318e2552cc575da0ca658c73b.jpg"},{"name":"Gotcha!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1237700/abf99f0b40c0a557cce7f99b266b6a8ddfdbb3af.jpg"},{"name":"Gotta Catch 'Em All","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1237700/a87b86d2b6d2d95b2e776fb9a86b39203efad6f6.jpg"},{"name":"How Informative","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1237700/783daa2d49941f1c15078fa65887a19b10c5208b.jpg"},{"name":"Science!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1237700/1f24c728b76f74c5a9888bad7045d1a4830016f1.jpg"},{"name":"Stardust","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1237700/8383b3fe45dfee69dacb4ac15dac50036311bdbc.jpg"},{"name":"The First Elements","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1237700/7f4014fefbb14da8e5cdbef53052ade1bba1b640.jpg"},{"name":"The First Three Minutes","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1237700/2d5a7152161fe88c89e84f31d44b80bfe7e1a1b6.jpg"},{"name":"What's This Do?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1237700/e736a98fc77e1d8264ef49d58236ce3e1e751be2.jpg"},{"name":"I Think I Like The Claw","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1237700/7ed4dec27aebcfbf951e45a3a35c14e45b3c8685.jpg"}],"total":10},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1237700/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1587048452","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1237700/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1587048452","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1237700/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1587048452","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1237700/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1587048452","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Building the Universe is a time travel and building game that starts at the Big Bang, the beginning of the universe as we understand it.
