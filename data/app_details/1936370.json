However, in addition to just reading dialogue, the game contains an active turn-based battle system which players use to fight enemies and bosses over the course of their adventure. When players aren't tackling the main storyline, they'll find themselves in Hub areas where they have the ability to interact with their party members through minigames such as Cooking and Teatime. Interacting with party members in this manner raises Friendship and strengthens them in battle. While the story is mostly linear, the player's friendship with their allies will determine the ending of Episode Three and how Episode Four plays out. Players will be made aware of route-defining decisions.","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1936370/b4c1648c36375d9b7a99e04206e76b269cc6dceb/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732765839","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1936370/b4c1648c36375d9b7a99e04206e76b269cc6dceb/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732765839","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"There is some optional light nudity in an osnen CG.
