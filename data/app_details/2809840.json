{"about_the_game":"The soundtrack of Elixir, composed and produced by artist Davide Perico, is a masterful embodiment of emotion and mood.

This dual approach ensures that the music not only complements but also amplifies the emotional and narrative depth of the gameplay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe soundtrack is structured around three evocative states: Suspense, Darkness, and Light. These states are vividly brought to life through the use of a full orchestra, which provides a rich and dynamic musical backdrop. The orchestral elements are combined with innovative sound design techniques, including the use of organic percussion, which adds a tactile, almost visceral quality to the music.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn moments of suspense, the music creates a palpable tension, using subtle crescendos and intricate rhythms to keep the player on edge. The darkness is conveyed through deep, resonant tones and haunting melodies that evoke a sense of mystery and foreboding.
