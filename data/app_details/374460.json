{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">&quot;WELCOME TO IMPOSSIBALL!&quot;</h2><br>IMPOSSIBALL is a re-imagining of Atari\u2019s &quot;Pong&quot; with three different game modes that can be played in singles (1-2 players) or doubles (1-4 players). The game modes are: IMPOSSIBALL, DODGEBALL and LONEBALL.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">IMPOSSIBALL</h2>IMPOSSIBALL is like Pong but with 500 balls instead of one.
