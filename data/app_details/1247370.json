{"about_the_game":"You have to control the animal in an uncompromising struggle for survival. Each has its own individual characteristics: mass, speed, manoeuvrability, damage, skin thickness, absorb and dry. The battle takes place on land, in water and in the air.

You can distance yourself, but the drought begins and players are forced to go to a risky rapprochement in the fight for the last water.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How not to became Food</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> You need water, just put your head in it.<br></li><li> Water goes out, it's inevitable.<br></li><li> Use claws, jaws, hooves, horns and beaks in the fight for last water.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Early Access Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The game is based on a sensitive sync of complex skeletons.
