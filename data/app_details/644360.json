{"about_the_game":"MidBoss is a possession-based traditional turn-based roguelike with a retro aesthetic reminiscent of the 16-bit era, and the soundtrack compliments this aesthetic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nComposer yuzuki created two versions of many of the game's tracks in order to accommodate the game's dynamic music system; one upbeat and one low-key version. The soundtrack comes with 16 tracks, some with ethnic, tribal, and folk influences, others touching violin pieces or shredding electric guitars.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll tracks are available in FLAC and MP3 formats.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/644360/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1634247272","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/644360/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1634247272","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/644360/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1634247272","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/644360/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1634247272","categories":[{"description":"Additional High-Quality Audio","id":50}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>More from Kitsune Games</h1><p>","developers":["yuzuki"],"fullgame":{"appid":"561740","name":"MidBoss"},"genres":[{"description":"Casual","id":"4"},{"description":"Indie","id":"23"},{"description":"RPG","id":"3"},{"description":"Strategy","id":"2"}],"header_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/644360/header.jpg?t=1634247272","is_free":false,"linux_requirements":[],"mac_requirements":[],"name":"MidBoss Original Soundtrack","package_groups":[{"description":"","display_type":0,"is_recurring_subscription":"false","name":"default","save_text":"","selection_text":"Select a purchase option","subs":[{"can_get_free_license":"0","is_free_license":false,"option_description":"","option_text":"MidBoss Original Soundtrack - $4.99 USD","packageid":180754,"percent_savings":0,"percent_savings_text":" ","price_in_cents_with_discount":499}],"title":"Buy MidBoss Original Soundtrack"}],"packages":[180754],"pc_requirements":[],"platforms":{"linux":true,"mac":true,"windows":true},"price_overview":{"currency":"USD","discount_percent":0,"final":499,"final_formatted":"$4.99 USD","initial":499,"initial_formatted":""},"publishers":["Vulpine Music"],"ratings":null,"release_date":{"coming_soon":false,"date":"25 May, 2017"},"required_age":0,"screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/644360/ss_f8aedd3c130af6cf363e0a050386f7525426d478.1920x1080.jpg?t=1634247272","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/644360/ss_f8aedd3c130af6cf363e0a050386f7525426d478.600x338.jpg?t=1634247272"}],"short_description":"The official soundtrack for MidBoss: the possession based roguelike.
