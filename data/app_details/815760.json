{"about_the_game":"Wartime in the 20th century proved the Oceanic Whitetip to be one of the deadliest sharks. Feeding frenzies against shipwrecked sailors became such a problem that a special unit of the Navy was formed and headed by ace diver Wilhelm. With cooperation from the Russians, Wilhelm's team was armed with experimental hardware and then tasked to help shipwrecked sailors across the Pacific Ocean. Although they did not reach every disaster in time, their success in driving back opportunistic sharks is remembered to this day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWilhelm is a famous American diver who assisted in countless open sea search and rescue operations throughout WWII. With international help from the Russians, his team was armed with modified Russian hardware to help stave off sharks and enemy frogmen.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/815760/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1639606483","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/815760/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1639606483","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/815760/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1639606483","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/815760/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1639606483","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Valve Anti-Cheat enabled","id":8},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Wartime in the 20th century proved the Oceanic Whitetip to be one of the deadliest sharks.
