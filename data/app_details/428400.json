{"about_the_game":"Nuclear Throne is a post-apocalyptic roguelike-like top-down shooter. Not 'the final hope of humanity' post-apocalyptic, but 'humanity is extinct and mutants and monsters now roam the world' post-apocalyptic. Fight your way through the wastelands with powerful weaponry, collecting radiation to mutate some new limbs and abilities. All these things and more you could do if only you were good at this game. Can you reach the Nuclear Throne?<br><br>Go through the rough world of Fish, Eyes, Crystal and other mutants with this 35 (+13) track journey of music. Made throughout the development of the game over 2+ years. <br><br>Download to get 35 tracks, 13 bonus songs and demos and instructions how to play the songs 'Legend of the Throne' and 'Kings and Queens of Wasteland' on guitar!
