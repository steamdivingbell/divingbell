{"about_the_game":"You are an analyst in a very secretive, underground organization.  Scour tabloid headlines, police reports and other sources in order to locate supernatural threats to the safety and sanity of your fellow citizens.  <br><br>Players have various tools at their disposal in order to achieve their goal in this experimental simulation.  <br><br> <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1721180/extras/Tabloids.png?t=1736544050\" /><br>Tabloids are a great place to start looking for information about monster sightings and attacks.  Unfortunately, the tabloids also have two major weaknesses.  First, they are almost totally unreliable, and should not be trusted by themselves.  Second, their availability is limited, only ten headlines are released per day.  Still, they make a good place to start identifying possible monster activity.<br><br> <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1721180/extras/Reports.png?t=1736544050\" /><br>More reliable than tabloids, reports come in two varieties, Police and Coroner.  Reports are available for each city, but will cost money to access.  They provide factual information, but will not mention monsters or anything that might threaten the reporter's credibility.  <br><br> <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1721180/extras/Teams.png?t=1736544050\" /><br>Selecting your team is an important step in the process of monster research.  Make sure you try to identify the type of monster you are going after and assign the right kind of specialist, otherwise your team may not be properly prepared.<br><br> <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1721180/extras/Lore.png?t=1736544050\" /><br>Lore is collected as a player progresses through the game.  Each attempt to take down a monster will result in small, but helpful hints that will make it easier to identify possible monster activity.  Lore is the only thing that will be saved between play-throughs of the game.  <br><br>Aberration Analyst is an experimental game made by solo developer Schmidt Workshops.  It is a point and click simulation with rogue-like elements.  Each play-through is intended to be relatively short (about a couple hours or so) and progress is reset after completion, whether you succeed in mitigating all the aberrations, or you run out of resources in the process.  Only lore is preserved between play-throughs, allowing players to learn more about how to identify aberrations successfully.<br><br>The game's music was written and performed by Immorpher.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Witch Buster","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1721180/2f6f16243186c10e026e5694172cf900839c6a3b.jpg"},{"name":"Ghost Chaser","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1721180/dcfc0cc237a865d764eff1ca931ccb80e71b4ad7.jpg"},{"name":"Werewolf Trapper","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1721180/c7c5360ff056c19d7b9ccc7a065f428b0874393d.jpg"},{"name":"Vampire Hunter","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1721180/264cf871836fe39591c4a4716794aceab862f881.jpg"},{"name":"Wendigo Stalker","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1721180/8b7fd9a265d78d793abc577781c93af8a2a91430.jpg"},{"name":"Evidence Collector","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1721180/a0d8ee947af5ad4f2f498964dce28585d0e2a73a.jpg"},{"name":"Aberration Analyst","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1721180/20756e77ca75fc41bf9116a16dfdf54fd2cb9732.jpg"},{"name":"Caretaker","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1721180/7677519f3e7d46f74cfb32f9ef0117e23225665d.jpg"},{"name":"Capitalist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1721180/aa140b48f702afefcef2283bbce18d3d158d6f0b.jpg"},{"name":"Loremaster","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1721180/60d70e0785a0cda45cb73c7f570c195c8c6af02e.jpg"}],"total":10},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1721180/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736544050","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1721180/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1736544050","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1721180/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736544050","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1721180/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736544050","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":1768900,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"You are an analyst in a very secretive, underground organization.
