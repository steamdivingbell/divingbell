{"about_the_game":"Explore the stunning \u201cSeelinie\u201d with Rivet Games\u2019 Lake Constance: Schaffhausen \u2013 Kreuzlingen route!<br><br>The Lake Constance: Schaffhausen to Kreuzlingen route is part of the Swiss \u201cSeelinie\u201d (Lake Line) from Schaffhausen to Rorschach, which is the Swiss part of the train-ring around the Bodensee (Lake Constance), and located in the Thurgau region. This route features the stunning part from Kreuzlingen to Schaffhausen. <br><br>The route as it is today was built in 4 segments from 1869 to 1895. Initially, there were 3 Swiss train companies who had built routes in this area. One after another, the NOB (Swiss Northeastern Railway) took over the separate parts and united them. In 1902, when Switzerland started nationalising its railway companies, SBB took over the route. They started electrifying the route in 1928, but because of its status as a branch line, it took until 1969 to complete electrification. <br><br>In the 1990s, the SBB slowly started decommissioning the route, but in 1996 the MThB (Mittel-Thurgau-Bahn or Central Thurgau Railway) took over the route and started modernising both the tracks and the trains. Then in 2002, the SBB subsidiary \u201cThurbo\u201d took over the route as well as most of the rolling stock.<br><br>Today, the route is operated with modern multiple units, running every half an hour in both directions.
