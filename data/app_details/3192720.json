Run at night in your hoodie and scarf and hide from the police like a real urban ninja.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow it works.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStory:<br />\r\nYou are a young hooded graffiti artist who has a big dream to become famous. You begin your journey in your hometown in Rochester. You are starting to get good at what you do, the locals admire you. It's time to create your own brand and sign your street art. You proudly sign it \u201cGraffiti Ninja\u201d. You decide to move to another city and battle other famous graffiti masters. Try to be better than them and don't get caught by the police! Focus on painting increasingly beautiful spray cans. Mix paints, add more layers, change graffiti fonts. Who knows what city the next one will be in. Check it out!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\nPaint graffiti based on your new stencil idea on paper. You have a spray art sketch. Important:<br />\r\n- don't mix up the colors,<br />\r\n- don't go beyond the edges of the drawing,<br />\r\n- try to draw as accurately as possible.<br />\r\n- share your artwork with friends, create wallpapers from it or save it on your device.<br />\r\n- Paint almost the entire alphabet and other symbols on the wall step by step.

This game is different, you can learn how to paint graffiti and have fun at the same time. It's more like the idea of a spray-paint mogul.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRemember that every wall is different. You have a different graphic idea for each one. Sometimes inspiration will come and sometimes it won't. Sometimes you will draw text, sometimes animals, symbols, love, heart signs or other, depending on your mood. You need to listen to your emotions and draw what they are telling you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the game you will find walls in different cities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou constantly need to improve your spray cans and graffiti tools. Remember, without this it will be difficult to finish the game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3192720/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730158872","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3192720/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1730158872","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3192720/381e5db9cf647f2a2d8607d637ce68ff3be4ea48/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730158872","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3192720/381e5db9cf647f2a2d8607d637ce68ff3be4ea48/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730158872","categories":[{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Become a great graffiti artist and work your way to success!
