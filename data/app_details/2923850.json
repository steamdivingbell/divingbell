The custom rule creation process lets you create rules that fit your miniatures and construct the spells you want to bolster them on the battlefield. The rules of the game scale from smaller battles of 20 or fewer models, up to much larger battles.<br><br><strong>About AtomsPast</strong><br><br>The goals of AtomsPast is to give miniature wargamers control of their game and to eliminate as much of the cost of wargaming as possible. There is no &quot;power creep&quot; of miniatures to worry about or additional rule books or expansions needed. Any models of similar scale can be played with, and all the rules to play the game are in one place. <br><br>In AtomsPast, you pick a leader of your Warband called a &quot;Kon&quot;, who is the focal point of your spell casting. To win the game you must destroy your opponents Kon while protecting your own. Your Kon goes to battle with a Warband of models and a Grimoire of your spells. Your Kon, Warband, and Grimoire are all built in AtomsPast and everyone has access to the same effects and abilities. Do you want an Orc Warband led by a mighty Shaman? Or what about a two-headed Dragon charging through your enemies lines? You can create the rules for these and much more in AtomsPast. <br><br><strong>Why Steam?</strong><br><br>In the future I'd like to make  an asynchronous multiplayer expansion to AtomsPast so people who don't have time or aren't near a gaming group/store can also play a tabletop wargame where they can be as creative as they want with their battles. This will be a paid separate DLC in the future.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2923850/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728388805","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2923850/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1728388805","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2923850/854a36f9caeea779249de4016630e280de46e60d/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728388805","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2923850/854a36f9caeea779249de4016630e280de46e60d/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728388805","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"Because a big part of the Atoms-Past is the freedom to create custom rule sets for your tabletop/digital models, users can create mature content for their model rules in the names and descriptions."},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2923850/extras/Banner_616w_353h.png?t=1728388805\" /><br><br>AtomsPast is a custom model rule creator, custom spell creator, and complete rule book for waging battles on tabletop against your friends.
