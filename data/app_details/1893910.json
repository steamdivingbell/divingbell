{"about_the_game":"Join your friends in a 2D online multiplayer board game experience. Slide tiles around the board to make paths and collect goals and power-ups. Use the board to mess with your opponents, and take you to victory. Play in multiple different environments that each feature different tile, goal, and atmosphere designs. Play either against your friends or take it on solo to see how fast you can clear the board. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nProject labyrinth includes a multiplayer mode where you battle against your friends to see who can collect all their goals first. The number of goals and size of the board is customizable. The game also includes a single-player mode where you fight against the clock to finish a board as fast as you can with as few moves as possible. You can either play boards that you save, or boards that other people upload. In both singleplayer and multiplayer, you can choose whether or not to include powerups, which alter the game in ways such as shuffling the board.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game features multiple different environments to play in, including space and the mountains. These environments change up the way the tiles, goals and many different objects in the game look.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1893910/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1677101651","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1893910/page.bg.jpg?t=1677101651","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1893910/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1677101651","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1893910/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1677101651","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2329420,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Join your friends in a 2D online multiplayer board game experience.
