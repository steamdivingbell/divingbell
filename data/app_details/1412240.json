{"about_the_game":"Welcome to Lombardi's World. You will die here, but you'll have some fun. You and your friends must band together to explore, complete puzzles, and fight enemies with the ultimate goal of defeating Chris Lombardi of Matador Records.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game takes place in a surreal world where Matador Records rules over all inhabitants. At the helm of this bleak tyranny is none other than Chris Lombardi. Matador records must be stopped, and it is up to three heroes to defeat them! Trait, Tommy and Stoney must work together using their unique hero abilities to conquer evil enemies and solve difficult puzzles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can expect to have many intense PvE battles as well as PvP if you so choose. There are also large world macro-based puzzles and obstacle courses that are necessary to complete. And of course the final showdown between your team and Chris Lombardi!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is played entirely online. Players will join or host a server in which they can have many other friends join and band together to win! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBE WARNED: This game was mostly coded by a MUSICIAN and the quality of the game reflects that. It has some bugs that I just couldn't figure out how to fix, but I assure you it is possible to beat. It tends to run very poorly on MAC LAPTOPS because I spent 20 years playing the drums, not optimizing code. If you experience game breaking issues and can't join a server, please feel free to take a refund. Also please be aware that THIS GAME IS VERY, VERY HARD","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"TURN ON THE GAME","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1412240/8213ae7fbc8f1db89d19904eb28f7af11cb6c6ca.jpg"},{"name":"DEFEAT LOMBARDI","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1412240/daa6b55086cd3fe2f1a995d34de9fbd2af056628.jpg"},{"name":"COSSETT SHOWDOWN","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1412240/92161b5fadc506a196f835403eb3e26dc2f48298.jpg"},{"name":"BIBLICAL, INNIT?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1412240/16f3db98378519634b1caca2904456ae5f040dc9.jpg"},{"name":"WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1412240/8617e23d366d1c7164ac446191b850aa88163aee.jpg"},{"name":"HOWDY PARTNER","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1412240/27dd527e0bcb51c2aa86a54db30d0e6f1410089a.jpg"},{"name":"MUSHROOM HEAD","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1412240/fe18545ac8af2b418144bece92dd52fdc3bf5ac2.jpg"},{"name":"SLED MASTER","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1412240/6cbaa4cc8b546993376b1c1740d4894eb8552b22.jpg"},{"name":"KEY ME","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1412240/759f42f1740fc016609ccdc5e78fc6ec4d2f5bb8.jpg"},{"name":"RELOADING","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1412240/f48c0e968d58c85d4b70111a06af052851d6fc43.jpg"}],"total":12},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1412240/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1615073685","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1412240/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1615073685","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1412240/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1615073685","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1412240/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1615073685","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"- Violence (Blood, Minor Gore, Suffering, Self-Harm)\r\n- Foul Language\r\n- Drug and Alcohol Use"},"detailed_description":"Welcome to Lombardi's World.
