{"about_the_game":"In the game the player controls a tehnodrom, which can be equipped with various types of weapons. Each weapon has its own unique characteristics and abilities that can affect your play style. For example, one weapon can be very powerful but slow, another can be fast but not very effective, and a third can hit several enemies at the same time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game will have 4 levels, of varying difficulty and placement of cubes. You drive across the map and destroy cubes and enemies while making your way to the goal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe goal of the game is to destroy all enemies in the level and reach the final boss. Enemies can vary from drones and tanks to huge guns and mechanical monsters. Each type of enemy requires a different approach and strategy, and the player must choose the weapon that will best deal with the specific type of enemy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the game progresses, the player can collect upgrades for the Tehnodrom, such as increasing speed, increasing weapon power, or adding new abilities. These upgrades will help the player cope with more difficult levels and enemies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe final boss is the most difficult enemy in the game, requiring the player to use all of their skills and experience. Defeating the final boss ends the game and gives the player a triumphant conclusion to their journey.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"100 crystals composed","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2999750/616eb1f2d5b469c0bd4d3aec48e79bd15cc4a6ff.jpg"},{"name":"100 gold pieces","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2999750/a974507437d209986d9b39981a0528c49454a6c2.jpg"}],"total":2},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2999750/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1719236014","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2999750/page.bg.jpg?t=1719236014","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2999750/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1719236014","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2999750/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1719236014","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In the game the player controls a tehnodrom, which can be equipped with various types of weapons.
