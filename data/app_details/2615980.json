{"about_the_game":"Transform the look of your favourite animals in Meadow! This pack contains two skins: one Streaked Tenrec skin for the Hedgehog and one Leopard Cub skin for the Lynx Cub. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe lowland streaked tenrec, also known as the Madagascar hedgehog shrew, is as bizarre looking as it is endearing. Its most distinguishing features are the black coat with yellow streaks, its long nose and the black and yellow quills. It\u2019s also the only mammal known to use stridulation, something that\u2019s more common amongst insects and snakes. This means that they rub the tips of their quills together to generate a high frequency noise, thought to be a way for mother and babies to communicate. Unfortunately, they don\u2019t come in blue and they don\u2019t wear running shoes. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe leopard cub doesn\u2019t need an introduction, surely. They\u2019re kittens, but cooler since they have gorgeous spots and grow up to be beautiful and fearsome predators large enough to take you down in single combat. At Might and Delight we\u2019re not afraid to break your heart, though, so here\u2019s a sad fact for you: it\u2019s estimated that less than 40% of leopard cubs survive their first year. Now, you may be curious about why the survival rate is so low, but we didn\u2019t have it in us to research it. It could be leopard cub eating monsters for all we know. You go find out, if you really want that knowledge.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2615980?t=1700739189","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2615980?t=1700739189","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2615980/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1700739189","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2615980/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1700739189","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Transform the look of your favourite animals in Meadow!
