On your path you'll find five different environments, each with its unique style and challenges.<br><br>It is a long journey, and when you try to look at the finish line it seems impossible to reach. But patience and determination do make things better and soon enough you feel strong and fast and what felt unreachable is already passed by. And while new challenges will always be ahead of you, you learn to enjoy the journey as much as the destination.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE TRAIN</h2>The train is the heart of the game\u2014sleepless because it never stops. It is your home, your office, your kitchen, your gym and the only tool that can get you what you want. You care for the train, you upgrade the train, you make it efficient, modern and beautiful. And you will be repaid with speed: Speed is what takes you home faster after all!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE WAGONS AND THE MINI-GAMES</h2>As you grow and upgrade your train, you add different kinds of wagons. Every wagon includes a unique mini-game for you to upgrade, optimize and beat in order to get the most out of it. You will have to carefully choose where to spend your resources and find the synergies to grow your resources faster.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE PRESTIGE CARDS</h2>Prestige cards are immensely valuable! You will unlock prestige cards as you progress in the game and each provides a unique boost that can be applied to one and only one wagon. As your build progresses, you may find a specific boost to be more valuable in a different wagon and suddenly feel frustration. And we don't want that: you can move prestige cards from one minigame to another as many times as you want!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>ABOUT US</strong></h2>This is a single family effort!
