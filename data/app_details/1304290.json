{"about_the_game":"When the world's most famous actor, Tim Hanks, contracts Covid-19, the U.S. government chooses to use its experimental new program to save him. A swallow-able pill with a cute, little, micro-soldier inside. Equipped with an anti-body launcher, the micro-soldier must travel to the source of the infection and shoot it to hell. The government only manufactured one packet of these pills, and after every soldier has failed to kill the virus, it's down to the last pill in the packet to save the actor and the future of the Hollywood film industry.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCall of Corona: Micro Warfare is a satirical action/comedy game like none other. Forget what you know about gaming and the human anatomy cause we're breaking the rules on both. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is a single-player campaign game of 30 minutes. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game was entirely created while locked up during the great quarantine of 2020. The goal of the game is to use  comedy to lift the spirits of people as the world suffers through the Covid-19 pandemic together. All proceeds from the game will go to the World Health Organisation to help fight Covid-19.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll references to pop culture are made satirically and are completely fictional.","achievements":{"total":0},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1304290/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1589532624","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1304290/page.bg.jpg?t=1589532624","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1304290/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1589532624","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1304290/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1589532624","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"This game contains mild violence and cursing."},"detailed_description":"When the world's most famous actor, Tim Hanks, contracts Covid-19, the U.S. government chooses to use its experimental new program to save him.
