{"about_the_game":"Welcome to Ranch Mayhem, a relaxing and rewarding active idle game where you can grow, spend, process and export your crops. In Ranch Mayhem, you can plant and harvest 15 different crops, each with their own growth rate and value.  You can spend your crops in the Crop Shop for various bonuses, such as increasing your crop yield, unlocking new skills, or enhancing your farm. The seasons in Ranch Mayhem last for 30 minutes each, and they affect the weather, and therefore the behavior of your crop growth. You can also encounter random events, such as crop invasions, that will challenge your farming skills and require you to use counter measures. Ranch Mayhem is a game that combines the peacefulness of automatic crop growth with the excitement of strategic decisions and surprises. You can play at your own pace, and discover new features and updates along the way. Are you ready to join the farming adventure of Ranch Mayhem? Happy farming!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"A promising start","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2818590/0edcd5f6770939698e66bd156086d0843fbdd1c8.jpg"},{"name":"All the Wheat","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2818590/2cef1acffffc75cd9f9243bdbe44bf346a57c6c2.jpg"},{"name":"All the Carrots","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2818590/67093205372915a4d3635dc98da8b292d91af31a.jpg"},{"name":"All the Potatoes","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2818590/6525dc404fde9e3c9545ebaee015cd375db43cad.jpg"},{"name":"All the cucumbers ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2818590/2d28c9ced46fe3d9ba85823c99e65cc31a27dce0.jpg"},{"name":"All the tomatoes ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2818590/a38faa1b0361a854dae419785227c98867db52cc.jpg"},{"name":"All the cabbages ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2818590/ae37c41d8625ef7644cdbcb68c729bfb41488250.jpg"},{"name":"All the watermelons","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2818590/f644edd8f19dac488048fe574dcd68613a885b5a.jpg"},{"name":"All the bell peppers","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2818590/451a954a4c1b61a09a00038b4015e662c7dc12fc.jpg"},{"name":"All the corn","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2818590/b82625ce352cd431591f9ec2d1ae0bc9e35f79e5.jpg"}],"total":29},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2818590?t=1722685934","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2818590?t=1722685934","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2818590/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1722685934","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2818590/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1722685934","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to Ranch Mayhem, a relaxing and rewarding active idle game where you can grow, spend, process and export your crops.
