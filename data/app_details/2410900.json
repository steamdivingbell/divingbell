Some of the subject matter is somewhat mature, for example the 1st Era is set in 1942 Nazi occupied London where the first scene opens up with some enemy soldiers admiring a nude painting of Churchill (a very tasteful one of course).  In this moment a time travel flux gate opens in an explosion what obliterates the soldiers.  There are some cut-scenes of torture and minor body-horror but much of this is handled in a comicbook style."},"detailed_description":"Fight, hunt and stealth your way through dangerous terrains set across the expanse of history. <br><br>Time Raiders is high-octane arcade action in a 3D top-down shoot n\u2019 loot with time as your playground.
