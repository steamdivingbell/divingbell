{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Featuring: </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">OE-Like</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Constant endless unit production from your shipyards. Each ship is autonomous, they seek your opponents and prioritize what they are best suited to fight. Witness vast battles. Though you cannot directly control your units in the interference of the Spance, you can create waypoint chains to direct where shipyards send your fleets. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Inspired by the gameplay of Obliterate Everything by CWWallis. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Full Campaign</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A fast-paced singleplayer campaign with over 40 missions where you fight both with and against each of the main factions. Delve the secrets of the Spance, and annihilate your opposition. Overcome the horrors of the storm and wield the might of interstellar armadas. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Gameplay</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Annihilate The Spance is a real-time strategy game focused on a singleplayer campaign that sees you handle base building, economy, and armadas of autonomous starships. In ATS your units cannot be commanded individually, but you have many solutions to direct them towards your goals. Each ship has its own intelligent AI, and will attempt to do its best alongside its brethren in the heat of battle.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Test your ability to respond to situations as they change and shift in the chaotic tide of a 3D battlefield. ATS features an unlocked height plane, allowing starships to fly up, down, and around their enemies. Battles are multiple stories high, and can bend and shift as new vessels with unique capabilities arrive upon the battlefield. ATS has a greatly varied unit scale, ranging from tiny drones to kilometers-long capital ships that can level entire bases multiple times over.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each ship in ATS is autonomous, targeting and attacking on its own initiative while you focus on making higher-level strategic decisions. Plan your fleet composition carefully. Calculate build cycles. Make tactical positioning decisions. There is no single ship that can win this battle. Compose a mixture of ships from across your entire selection of blueprints. Exploit your enemies' weaknesses and capitalize on your strengths to annihilate the enemy.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> <strong>The Story</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">ATS is set in a future embroiled in conflict following the discovery of a mysterious, ultra-dense nebula-like anomaly known as the Spance. An ancient, roiling storm of matter and energy, the Spance has roamed the galaxy for eons and dragged hundreds of solar systems into its depths. Extreme and inexplicable phenomena make navigation of the Spance treacherous, but the unfathomable riches contained within offer a lucrative new frontier full of promise. However, not all is as it seems.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Four interlinked campaigns will take you through the depths of the Spance. Encounter each of the major factions as they struggle toward their goals for the Spance and its treasures, all the while gaining access to new units and technologies. Learn the unique doctrines needed to command the military might of the Kontaalen Armada, the united fleets of the Vaalkorei Coalition mercantile guilds, and the experimental technologies of Emar's Tychon Division. Delve ever deeper into the impenetrable abyss of the Spance and unlock its secrets.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Skirmish, Custom Maps, and the Level Editor</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Beyond the main campaign, you can jump directly into Skirmishes against AI opponents in custom maps and levels.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Additionally, our game features a full in-game level editor that can be used to create and share your own scenarios.</p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Subjugator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1706360/bcda3ecce51d038101f6bd8ce8bdf4fc493bde86.jpg"},{"name":"Soul Warden","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1706360/a49b82f463c8bb9ab35d13cdda2d39e26d87f3cc.jpg"},{"name":"ANNIHILATE THE SPANCE","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1706360/a86b62906bb9bed19c1ccacdc7982a6b76b8a4c1.jpg"},{"name":"No Time Like Showtime","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1706360/3b89efd4fb98ac92a20d3cf21ee40306d99007c1.jpg"}],"total":4},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1706360/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737022010","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1706360/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1737022010","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1706360/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737022010","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1706360/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737022010","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":1743130,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Featuring: </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">OE-Like</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Constant endless unit production from your shipyards.
