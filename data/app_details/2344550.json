Apprenticed to the most powerful sorcerer known to history, but stalked by mysterious enemies. Hardly having even begun, these magicians will have to contend with unexpected enemies and insidious dark magic.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build Your Spell Book</h2><br>The main progression of MageCraft is in learning new spells for your team to wield in battle. Each wizard has their own specialization, and can gain increasingly powerful magic which they will need to take on the dangerous enemies the game presents.
