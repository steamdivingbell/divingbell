{"about_the_game":"The Worm is a game that mixes the classic with innovation!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe protagonist is \u201cthe worm\u201d, he stretches every time you turn on the blocks below and he can not touch his body with his head.<br />\r\nWith the button \u2018turbo / god mode\u2018 the worm rushes impulsively and can destroy enemies!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe mazes are always random and unpredictable because they are procedurally generated.<br />\r\nThe goal is to tap more blocks as possible to pass the levels!<br />\r\nGood fun!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe goal is to drive the worm through random mazes to reach more 'save points' as possible.<br />\r\nAfter turning a box the worm stretches, creating the dynamics of the classic games like \u201cSnake\u201d !!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOf course the worm can not touch the body with the head, otherwise it will be GAME OVER !!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame Features:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMultiple maps!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are four types of randomly generated maps:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u2013 Labyrinth normal: classic labyrinth without walls<br />\r\n\u2013 Labyrinth with walls: maze with walls that prevent the fall of the worm.<br />\r\n\u2013 Caves normal: caverns map without walls<br />\r\n\u2013 Caves with walls: caves map with walls that prevent the fall of the worm.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPersistent maps!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWas improved the storage of the current game, with the preservation of the map for a level failed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnemies<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnemies follow the main character moving and jumping.<br />\r\nThere are TEN enemy types, with different characteristics and speed.<br />\r\nThe more advanced enemies can not be killed by jumping on them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBonuses<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBonuses are spherical objects placed randomly on the maze.<br />\r\nThey can be moved and are deadly for the enemies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnlimited levels<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is practically infinite, the number of levels is unlimited and therefore the real challenge is to fill as many blocks as possible to become a legend.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMultiple cameras<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the game you can select various types of cameras:<br />\r\n\u2013 Normal (the camera gently follows the movements close the protagonist)<br />\r\n\u2013 Map (the camera is fixed from above)<br />\r\n\u2013 Dynamic map (the camera is at the top and follows the rotations of the protagonist)<br />\r\n\u2013 Dynamic (the camera follows the protagonist in the third person, with the view from below)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMultiple game modes<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can select various game options, including the camera, game difficulty levels, the number of enemies and their speed.<br />\r\nAll this to offer an even richer gameplay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFull game statistics<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game saves the complete statistics of the game in progress, including the score, time played, enemies destroyed, blocks filled, jumps, levels completed, levels failed etc.<br />\r\nIn this way, lovers of statistics will have even more pleasure in playing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFull game rankings<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game will store up to 100 high scores with its partial statistics.<br />\r\nThis will make real the challenge to become a legend !!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFull procedural generation, exploration and discovery<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach level is generated procedurally with the algorithm of construction of random \u2018Dungeon\u2019.<br />\r\nEven the main character, enemies, blocks and everything are placed and constructed randomly.<br />\r\nIn this way, the game is always unpredictable and dynamics are always unknown.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFight and strategy<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn each level there are the bases from which the enemies will appear.<br />\r\nThese enemies will follow you to kill you.<br />\r\nThis way to overcome the levels you\u2019ll also face fierce fighting from enemy waves.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIncremental difficulty<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the advancement in the levels, these become ever larger and increasingly difficult mazes.<br
