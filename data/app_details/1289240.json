{"about_the_game":"The Ancient Lands is a survival strategy game set in a time where darkness has consumed most of the world. You play the role of a Watcher and you are tasked with the job to defend your villager town from the approaching darkness. As a Watcher; you cannot control your peoples' movement, but you have control over what they build and gather. You start small with only a few villagers at your disposal and you must guide them to keep them alive. When night falls, monsters can come out to start attacking your villager town. When the night does fall; you have a small arsenal of powers that you can use to aid in the survival ability of your town.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Survival</h2>Your people must eat to survive. You can harvest from berry bushes and from built farms for food. Have your people mine from stone deposits for stone and gold to keep your economy going as well as harvest trees for a source of wood.

After so long of surviving wave after wave; you will finally encounter a finale wave to test your mettle.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Randomly Generated World</h2> Each world is randomly generated with basic things like mountains, trees, and stone deposits. This can impact the way you construct your village buildings.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Powers</h2>As a Watcher, you are given powers to help aid your people. Each power has a different effect and some are used on your people and some are used on the enemy.

Catapults, and other dangerous creatures.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1289240/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1665875412","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1289240/page.bg.jpg?t=1665875412","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1289240/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1665875412","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1289240/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1665875412","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Ancient Lands is a survival strategy game set in a time where darkness has consumed most of the world.
