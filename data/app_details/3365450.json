{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>&quot;A Regular Store&quot;</strong> is a chilling single-player horror experience that puts you in the shoes of a new employee working the graveyard shift at a local retail store. At first glance, <i>&quot;A Regular Store&quot;</i> lives up to its name \u2014 a quiet, uneventful place where you\u2019re tasked with mundane housecleaning duties outlined in a notebook left by your manager. Your nightly responsibilities include restocking shelves, taking cash from registers, compacting cardboard boxes, and performing other routine tasks to keep the store in order.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">But not everything is as ordinary as it seems.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">[img][/img]</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Set in the early 2000s, the game combines nostalgic simplicity with an eerie atmosphere as strange and unexplainable events begin to unfold. Shadows that move when they shouldn't, objects that aren\u2019t where you left them, and an ever-growing sense that you\u2019re not alone in the store blur the lines between your duties and survival. Hidden among the chaos are cryptic notes and old articles hinting at a darker, long-forgotten history lurking beneath the surface of your seemingly normal job.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you complete your shift, expect unsettling jump scares and unnerving phenomena that might make you question your surroundings\u2014or your sanity. Pay no mind to the flicker of movement in the corner of your eye, the peculiar creaks, or the faint whispers that seem to echo through the aisles. Your priority is to finish your tasks and lock the doors. After all, it\u2019s not just about keeping things out\u2014it's about keeping yourself in.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">[img][/img]</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With its immersive gameplay and retro aesthetic, <i>&quot;A Regular Store&quot;</i> delivers a unique blend of psychological and environmental horror, balancing tension with a compelling narrative. Devlogs chronicling the development of the game are available on our YouTube channel if you\u2019re interested in behind-the-scenes insights into its creation. Check them out and see how this deceptively &quot;regular&quot; store came to life. :D</p>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3365450?t=1740186363","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3365450?t=1740186363","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3365450/389d7360d62f81fc36f6445c8cbd44a45c8ee39d/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1740186363","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3365450/389d7360d62f81fc36f6445c8cbd44a45c8ee39d/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1740186363","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>&quot;A Regular Store&quot;</strong> is a chilling single-player horror experience that puts you in the shoes of a new employee working the graveyard shift at a local retail store.
