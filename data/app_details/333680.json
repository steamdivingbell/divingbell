{"about_the_game":"Soak up the eclectic music of the unique indie abstraction known as ULTRAWORLD EXODUS.  Find your favorite chair and take in a twenty five song double album that features spaced out ambiance, catchy orchestrations, and toe-tapping beats.  The sole creator of the game was also the sole creator of the soundtrack so these songs are tightly linked to a specifically designed audio-visual experience.  While originally composed to compliment vibrant landscapes, this unusual mix of songs easily stands on it's own.  So throw on your headphones, sit back, and enjoy!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;...its soundtrack remains a highlight.&quot; - PCGamer<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;It's a gorgeous looking game with an equally nice soundtrack.&quot; - IndieGames.com<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Its soundtrack is also very eccentric, featuring ethereal, electronic, ambient sounds.&quot; - Game Skinny","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/333680/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1462749660","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/333680/page.bg.jpg?t=1462749660","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/333680/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1462749660","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/333680/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1462749660","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Soak up the eclectic music of the unique indie abstraction known as ULTRAWORLD EXODUS.
