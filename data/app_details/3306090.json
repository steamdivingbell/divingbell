{"about_the_game":"A horror FPS genre game  about a man's survival in the night in an abandoned house in the forest. <br />\r\nJacob, a young man with a penchant for adventure, finds himself driving alone down a winding road in the heart of an expansive, eerie forest. The air is thick with an ominous chill, and a sense of isolation looms as the towering trees seem to close in, casting long, ghostly shadows across the path. Suddenly, out of the darkness, an animal appears in the middle of the road. With barely any time to react, Jacob\u2019s car swerves off the road and crashes, leaving him stranded and injured in the darkness, the metal crunching against the tree. Shaken but unhurt, he quickly tries to call for help, only to find that his phone has no signal. Trapped, he realizes he must venture out into the unknown to find shelter for the night. With no other choice, Jacob begins to walk deeper into the forest, his footsteps muffled by the damp leaves carpeting the ground. After what feels like hours of wandering, he finally spots a flicker of light through the dense trees. As he pushes forward, the outline of an old mansion emerges, cloaked in shadows and barely visible under the faint moonlight. The house appears abandoned yet unsettlingly intact, standing as a testament to another era. Trapped in the twisted reality of the house, Jacob must confront the spirits, unravel the secrets of the ritual, and survive until dawn. But as he delves deeper, he begins to wonder: did he find the house, or did the house find him?.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3306090/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732187689","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3306090/page.bg.jpg?t=1732187689","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3306090/9b16240247cf7e147f82a27451e5160bed1675c9/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732187689","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3306090/9b16240247cf7e147f82a27451e5160bed1675c9/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732187689","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A horror FPS genre game  about a man's survival in the night in an abandoned house in the forest. <br />\r\nJacob, a young man with a penchant for adventure, finds himself driving alone down a winding road in the heart of an expansive, eerie forest.
