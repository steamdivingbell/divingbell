{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">  CURSED! </h2>   By David Cole - Bardic Mischief    A Level 4-5 Adventure for the Shadowdark RPG ruleset    Beneath the mist-shrouded lands of the Grenadle estate and the looming presence of Grenadle Castle, Erghart Grenadle II, the current lord, grapples with the ancient and malevolent curse of the Loup Garou--a dark legacy etched into the bloodline of his tragic family.  <br>   <br> <br>  As the tale unfurls, the origins of the curse are cloaked in the shadowy history of Grenadle Castle, where each act of violence and fleeting mercy weaves a thread in the somber tapestry of the family's legacy. This curse is not merely a supernatural affliction but a haunting echo of ancestral duty, binding each generation to the tormented deeds of those who came before. <br> <br> <br>  The adventurers are drawn into this dark saga through their participation in the annual hunting tournament, sponsored by the Undertow Village Council. What begins as a quest to help control the perilous wildlife in the swamp quickly escalates into a fight for survival. The heroes must rise to become the salvation of the swamp or face the dire fate of falling prey to the Loup Garou... or something far worse! <br> <br> <br>  Is your party prepared for a journey into the heart of the swamp, where they'll face its most enigmatic and feared creatures, along with a tribe of dark druids who have revived an ancient evil believed to be vanquished a century ago? If so, pay a visit to Ol' Scratch at the Crossroads Tavern--he's got an offer you won't want to miss.    45 new NPCs and Monsters, 16 new Magic Items, 28 colorful maps, 6 new Spells, 68 new Tokens, and Undertow Village complete with map, NCPs and personalities. <br> <br> <br>  This &quot;zine&quot;-sized module combines four chapters that are adventures on their own.\u00a0 Characters will progress completely through level 4 and 5.\u00a0 This adventure could drop into any campaign or serve as a home for a new sandbox with lots of stories yet to be told. <br> <br>   All written content is original to the writer and is a live creation.
