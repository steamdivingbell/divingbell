{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Many years have passed since the Great War and defeat that the Orcs suffered from vile humans. From that time they hunted us like animals and pressed deeper into our lands. But you decided not to back down one step further. You\u2019re a young Warchief lusting for blood and your warriors want revenge. Reclaim your lands, rebuild your villages and bring doom on our enemies. Raise our warbanner and gather The Horde.

Build defences to buy time for preparations and strike when you're ready for war.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You need to manage your resources well and balance between expansion and needs of your clan.
