{"about_the_game":"<strong>[A talented cat hides &quot;floors and walls&quot;]</strong><br><br>This game is a 2D puzzle action game where you aim to clear the world in a world where the terrain changes exactly as you see it by hiding floors and walls so that they are no longer visible. In order to reach its owner, the cat, the main character, progresses through seemingly impossible stages by hiding and erasing walls and floors.<br><br>The appeal of this game is that you can change the terrain and carve your own path to the goal.<br><br><strong>[Simple operation method]</strong><br>In addition to basic movement and jumping, you will use &quot;black boxes&quot; to hide walls and floors to conquer the game. A &quot;black box&quot; appears while you click the mouse, and by hiding the terrain, it is treated as if the terrain does not exist at that location and you can pass through it. You will conquer various stages with this intuitive operation.<br><br><strong>[Two different modes]</strong><br>This game has two modes: a ``puzzle'' mode where you can have fun and have casual fun, and an ``action'' mode where you use gimmicks to reach the goal.Even with the same ``hiding floors and walls'' element, you can have different fun.<br><br><strong>\u3010Stage\u3011</strong><br>There are over 50 stages in total! A variety of stages await you, from easy ones to highly difficult ones to ones with a few quirks!<br><br><strong>[Story]</strong><br>The main character, a cat named ``Hyde,'' goes into an impossible labyrinth in order to find his owner who disappeared one day. She uses her research on ``the power to block out existence and make it impossible to even touch'' to advance through a labyrinth that seems impossible to conquer, with walls and doors buried.<br><br><strong>[Distribution guidelines]</strong><br><br>Game distribution/live commentary: OK for individuals and corporations<br>Spoiler: OK<br>Monetization: OK<br>Distribution platform: No particular restrictions<br><br>\u30fbIf you would like to broadcast or provide live commentary, we would appreciate it if you could write the following information!<br>Steam URL","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Hello World","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2607760/d0537e409fd27a815c6ccb216e8325f6b096aa0e.jpg"},{"name":"Tutorial completed","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2607760/deb03f6eb9e2599ffd51660abcc00101d37a132c.jpg"},{"name":"Master of dress up","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2607760/87654e544a0b6d30c6234284f801ce76684a1174.jpg"},{"name":"Happy end","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2607760/489b779224afe362c2bf90b8e9c3d291c1ba7b01.jpg"},{"name":"Hide for Cat","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2607760/1241382e4d2c3b3de9fa889247be82bfa318ac8e.jpg"},{"name":"Good!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2607760/df0e86cde3a6d4dd0ddb9c85ad2c6c75b5b537fa.jpg"},{"name":"looking for the key","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2607760/fcb3dab0fb8a13ad13ce2192027453e19b55337e.jpg"}],"total":7},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2607760/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1711787751","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2607760/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1711787751","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2607760/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1711787751","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2607760/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1711787751","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>[A talented cat hides &quot;floors and walls&quot;]</strong><br><br>This game is a 2D puzzle action game where you aim to clear the world in a world where the terrain changes exactly as you see it by hiding floors and walls so that they are no longer visible.
