{"about_the_game":"hello!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nmy name is ralf. right now im working somewhere outside from my hometown to earn some money. <br />\r\nbecause i didnt and still dont have anything else to do after work, i started to develop this game just for fun respective as a pastime using the most sh... eh slowest laptop ive ever seen. for me it was really nice to listen to electronic music while coding so i think everything goes fine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nanyway:<br />\r\nthe goal of this game is to run, jump and fly through a world. i dont want it to be a realistic simulation or something like that. its not that its impossible to realize, but i think that its much more fun like that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nsince this is an early access game, theres not much to see right now. you can walk through an empty world with a circle, which can be very relaxing by the way, and watch a (badly implemented) sun rising and setting. thats what you will get for your money right now. since i dont have anything else to do, i will continue developing this game respective this empty world wont last forever.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2500010?t=1689089904","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2500010?t=1689089904","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2500010/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1689089904","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2500010/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1689089904","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full
