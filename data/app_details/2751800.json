{"about_the_game":"A creative first-person card game that mimics VR perspective and operation. Combining science fiction and magic, it features a non-traditional card game mode and a 3D spatial UI. Players can throw cards to any position (with physics system) by using the mouse quickly.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2>\u00b7 Unique gameplay mechanism: The game mimics the way VR throws objects. In this game, players can drag and throw cards with the mouse. Cards use physical systems, and where they are thrown depends entirely on player operations. The game also comes with 10 dance actions, and players can dance and throw cards for high immersion.<br><br>\u00b7 Gameplay: You can only summon up to 5 creatures on the field at the same time. Once your creatures reach 5, throwing cards again will not summon more creatures. You need to wait for the number of monsters to drop below 5 before picking up cards and throwing them again. After the creature is summoned, it will prioritize attacking or occupying flags against the creatures it restrains. (Ranged creatures will not actively occupy flags, only melee creatures will occupy flags).<br><br>\u00b7 Creatures factions: Currently updated to 7 factions, with a total of 96 summonable creatures. In the future, it will increase to 9 factions, with a total of over 100 creatures.<br><br>\u00b7 Realistic models: Further enhance immersion.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiplayer Online</h2>Play with friends in the Steam lobby and enjoy multiplayer mode, it's even more fun and free!<br>The multiplayer mode uses Steam lobby + peer-to-peer.<br><br>\u00b7 PS:<br>The gameplay of this game may be unique.
