{"about_the_game":"Times Dungeon takes you into a dark dungeon where time is your greatest enemy. In this game, you have only 60 minutes to defeat four powerful bosses. The dungeons between each boss are procedurally generated, so you never know what you\u2019ll face next.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsing your weapons and reloading will waste precious time, making every second incredibly valuable. You\u2019ll progress through three levels, encountering four main bosses, each requiring you to develop strategies to overcome their unique challenges. This game tests both your reflexes and your time management skills.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTimes Dungeon combines rogue-like and FPS elements to deliver a highly addictive experience that you'll want to play again and again. As time ticks away, you must use every moment wisely. Can you become the master of the dungeon before time runs out?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1993440/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726659010","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1993440/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1726659010","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1993440/44a1e75959436d31a7cdec77d38e64657084ee0e/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726659010","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1993440/44a1e75959436d31a7cdec77d38e64657084ee0e/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726659010","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Times Dungeon takes you into a dark dungeon where time is your greatest enemy.
