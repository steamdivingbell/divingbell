{"about_the_game":"<strong>This demo contains most of the content from the game up to the first boss.</strong><br><br>I Made Myself a Ship is a game about systems and components, using them to add and upgrade the capabilities of your ship to destroy more enemies in your quest to decimate everything and collect it for yourself.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2906550/extras/IMMAS-PlacingComponents.gif?t=1729118760\" /><br><br>Destroy enemy ships to collect systems and components, then place systems on your ship to add effects. Add homing to your shots to make sure they hit, fire volleys of shots to take down larger opponents, add explosions to wipe out multiple ships at once, reinforce your hull to fly straight through enemies, shield yourself to survive, and so much more.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2906550/extras/ExtraProjectileCombined2.gif?t=1729118760\" /><br><br>Attach components to your systems to increase their effects. Scaling up systems makes them stronger, as long as you can make room for them. Every system can be scaled up, leaving you with a hard choice: to use a large variety of systems, or just a few very powerful ones.

Want to be tanky? Use barriers to maintain shields to survive longer. Want to go fast? Or faster? Or faster still? Add components to your engines system until you're satisfied. One of the main design goals of the game is to let you build the ship you want to build, as long as you can cover the energy costs of whatever you want to do. It's your ship, make it yourself.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2906550/extras/AgileShip2.gif?t=1729118760\" /><br><br>Your ship can be very agile, letting you dodge and weave around enemies.
