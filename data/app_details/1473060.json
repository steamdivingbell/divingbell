Take on the role of a mercenary who unwittingly becomes imbued with the power to alter reality, and finds themselves thrown into a chaotic maelstrom where other sinister and malevolent forces attempt to stop them at every turn in an evolving storyline. But can you really stop those who know what you are going to do before you even know it yourself?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1473060/extras/Combat_new_draft_3.mp4.gif?t=1738191043\" /><br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1473060/extras/rewrite_the_universe.mp4.gif?t=1738191043\" /><br>In Reality Break, almost everything is modifiable with the Rewrite mechanic.
