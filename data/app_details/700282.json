They are inside your room, and inside your mind - your dreams and sometimes dreams come true. Freddy Krueger knows the true meaning of haunting. The true meaning of pushing someone into that dream state where you are uncertain whether you are awake or asleep - alive or on the verge of death. Some more than others will resist sleep, like young Quentin, who is forced to head back where Freddy learned about revenge. Back to Badham Preschool.<br><br><strong>Back to school</strong><br>Who would have thought that dreams could actually do harm? Physical, pain inducing harm? Fear and pain stemming from a scarred soul who seeks revenge for a punishment he deserved.

Someone who will never let you rest. Someone who intentionally deprives you of sleep to diminish your resilience. Someone who sees himself as a victim desperate for payback. He can\u2019t see your pain and suffering\u2026 all he sees is\u2026 his metal claws closing in on your neck. <br><br><strong>Killer Power \u2013 The Nightmare: Dream Demon</strong><br><br>Death won't accept him, so he remains, a calamity, indisputable master of his victims' nightmares. Dream Demon allows The Nightmare to pull Survivors into the Dream World.  <br><br>- Survivors facing The Nightmare are constantly on the verge of falling asleep. <br>- Awake Survivors only catch brief glimpses of The Nightmare before falling into a deep slumber. <br>- These microsleeps allow The Nightmare to attack a Survivor at any point, pulling them into the Dream World in the process.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Once in the Dream World: </strong></h2><br>- The Nightmare can project an illusion of himself next to a generator and cause it to gush a torrent of blood. The cooldown of his Dream Projection is reduced for each sleeping Survivor in the trial. <br>- Dream Snares are traps that can reach up and grab Survivors who pass over them, slowing them down. Survivors are affected by the Dream Snare are unable to vault quickly through a window. <br>- Survivors who are awake will be unaffected by The Nightmare\u2019s Dream Traps. To escape the Dream World, Survivors can either fail a skill check, be awakened by a woke Survivor, or reach a ringing alarm clock.   <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/700282/extras/nightmare_killerperks.jpg?t=1681937223\" /><br><br>The Nightmare comes with <strong>3 new perks</strong>.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fire Up</h2>The increased pressure of losing your prey fills you with anger and gives you unsuspected motivation. Each time the Survivors complete repairs on a generator, Fire Up grows in power and grants a speed bonus to pick-ups, drops, pallet breaks, generator breaks and vaults.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Remember Me</h2>You become obsessed with one survivor. Each time you Hit your Obsession, you increase the opening time of the Exit Gates up to a maximum. The Obsession is not affected by Remember Me. Only one obsession per match.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Blood Warden</h2>You get one chance to hook a Survivor and summon The Entity to block all open Gates for a limited time. While Blood Warden is active, auras of Survivors located within the Exit areas are revealed to you. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/700282/extras/nightmare_survivor.jpg?t=1681937223\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Sleepwalker</strong></h2>Quentin Smith will never run out of pills to keep him awake, of energy drinks to make him go another mile or another hour. He will never stop, and hopefully he will never sleep. Ever again. Or at least until he\u2019s managed to stop Freddy. Fear poses an option: head into the storm and ride it out, or accept the inevitability of death and just go to bed. Quentin chooses the first one. But how long can he avoid sleep? And how will he manage in this place? Where even death can\u2019t provide any kind of tranquility.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/700282/extras/nightmare_survivorperks.jpg?t=1681937223\" /><br><br>Quentin Smith comes with <strong>3 new Perks.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Pharmacy</h2>You have a knack for finding medicine. Searches through chests are faster and the noises they cause along with their hearing distances are reduced. Pharmacy guarantees an Emergency Med-Kit on your first completed chest search.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Vigil</h2>You watch over your friends even in dire situations. You and your allies within range recover from Exhausted, Hemorrhage, Mangled, Hindered and Blindness status effects faster.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Wake Up! </h2>Unlocks potential in one's aura reading ability. Once all generators are powered, Exit Gates are revealed to you when within range. While opening the Exit Gates, reveal your aura to other Survivors within range. While Wake Up! is active, you open the Exit Gates faster.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/700282/extras/nightmare_map.jpg?t=1681937223\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A place for teaching</strong></h2>When you think \u201cpreschool\u201d, you think of learning. Development and knowledge. You put trust in its meaning and heritage. Badham Preschool however, was something completely different. On the outside it posed as a place where everyone could feel safe. But it held pain and suffering inside. Freddy roamed the premises and distorted everything we took for granted. Nowadays, the preschool is just a shattered memory. Where hallways are abandoned, and where toys provide a disturbing sight of never forgotten torment. It\u2019s not what it once was, and it will never return to its old shape.
