{"about_the_game":"Requiem Of Science is a free custom modification for Half-Life 2: Episode 2 in the Sci-Fi style.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Plot:</h2>The events of Requiem Of Science take place constantly a year before the events of Half-Life 2, but there are almost no plot intersections between these games. The plot is presented, traditionally for an indie game, through notes, and therefore is not required to be read to enjoy the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay:</h2>The gameplay is similar to Half-Life 2, but with an unusual game structure and levels. The changes concern not the general game balance, but the eclectic level design.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">IMPORTANT:</h2>The modification does not claim to be canonic, although it does not cancel the events of other games in the Valve universe. The game has little connection with the events of Half-Life and Portal.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Unusual modification experience<br><br></li><li> 2 hours of playing time<br><br></li><li> 12 levels (3 chapters)<br><br></li><li> Charismatic main character Genry Freedom<br><br></li><li> Voice acting</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1828210/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732144419","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1828210/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1732144419","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1828210/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732144419","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1828210/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732144419","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"Includes Source SDK","id":16}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Requiem Of Science is a free custom modification for Half-Life 2: Episode 2 in the Sci-Fi style.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Plot:</h2>The events of Requiem Of Science take place constantly a year before the events of Half-Life 2, but there are almost no plot intersections between these games.
