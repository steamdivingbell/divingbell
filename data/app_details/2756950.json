The game was initially designed as a prototype by David Xu and Letitia Napitupulu to be simple enough to not need text to go along with the unit on accessibility. Simply Rotate was then further developed into a final project for the class with Andre Lebecki and Kelly Chan helping out with development. The game will now continue to be developed into a more complete experience with Calvin Thompson composing the music.","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2756950/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1709410542","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2756950/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1709410542","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2756950/extras/USCGames_AboutThisGame.png?t=1709410542\" /><br>Simply Rotate is a physics based puzzle game where you rotate the level to get a ball to the goal while conserving rotation for future levels.<br><br>Think outside the box and efficiently rotate the world so you can complete complex puzzles.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2756950/extras/USCGames_GameplayFeatures.png?t=1709410542\" /><br><strong>Rotate Your World</strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2756950/extras/Gif1.gif?t=1709410542\" /><br>Rotate the level while avoiding obstacles and trying to conserve rotation.
