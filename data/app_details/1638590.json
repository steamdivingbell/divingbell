The only thing is, you are not part of that Race, as you are the Race Track Engineer. You need to make sure that the Race can take place, and you have a Car that that has different tools or add-ons you pickup while driving. As you drive around the Race Tracks you come across different obstacles that need to be cleared or you encounter stuck Racers that need to be given an extra push. You can use any of your tools to do the job. Some obstacles like the Walking Plants and the Visitors can only be defeated using your trusty Digger!<br><br>Besides clearing the tracks, every track needs a Finish Line. It is one of your jobs to put the Finish Line in place at the end of the Race Track.
