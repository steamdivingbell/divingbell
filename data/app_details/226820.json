While navigation may be cumbersome, it\u2019s definitely not a deal breaker, and it\u2019s far too easy to get sucked into the game and never want to stop until you reach the conclusion.\u201d<br>Gamezebo<br><br>\u201cThe mystery for Nancy to solve is as intriguing as ever, the writing and voice-acting is solid (though a bit cheesy in places), puzzles are challenging, and the atmosphere is suitably creepy. Nancy Drew: Ghost of Thornton Hall debuts two wonderful gameplay additions: an expanded hints system and the ability to fast-forward through dialog.\u201d<br>Common Sense Media<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s yet another solid adventure game in a series that has always been among the best the genre has to offer. I have no idea how Her Interactive manages to keep their level of quality so high in such a consistent manner, but whatever they\u2019re doing, it works.\u201d<br>True PC Gaming<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/226820/ss_42af67f3daedd9f6578c85d37744ae0baa07de3a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734461287","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/226820/ss_42af67f3daedd9f6578c85d37744ae0baa07de3a.600x338.jpg?t=1734461287"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/226820/ss_db77020517ec0945f1b5dbff5aca0677ad417900.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734461287","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/226820/ss_db77020517ec0945f1b5dbff5aca0677ad417900.600x338.jpg?t=1734461287"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/226820/ss_c6eb8e62d9e5652362470027792f6ece2fc4cc5d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734461287","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/226820/ss_c6eb8e62d9e5652362470027792f6ece2fc4cc5d.600x338.jpg?t=1734461287"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/226820/ss_19a3021d7c71a1dc4c1878ca8146ba7007036d92.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734461287","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/226820/ss_19a3021d7c71a1dc4c1878ca8146ba7007036d92.600x338.jpg?t=1734461287"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/226820/ss_6e4dd9d1cf3d0ed8d875c7766d337f2497596915.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734461287","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/226820/ss_6e4dd9d1cf3d0ed8d875c7766d337f2497596915.600x338.jpg?t=1734461287"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/226820/ss_a5a45109d140d7d3690f44b1a2c7b41a93ee39fa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734461287","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/226820/ss_a5a45109d140d7d3690f44b1a2c7b41a93ee39fa.600x338.jpg?t=1734461287"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/226820/ss_9c7f95794bab8081ce8af3ca35b35587e11aa4cd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734461287","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/226820/ss_9c7f95794bab8081ce8af3ca35b35587e11aa4cd.600x338.jpg?t=1734461287"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/226820/ss_09ed8c1b7f71ce9b1bad3332ee3d86e6f6821634.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734461287","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/226820/ss_09ed8c1b7f71ce9b1bad3332ee3d86e6f6821634.600x338.jpg?t=1734461287"},{"id":8,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/226820/ss_f6623edeebad0f00f9bbfc83d4b4d60d81f5d7e4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734461287","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/226820/ss_f6623edeebad0f00f9bbfc83d4b4d60d81f5d7e4.600x338.jpg?t=1734461287"},{"id":9,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/226820/ss_0545e1e71ca269b961e3a559b09bab19f2970924.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734461287","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/226820/ss_0545e1e71ca269b961e3a559b09bab19f2970924.600x338.jpg?t=1734461287"}],"short_description":"Some Families Keep Deadly Secrets!","steam_appid":226820,"support_info":{"email":"techsupport@herinteractive.com","url":"https://www.herinteractive.com/support/contact-support/"},"supported_languages":"English<strong>*</strong><br><strong>*</strong>languages with full audio support","type":"game","website":"https://www.herinteractive.com/shop-games/nancy-drew-ghost-of-thornton-hall/"}
