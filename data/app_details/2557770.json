Players will engage in firefights with AI opponents, which can result in blood splatter and other associated visual and audio effects typical of gun violence. There are no overly graphic or gory scenes, but the intensity of the combat might be intense for some users.\r\n\r\nDrug and Alcohol Use:\r\nWhile the core gameplay does not revolve around drug or alcohol use, there might be instances or missions where illegal narcotics or alcohol are depicted as part of the storyline. These elements are incorporated for narrative purposes only and are not glamorized.\r\n\r\nSensitive Topics:\r\nThere are no depictions of sexual assault, non-consensual sex, self-harm, or any other explicit sexual content in the game. However, given the nature of SWAT missions, players might encounter scenarios that touch on sensitive issues like hostage situations, threats, and high-stakes standoffs.\r\n\r\nStrong Language:\r\nPlayers can expect occasional strong language, typical of intense situations and reflecting the game's mature setting.\r\n\r\nGeneral Advisory:\r\nPrecision Point VR is designed to provide an immersive tactical experience, and while it aims to be realistic, all content is purely fictional. Players with sensitivities to any of the topics mentioned should proceed with discretion. Always refer to the game's settings for options to adjust or turn off certain content if needed."},"detailed_description":"Precision Point VR: The Ultimate SWAT Tactical Experience<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGameplay Overview:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDynamic Environments:<br />\r\nDelve into a variety of tactical environments ranging from tight, close-quarter rooms and hallways to more expansive urban settings.
