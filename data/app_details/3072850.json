{"about_the_game":"Apeiron is a hybrid real-time strategy game that combines elements of roguelike, card-battler, and god game. Players are able to 'play god' by growing their own Planets and controlling giant Avatars in battle.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Overview</h2>In Apeiron, you\u2019ll take the role of a godling, a newborn god summoned by High Goddess Cosmos to push back the darkness of the Mad God Chaos. Explore dungeons in our PvE mode, then head to the Arena to battle it out in PvP combat, or visit your Planet to oversee the growth of your very own world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Master the Cards</h2>Combat in Apeiron is real-time, fast-paced card-slinging action that combines the best of Slay the Spire and MOBA gameplay to offer a fresh new battle experience. You\u2019ll need to master your skills, read the flow of the fight, and play your cards at just the right moment to claim victory.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Embrace the Doods</h2>As you travel the godiverse, you\u2019ll be joined by dood Apostles, heroic (if hungry) lil\u2019 creatures who\u2019ll add their unique skills to your deck. There are six different Apostle classes to play with and no two Apostles are the same: each has a random selection of skills and a randomized power rating. Hunt for the perfect Apostles and form your own divine team of doods!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">It\u2019s A Miracle!</h2>Use elemental Miracles on your Planets to shape the world and answer the prayers of your follower doods\u2026or punish them for their sins. Depending on what kind of role model you are, your world will become a heaven on earth\u2026or a blasted hellscape. Whichever path you choose, you\u2019ll unlock new skills and shapes for your Avatar for when you head back into the dungeon.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Uncover the Truth</h2>At the heart of the godiverse lies a mystery, and it will be up to you to uncover the truth behind the war between High Goddess Cosmos and the Mad God Chaos. Meet strange and powerful gods, forge alliances, and enjoy an unforgettable story.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Doodaria Community</h2>We have a bustling community of doody gamers and streamers in our Discord!
