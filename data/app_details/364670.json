It's been three years since Skyflower's release! I built this game as a freshman in high school -- and there were definitely many things that I could have done better. Number one on this list is continuity. Many improvements were never developed in time, and at this point, Skyflower has (regrettably) joined the long list of unfinished early access games.<br><br>For me, Skyflower was an incredible learning experience. It's my first game that I've ever brought to release. As I start my next projects, I've got an idea where the roadbumps will be, and I've got plans to handle them. First things first: no Early Access! I'm only putting out finished games, and if you'll stick with me, I hope you enjoy them!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong>Fight your way to the top in this action-packed permanent death dungeon crawler! </strong><br><br>In a world of desolation and despair, a wanderer looked up and saw the endless sky staring back down at him. <strong><i>He would make it there, no matter what it took.</i></strong> Endless variations of randomly generated worlds and enemies await! <br><br>Challenge minibosses, complete puzzles, and <strong>shoot everything</strong> on your path to the skies.
