{"about_the_game":"Synthwave Ascension is a top-down shooter with roguelite elements and synthwave themes, where you try to survive against waves of enemy robots and cyborgs. The game focuses heavily on <strong>character progression</strong>, and the beginning may be slow and difficult as you start off very weak, but as you fight off the enemies you <strong>level up</strong>, get <strong>skill points</strong> and <strong>credits</strong>, which you can use to make your character <strong>stronger</strong> by investing in different attributes in the skill menu and buying upgrades, making it easier to survive. When you reach max level you can <strong>Ascend</strong> (Prestige) to start over at level zero again, but with <strong>even more</strong> skill points, allowing you to grow even stronger. <strong>But beware!</strong> Enemies will also get <strong>stronger</strong> and <strong>faster</strong> the more of them you kill.<br><br>The game is a <strong>work in progress</strong> and there are many <strong>planned features</strong> not yet implemented.
