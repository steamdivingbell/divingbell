{"about_the_game":"Do you like idle games? Do you like collecting cards? Do you like complex games that require you to read several pages of instructions in order to optimize your gameplay?

You'll use those cards to build an elaborate stat chain. The chain starts with your foundation card, passes through several support and monster cards, receives boosts from a variety of item cards, then ends with your hero card, who will use the stats passed on to them to battle a horde of monsters. Players with strong analytical abilities and a high degree of mathematical prowess will find themselves commanding a powerful stat chain that allows them to decimate their enemies with ease. Players with no analytical abilities and poor math skills will still succeed, but not quite as fast.<br><br>The average battle grid has 40 card slots. That means you'll need 40 cards to completely fill in the grid. It's one giant efficiency puzzle! Are you the type of player who wants everything to be perfectly optimal and efficient?
