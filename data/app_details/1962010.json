These are upgrades that last for the rest of the run and will really define your playstyle. Upgrades such as increased projectile range, larger Area of Effect sizes, increased resistance, improved agility and much more. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1962010/extras/Steam_Description_Title_TheVoidborn.png?t=1729087288\" /><br>The Voidborn have trapped you in a quarantine zone until you complete a Galactic Gauntlet of their design.
