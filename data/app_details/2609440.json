{"about_the_game":"This is the accompanying soundtrack to Hadrosaurus Software's brand new original parser driven adventure game for DOS: the Aching. This soundtrack contains all the musical theme tracks divided into disks by hardware device (Tandy 1000, MT-32). This game was originally designed around the hardware limitations of the Tandy 1000 line of home computers. In the 1980s, when Tandy was becoming a house hold name in the USA, sound hardware was generally limited, if not entirely non-existent, on home computers. Following on from the IBM PCJr, the Tandy employed the Texas Instruments SN76489 sound chip which could produce 3 independently pitched and attenuated square wave channels and a single attenuated noise channel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe are proud to provide this brief soundtrack programmed for the Tandy's 3 Voice sound chip and the Roland MT-32 MIDI Module. This soundtrack has been recorded on emulated hardware as sadly the original hardware has become relatively rare.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2609440/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1722609846","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2609440/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1722609846","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2609440/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1722609846","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2609440/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1722609846","categories":[{"description":"Additional High-Quality Audio","id":50}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This is the accompanying soundtrack to Hadrosaurus Software's brand new original parser driven adventure game for DOS: the Aching.
