{"about_the_game":"A unique 4X real-time historical strategy game, set on a procedurally generated globe. Play from ancient times, right through to the modern day. Expand your empire, build settlements, units, buildings and construct world wonders.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Make History, Your Way.</h2>The regions of the world, the seas and the names of the cultures are all procedurally generated, making each play-through totally unique.<br><br>Play against up to 8 procedurally generated AI <strong><u>Civilizations</u></strong>, each with their own individual personality and goals.<br><br>Alongside other major Civilizations, you will also interact with less developed <strong><u>Tribes</u></strong>. They can be either friendly or aggressive towards you, depending on their personality. <br><br>Develop a friendship with each tribe, who in-turn will gift you resources, units and more. Tribes can also develop or be helped to become major Civilizations during the course of a game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ethics and Culture</h2>Ethics are the guiding principles by which your empire acts and grows. Your ethics control how you are able to treat your population, as well as how you interact with other civilizations and tribes.<br><br>Select <u>Culture cards</u> based on your Ethics, which increase your productivity, and give you access to more powerful forms of governments.<br><br>Ethics can also enter your nation through migration and conquest, which can both help and hinder you. Having too many conflicting ethics in your empire can water down your cultural growth, and cause tensions - resulting in rioting and even a civil war.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Governments</h2>Each ethic has its own set of increasingly powerful governments, from primitive despotism right through to Digital Democracy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Science</h2>Research over 50 technologies, spread over 6 ages, starting in ancient times, and right through to the modern era.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Diplomacy</h2>Meet other Civilizations, with different personalities and goals. Sign peace treaties, create alliances, trade agreements and much more.<br><br>Also interact with developing Tribes, which range from being very friendly to very hostile. Foster a friendship with them to gain bonuses, or use them against your enemies. Eventually, with (or without) your help, tribes can become fully fledged civilizations.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Victories</h2>There are multiple ways to win the game, including world conquest, science and diplomacy. <br><br>With so much control over your society, the ways to play Nova Historia are truly vast, and each play-through is a very unique experience.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2682900/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1705801299","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2682900/page.bg.jpg?t=1705801299","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2682900/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1705801299","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2682900/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1705801299","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A unique 4X real-time historical strategy game, set on a procedurally generated globe.
