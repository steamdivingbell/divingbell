{"about_the_game":"The Distortion Engines Bolt-on contains 3 extra distortion effect engines to boost capabilities of SFXEngine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBand Distortion is a combined filter and distortion engine. Band Distortion will boost and clip the frequencies around a specified frequency band, a bit like an amplified peaking filter or a band pass filter with a built in amplifier. This is a very useful engine. You can use it to boost the top end a little to duplicate an audio effect known as an Aural Exciter. You can boost only bass or only mid-range frequencies and you can turn off part or all of the original sound to use the effect exactly like a band pass filter, or you can use the engine like a band in a graphic equalizer. Modulate the cutoff frequency to create distorted filter sweeps.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaximized Clip is a clipping effect. This engine hard-clips the signal at the specified level then boosts the result to maximum. This engine can be used to create distortion in an identical way to the Basic Distortion engine. Apply this engine to pure analogue waves to reshape the wave and reshape the sound.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nReflective Clip is a wave-shaping effect in the mould of Positor. Reflective Clip \u2018folds down\u2019 a top proportion of a wave and \u2018folds up\u2019 the bottom, then boosts the result to maximum. Waves are not folded down below (or up above) zero. On samples the effect is another form of distortion, but the effect on analogue waves is more useful and can transform saw, sine, and triangle waves without the need for filtering.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2729310/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734436159","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2729310/page.bg.jpg?t=1734436159","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2729310/c29ea21e4a445a3e9bb959652e80ceab5452cac8/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734436159","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2729310/c29ea21e4a445a3e9bb959652e80ceab5452cac8/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734436159","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Distortion Engines Bolt-on contains 3 extra distortion effect engines to boost capabilities of SFXEngine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBand Distortion is a combined filter and distortion engine.
