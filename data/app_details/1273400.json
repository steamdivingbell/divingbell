Each of them offers its own campaign that helps you climb the ladder of success. Friedenberg is based on picturesque cities of Southwest Germany, and features enchanting rolling hills and scenic riversides. Here, your objective is to contribute to the design of renewable energy solutions and enhance the local urban infrastructure throughout the campaign. Beyond these significant undertakings, you'll encounter diverse tasks that allow you to put every piece of equipment you earn to the test. Sunny Haven, on the other hand, is a truly American-style harbor city that you have to revitalize to put its tourism industry back on track. Altogether, more than 90 exciting contracts are waiting to be completed on both maps, so you can be sure you'll always come across something new to explore! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1273400/extras/CS22_-_AC1546_-_NewSteamStoreGifs_-_Over_90_Licensed_Machines_By_24_Brands.gif?t=1734016160\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dive back into the construction scene with a vehicle fleet that will leave you awestruck by its sheer size! Take your pick from a selection of over 80 machines from official licensing partners, all of which are faithful virtual recreations of their real-life counterparts. Look forward to a colorful mixture of vehicles from previous installments of the beloved franchise, as well as completely new additions to the game. The same goes for the manufacturers behind them: In addition to the well-known Construction Simulator partners Atlas, BELL, Bobcat, Bomag, CASE, Caterpillar\u00a9, Kenworth, Liebherr, MAN, Mack Trucks, Meiller-Kipper, Palfinger, Still, and the Wirtgen Group, you now have the opportunity to put machines by Benninghoven of the Wirtgen Group, CIFA, DAF, Doosan, Nooteboom, Scania, Schwing Stetter, and Wacker Neuson to use. Plus, while creating your character, you can choose an outfit featuring officially licensed personal protection equipment from our new partner Engelbert Strauss. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1273400/extras/CS22_-_AC1546_-_NewSteamStoreGifs_-_Two_Open_World_Settings.gif?t=1734016160\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You think that's everything? Far from it: The updates Construction Simulator has been provided with since its release not only contain patches, but free extra content too. Several new machines have found their way into the game, including the innovative wheel excavator EW100 by Wacker Neuson and a practical service vehicle for refueling and repairing. In addition, the Wacker Neuson EW100 and Wacker Neuson ET145 allow you to choose from a selection of different buckets to quickly adapt to surprising challenges on the construction site. Thanks to crossplay among PC and consoles including voice chat capabilities you can play with your friends regardless of the chosen platform. New tools and features in the form of enhanced terrain reworks, increased vehicle hall capacity, and a handy flashlight are also part of the updates. And since we don't want you to get bored by taking on the same jobs over and over again, an entirely new tourist area as well as various seasonal contracts have been added on top.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1273400/extras/CS22_-_AC1546_-_NewSteamStoreGifs_-_Build_With_Your_Friends.gif?t=1734016160\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">All in all, with the initial base game and its updates, Construction Simulator now offers you more than 100 contracts, over 90 machines, and, consequently, almost endless construction fun, which you can experience together with up to three friends in the multiplayer mode.
