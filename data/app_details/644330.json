However, the sound and smell of fire does not give you the time to contemplate the situation. Danger drives you out into the world, cold, and deadly darkness surrounding you. However, into the oblivion of your existence comes Ester. A small girl who serves as the eyes for the blind man and your connection to the world. Her words serve as your sight, painting the world into a horrific image filled with peril. Even this friendship is tenuous... distant memories haunt you. Your doomed past chases your dreams and threatens your desperate journey in search of safety and help.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/644330/extras/Ad_sprites.png?t=1533149081\" /><br><br><br>This is an indie developed project using overhead sprite art. This game is over world adventure style, requiring the player to discover the world not through the character's sight, but through feeling, sound, smell, and your companion, Ester's, insight.
