{"about_the_game":"<strong>Incursion</strong> is an indie FPS that aims for a unique wave survival experience with class-based combat for both co-op and singleplayer. Fight alongside strangers or friends and take advantage of unique weapon combinations, perks, and classes to win in this solo-developed indie title.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About</h2>Incursion brings a new twist on wave survival, heavily inspired by Team Fortress 2 and Call of Duty. Utilize unique weapons, abilities, classes, and map knowledge in this intense shooter. Incursion is also primarily developed by one person, which means you know your feedback is going to be heard.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Features</h2>\u2022 <strong>Online Co-Op:</strong> Fight alongside strangers or friends. Unique class compositions, perk choices, and weapons can change how the game is played!<br>\u2022 <strong>Singleplayer:</strong> Why make The Republic spend money hiring more soldiers when you're all that's necessary to do the job? A true one man army!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay Mechanics</h2>\u2022 <strong>Different Gamemodes:</strong> Whether you're in the mood for dodging enemies in an alley or defending a single point, <strong>Incursion</strong> features different gamemodes to offer a unique experience.<br>\u2022 <strong>Perks:</strong> Level up in-game using the new reforged perk system. Use different combinations of perks to cater to your playstyle such as increased damage, starting weapons or increased run speed. Of course there are also perks for players who like the extra challenge which intentionally make the game more difficult such as lowering your health, resetting your money in multiplayer or other debuffs.<br>\u2022 <strong>Play with anyone of any experience:</strong> The perk system allows you to choose your in-game level. Use lower-level perks so you don't 1-hit every enemy when playing with someone new, or max out your perks to take on the hardest difficulties.<br>\u2022 <strong>Classes:</strong> Take out a horde of enemies easier or be able to escape quicker - classes gives you an ace up your sleeve ability.<br>\u2022 <strong>Weapon Combinations:</strong> No more forcing you to play with the gun you want + a secondary you don't like in Incursion Classic or many other fps games. Now you can use any weapon in any weapon slot. I'm a long-range primary, close-range secondary guy myself.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Is this game for you?</h2>It's in my best interest to make sure you're happy with your purchase as I want to keep the reviews on this game as positive as possible.<br><br><strong>So, are any of these deal breakers?
