{"about_the_game":"Waves after waves of zombies are attacking a remote Elderly House. No help is coming any time soon. Defend the Elderly House as long as you can using the money earned by killing the zombies. And the money is needed to deploy defending units, which are not directly controlled by the player. You can also spend money to build new houses, enabling new unit types.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is intentionally not a horror game and it contains just a trace amount of dark humor. It's a side view tower defense genre with AI-controlled units. The player only decides when to spawn what types of units and how many by clicking corresponding buttons in the bottom of the screen. The creators of this game over the years have developed many titles designed for the elderly people and the theme selected for the first Steam-released game is to encourage people of all ages never to give up and keep positive attitude and sense of humor no matter what. Best of luck and have lots of fun!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2957550/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1718289649","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2957550/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1718289649","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2957550/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718289649","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2957550/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718289649","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Waves after waves of zombies are attacking a remote Elderly House.
