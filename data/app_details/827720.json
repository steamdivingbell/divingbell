{"about_the_game":"&quot;The T-72M2 Wilk (Polish for \u201cWolf\u201d) is one of the results of the Polish attempts from the late 1980s to upgrade its aging fleet of T-72M1 tanks in order to provide an effective counterpart to the western Leopard 2 and Abrams MBTs. The Polish development program resulted in several prototypes built between 1987 and 1990, featuring a more powerful engine, better Fire Control System and a Polish ERAWA explosive reactive armor kit. The Wilk program was concluded in 1990 but the lessons learned from it were used in the construction of the Polish PT-91 Main Battle Tank.<br />\r\nIn Armored Warfare, the T-72M2 Wilk is a Tier 6 Main Battle Tank. It\u2019s based on the T-72M1, which is an export version of the T-72A. That, along with improved mobility and the ERAWA ERA kit, puts it one tier above its predecessor. Performance-wise, it\u2019s comparable to the T-72B Main Battle Tank with its experimental Polish DRAWA FCS and the improved autoloader increasing its performance.&quot;","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/827720/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1692200259","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/827720/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1692200259","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/827720/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1692200259","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/827720/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1692200259","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Turn Notifications","id":32}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;The T-72M2 Wilk (Polish for \u201cWolf\u201d) is one of the results of the Polish attempts from the late 1980s to upgrade its aging fleet of T-72M1 tanks in order to provide an effective counterpart to the western Leopard 2 and Abrams MBTs.
