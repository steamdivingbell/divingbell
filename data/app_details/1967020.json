{"about_the_game":"This is the official Fan Pack for Siren\u2019s Call! I would advise against looking at it till you beat the game, because there are spoilers aplenty. But I too like to live dangerously, so do as you wish. <br><br><strong>A little about me:</strong><br><br>My name is Jacob Cumiskey. I am the head writer, sole programmer, and director of Siren\u2019s Call. As a native Floridian, I put a lot of myself into this game, but always viewed it as more of a personal project to help me make sense of the world rather than anything other people would actually be interested in. <br><br>I have never been happier in my life to be wrong. The fact people have found value in this little VN of ours means more than I can even begin to articulate, and I hope your experience with it either has or proves to be worthwhile. <br><br>While Siren\u2019s Call is free and always will be, you can support our team by buying this fan pack! It has 13 HQ wallpapers, 30+ original songs composed just for this game (7 of which were unused in the game itself), a development booklet highlighting how all this came to be, and a spin-off 30,000+ word short story written by my co-writer (and best friend) Cory Nungesser.<br><br>You also have my eternal gratitude. Support like this will help us make more games in the Siren\u2019s Call universe, so it is very, very appreciated. <br><br><strong>Siren\u2019s Call Development Booklet:</strong><br><br>This is a digital booklet that contains both concept art and my personal notes on what inspired the creation of Siren\u2019s Call. If there are parts of the game you\u2019re still curious about, this is a good place to look. <br><br><strong>HQ wallpapers:</strong><br><br>13 wallpapers for your computer to remind you of your trip to Siren\u2019s Call.<br><br><strong>The Siren\u2019s Call Official Soundtrack:</strong><br><br>30+ songs, all original, with music composed by The Pocket Protectors and lilyxjorge.<br><br><strong>Macaron Mayhem:</strong><br><br>This is a side story set in Cory Nungesser\u2019s Baker's Paradise series of comedy mini-novels, featuring Judith and Oliver as they join the secret-agent-baker John and his possum-haired friend Dan for some absurd adventures. If you wanted something a little lighter after the intensity of Siren\u2019s Call itself, this is the perfect pallet cleanser. You also get to see Cory\u2019s take on these characters as well, which is a cool thing by itself. <br><br>You can access all of these by going into Siren\u2019s Call\u2019s Properties after downloading and clicking the \u201cBrowse Local Files\u201d button. This will take you to the Siren\u2019s Call game directory, where the Fan Pack is included after purchase.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1967020/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1649878691","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1967020/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1649878691","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1967020/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1649878691","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1967020/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1649878691","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This is the official Fan Pack for Siren\u2019s Call!
