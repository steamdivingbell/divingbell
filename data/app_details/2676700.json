In the first Deadly Nightmare game, you played the role of John, but this time around you take the role of his grandmother. Surviving is not easy, since you need to explore supernatural locations, figure out what\u2019s wrong and uncover the truth as fast as you can. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2676700/extras/Anna_and_Helen.gif?t=1709184243\" /><br>Learn more about John\u2019s grandmother and her story <br>As we know from the first game, his grandmother dies, but we barely know any of the circumstances. All we know is that she captured the curses and John tries to stay away from them until 6 AM. In Deadly Nightmare Unwanted Heritage, we get to learn how his grandmother tackles the curses, and we also get to use her unique powers and intellect to make that a reality.  <br>John\u2019s grandmother lived in a mansion along with her family, also known as the Wilsons. Anna, his grandmother, also had a sister named Helen. Unlike the first game where the curse ended up going through the maid, in this game the curse goes through Helen, so you are going against the clock to try and save her as fast as possible! <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2676700/extras/All_Road_Helen.gif?t=1709184243\" /><br>Opening the gate of curses <br>This time around we also need to complete the Gate of Curses mission, and we do that via finding materials and tools that are necessary to open the gate of curses and defeat the queen. However, that will not be an easy task. It requires a lot of work and attention, and you\u2019ll end up near a lot of different enemies that you will have to face. Which is exactly why you need to be very well prepared, as this is a very demanding and challenging game.  <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2676700/extras/Book_of_Curses.gif?t=1709184243\" /><br>A large number of spells and creatures <br>Deadly Nightmare Unwanted Heritage adds a large number of new creatures, so you\u2019ll have those from the previous game and many others. On top of that, you also have realistic spells and curses. These help add to the excitement and authenticity of the game, while bringing you a very engaging and fast paced gameplay. You can even use poison to acquire supernatural powers, which will help you survive. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2676700/extras/Car.gif?t=1709184243\" /><br>Incredible visual effects <br>The sequel comes with an old-timey look, which makes it appropriate for the era we are playing in.
