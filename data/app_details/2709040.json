{"about_the_game":"You wake up stranded, after seemingly crashing your ship on The Sarcophagus \u2014 a giant, space-drifting, cosmic uterus holding an ancient demonic being known as ULTROS. Trapped in the eternal loop of a black hole, you will have to explore The Sarcophagus and meet its inhabitants to understand the part you play. <br><br>Are you the gruesome breaker of this cycle, or can you become a link from destruction to rebirth?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A PSYCHEDELIC SCI-FI JOURNEY </strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2709040/extras/steam_feat1.gif?t=1718182337\" /><br>ULTROS is set in a multifaceted realm - a vast alien landscape teeming with life. Grounded in science fiction, ULTROS comes wrapped in an eccentric art style and a mystical soundtrack from the visionary El Huervo, renowned for his work on Hotline Miami.
