{"about_the_game":"Evolution Survival is a game where the universe evolves around you. The plants you saw at the beginning will be different at the end, the rocks will have all eroded, the star will have ended, the atmosphere will have been stripped away and your planet may be gone. The animals may be more aggressive, if there are any left, maybe the animals all died out because you caused them to go extinct. Who knows what will happen when Natural Selection is at the wheel.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Evolution:</h2>The star, plants, animals, and rocks will change as time moves past, the game simulates evolution as if hundreds of generations happen with each new offspring. Animals may sprout 7 legs and 5 mouths, maybe trees will prefer to be upside down. The star, if massive enough may go supernova after expanding as it burns helium, becoming a neutron star or black hole. Perhaps it will just become a white dwarf and fade slowly for trillions of years. Maybe you will not get a star at all, just a failed star called a brown dwarf that glows for a little while before fizzing out. The Rocks will erode away and leave pebbles and stones for you to pick up and use in your crafting.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2640300/extras/SSEQ.png?t=1730245094\" /><br>*The Above image is not to scale<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2640300/extras/DEsc1.png?t=1730245094\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay:</h2> You will start on some land, preferably near the sea. Some sort of glowing object will brighten up the otherwise gloomy cosmos above you. Plants and animals will spring up in possibly great numbers, or perhaps few if you are in a freezing desolate wasteland. Just remember, Life always finds a way. Expand your reaches by building shelters with newly eroded stones that came off of cliff rocks, and tough wood from exotic trees. Maybe you'll get hungry and find some lovely fruit to eat! Maybe you get a pet rock or a pet animal and call him Bob! The possibilities are endless!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PVP:</h2>Since there are weapons in this game you can of course kill your friends. Imagine taming some sort of alien, evolved creature, that has some very cool quirks, and riding in on your friends base and distributing justice! How about raising that creature from the time he is a baby? Or maybe giving a &quot;gift&quot; to your friends in the form of an angry baby dinosaur looking...thing!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cosmetics:</h2>Do they exist? Yes. Do they give you any advantage? No. AND they NEVER will be monetized in any way shape or form. That's a promise. All it is, is a simple loot crate system that gives you points you can spend on cosmetics and can occasionally give you a cosmetic. You just equip them from a cosmetic work bench in-game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2640300/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730245094","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2640300/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1730245094","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2640300/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730245094","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2640300/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730245094","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2774010,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Evolution Survival is a game where the universe evolves around you.
