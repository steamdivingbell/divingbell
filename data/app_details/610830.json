{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A Mini-Dungeon adventure for 4-5 PCs of level four</strong></h2><br><i>Many years ago the witch priestess Segolia established a temple in the frontier town of Feluxia. In exchange for healing services to the town, Segolia only demanded the weekly sacrifice of orcs and other raiding humanoids. As the frontier has pushed further away from the town and the area has become more civilized, raids by monstrous type humanoids have become few and far in between. However, Segolia still demands her sacrifices, and some of the townsfolk have begun to disappear. The mayor has hired the PCs to investigate Segolia\u2019s temple as he believes her to be behind the recent disappearances, but is fearful of confronting her himself or sending the town militia for fear of offending her if she is not.</i><br><br>Mini-Dungeons are small adventures for Pathfinder which are setting agnostic and are easily inserted anywhere in your campaign.<br><br>Released on March 16, 2017.
