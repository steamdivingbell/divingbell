The first one is Deathmatch, where the player with the highest score at the end of each round wins. Runner is the second mode where one player is selected as the &quot;Runner,&quot; and the objective is to kill them while the Runner gets buffed health and unlimited fatigue. Finally, there's Trouble in Teddy Town, which is inspired by Trouble in Terrorist Town, where one player is selected to be the &quot;traitor,&quot; and everyone's goal is to figure out who the traitor is and kill them. The timer is adjustable, but the default is set to 5 minutes, and the player with the most kills at the end of the round is the winner.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProject Teddy should run smoothly on any computer that supports Vulkan, offering an optimized and seamless gaming experience.
