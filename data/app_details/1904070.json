And now Johnny is on his way to the Core of the global security system. Just imagine what a disaster can be caused by a pest in such a system. But never mind, the system is protected with lasers, traps and unbitable puzzles, and any pest wouldn't be able to squeeze inside. They are sure of it, but with ingenuity and sleight, any system isn't impenetrable ;)<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1904070/extras/dilemma.png?t=1645817422\" /><br>So, as we accompany Johnny on his journey, maybe we should stop him? Possibly destroying the world is a bad idea? But the Programmer created Johnny with a purpose, how can &quot;son&quot; go against his &quot;father&quot;? Why should the world be destroyed? <br>Oh, so many questions. I have a headache. Please, go and find your own answers in hidden parts of the system's labyrinths and help Johnny make the right decisions.","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1904070/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1645817422","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1904070/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1645817422","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1904070/extras/meet.png?t=1645817422\" /><br>Johnny is a funny and friendly guy.
