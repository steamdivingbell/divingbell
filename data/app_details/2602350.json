But after encountering the primordial fire, wars ravaged the continent and brought mankind to the brink of extinction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom this time, we speak of the dark swords, the most powerful weapons of the Lordhem kingdom. With these swords, Lordhem nearly conquered the entire continent. But the united kingdoms rebelled, and Lordhem lost its power.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirelink is the heiress of a dark sword left by her grandfather Fianor. She had never wielded the sword until her village, Osthem, was attacked by a host of creatures commanded by a huge demon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSeeking revenge and to protect Osthem from any future threats, Firelink wields the dark sword and embarks on an epic journey. Along the way, she begins to understand the sword's power and its influence on her, acquires new abilities, and faces huge monsters.
