{"about_the_game":"Skychaser features an exclusive Extra 330SC stunt aircraft created by established flight simulation developer IRIS Flight Simulation Software, accurately modelled down to the finest details, including a fully functional cockpit with authentic audio captured from a real-life engine.<br><br>The aircraft, which is fast and agile and has dominated four real-life World Aerobatic Championships, also features six exclusively designed custom paint schemes, making this a prized addition to your virtual fleet.<br><br>Additionally, Skychaser features four nail-biting missions, which will build your aerobatic skills and test them to the max!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gold Coast Cruisin\u2019 </h2>Giving you an opportunity to familiarize yourself with the Extra as you fly from Brisbane, Australia along the Queensland coast before landing at Gold Coast Airport. Put your precision to the test as you manoeuvre through this harrowing trial.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Canyon Challenge </h2>Taking you over the peaks and through the crevasses of Yosemite National Park, you will need to perform high-speed aerobatic manoeuvres down narrow winding valleys, over steep mountaintops and other unpredictable terrain. Expect sudden twists and turns, vertical climbs, and sudden dives on this rollercoaster ride of a course.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Snowdonia</h2>Set amidst the Welsh mountains in the UK, this is a course where you must demonstrate your mastery of the Extra 330SC by clinging to the sides of mountains whilst flying at high speeds, mere feet above the surface of lakes. This mission is unforgiving with a fast and frenetic pace.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Low Level</h2>Starting at Half Moon Bay Airport in San Francisco and flying along the edge of the Pacific Ocean to a landing at Shelter Cove, you will soar over the Golden Gate Bridge and marvel at the spectacular scenery of the Sierra Nevada range. To complete this mission, you must fly the entire course at top speed and under 500ft. Are your low level aerobatic skills up for the challenge?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/379564/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1537262215","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/379564/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1537262215","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/379564/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1537262215","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/379564/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1537262215","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Skychaser features an exclusive Extra 330SC stunt aircraft created by established flight simulation developer IRIS Flight Simulation Software, accurately modelled down to the finest details, including a fully functional cockpit with authentic audio captured from a real-life engine.<br><br>The aircraft, which is fast and agile and has dominated four real-life World Aerobatic Championships, also features six exclusively designed custom paint schemes, making this a prized addition to your virtual fleet.<br><br>Additionally, Skychaser features four nail-biting missions, which will build your aerobatic skills and test them to the max!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gold Coast Cruisin\u2019 </h2>Giving you an opportunity to familiarize yourself with the Extra as you fly from Brisbane, Australia along the Queensland coast before landing at Gold Coast Airport.
