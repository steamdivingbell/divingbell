{"about_the_game":"<strong>The city is your orchestra, you are the conductor, how should this rhapsody play?</strong><br><br><i>Welcome to City Rhapsody! Instead of layers and layers of bureaucracy; we, the citizens, decided to appoint one person, you, as the city's &quot;conductor.&quot;<br>Look out! We are very needy so it just may get chaotic. From everyday traffic congestion, changing power demand, accommodating our requests, and providing uninterrupted city services; to fighting out-of-control fires that threaten to wipe us out. Are you ready to take up the challenge?</i><br><br>City Rhapsody! is a low-poly, chill, sophisticated, and engaging city-building game with a twist of real-time strategy mechanics. The player plays the city's all-seeing &quot;conductor&quot; who gets to build all roads and buildings, tweak traffic configurations, open/close businesses, manage complex utility infrastructure, and command special city units.
