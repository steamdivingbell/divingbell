{"about_the_game":"Brawler Bots is a dungeon clearing + pvp game taking place in a world of robots. As you hack &amp; slash your way through unending armies of virus infected robots with your friends in order to save the leaders of this world and return peace to Topanok, you\u2019ll amass hoards of powerful equipment to amp up and customize your robot with your own unique sense of style. Once you\u2019re finished saving the world, take that same gear into PVP and test your metal against the top players in a highly competitive environment in several different game modes! Do you have what it takes to be #1?<br><br><br>Customization to your robot is unique! <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1911770/extras/test11.png?t=1670737433\" /><br><br><br>In the current day all of the societies of Topanok have fallen. A virus, coming from seemingly nowhere, has spontaneously corrupted all of Topanok and left only violent, warped bots to inhabit the husks of their fallen civilizations. Only four bots from Nicolia were lucky enough to avoid being infected by the virus. It\u2019s up to them to hunt down the leaders of the five fallen civilizations, beat the virus out of them, and discover the truth of the virus that has ruined Topanok!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1911770/extras/muta1.png?t=1670737433\" /><br><br>       MUTA - The Brute Bot: Muta is the perfect mix between defense and offense. If you\u2019re looking for a balanced playstyle where you can give it as well as you can take it, then this is the bot for you.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1911770/extras/sano.png?t=1670737433\" /><br><br>       SANO - The Tank Bot: Sano is the largest, most hardy bot. They\u2019re the shield of the party that rushes in head first and takes all of the beatings for their team. If your goal is to lead the charge and take on packs of infected at once, Sano is your pick.<br><br><br><br>       CAZA - The Fighter Bot: Cazo is speed and brutality incarnate. Built for violence, Cazo is the hardest hitting of all of the four bots.
