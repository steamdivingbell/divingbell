{"about_the_game":"In the year 2216 an AI equipped vessel was created and embarked on a journey to a potentially habitable planet. Its primary objective was to terraform and pre-establish a settlement for humans on the 4th planet in the Vega star system, over 25 light years from Earth. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe ship took 41 years to arrive at Vega 4. Upon reaching the planet the AI determined that it could be terraformed and a signal was transmitted back to Earth to send a colony ship to arrive 200 years later. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing the terraforming activity, the AI\u2019s directives were overwritten and it began to develop weapons technology. It spread over the entire planet in an effort to prevent humanity from inhabiting the planet.
