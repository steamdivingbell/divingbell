The guileless plot, the long-familiar narrative about the evil aliens, &quot;the planet was unable to oppose the enemy&quot; is a wonderful backdrop for a turbulent political thriller. Intrigues, secrets, betrayals, adventures and amazing disclosures.\u201d<br>StopGame<br><br>\u201cThe authors came up with a very fascinating plot: here there are many diverse characters with their skeletons in the closet, and intrigue, and unexpected plot twists. Moreover, there is a real, not imaginary, nonlinearity: at a certain moment, you must make a difficult moral choice, after which the plot will be divided into two independent branches. In addition, there is everything for a &quot;real manchkin&quot;. There are enough opportunities for comfortable character leveling: in addition to the main quests and the main enemies, you can always be distracted to explore the territory, arrange the genocide of the local fauna and find a couple of backpacks with valuable loot.\u201d<br>PlayGround<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/290850/ss_2643450f138c40ead5a44a5876f4375fe50f1d6f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576656447","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/290850/ss_2643450f138c40ead5a44a5876f4375fe50f1d6f.600x338.jpg?t=1576656447"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/290850/ss_b53e18de58ca7b8643d41a87eb2c32cbbe5f915e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576656447","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/290850/ss_b53e18de58ca7b8643d41a87eb2c32cbbe5f915e.600x338.jpg?t=1576656447"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/290850/ss_26d26cfb4328e980c62673e8ecd32edb170b1aa9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576656447","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/290850/ss_26d26cfb4328e980c62673e8ecd32edb170b1aa9.600x338.jpg?t=1576656447"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/290850/ss_8abb195781ee6090f2ad8f8eb941236680814924.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576656447","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/290850/ss_8abb195781ee6090f2ad8f8eb941236680814924.600x338.jpg?t=1576656447"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/290850/ss_8e9acb1d14d61f42c4fceb832c3d851f23a369de.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576656447","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/290850/ss_8e9acb1d14d61f42c4fceb832c3d851f23a369de.600x338.jpg?t=1576656447"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/290850/ss_246e3d3de029160b446c93a4b0d02bf7bff10102.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576656447","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/290850/ss_246e3d3de029160b446c93a4b0d02bf7bff10102.600x338.jpg?t=1576656447"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/290850/ss_35cf6bdc5246f21d4a65d3b822b5dc76de619c07.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576656447","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/290850/ss_35cf6bdc5246f21d4a65d3b822b5dc76de619c07.600x338.jpg?t=1576656447"}],"short_description":"X-TEAM is a role-playing strategy with a non-linear narrative.
