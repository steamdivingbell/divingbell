With the undead in tow, you traverse the shrine carelessly and corner yourself. As the undead creep towards you, in your desperation you make a final prayer to the shrine located in front of you. As you close your eyes and pray, there is sudden silence in the air. You sit there for a moment within the silence, and then suddenly a stern voice beckons you to open your eyes. There before you stands a hakama clad fox eared girl.
