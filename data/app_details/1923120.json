{"about_the_game":"You're a farmer in a small village, and you head into town on the day of the town fair, but out of nowhere, the princess is kidnapped by an orc, and it's your job to rescue her and maybe save the world along the way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFight through over 8 dungeons, with 12 completely optional dungeons, with the goal of testing your skill and making you harder to kill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFight through time and save Nakimbo island from the evil beings that lurk in the desert, along with a mysterious person who lives in a far away swamp, and unravel the mysteries, just be sure to think carefully about your decisions, as some have disastrous consequences.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUse abilities not meant for your class:<br />\r\nalong your journey there are many types of orbs, and when these orbs are used they allow the chosen person to gain powers that would normally not be available to their class, have a farmer shoot fireballs out of their hands or have a thief bring thunder down from the sky<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUse the right tool for the job:<br />\r\nInstead of choosing the best possible weapon, you may want to stratergise, bring the best possible weapon that you can get in order to properly equip yourself instead of using the same weapons that you always do.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChange gear on the fly:<br />\r\nIf you're in the middle of a battle and the enemy starts to change up what attacks they do, that won't leave you defenceless, use special orbs to change what abilities you have and you're current weapons and armour<br />\r\n<br />\r\nonly complete what you want to:<br />\r\nWith 12 optional dungeons, each with a unique gimmick and giving you special weapons not found anywhere else, making enemies easier to defeat, along with all of them having special properties not used by other weapons<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLevel up without game overs:<br />\r\nHead to an armoury and you might be able to increase skills like attack by battling training dummies, or fight against advanced battlebots, designed to tell when you're weak and stop fighting, however you want to get stronger, you can choose.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChoose the right decisions:<br />\r\nNPC's remember what is said to them, so make sure to say the right thing, otherwise you could lose a potential ally.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpice up your party:<br />\r\nMost NPC's would like to join you on your quest, but don't accept all of them, as there can only be 4 people at once, although some might have huge advantages, they most likely have flaws that may make battles harder, but the decisions are all up to you.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1923120/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736590602","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1923120/page.bg.jpg?t=1736590602","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1923120/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736590602","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1923120/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736590602","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam
