{"about_the_game":"Burned and lightly battered, this serial befriender is still truckin\u2019 along. In a stunning departure from the rest of the oeuvre, Vol. 4 of Hiveswap Friendsim uses visuals, music and text to tell a story where you meet two trolls and try to make friends with them. Navigate peaks and valleys, bathrooms and back rooms, busy streets and natural landscape, all to get another helping of that sweet FRIENDSHIP pie. The friendship is the filling. The crust is more friendship.<br><br>---<br><br>You just crash-landed on Alternia, and you\u2019re <strong>DESPERATE</strong> for friendship! Anyone will do...wait, who are those two trolls approaching you?<br><br>The <i>Hiveswap Friendsim</i> is a quick, loosely-canonical visual novel adventure following the efforts of the unnamed protagonist (that\u2019s you!) to survive and maybe even thrive on the harsh surface of ALTERNIA. Set in the time of <i>Hiveswap: Act 1</i>, this episodic visual novel\u2019s opening volume, written by <i>Homestuck</i> creator <strong>Andrew Hussie</strong>, is sure to satisfy <i>Homestuck</i> and <i>Hiveswap</i> fans who are eager for a darker stroll across the Alternian landscape. <br><br>Future episodes will arrive regularly as DLC.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/864980/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1564506848","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/864980/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1564506848","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/864980/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1564506848","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/864980/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1564506848","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Burned and lightly battered, this serial befriender is still truckin\u2019 along.
