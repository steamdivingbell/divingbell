{"about_the_game":"<br>It\u2019s Lady Veridiana\u2019s 2000th birthday. According to the pulsar stars, a Great Party shall be held tonight that will last for 666 days. All demons will come to rejoice to the beat of DJ Lazarus and dance their eyes out (literally). But there is one problem: Humans. As usual, these Party Poopers want to take advantage of the fact that demons are distracted and having a hell lotta fun. Their plan: invade Lady Veridiana\u2019s castle, murder her in cold blood, and get rid of the Demon Curse that has been ravaging the land for centuries.<br><br>Fortunately, you will not let that happen. As the newly appointed Black Architect, your task is to protect the party and the attendees at all costs. Use your budget wisely to augment the castle and build a Trap Deck full of deadly weapons with which to destroy the intruders. But be careful with harming the attendees; you don\u2019t want to trigger Lady Veridiana\u2019s legendary wrath! In this tower defense, deck building game, you need a good combination between strategy and flexibility!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1659530/extras/Description2.png?t=1706807994\" /><br><br><strong><i>- Build a labyrinthic castle worthy of a Lady Demon:</i></strong><br>You have a budget and you have to spend it well.
