{"about_the_game":"Welcome to Codebreaker: Defuse or BOOM, a thrilling and immersive puzzle game where you play as a master spy with a crucial mission - to crack a complex code set up by an adversary known as the Codemaker. With every tick of the clock, the stakes rise. Are you ready for the challenge?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCodebreaker is an exciting and mind-stimulating puzzle game, drawing inspiration from an age-old pencil and paper game that paved the way for the classic board game, Mastermind. This game is designed not just for entertainment, but also as a tool to hone your logical thinking skills. It presents a challenge that keeps your mind alert and engaged, making it an effective brain exercise.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe brilliance of Codebreaker lies in its universal appeal - it's a game that captivates players of all ages. It offers a fun and engaging platform for younger players to improve their problem-solving skills, while older players can enjoy the challenge and keep their cognitive abilities sharp. Its simple rules, paired with the need for strategic decision-making, create a game that is easy to understand but challenging to master.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Codebreaker, each round begins with the Codemaker setting up a cryptic sequence of four or five Code Lights. The Codemaker is cunning and can use any color combination, including the same color more than once. Your task, as the Codebreaker, is to unravel the color pattern, making strategic attempts to match the exact colors and positions of the secret code.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach attempt will earn you critical Hints. A green Hint indicates you've correctly matched a Code Light's color and position in the code sequence. A yellow Hint means you've identified the correct color, but placed it in the wrong position. A red Hint signals that a color is not used in the secret code at all. Be warned, agent - the Hints are not presented in any particular order. A major part of your mission is deducing which Hints correspond to which Code Lights.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCodebreaker comes with adjustable settings to fine-tune the difficulty and pace of your mission. Choose to reveal correct guesses immediately, limit the use of each color to one appearance, or set a countdown for a race against time. You can also adjust the number of Code Lights and the maximum number of guesses you are allowed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe immersive features don't stop at gameplay. A real-time timer keeps track of your progress, and a monochrome mode is available for agents with trouble with colors. The game also offers optional sound effects and background music for enhanced user experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the goal is to crack the code as fast as possible, Codebreaker is much more than just a race against time. It's about careful analysis, strategic planning, and the thrill of problem-solving under pressure. Perfect for fans of puzzles and spy-themed games, Codebreaker tests your wits and keeps you on your toes, mission after mission.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, agent, are you ready to take on the challenge? Do you have what it takes to be a master Codebreaker? Join the game now and let your adventure begin!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2552290/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1704434166","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2552290/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1704434166","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2552290/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1704434166","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2552290/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1704434166","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to Codebreaker: Defuse or BOOM, a thrilling and immersive puzzle game where you play as a master spy with a crucial mission - to crack a complex code set up by an adversary known as the Codemaker.
