{"about_the_game":"The S\u00fcdbahn is one of Austria\u2019s most important railways, a mountainous corridor that connects communities and industries to each other, and with neighbouring countries. It opened in sections between 1841 and 1848, spanning some 260 km between Wien and the Austrian-Slovenian border.<br><br>Its history has been rocky, with various conflicts seeing the line suffer as a result, and some sections were downgraded to single-track in the 1950s, however the line always recovered, and was in fact electrified in the 1960s. Today, the line is kept busy with cross-border passenger and freight traffic, and this experience awaits with RSSLO\u2019s S\u00fcdbahn route!<br><br>RSSLO\u2019s route focuses on the north-south corridor between Bruck an der Mur, Austria and Maribor, Slovenia, a distance of around 130 km and featuring 27 true-to-life stations. Speed limits vary, as does the terrain, keeping you on your toes as you traverse this naturally stunning and vital railway.
