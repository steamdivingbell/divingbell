{"about_the_game":"Kinetic: Break All Limits is a high speed 2d platformer with a focus on different types of movement. You play as Kin, a resident of a remote world, who must rescue his home from the existential threat of an alien menace and save his family.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe's always had a talent for athletics, but with his new suit technology, it feels like anything is possible. Interact with all shapes and kinds of terrain. Fly, jump, swing, and bounce through the world in whatever way you can imagine to reach your goals. Rather than a health bar, Kinetic uses a timer that slowly depletes. Getting hit by enemies will take away chunks of your remaining time, but destroy enemies to add to the timer and make it to the end of the level! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nInspired by games like Megaman X4 and Super Smash Bros. Melee, Kinetic is a fresh experience of movement and close-up combat with its own intricacies and tricks to explore.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Rollback netplay multiplayer. Fight other players, race them through levels, explore new places, and more!<br />\r\n-Fully integrated level editor! Create new levels easily, upload them to the Steam Workshop, or host custom matches to share them with your friends!<br />\r\n A lot of work has gone into make the level editor extremely fluid. Make complex maps in very short amounts of time!<br />\r\n-Adventure mode, featuring the story of Kin attempting to save his world and understand the aliens who are threatening to consume it. 6 completely different locations to explore, each with their own sets of enemies and levels<br />\r\n-Over 100 types of interactive objects and enemies!<br />\r\n-Powerups that allow you to overcome difficult obstacles and adapt to many levels and styles of movement","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1987710/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1708470349","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1987710/page.bg.jpg?t=1708470349","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1987710/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1708470349","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1987710/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1708470349","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Kinetic: Break All Limits is a high speed 2d platformer with a focus on different types of movement.
