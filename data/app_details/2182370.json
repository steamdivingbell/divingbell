{"about_the_game":"Experience the City that never sleeps. From the Big Apple to New Jersey suburbs, non-stop action awaits aboard premier electric traction. Serve the East Coast well with NJ TRANSIT and Amtrak\u00ae passenger equipment, brought to life in Train Sim World 3: Northeast Corridor: New York - Trenton.<br><br>Celebrate American rail with the Train Sim World 3: US Super Bundle!<br><br>Get to work on dense passenger operations aboard the iconic NJ TRANSIT ALP-46. All-modern, all-powerful, the ALP-46 is derived from its European cousin, the BR 101. Twinned with capacity-crunching Multilevel equipment, hurry commuters by the hundreds between Trenton and New York Penn Station from the workhorse itself or the striking cab car.<br><br>Go the distance in speed and style. Between the heart of all-stopper action, take charge and race through on express Amtrak services, powered by the stalwart ACS-64, also a relative of European motive power. Sprint between cities with Amfleets in-tow and get a taste of retro tech from the cosy confines of the ex-metroliner cab car, push becomes shove with 8600 hp on your tail!<br><br>Follow in the footsteps of railroad legends, the famed Northeast Corridor is rich in history and complexity dating back more than a Century. Now busier than ever, link the likes of Trenton Transit Center and Newark Liberty International to the most populous city in the United States. Whether riding express, or getting into the commuter flow, take on the challenge of all-hours action on America\u2019s East Coast.<br><br>Ride and Operate commuter trains out of bustling New York City, complete route tasks, or simply go railfanning from your favorite vantage point.
