{"about_the_game":"An epic battle between an old lady with a moustache and a lucha libre baby fighter is about to unfold. Unnamed Fiasco is a competitive local multiplayer game where your mistakes can actually help you. Every time your character dies during a match, a new clone is created to help you by repeating your past lives movements and actions. Hit pi\u00f1atas to collect power-ups and face the minute madness that completely changes the match flow. Fight on top of an old Mayan temple, a crowded bullring, a laboratory with deadly lasers and more. Face your friends on intense couch multiplayer matches or go solo on tons of action-puzzle challenges with online leaderboards.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>2-4 players local multiplayer:</strong><br>Play locally with up to 4 players on various multiplayer modes.<br></li><li><strong>Multiplayer modes:</strong><br>Face your friends on the multiplayer modes that include Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Dog Tag, Treasure Hunt and Police Chase. <br></li><li><strong>Multiplayer maps:</strong><br>Play on 24 multiplayer maps across six different map themes, including Temple, Bullring, Laboratory, Daycare and more.<br></li><li><strong>Singleplayer challenges:</strong><br>Face more than 40 singleplayer challenges that will require both skill, fast-thinking and puzzle-solving.<br></li><li><strong>Let your past lives help you:</strong><br>Everytime you die, a clone is created to help you by repeating you past lives movements and actions.
