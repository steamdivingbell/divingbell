{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Rat Hunter is a traditional first-person shooter set in a hi-tech environment.

Developers lay the emphasis on original ideas in visualization and gameplay design. The action takes place on a remote planet, which is located in a G-class star system. Its gravity, atmosphere and other conditions are pretty much the same as on Earth. The planet is rich in minerals, and the low depth of occurrence allows for strip mining.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The main character of the game is a freelance reporter who started an independent investigation in order to expose the truth behind the disappearances of workers of a corporate facility.
