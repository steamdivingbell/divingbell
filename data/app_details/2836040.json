{"about_the_game":"Welcome to Slayer Knight, a challenging side-scroller action adventure where you play as the Knight. As the Knight, you must slay a variety enemies with timing and spacing, perform intricate platforming, defeat the almighty Ancients, and do so as quickly as possible in order to become the Slayer Knight. In doing so, you will eliminate the chaos ravaging the Lands. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2836040/extras/knight3.png?t=1709104528\" /><br><br>At this point in time, the first two levels of the game is available--including the tutorial--where the intent is to get feedback from others as the rest of the game is getting developed. The tutorial will eventually be expanded to a full size level. I'm keeping the scope of Slayer Knight down to a total of four levels and a smaller, unlockable fifth level. The first four levels will consist of various enemies, platforming, and a boss at the end. The fifth will just have a boss that will test everything the Knight has learned throughout their journey in the Lands.<br><br>I hope you all enjoy the experience!","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2836040?t=1709104528","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2836040/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1709104528","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2836040/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1709104528","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2836040/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1709104528","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":2837400,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Welcome to Slayer Knight, a challenging side-scroller action adventure where you play as the Knight.
