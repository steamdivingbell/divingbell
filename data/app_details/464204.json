{"about_the_game":"Gold coated model of the BM03 Vegalta. Only a small number of these were ever manufactured. This model is coated in gold so that it reflects radar waves. However, this is not very effective. It is operated as a ceremonial unit or by commanders. It is armed with a Combat Burner (flamethrower) that is mounted on the arm. After jumping, pressing the jump button again will activate the jet thrusters. Flight is possible for short periods of time.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/464204/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1710751817","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/464204/page.bg.jpg?t=1710751817","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/464204/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1710751817","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/464204/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1710751817","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Gold coated model of the BM03 Vegalta.
