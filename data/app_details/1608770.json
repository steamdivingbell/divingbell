{"about_the_game":"Dive into the world of Steampunk Abyss. A world where the surface of the planet was ravaged as builders tried to create larger and deadlier automatons in a technology race. A race whose prize was riches and fame. Fortunately, a wise few saw the destruction that race would truly bring. These few banded together, combining their knowledge of artifice, architecture, mining, and  agriculture. The product of their work was the Abyssal Labs, a large compound where the boundaries of science could be pushed without the goal of destruction. This compound was self replicating and given the directive to protect humanity. Under these labs, the architects built a massive city as an ark to preserve them and their loved ones. This city was called Duc Pointe. <br><br>You play as Dax of the 9th Aeon, an outcast whose mother betrayed the citizens of Duc Pointe by turning The Abyss against them. This was done by changing the directive of the automatons from preservation to destruction. Duc Pointe has begun to rot away. Without access to resources in the mines and Abyssal Labs, its only a matter of time before the power turns off for good.<br><br>Run the Abyss. Bring back the resources necessary to rebuild Duc Pointe. Form a team to search the areas you clear of defenses. Redeem your family name by bringing back the treasures of the surface.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1608770/extras/shoot.gif?t=1631163055\" /><br>Dodge and shoot your way through procedurally generated levels. The Abyss is a dangerous place so be on the lookout for upgrades for your gun, your abilities, and dash. As you get closer to the surface, the Abyss will fight back. It will start building stronger enemies from the scrap you've left behind.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1608770/extras/loot.gif?t=1631163055\" /><br>After you've finished the fight, make sure to stop and scrap the husks left behind. Wouldn't want the automatons being rebuilt into something new... You can also trade generated scrap to increase the strength of the automaton you pilot. Increase its statistics to enhance the way you play. Maybe increase its durability so you can focus less on dodging incoming fire. Or focus on increasing the automaton's steam capacity so you don't have to worry about slowing down in the midst of a fire fight. You may even find a valuable byte that can be converted into a new gun piece<br> <br>Also you may want to keep an eye out for containers left behind by past Abyss Runners. They may just contain just the upgrade you were looking for...<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1608770/extras/Die.gif?t=1631163055\" /><br>Unlike past Abyss Runners, death is not the end. Dax and her mentor have assembled an automaton that can be piloted remotely. This allows Dax to push further than anyone in the past could without losing everything. Bring back pieces of lost technology. Bring back scrap that is the lifeblood of Duc Pointe. Death is a chance to prepare for the next attempt.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1608770/extras/BuildWeapons.gif?t=1631163055\" /><br>While running the Abyss you'll find ancient pieces of technology. These pieces of tech, known as Bytes, can be used to assemble more powerful weaponry, add abilities to your dash, and to your automaton. Gain new explosive abilities as you upgrade your drone to bring back more tech each time you die.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1608770/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1631163055","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1608770/page.bg.jpg?t=1631163055","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1608770/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1631163055","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1608770/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1631163055","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Dive into the world of Steampunk Abyss.
