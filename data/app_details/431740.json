Yet like sisyphus, you go on and on and you click the mouse over and over again and overtime you realize that these actions have meaning. Sisyphus may be considered a figure that has been punished in the cruelest way possible, yet to a person that understands the Chowderchu, they know that he has been given a task and while the task may never be complete - that task gives meaning. I feel strongly that Chowderchu is the same way, though I assume there is an actual ending somewhere.
