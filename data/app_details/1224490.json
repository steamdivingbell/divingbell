Note<br />\r\n  that this transformation will consume mana (represented by the tree in<br />\r\n  the lower left corner of the status bar); you can't transform unless you<br />\r\n  have enough mana.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* SPACE makes Nikita attack.  While in human form, she can only attack<br />\r\n  after finding a suitable weapon; while in wolf form, she can always<br />\r\n  attack with her teeth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* DOWN arrow key crouches if Nikita is on the floor, or climbs down if she<br />\r\n  is on a ladder, pole, vine, etc.  Also, you can use the DOWN arrow to<br />\r\n  pick up weapons and treasures, or type T (for &quot;take&quot;).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* UP arrow key gets up from a crouching position, climbs up, enters<br />\r\n  doorways, or makes Nikita flip upwards while hanging from a handhold.<br />\r\n  Also, if you hold the UP arrow when jumping, Nikita will flip into the<br />\r\n  air, gaining a little additional height.  Finally, if you hold the UP<br />\r\n  arrow while attacking in wolf form, Nikita will go into a frenzy and<br />\r\n  MAUL anything nearby.  You can still use the left and right arrows to<br />\r\n  move while mauling.  As with transforming, mauling is a special magical<br />\r\n  maneuver and requires mana; it continues to consume mana for as long as<br />\r\n  you hold down the attack button to keep mauling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* CTRL key activates levers, switches, and SAVE GAME signposts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* TAB or &quot;T&quot; key picks up any object Nikita is currently positioned over.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* &quot;U&quot; or &quot;G&quot; key picks up and immediately use any object Nikita is over.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* &quot;A&quot; or &quot;I&quot; key accesses the inventory menu, allowing you to use, drop,<br />\r\n  or throw items in Nikita's inventory.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* F1 through F8 activate the object in the corresponding slot of Nikita's<br />\r\n  Inventory or Pack.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* 1 through 5 activate the magic spells Nikita can learn during the game,<br />\r\n  which appear as small icons between the two snakes on the status bar.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* ESC and &quot;P&quot; (Pause) keys pause the game and enter the main menu.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* F10 displays the help file which also contains all of this information.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHealth &amp; Mana<br />\r\n-------------<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the status bar across the bottom of the display, you will see a large<br />\r\ngolden jar containing a bubbling blue fluid.  This fluid is the Seltzer of<br />\r\nLife and represents Nikita's health.  When nikita is injured or hurt, the<br />\r\nfluid level goes down.  If the jar becomes completely empty, Nikita dies<br />\r\nand you have to start over at the beginning of the level, or at the last<br />\r\nplace you saved your game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou will also see a tree in the status bar. This is the mana tree and<br />\r\nrepresents Nikita's mana level.  Mana is used to transform from wolf to<br />\r\nhuman form and to invoke magic attack spells.  The number of leaves on the<br />\r\nmana tree represents how much mana she has. As Nikita uses her mana, the<br />\r\nleaves fall from the tree and must be replenished by picking up gems or<br />\r\npotions or finding sanctuaries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpells<br />\r\n------<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs Nikita progresses through the game and defeats enemies, she will learn<br />\r\nadditional magical spells, which you can activate by pressing the 1<br />\r\nthrough 5 keys on the keyboard.  As with transformation and mauling,<br />\r\ncasting these spells requires mana; more powerful spells require more<br />\r\nmana.  The first two spells, Stinger and Fireball, are available in the<br />\r\nSHAREWARE version of the game; however, the three most powerful spells,<br />\r\nDoball, Ghibli, and Lightning Bolt, are only available in the REGISTERED<br />\r\ngame.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are also various magical scrolls, potions, and wands scattered<br />\r\nthroughout the levels of the game, which Nikita can pick up and use.  Some<br />\r\nof these items correspond to the spells described above; in this case,<br />\r\nNikita does not have to have learned the spell yet in order to use a<br />\r\nscroll or wand to cast it, and using a scroll or wand does not consume<br />\r\nmana since the mana comes &quot;pre-packaged&quot; in the magical item.  There are<br />\r\nalso various other powerful magical items that do not correspond to any of<br />\r\nthe standard spells; you will learn about them as you encounter them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmulets<br />\r\n-------<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are three types of magical amulets which Nikita can collect during<br />\r\nher adventures. These amulets are very valuable and should always be<br />\r\ncollected whenever possible.  There is exactly one amulet on every level.<br />\r\nIf you miss the amulet on a level, then that level will be marked in red<br />\r\nrather than in blue on the episode map, indicating that you may want to go<br />\r\nback and replay that level later to find the amulet.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHealth amulets are blue. If Nikita has more health amulets, her blue<br />\r\nhealth level will go down more slowly when she is hurt or injured.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMana amulets are green. If Nikita has more mana amulets, her mana level<br />\r\nwill not go down as quickly as she uses mana.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStrength amulets are red.  Nikita's strength is increased when she<br />\r\ncollects more of them, making her attacks more powerful against enemies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInventory<br />\r\n---------<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen Nikita picks up objects in the game, they are collected into her<br />\r\nInventory or Pack. There are eight slots in Nikita's pack. Each slot may<br />\r\nbe able to hold more than one of a given type of object.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSelecting &quot;Inventory&quot; from the main menu will display a new menu of the<br />\r\nobjects in Nikita's pack if there are any. You can also access the<br />\r\ninventory menu directly with the &quot;A&quot; or &quot;I&quot; key.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you select an item from the inventory, a new menu will appear asking<br />\r\nyou what you would like to do with that object.  You can either &quot;use&quot; the<br />\r\nobject or remove it from the inventory by &quot;dropping&quot; or &quot;tossing&quot; it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince more than one of the same type of object can be stored in each<br />\r\ninventory slot, you are also given the option of taking the action on just<br />\r\none of the objects or on all of the objects within the slot.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFunction keys F1 thru F8 are shortcuts to using the items in Nikita's<br />\r\npack.  For example, pressing F1 will use one item from the first slot in<br />\r\nthe inventory.  To make it easier to know at a glance which slot<br />\r\ncorresponds to which function key, there is a small empty space on the<br />\r\nstatus bar between the F4 and F5 slots, corresponding to the space between<br />\r\nthe F4 and F5 keys on most keyboards.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1224490/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1589560028","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1224490/page.bg.jpg?t=1589560028","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1224490/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1589560028","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1224490/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1589560028","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Depictions of fantasy cartoon violence.
