As you navigate this enchanted labyrinth, you'll encounter a horde of undead creatures lurking in the dark, ready to challenge your bravery. Gather your courage and arm yourself with sweet treats, for every candy you collect fuels your strength against the ghastly foes that roam the night. Your heart races as you inch closer to the legendary stash of candy waiting at the end, promising unimaginable delights. Will you conquer the maze and emerge victorious, or will the undead claim you as their own?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Spooky Maze is a casual maze game with top-down shooter elements. You will traverse a maze. Collect the candy on the path while you search for the candy stash at the end of the maze. Each play through will be different, the levels are procedurally generated and of different sizes. Choose between Jack o Lantern and the Witch characters. This is a casual game where completing the maze is the main goal. There is no score or leaderboard, just some maze solving fun for Halloween. Happy Halloween.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3281840/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730416037","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3281840/page.bg.jpg?t=1730416037","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3281840/ff65d33b391b6ebdc83051f57cb216281933ff86/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730416037","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3281840/ff65d33b391b6ebdc83051f57cb216281933ff86/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730416037","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3281840/extras/SpookyMazeTitle.png?t=1730416037\" />Step into the spine-chilling realm of Spooky Maze, where shadows dance and whispers echo through the twisting corridors!
