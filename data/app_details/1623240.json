A sudden power outage has plunge the streets of this town into darkness. As the hands of supernatural forces manipulate your reality, you seek a means of escape. After what seems like an endless struggle, you discover what seems to be fragments of your reality. By collecting these fragments from the depths of the Realmverse, you can slowly piece together your escape from this mirrored prison. The Realmverse is a constantly-changing maze. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1623240/extras/secondHeader.png?t=1737336630\" /><br>The Maguntsche Demon is a dark entity with only one goal in mind. As you explore the Realmverse, this demonic creature is out for your blood and will do anything to stop you from collecting the reality fragments. Your only line of defense against The Maguntsche Demon is your flashlight. This tool has limited usability and could potentially anger the entities of the Realmverse more. It is important to use your environment and flashlight wisely to your advantage.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1623240/extras/thirdHeader.png?t=1737336630\" /><br>The archives provides additional stories and tales to explore within The Maguntsche universe.
