Practice your moves in relative safety, or just watch the pretty explosions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Survival</h2><br>Unlocking the bonus Survival Mode gives you a huge upgrade budget to customize your ship just once then hurls you into an endless battle against increasingly ferocious odds and a limitless armada of enemy Warships.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Duel</h2><br>Face the elite enemy ace pilot in the campaign and you'll unlock the bonus Duel Mode where you can challenge the ace alone (with his 5 elite henchmen... hey, he is a bad guy!)","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"ROCK ON","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/344300/61ce2bd4c4fbbd3df852acb4b22542e9465d7fd1.jpg"},{"name":"VOGON CAPTAIN","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/344300/565b2cd3ed7bb22ce2cbdaf83da795c7821ece7f.jpg"},{"name":"ED STRAKER","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/344300/fc39d0cc5ab31fed07541ef9a4a8054e1a11daa0.jpg"},{"name":"CHECKPOINT 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/344300/31e40bdc55e0cfb3436149e1221a8d9c3a8023e1.jpg"},{"name":"CHECKPOINT 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/344300/e8eca542bf2adec09e039f3810db46f628f92f62.jpg"},{"name":"CHECKPOINT 3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/344300/986fe167d123f92660ec52f097cc9fd549490ef9.jpg"},{"name":"MAN-O-WAR","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/344300/de77811ffd5e9fdac0cdea8b4216129b3de13ecb.jpg"},{"name":"SUPERMAN-O-WAR","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/344300/a85629e131f769cb03b7d26d78c9d3c581afc1ce.jpg"},{"name":"TITAN FELL","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/344300/4eaf6cbbbade90bf9bc7aa0591c75e1ce1f3af8a.jpg"},{"name":"GENERAL ORDER 24","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/344300/4ed9c902d54bea85043a6f6726375d4af107b973.jpg"}],"total":46},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/344300/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1447367672","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/344300/page.bg.jpg?t=1447367672","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/344300/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1447367672","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/344300/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1447367672","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About the game</h2><br><strong>Heckabomb</strong> is a twin-stick shooter for Windows.
