{"about_the_game":"<i>Only one superpower will gain the upper hand in World War III!</i><br><br>The thunder of the cannons of World War II has died down.

USSR vs USA is a full-fledged add-on for Strategy &amp; Tactics: Wargame Collection that will make the perfect gift for every fan of alternative history. How would have the situation developed if the Cold War had turned into a global conflict? In the spring of 1948, Beijing becomes the target of a nuclear attack. The next day, the Soviet Union and China start a grand-scale incursion into North America. Fiercely resisting the invaders, the forces of USA and Canada slowly retreat inland... WWIII engulfs all of the continents in the blink of an eye! Pick a side in these alternative history campaigns and scenarios. There is also a surprise waiting in the Antarctic for those who love conspiracy theories: under the cover of polar night, the final Third Reich army is preparing to take its revenge...
