I am very excited to finally meet you on Steam. Survivors, as my first game in entrepreneurship, has been online on mobile terminals for some time. Looking back on these days, the development team has expanded from 2 people to more than 10 people, and has experienced twists and turns and the COVID-19 pandemic; during this period, we have done many other projects for the survival of the team; we have developed survivors intermittently in the middle, and this year there are only 1 programmer partner and Tata; the fewer people have made us more focused on continuing the development of survivors, and we have also made the PC version after many hardships this time. I hope everyone likes it.<br><br>The PC version will be released soon, and based on this version, the complete appearance of the Gunner plan will be gradually realized through continuous iteration. The update content of the PC version will be completely different from the mobile version. I hope everyone will join the game, give us suggestions, and improve the game. Thank you everyone! !</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Survivors Of The Zombie World is a 3D pixel-style zombie survival game.
