One after the other player has to place it on an available connector sticking out of the board sides. Placing tiles forms groups of blocks, offices, roads, and parks. Players score points for strategic placements and creating large groups. On higher difficulty levels connectors will have different colors and the player will have to match the tile platform color he has on to the color of the connector he wants to place his tile on to.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1945860/extras/clip_2.gif?t=1733127404\" /><br><br>Some tiles include quests that will require connecting a specific amount of objects.
