You can customize Claire with body mods, cybernetics and an intricate skill tree system. Upgrade her car to traverse different terrain and withstand the effects of weather, night and day.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Battle in Your Bitchin' Ride</strong></h2>Equipped with weapons and other tech, Claire\u2019s car is your best friend against dangers in The Dead Zone. Hungry animals are ready to rip you apart. Murderous bandits will rob your lifeless corpse. Prepare for the worst with your car and its arsenal of weapons.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Race for Glory</strong></h2>The world may have come to an end, but who said we can't have fun? Ride or die in red-hot races to be the best on the post apocalyptic circuit. 10 tracks in multiple biomes, innumerable races, all of them equal measures deadly and glorious. Indulge in extra game modes such as destruction derby-style racing and twisted battle arena, all while roading out to a thumping synthwave soundtrack.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1839200/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1688986065","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1839200/page.bg.jpg?t=1688986065","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1839200/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1688986065","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1839200/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1688986065","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Cartoon Violence"},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1839200/extras/addtowishlist_gif.gif?t=1688986065\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1839200/extras/ezgif.com-gif-maker__90_.gif?t=1688986065\" /><br><br><strong>RoadOut </strong>is a story-driven adventure that combines top down action-RPG elements with rubber-burning driving mechanics.
