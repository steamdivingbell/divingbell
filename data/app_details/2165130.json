Explore the dangerous world of Gloom, a planet inhabited by bloodthirsty tribes of insectoid creatures as one of four main characters with distinct stories:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Pox</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Verrick live by the harshest rule of nature: only the strong survive.  While most Verrick are imposing monsters, the lowly slave Pox the Vile is no more than a runt, the kind that Queen Agony routinely discards so that the Verrick Horde will grow stronger.  But, Pox has guts and ambition, and he's got more ruthlessness inside of him than any other Verrick.  He'll do whatever it takes to crush Queen Agony, claim her throne, and conquer the world!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Capella</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the village of Dream, the Chosen One of the Ahm awakens on the first day of her journey.  She is Capella, the last of the Sua-Roo.  Two warrior-priests from Dewdrop City have arrived to escort her to the Moonlight Temple.  The road is long and dangerous, but Capella's faith will guide her through the horrors of the outside world.  After all, she is the Chosen One.  She will give birth to God.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Phlegm</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Of all the tribes of Gloom, nothing's lower than a Skyx, and Phlegm is the lowest Skyx there is.  But, he doesn't care much about what the rest of the world thinks of him; he's content hanging out with the rest of his dirtbag friends, picking pockets to get by, and doing odd jobs if he <i>really</i> has to.  After picking the wrong pocket, Phlegm is forced into the employment of one of the most unsavory characters in Raja Balquar, which triggers a series of events that will lead Phlegm to one of the most deeply kept secrets in all of Gloom.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Shear</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The mating ritual failed.  The seed did not take, and Shear's eternal mate lay dead on the ground, his head consumed to nourish a child that will never exist.  Shear is the Wind that Cuts, one of Shen-Lan's greatest warriors, but the traditions of the Reiken'O are strict: there must be a balance between life and death.  A warrior that can only take life will upset the balance.  On this day, Shear awaits her own ritualistic suicide.  But, for a moment, she looks up and sees her eternal mate once again, headless, his body translucent, pointing towards the village exit.  She soon finds her legs propelling her forward, down the mountain, her hand twitching over the hilt of her blade as she attempts to severe the chains that bind her.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Features:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">-Four full-length stories, each with unique threats to the world of Gloom.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">-Little redundancy between characters.  Each story will feel fresh, there is little repeated dialogue, and even the monsters that share locations will generally be unique to the characters.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">-A dark, alien atmosphere inspired by the <i>Lennus</i> series.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">-About 40 recruitable mercenaries, each with their own playstyle and personalities.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">-Mercenaries will also react to situations differently.  One might betray you for a better offer, one might run away from combat if fighting a monster they've been traumatized by, one might gain new abilities if you help them achieve revenge--the mercenaries have all been integrated into the world and events you'll come across as you explore.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">-On-map encounters similar to <i>Chrono Trigger</i>.  Each encounter is methodically placed and integral to the level design, and most encounters can be avoided by paying attention to your surroundings.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">-Turn-based combat with a visual turn indicator.  Make tactical decisions about who to take out first, or utilize one of several debilitating status effects to manipulate the turn order in your favor.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">-Devour your enemies!  After defeating a monster, you can eat their corpses to gain buffs and health bonuses.  Or, you can poison corpses so that enemies who try to devour them get an unpleasant surprise.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">-Magic operates differently depending on the biome you're in.  For instance, casting Sludge Bomb in a swamp will damage and slow your opponent, but if you do it in a cold mountainous region, it won't hit as hard, but the slow will be much more effective.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">-Lots of powerful equipment hidden behind secret, horrifying bosses.  The world of Gloom is a terrifying place...you'll have a blast exploring it!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">-Modifiable weapons give players more control over the unique properties of their equipment without being chained to the base attack stat.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">-Go on a crime spree with Phlegm, who can steal from anyone in or outside of battle.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2165130/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735849340","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2165130/page.bg.jpg?t=1735849340","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2165130/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735849340","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2165130/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735849340","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"The World of Gloom is violent and unforgiving.
