Starting with his father's Atari, he deepened his love for games in his teenage years on Squaresoft's JRPGs and late 90's survival horrors, such as Silent Hill and Resident Evil. <br><br>As he grew up, this passion turned into his career. He studied game development at Seven Computa\u00e7\u00e3o Gr\u00e1fica, and achieved his college degree in Information Technology Systems from Unicarioca. He taught Game Development and 3D Modelling at Seven and Pix, helping others like him to pursue their dream against the odds of the Brazilian gaming scene. <br><br>His dream was to build experiences that took players to the same places he went as a gamer in his teenage years, establish his career as a game designer, and support his family. <br><br> <strong>Pedro was affected by the great mental challenges imposed by Borderline Personality Disorder (BDP).</strong> In the shadow of his loss, we hope to raise awareness about this condition. Pedro was so much more than his diagnosis; and he will be deeply missed by those who loved him.
