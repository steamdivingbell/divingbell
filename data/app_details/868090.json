SP, ranked &amp; MP options also unlocking creatures and upgrading them. Learning to use your creatures in the right order to combat your enemies while placing in the right areas is important for the win.  Teleport to areas to watch the battle unfold is very impressive and gives a good sense of the scale of the creatures.   Highly recommend this VR game.\u201d<br>Dick Rambo<br><br>\u201cStrategic duel card games aren\u2019t that easy to come by. We decided to check out a few of these games last week and received some mixed results in the process. Battle Summoners VR is still in Early Access, but the game is pretty interesting in its current form. Owners of the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift can pick up the game for under $10 right now.\u201d<br>thevrbase<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/868090/ss_11b5c865ce3de8ad8f77c2eb4648959d737abe75.1920x1080.jpg?t=1531104782","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/868090/ss_11b5c865ce3de8ad8f77c2eb4648959d737abe75.600x338.jpg?t=1531104782"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/868090/ss_291e795209ec8796a50dc941515a1140dcadb1ca.1920x1080.jpg?t=1531104782","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/868090/ss_291e795209ec8796a50dc941515a1140dcadb1ca.600x338.jpg?t=1531104782"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/868090/ss_fc20d72fd026d048e3904abc55b4e6ce0c15be4a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1531104782","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/868090/ss_fc20d72fd026d048e3904abc55b4e6ce0c15be4a.600x338.jpg?t=1531104782"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/868090/ss_3c4c5bf0349f0fd8f19eda50e9d72fb0f237196f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1531104782","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/868090/ss_3c4c5bf0349f0fd8f19eda50e9d72fb0f237196f.600x338.jpg?t=1531104782"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/868090/ss_7ac3f12a35fd4cbf61e9991cc76b7f9880bf23b4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1531104782","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/868090/ss_7ac3f12a35fd4cbf61e9991cc76b7f9880bf23b4.600x338.jpg?t=1531104782"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/868090/ss_3a3f8daf227cfd3417267cda3f0018e20142c760.1920x1080.jpg?t=1531104782","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/868090/ss_3a3f8daf227cfd3417267cda3f0018e20142c760.600x338.jpg?t=1531104782"}],"short_description":"&quot;Battle Summoners&quot; is a strategic duel card game for Virtual Reality.
