{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">&quot;Dark Ranger&quot; is a light Rogue RPG. Veterans who have retired from the human battlefield have regained their glory in the secondary battlefield against monsters. In the Kingdom of Mist, there is a special trial. If a knight who has reached the age of 40 has not conquered a city and has not been awarded a knighthood, he will be judged as a &quot;frail person&quot;. The past will be erased and he will no longer have the right to continue serving. The fate of the faint-hearted people is not good. The long-lasting war has caused the family industry to decline. Some people have become postmen because they are familiar with the kingdom's transportation fortresses after years of wandering. But most people are discouraged and live in the simple taverns in the town.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">However, a new threat is approaching in recent years. The monsters in the dungeon are becoming more and more active at night, and the nobles are worried that these monsters will rush to their manors sooner or later. So they began to recruit adventurers. The regular troops have no time to take care of these unimportant secondary battlefields, so the skilled swordsmen and the unhonored ones are the best candidates. You are such an unhonored one. Before going on a mission, the town sheriff will arrange a brief combat training for you. Forget your years of experience fighting humans, the battlefield here is completely different. The time in the dungeon does not pass evenly, it is controlled by the big clock of the dark church in the center of the earth. When the big clock swings to the east, human time freezes, and when it swings to the west, the monsters' time freezes. To win the battle in the swing of the clock back and forth.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3424920/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736600867","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3424920/page.bg.jpg?t=1736600867","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3424920/1592087bc1aea7a243e6b01ebbef4d631bf27689/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736600867","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3424920/1592087bc1aea7a243e6b01ebbef4d631bf27689/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736600867","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">&quot;Dark Ranger&quot; is a light Rogue RPG.
