But we perfectly know this maniac, we understand what he is capable of ... Devilry, which is literally saturated with the forest, will make the hearts of lovers flutter like never before. Can you figure it out without losing your mind? Can you step over your fears and rush into the dark unknown, hiding behind the branches of shrubs and trees, meandering between your brain convolutions and paving the way straight to hell? Good old Matanga is always happy with new human meat, and we are happy with it, because DNA expertise will dot the i's. But will Matanga give us his bio-material so easily? ...<br />\r\nThe game will feature:<br />\r\n1.
