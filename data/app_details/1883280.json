{"about_the_game":"Drag Battle Top Fuel is a racing game where you get to drive the fastest accelerating vehicles on earth, Top Fuel dragsters. With an estimated 10,000 - 12,000 horsepower these machines are not just incredibly fast they are also a handful to control. Going in a straight line is not as easy as it sounds with that much power. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou will be racing for best reactions times, half track times, quarter mile times and highest speeds all while trying to keep the vehicle in a straight line. The action is short, fast and intense with so much happening in a short amount of time, your reaction time will be the difference between winning, losing, and crashing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDrag Battle Top Fuel simulates elements involved in drag racing. Burnouts are an essential part of drag racing, getting the tyres to a suitable temperature for the conditions is vital to getting the maximum amount of traction. You will have to do this in Drag Battle Top Fuel before racing to get your tyres as close to the ideal temperature as possible, otherwise traction will become an issue and the Top Fuel dragster will become very difficult to control. Crashing at such high speeds causes a spectacular amount of damage to Top Fuel dragsters. Drag Battle Top Fuel includes a dynamic crash systems which simulates what happens when a Top Fuel dragster loses control. When this happens the frame of the car will break into pieces, components with break off the dragster and body panels will crumple.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nParachutes are needed to slow a Top Fuel dragster down from over 500 km/h, brakes would simply fail at these speed if used. Deploying the Parachute in Drag Battle Top Fuel will not only slow down the dragster it will also stabilize and keep the dragster in a straight line allow your Top Fuel dragster to come to a safe stop after making a pass, simulating what happens in drag racing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRace against AI Top Fuel dragsters with varying levels of difficulty which is chosen by the player at the start of each competition. Choosing more difficult settings comes greater rewards and greater losses if you crash.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDrag Battle Top Fuel has an in game economy. Winning rounds and competitions will earn you money, crashing will loose you money and losing will net you nothing. You can spend your winnings on customising your Top Fuel dragster by changing colours and paint schemes, or buying custom liveries to make your vehicle stand out. There are a number of different liveries featuring retro, modern and futuristic designs. All unique and eye catching designs, which can be purchased with winnings or by completing challenges.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can choose to race from a third person perspective behind the vehicle for an arcade experience, where you can view the flames shooting from the exhaust, tyre deforming from extreme forces, smoke flying off the tyres when doing a burnout, or seeing the effects of crashing the dragster. For a more immersive experience you can switch to first person perspective where you race from the drivers perspective in the cockpit of the Top Fuel dragster.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe action takes place on a drag strip that has been modelled and texture from satellite images and photographic references to accurately emulate the look and scale of a real drag strip. The map has different times of day and weather which you can choose before entering a competition. Each map offers a unique feel, with realistic lighting and visuals make the Top Fuel dragsters and environments feel immersive and life like.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1883280/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1645084952","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1883280/page.bg.jpg?t=1645084952","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1883280/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1645084952","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1883280/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1645084952","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Drag Battle Top Fuel is a racing game where you get to drive the fastest accelerating vehicles on earth, Top Fuel dragsters.
