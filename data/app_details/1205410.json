This true-to-life experience thoroughly covers each step of the science procedure typically used in real classroom dissections. Guiding learners through each anatomical system, our digitized science teacher walks students through the process, while talking about the structure and function of each organ through the various systems. Also, students compare the dogfish\u2019s anatomy to their own doing comparative anatomy cross-checks along the way.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Authentic Science Experience Aligned to National Learning Standards</h2>This program is aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)\u2014America\u2019s framework for science learning. Using original to-scale models of organs and specimens, learners get a first class dissection experience at their own pace, and without the safety or ethical implications.
