Take the wind into account when choosing a faraway target. Learn to aim quickly, as your muscles will eventually tire out, making it increasingly difficult to aim. And if your target moves too quickly or is too far away - use your sharpened senses to temporarily make shooting easier and faster.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1374440/extras/ramka2.gif?t=1671525330\" /><br><br>Sign up for increasingly prestigious tournaments in various different locations. Build your reputation by overcoming various challenges and outperforming your competition. Be ready for anything - only easy contests involve simple firing at a stationary target.
