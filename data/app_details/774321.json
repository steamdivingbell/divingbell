Leo Cornell was just another regular working-class guy, trying to make a living under horrendous circumstances due to his evil patronizing boss, Jorge Blue. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t until the very same day that Leo got himself fired, he also realised that his very own existence had come to an end. <br><br>STARBO is a short, story-driven horror game based on the story of a man\u2019s journey beyond death. You'll get to explore a brand new world, find hidden keys and solve puzzles all under the pressure of bloodthirsty creatures wanting nothing other than your failure.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Hi dear stranger!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/774321/6cd38e24d4afcb12171a7ecacff4d357ffa05c1a.jpg"},{"name":"You got fired.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/774321/9cc1e0cd5fdc135fd1ebba29fec0f4980317cc69.jpg"},{"name":"Your plane crashed!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/774321/c771d073be0d29804632025c1004cf8171d42e8f.jpg"},{"name":"You woke up in the blue.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/774321/0e2903fdf1fb8d648e0901d542851f5a361165e4.jpg"},{"name":"You escaped..","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/774321/8423aac2077c62b2731ed287cd173876782c1160.jpg"},{"name":"You did not burn up!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/774321/e01a87550a827e3f9c782944bde171ce72e31e0c.jpg"},{"name":"You\u2019re getting better.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/774321/f2c04c59c591b78e5846e5d9db3ed3b274750b3d.jpg"},{"name":"I\u2019m here for you!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/774321/d847cc1a9cc8b2b30da086d3a636912449bb22ce.jpg"},{"name":"I can\u2019t imagine what you are going through.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/774321/cd85a52404a352e9b0e787076a46d04535fec36a.jpg"},{"name":"You are strong!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/774321/85e3afe12909e1246d0eaf193b0cd2b437f67381.jpg"}],"total":15},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/774321/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735583997","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/774321/page.bg.jpg?t=1735583997","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/774321/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735583997","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/774321/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735583997","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>STARBO</strong> tells you the story of a dead man's journey through a horrendously blue world filled with strange messages and beings all trying to tell you a story, the story of Leo Cornell.
