Guided by a mysterious voice in your head, you discover that you recently had a severe accident and your mind was transferred into a robot body. Your mission is to synchronize your new body with your mind by navigating through a high-tech facility filled with other robots and tricky obstacles and something that the voice in your head describes as the \u201cglitch\u201d. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Experience fluid and fast-paced gameplay with mechanics such as double jumping, wall jumps, dodge rolls, and dash attacks. Each level is a test of skill, where touching other robots or glitches results in an instant reboot, allowing for quick retries and maintaining a steady, engaging pace. The game features well over 100 meticulously designed levels, each auto-saving upon completion, making it perfect for quick gaming sessions. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Adjustable assist settings allow players of all skill levels to enjoy the game at their own pace, offering features like triple jumps, immunity to glitches, and auto-stomping enemies. Once you've completed the game, unlock the speedrun mode to challenge yourself with an in-game timer and minimal interruptions. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Uncover the truth behind your existence, experience the strange glitches and blackouts, and piece together the story of your past in this captivating journey.
