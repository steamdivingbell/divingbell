{"about_the_game":"Brutal TD is a minimalist retro-styled game that combines elements of tower defense games and classic space shooters. Brutal TD puts you in complete control of a single tower. You can choose what enemies to fire at, which enemies you prioritize, and how to spend your resources. You can build differently for different situations. Brutal TD has different power-ups, tons of unique enemy types, and unshockable helper towers. Unlike other tower games that have static levels that are the same every play-through, most waves have semi-random spawn times, pathing, and spawn locations. Each level of Brutal TD gets progressively more challenging. Wave bosses go from simple blocks that fire at you to large enemy planets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBrutal TD features custom CRT shaders to replicate that old-school retro feel. Levels have different dynamic backgrounds that help add to that classic space shooter feel. In addition to the CRT shaders and other visual level effects, you can enable or disable object blooming and glow tracing. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach level has unique chip/synth tunes composed for that level to amp up the retro feel. If you like the music in the trailer, you will love the music in the game. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA mouse and keyboard are recommended to play, but the game does have full controller support and native support for the Steam Deck (docked or undocked). Controller support includes optional tilt-to-fire controls and shoulder button quick-action macros.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBrutal TD is balanced to be a difficult challenge, but rewarding the more you play. Most levels feature random enemy spawn points for replay value and to keep you from getting too comfortable on each replay. Brutal TD is easy to learn but difficult to master. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdditional features:<br />\r\n    \u2022 Different enemy types that do things like steal resources or obscure your vision.<br />\r\n    \u2022 Tons of upgrades.<br />\r\n    \u2022 Different randomized item drops. <br />\r\n    \u2022 Full auto mode to spray bullets all over the screen.<br />\r\n    \u2022 Different helper towers that auto-fire, help fabricate resources, and more. <br />\r\n    \u2022 Tons of different bosses, some with multiple forms. <br />\r\n    \u2022 Over 40 levels with awesome chip/synth tunes.<br />\r\n    \u2022 39 Challenge modes with the original pre-nerfed, almost impossible level designs for those who really enjoy a brutally difficult game.<br />\r\n    \u2022 A level editor to let you make your own levels. Levels can be shared with anyone via the editor save data. <br />\r\n    \u2022 Tons of achievements to show off that you beat one of the hardest games on Steam.<br />\r\n    \u2022 Unlockable skins for your mouse pointer and main tower.<br />\r\n    \u2022 Unlockable intelligence rooms that let you see enemy stats, names, and more. <br />\r\n    \u2022 A subtle but overarching plot.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"So it begins","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2176020/02362c8c12102f36910f1d45a25d4d47c42b7d77.jpg"},{"name":"Screamer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2176020/340b9eb821f8bc4b5c3a21d1f8b1aedeb6459fe4.jpg"},{"name":"Feeling Bloo","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2176020/197279fce32c5297f98a365ace067d73380d1bb0.jpg"},{"name":"Disasteroid","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2176020/c82873a064836f66dcf28af2e8bb2eb206b45de3.jpg"},{"name":"Red Blips","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2176020/0baecd1b58510ad1cd9aecef07ce49ba937f11bd.jpg"},{"name":"Cash Zapper","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2176020/0094117fa5b96d1634adedd11cb0e9e467ce9a2c.jpg"},{"name":"The Big One","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2176020/b27c085973f175a0eb3601e065ce22f8bc0d4f5b.jpg"},{"name":"Ammo Zapper","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2176020/f0d4c5d1f0940f8328ddc758bb6b3892f3a9edd4.jpg"},{"name":"Mean Green","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2176020/84676fadd0558b3bd2a2a3986b5483d60f541d8a.jpg"},{"name":"Inverted Yellow","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2176020/0a8d3906716240bbc1da31ac03606fa1de3184c5.jpg"}],"total":95},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2176020/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1699239566","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2176020/page.bg.jpg?t=1699239566","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2176020/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1699239566","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2176020/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1699239566","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Brutal TD is a minimalist retro-styled game that combines elements of tower defense games and classic space shooters.
