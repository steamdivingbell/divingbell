The first day of your unpaid internship feels less exciting when you\u2019re reminded that it\u2019s been the first day, every day, for years now. Are your food pellets even that fresh? Is your bean chair even that plump? It might be time to wake up from this capitalist fever dream disguised as a corporate wellness meditation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDive deep into the lore of the company you work for: Tough Guy Mountain, the company that turned the entire world into a marketing campaign to fulfill its sinister goals.
