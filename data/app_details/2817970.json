{"about_the_game":"You just returned from a vacation in planet Earth. You wanted to stay longer, but you did not have any more vacation days left... Instead, you bought a Human Souvenir to relive your memories of interacting with Earth Humans. And, of course, to impress your colleagues that you own a Human now. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHuman Souvenir is an arcade toy-like game in which you are tasked with fulfilling the ever-changing needs of an Earth Human. The Souvenir includes a party mode, mimicking the parties you attended to watch Earth Humans dance funny. Since the Earth Human had to be genetically modified to fit into the Souvenir, it tends to be even pickier than their original form. So, be aware that your Souvenir will require constant attention! Don't worry if you don't manage though, we figured out a way to unlock Earth Human Reincarnation, so you will never run out of Humans to play with. This toy is not intended for aliens younger than 300 light years. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay at your own (and the Earth Human's) risk. Shaman Garage is not liable for any psychological or emotional damage caused by frequently interacting with Human Souvenir and/or by the empty void it leaves if you do not manage to keep the Human alive.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Absence of photosynthesis ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2817970/9b5c6f369be2ea71f7d91de7d59e0481525b0f42.jpg"},{"name":"Hungry hippo","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2817970/9751e3088059a37a0f4cacc435bc01f74c6f7d65.jpg"},{"name":"Insomniac","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2817970/03a2bbee4164751f018dbdb503864bcc20a0d55a.jpg"},{"name":"I am speed","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2817970/fcb93a888e944e1b8480b572ffa1c64aa8afc477.jpg"},{"name":"Sweaty Sally","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2817970/f661280a974890c1ffa05b4c8e705c1a256a62b6.jpg"},{"name":"Renata Bliss","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2817970/32dc76dcd9a2e1d5fd4a5fdd6de1bf2fc1b479b9.jpg"},{"name":"What's that smell?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2817970/c434b2ad3275b17675646e632b2895585cce1b4c.jpg"},{"name":"Rave rat","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2817970/1e0fb1dcd05e7e6a88513a510b25251e7a661255.jpg"},{"name":"Whats brown and sticky?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2817970/0312faa896ba955fa3a3838605e3056df3b0e632.jpg"},{"name":"Side quest","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2817970/812d56fb2a8dcc5e8ccc905feeb383e099f83be6.jpg"}],"total":14},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2817970/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1716904664","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2817970/page.bg.jpg?t=1716904664","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2817970/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1716904664","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2817970/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1716904664","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You just returned from a vacation in planet Earth.
