The fact that you\u2019re lacking your usual 3D posture is significant not only for the story you\u2019re about to experience but more importantly for the way you play. When compared with a real being, a shadow, by its nature, is subject to different laws of physics. It needs light to exist, and dark places are its biggest enemy. Shadows always need a surface onto which they can slip, so when it comes to negotiating obstacles, you\u2019ll need to figure out smarter ways than simply jumping over them. Remember that your shadow self will transform depending on the angle of light, and that changing perspective or camera view might be of key importance to solving certain spatial puzzles. Prepare for a game that\u2019s unlike anything you\u2019ve played before.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1127820/extras/steam_tytul2.png?t=1666098656\" /><br><br><strong>Set off on an extraordinary, symbolic journey</strong> \u2013 stay open-minded, revisit your memories, but be warned that not all of them are worth remembering;<br><br><strong>Experience the true meaning of \u201cmoving like a shadow\u201d</strong> \u2013 forget all the rules of movement that other games have taught you, and try to look at the world around you from an entirely new perspective instead;<br><br><strong>Collect pieces of your memory</strong> \u2013 try to rebuild the past from the scraps of memory buried deep in your mind;<br><br><strong>Enjoy the unique graphic design</strong> \u2013 unusual graphics will help keep you immersed in this remarkable world while staying focused on exploring your memories; <br><br><strong>See how real-life art can inspire game developers</strong> \u2013 an Etruscan sculpture \u2013 Ombra Della Sera and artists such as Adolphe Appia, Josef Svoboda, Yannis Kokkos, Frank Miller, and James Turrell inspired the creators of Repressed to bring this game to life;<br><br><strong>Listen to a one-of-a-kind, disturbing yet addictive soundtrack</strong> \u2013 immerse yourself in the game world while listening to the unique soundtrack composed by Bogdan Mizerski.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1127820/extras/woman_600x250.gif?t=1666098656\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1127820/extras/steam_tytul3.png?t=1666098656\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"The doghouse","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1127820/f3c4e0bdd356744c2510cd2494a97c139e91a3b5.jpg"},{"name":"The tricycle","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1127820/a471968c4fc3e9a997baf74dad089317d32e5bd4.jpg"},{"name":"The rubber duck","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1127820/5afe939f2a6c719a9611978e8ee8835f400d56f5.jpg"},{"name":"The ice cream","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1127820/e5d9939b4b5008cd9f71901353457c77f3cdf914.jpg"},{"name":"The toy car","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1127820/5a34f8c907cffe2c5fe4f046e10f9568d8e4ea97.jpg"},{"name":"The swing","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1127820/6977fe6d7fd26ab6841538f35834eae2b7fdb264.jpg"},{"name":"The first day","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1127820/ece5ec2d01e96d4deaac2de876953bd91ac9d522.jpg"},{"name":"The wreath","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1127820/05db09f31f82ddb8a96bb20adc441c0f7569a180.jpg"},{"name":"The cake","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1127820/0d7d5dbfb2003d8d6b3cee8cdc3fe3040658fdb4.jpg"},{"name":"The ball","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1127820/7b6484a8df46410975b7c625a4a2d9906f05c496.jpg"}],"total":20},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1127820?t=1666098656","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1127820?t=1666098656","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1127820/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1666098656","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1127820/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1666098656","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1127820/extras/fall_600x250.gif?t=1666098656\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1127820/extras/steam_tytul1.png?t=1666098656\" /><br><br>In Repressed you play as a shadow of your own persona on a journey within your Memory Palace.
