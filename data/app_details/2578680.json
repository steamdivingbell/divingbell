The story is set in a fictional land similar to ancient Greece. This means you will encounter things like taverns serving alcohol, bandits stealing gold, or tavern companions that dance for the visitors. I also plan to add NPC relationships, like dating, romance, and mentions of sex.\r\nNone of the content is explicit, so you will not encounter nudity, nor excessive violence/gore.\r\nMy game design philosophy is to create a welcoming space that introduces mature topics tastefully."},"detailed_description":"<strong>Inspired by the social MMOs of the early 2000s, Frontiers Reborn is a massively multiplayer roleplaying game where social interaction and collaboration come first.
