You and your blokes have been unfairly banished and stripped of everything but a few shillings and table scraps. Undaunted, you journey to a strange land to reclaim your honor.<br><br>Under the steely gaze of her majesty, Queen Anne, you must chart your path to fame and glory. Will you farm the earth, fight as knights or finagle your own feudums? Whatever your fate, one thing is clear: Medieval life is not a bowl of cherry tarts. Fertile land is scarce, food is dwindling, and fanciful creatures fancy you for dinner! Luckily, not everything feudal is (ahem)\u2026futile.

The Queen\u2019s tyranny is spreading into every corner of the kingdom. Her foot soldiers scour the countryside to hunt the behemoth \u2014 the bewitched king that was once her husband!

More strange folk have migrated to your neck of the woods, leaving you with little elbowroom. To make matters worse, windmills and catapults are popping up like dandelions. That takes the biscuit!

A famine has emptied your barns and you must look to the sea for sustenance. With harpoon in hand, you hoist your anchors and begin your hunt for seal meat. But beware! Not all fins are friendly.
