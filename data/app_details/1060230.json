{"about_the_game":"Guide your tribe. Build a civilization. Cultivate the world - together. In <strong><i>Sapiens</i></strong>, you start with nothing and advance through thousands of years of technological breakthroughs in single player, or team up with friends to construct sprawling cities and manage resources collectively in multiplayer.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1060230/extras/SapianSteamGif3_iteration_1.gif?t=1721349106\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Choose Your Home</h2><br>Pick from thousands of procedurally generated environments across a map larger than Earth itself. Choose wisely, as each area has different climates, resources, and challenges. Finding the right place to begin your home is key to growing your civilization. Shape the world around you from the largest citadel to the smallest log, which can all be moved and placed at will. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1060230/extras/SapianSteamGif4_iteration_1.gif?t=1721349106\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Play Together</h2><br>In multiplayer you can collaborate with friends to build major trading hubs, hospitals, and other large-scale builds that would be impossible to build alone. There\u2019s no PVP, so relationships are based on cooperation and creating rather than destroying.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Find Resources</h2><br>Find new resources and send your sapiens to investigate, leading to new breakthroughs that unlock new things to build and craft. Start with primitive materials and work your way up to using more advanced tools and techniques. Other tribes can also be a resource as they focus their skills on one of four different trades, including rock tools, bread, pottery, and bronze.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1060230/extras/SapianSteamGif2_iteration_1.gif?t=1721349106\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Lead Your People</h2><br>Instruct individual sapiens to focus on specific tasks, such as research, planting crops, gathering materials, building, hunting, cooking, and more. Watch as they learn new skills, making them more valuable to your tribe. Manage their moods, health, and support their growing families.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Expand Your Reach</h2><br>Trade across the globe with ease with tools like Sleds. Send sapiens over long distances and establish camps to gather far away resources. Explore over great distances by deploying a team of sapiens, or conduct a hunting mission to gather resources. Players can also grow their standing in other tribes for even more benefits in trading.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1060230/extras/SapianSteamGif1_iteration_1.gif?t=1721349106\" /><br><br><i><i><strong>Sapiens</strong></i> features extensive mod support through Steam Workshop.</i>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1060230/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1721349106","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1060230/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1721349106","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1060230/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1721349106","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1060230/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1721349106","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":51},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Guide your tribe.
