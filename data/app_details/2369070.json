{"about_the_game":"The original music from the beautiful world of <i>Innchanted</i>! <br><br>The score was composed by Meena Shamaly (Old World, ABC Classic) in collaboration with three of the finest First Nations musicians in Australia: Kiernan Ironfield on the yidaki (otherwise known as the didgeridoo), Eric Avery on violin, and Allara Briggs-Pattison on double bass, electric bass, bilma (clapsticks), and percussion. <br><br>The spirit of these three wonderful artists is at the heart of this score, which is filled with their magical improvisations and brilliant spontaneity, inspired by their own relationships to land, living culture, and each of their instruments. Like a big jam session across time and space, they would respond to compositions with their performances, which would spark new compositions, to which they could then respond with even more performances!<br><br>Through this culturally collaborative process, Meena, Allara, Kiernan, and Eric have together created a musical journey full of whimsy, adventure, and, most of all, heart.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2369070?t=1702895885","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2369070?t=1702895885","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2369070/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1702895885","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2369070/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1702895885","categories":[{"description":"Additional High-Quality Audio","id":50}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The original music from the beautiful world of <i>Innchanted</i>! <br><br>The score was composed by Meena Shamaly (Old World, ABC Classic) in collaboration with three of the finest First Nations musicians in Australia: Kiernan Ironfield on the yidaki (otherwise known as the didgeridoo), Eric Avery on violin, and Allara Briggs-Pattison on double bass, electric bass, bilma (clapsticks), and percussion. <br><br>The spirit of these three wonderful artists is at the heart of this score, which is filled with their magical improvisations and brilliant spontaneity, inspired by their own relationships to land, living culture, and each of their instruments.
