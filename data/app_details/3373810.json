Restock and replenish your items in the small towns before venturing out into the native bush to get paid. Keep your car topped up and repaired, just in case you need a quick getaway.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can drive almost anywhere, and where you can't, you can hike.

This is the 1980s, so you have to pass time by playing instruments, sports and maybe a few pranks on your friends. Remember, time flies when you're having fun.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Soon enough, night will fall. And with it, monsters and anomalies will be more common. Get your cameras ready, and hope you have enough spare film to catch them all. And don't worry if a Scuttler or a Merchant takes you out. You can still help your friends from beyond the grave.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3373810/extras/Step3.png?t=1739939258\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With your new found dough, put together the slickest outfit you can. Stick stickers all over your character to build a unique look. Yes, I know what you guys will do with this feature, and you can disable seeing other's custom costumes. Please don't make me regret adding this.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Also, I am going to look into making the stickers tradable, with a foil and aging system.
