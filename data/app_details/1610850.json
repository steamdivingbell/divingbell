{"about_the_game":"<i>Red Trigger 2</i> is an FPA (First Person Adventure) game, inspired by games like <i>Portal</i>, <i>Metroid Prime</i>, <i>Bioshock</i>, <i>Psychonauts</i> and more, but very much has its own identity.<br><br>In <i>Red Trigger 2</i>, the main mechanic revolves around you shooting red blocks called Red Triggers. When you shoot a Red Trigger, it expands, and when you shoot it back, it retracts.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1610850/extras/ManageEnergyGIF.gif?t=1699410249\" /><br>However, you can only expand three Red Triggers at a time, so you must manage your energy wisely. You can either retract Red Triggers one at a time, or all at once. Be careful though, you don't want to do that while standing on an extended block over a deep, deep void below you!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1610850/extras/Use_Many_Different_Ways_GIF.gif?t=1699410249\" /><br>The Red Triggers are used in many different ways like making platforms, blocking lasers, holding doors open, powering systems, conducting electricity, propelling yourself, inputting codes and more! <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1610850/extras/UnlockAbilitiesGIF.gif?t=1699410249\" /><br>As you enter the HUB of the game, you can tackle the biomes all around it in almost any order you want. In each biome, you'll unlock a new ability like a grappling hook, a double-jump, a dash and more, which will allow you to explore more parts of the HUB, a bit like a <i>Metroidvania</i>!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1610850/extras/CatGIF.gif?t=1699410249\" /><br>For most of the adventure, you'll be accompanied by a mysterious sassy cat named Off Guard and, together, you'll try to uncover the dark secrets of this universe, as well as his tragic backstory.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1610850/extras/Biomes_GIF.gif?t=1699410249\" /><br>Each biome of the game has a single inhabitant that has a specific type of physical or mental pain. The biome they live in represents in an abstract way the struggle they live with. Let's take psychosis for example. In the biome themed around it, as you pass a certain door frame, if you turn around, you'll see that it's not the same room anymore. Trippy!

At the end of each biome, corrupt that zone and escape back into the HUB!

Uncover the dark truth of this universe through the events of the game, but also through <i>Bioshock</i>-esque audio logs.
