{"about_the_game":"Welcome to Spider Lander DX.  A loving echo of games from the 80's and familiar to those who loved classics such as Lunar Rescue and Lunar Lander.  Spider Lander has some interesting physics including swinging by a spider thread to your mothership as part of landing and then more into the familiar thrust and position to find a landing spot.  You then have to rescue at least one of the poor guys stuck on the planet (lots of extra points if you can rescue more than one!) and escape back to the safety of your spider mothership.   Like the classic arcades of old, it will keep on getting harder and you'll hopefully want just-one-more-go.  Enjoy!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"No One Left Behind","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/959730/32524c4af2df6647b91556053640e606fb0500a2.jpg"},{"name":"No Scratches","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/959730/180c36ac20002883a7d255e161a540132ba1b0b0.jpg"},{"name":"On Fumes","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/959730/c00d0dad699dc1e7f5a9e48398026cc1cf772165.jpg"},{"name":"Hit 1,000,000","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/959730/fa1f140dda7d48998f5b25882932207a9c6742c6.jpg"},{"name":"Rescue 100","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/959730/f3cc536d3ce0bcddd99410925be2235a5a367cbc.jpg"},{"name":"Beat 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/959730/15493e25aa42cd7fb2120a5c34d25cdfd1664cbc.jpg"},{"name":"Beat 10","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/959730/b12f8ae9d15c7b5e9b056ebbba4ed451320ba390.jpg"},{"name":"Beat 16","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/959730/b9e82df4184a129debf3c6edac372ac334e7ff30.jpg"},{"name":"Beat 32","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/959730/7c66b5a40a0e8252f9202a195bbd70fbdd590372.jpg"},{"name":"Crash and Burn","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/959730/46b2d84516c94489c2208961186579dea3226ec7.jpg"}],"total":12},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/959730/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1682364626","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/959730/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1682364626","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/959730/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1682364626","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/959730/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1682364626","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Welcome to Spider Lander DX.
