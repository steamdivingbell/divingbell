{"about_the_game":"<i>In the world of Stilt, you are a furball with two arms. You were routinely flying your spaceship delivering gift packages until a giant octopus living atop a volcano decided to steal your spaceship, dispersing the precious cargo all over the hills. You equip yourself with a springy stilt in each hand to bounce through the challenging landscape to retrieve the lost gifts and eventually get back your stolen spaceship!</i><br><br><strong>Stilt</strong> is a colorful, stunning VR platformer game that takes inspiration from classic platformers. Use your quick reflexes and problem-solving skills to progress through the levels, collecting lost gift packages and stamps along the way. With your wits and stilts, you can handle any challenge: pass chasms, avoid traps, break things and smack creatures. Find power-ups to upgrade your stilts and become the ultimate stilt master!<br><br>Take part in several cross-play multiplayer modes in various PvP arenas! In <strong>Smack-em-all!</strong>, score points by smacking other players to sea. In <strong>Area Bash</strong>, gain points by staying inside a marked, constantly moving area while trying to keep other players outside. Try not to get zapped in <strong>Electric Tag</strong>, and pop the most balloons to win in <strong>Balloon Hunt</strong>. There is also a huge lobby area where you can meet up with other players and prepare your stilts for the next match.<br><br>Are you ready to experience the thrill of Stilt and jump like never before? Put on your headset, fasten your stilts, and have some <strong>bouncy adventures in the world of Stilt!</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Core Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>VR platformer inspired by the classics - use your quick reflexes and problem-solving skills to progress in a world filled with danger and excitement.<br></li><li>20 Levels to explore.<br></li><li>6 Power-ups.<br></li><li>5 multiplayer modes for countless hours of fun!<br></li><li>Cross-play multiplayer with PCVR, Quest and PSVR2</li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Gift Explorer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2482270/ce9919339450b53703e4eff2678b8ad43d125aa6.jpg"},{"name":"Gift Pursuer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2482270/e08fda780428bacc3f7c780fe6496f73bae62046.jpg"},{"name":"Gift Collector","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2482270/da2ff5c124501ce2a6da4845e700877a0685368a.jpg"},{"name":"Gift Plunderer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2482270/eb33de6ac0ca545cc7a7ce058eef3ec794798947.jpg"},{"name":"Gift Hoarder","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2482270/254d4ddda8a417b5b0cab95d957093b88995a133.jpg"},{"name":"Stamp Explorer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2482270/e92f6e7fd6216aa4d1d82ceb426eb66ce4a0f17d.jpg"},{"name":"Stamp Pursuer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2482270/4fa4eeedeb64ca155364c3743b90192b1bc0603b.jpg"},{"name":"Stamp Collector","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2482270/19616939ec13ba21b2da822ed75813aa21ccee7b.jpg"},{"name":"Stamp Plunderer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2482270/3e638a684b10893a570f8220447e6bddbb7d1d09.jpg"},{"name":"Stamp Hoarder","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2482270/6d5032f8746bdff3ba56286804f2f3a56282a5ca.jpg"}],"total":35},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2482270/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733413344","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2482270/page.bg.jpg?t=1733413344","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2482270/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733413344","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2482270/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733413344","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<i>In the world of Stilt, you are a furball with two arms.
