{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Look up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's... It's a... Zombie!? Yep, that's right!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Zombie Barrel Blast is an arcade-style 2D platformer, minus any platforms with which to platform. Wait, what? What are you supposed to do to get around then? That's where the barrels come in. Use them to launch your Zombie, sending them flying across the not-so-friendly skies... or back into their graves if you're not careful.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You'll send Zombies soaring across various vistas, like a lush jungle, a searing volcano, the snowy Arctic, and many more. Just as many different barrels will line the path you must fly, with some forcing you to shoot quickly as a timer ticks down, or some breaking after you've launched from them too many times- some will even let you choose from where and at what angle you launch! With a watchful eye and intuition, only those with a pulse would have, you may discover hidden areas along the way, filled with treasures, tricks, and, if nothing else, a feeling of satisfaction.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1941490/extras/Barrel-Blast-with-Frame.gif?t=1737131141\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In this high-flying affair, you are not alone- because you'll have to contend with many enemies determined to cut your barrel-blasting sessions short. Some might even chase you, that's how determined they are. So, technically, you are alone, since it's you versus the world. BUT, you'll find plenty of items that will help you in your endeavours (as to whether or not you'll feel less lonely when using them, we can't say). Increase your BiteCoin intake or score-earning potential, slow down moving barrels, and even become invincible to enemies! You might even find something to help you shake off pesky pursuers!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1941490/extras/Volcano-Achievement-with-Frame.gif?t=1737131141\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">What would a pulse-pounding Zombie flight be without goals to achieve? Each level has many objectives to complete, oftentimes meaning you'll be sending Zombies through these aerial gauntlets several times over to accomplish them all. Go for a high score, collect as many BiteCoins as you can, race to the finish, and search from top to bottom for every last one of those delicious brains scattered about.
