{"about_the_game":"Ugmania is an open world sandbox survival game with a whole universe full of colourful and quirky planets to explore! Fly between procedurally generated worlds, land on them, mine resources, fight deadly enemies and bosses, spelunk through caves deep underground, uncover ancient mysteries, and discover the truth about your race! With many weapons, armours, and everything in between to choose from, you can play however you want! With lore that doesn't intrude on gameplay, action packed combat, satisfying resource management, and a unique home spaceship system, Ugmania is a new take on the classic survival genre.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fight!</h2>To get the resources you will need, you have to fight! Every planet presents its own dangers! From hazardous radiation and lava, to deadly slimes and snowmen wielding guns and dumb looking lizardmen! Every now and then, you might be confronted with a more dangerous adversary who will stop at nothing to break your bones and leave you dead!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gather!</h2>With different tools such as dynamite, pickaxes or capitalism, you can collect the resources that you need to craft better and better gear! Mine rocks, dive into caves to get better rocks, chop trees to get leaves and wood, collect gases from planets, or try to buy your way to victory with the local capitalist villagers!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore!</h2>With a whole universe available to you, theres a lot to explore! 7 different planet types with different flora and fauna are out there, waiting to be explored! Every world is procedurally generated, no two are the same! And deep below, you might find something... something strange.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"The Last Ug","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2316310/b7ee3e76febd8bed7baab3b467d10b6c53298955.jpg"},{"name":"Tree Bully","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2316310/6fdcf20c60432404664176623bc1d11725ea554a.jpg"},{"name":"Sacrilegious","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2316310/fbf58417eb1fd6b5c8fa7a240ea043ff40e97af0.jpg"},{"name":"The Rockiest Of Them All","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2316310/6f525b2618ede76cc486cf6fc929d2f8846a1979.jpg"},{"name":"Into The Unknown","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2316310/12515025c634584abc44a73346f3d9bbb7e5c699.jpg"},{"name":"Champion of the Ancients","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2316310/ad91e49b3119d3154ad56170b74cb28ed3068b0e.jpg"},{"name":"Dirty","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2316310/c012bbbb4b3ebae38b077dd34a39f33c138803d4.jpg"},{"name":"Failed Experiment...?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2316310/944651fcbd420a7c2bb9fcd6bbf950eea0943431.jpg"},{"name":"Goliath Vs Ug","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2316310/90cc1e78a2b1d738ec4c760d033cfa4005688cd1.jpg"},{"name":"The Professor's Assistant","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2316310/902439a054e12596f859efd792287feeb77eff45.jpg"}],"total":50},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2316310/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1692675651","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2316310/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1692675651","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2316310/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1692675651","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2316310/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1692675651","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Ugmania is an open world sandbox survival game with a whole universe full of colourful and quirky planets to explore!
