{"about_the_game":"Aliens are invading Earth, and their only weakness is... soft drinks?! You are our only hope! Go, Captain Soda!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCaptain Soda is a vibrant and satisfying arcade shooter about fighting an alien apocalypse where your strongest weapons just so happen to be Soda. Play as the main character, a soda-based hero named Captain Soda, and throw-down the money-abducting invaders with a loadout of weapons such as the Bubble Sub-machine Gun and Bottle Rocket Launcher, plus your favourite beverage. Your loadout is not complete without some accessories like the Double Jump Boots or Wrapper Cape to fit your playstyle and help you take on the apocalypse in over 25 levels and 3 unique areas. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn these fizzy chemical battles, face wave after wave of silly aliens, all leading up to you taking down the super powerful Overlords! Captain Soda is inspired by Super Crate Box, but succeeds it by offering a campaign mode, upgraded visuals, and features a physics-defying mechanic that makes screen-wrapping available not just for enemies, but for yourself for an even more intense and skill-based gameplay.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2199870/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1709834979","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2199870/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1709834979","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2199870/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1709834979","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2199870/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1709834979","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Aliens are invading Earth, and their only weakness is... soft drinks?!
