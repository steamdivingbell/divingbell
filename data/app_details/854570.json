{"about_the_game":"Pamali: Indonesian Folklore Horror offers a horror shaped by authentic Indonesian taboos and culture among its own society. In Pamali, your journey is influenced by your choices, because each horror experience is different for everyone.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Folklore One: The White Lady</h2>A young man named Jaka has just gone back to his hometown to sell his old family house. While he is unpacking, cleaning, and renovating the house, he disregards many of his family\u2019s old belongings and creates rude remarks. Not long after, he experiences mysterious and unexplained events. He eventually learns that the family has a secret and that he is not the only one in the empty house.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/854570/extras/steamPage_2A_USA.jpg?t=1697010143\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Haunted House</h2>Explore an abandoned Indonesian house with a spine-chilling atmosphere. Seek deeper into the house to find out more about an unsettling truth about the family. Be careful not to disrespect the mystical being that resides there.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/854570/extras/3A.gif?t=1697010143\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Object Interaction</h2>Interact with various objects within the house. You could also speak out your thoughts. Found an interesting painting? You can either praise it or mock it instead. Be wary of your choices, what you do, see or say will lead you to a unique take on the world in each repeatable playthrough.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/854570/extras/4A.gif?t=1697010143\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiple Endings</h2>Having second thoughts? You can run away the instant you arrived. Or do you wish to quickly sell the house without disturbing the entity that lingers in it? Or rather arrogantly explore and seek the entity? In Pamali, you'll be able to take decisions that will impact the experience and the ending.  If you were in that situation, what would you do?<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/854570/extras/5A_USA.gif?t=1697010143\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Investigation</h2>Seek the truth about Jaka and his family.
