{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Be The Coach</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game is set in a fictional city in England around the year 1980. You are the coach of a team in a league of total 8 teams. All other teams are AI controlled. <i>Can you beat them and win the league?</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Procedurally Generated</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">All players and teams are procedurally generated. Every game is unique, and the players that make up your team are different each time. Players have 3 main stats: </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Speed (SPD): How fast can the player run?</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Strength (STR): Used when tackling or trying to absorb a tackle</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Dexterity (DEX): Controlling the ball, passing and shooting</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In addition every player has their own height and weight, as well as Form (see below).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Set your tactics</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2509150/extras/advanced-tactic.gif?t=1735667078\" />Get to know your players and decide on a formation with a chance to win games. Be it 4-4-2, 4-3-3 or any other is up to you. Don't worry too much, you can change this during the match if you want.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each player can have their position adjusted in either a more advanced or defensive position. This will create new passing lanes during the match.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Any player can be assigned a playmaker role, meaning their team-mates will prioritize to get the ball to them. Perhaps you should reserve this for your more skillful players.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Active Match Coaching</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">During the matches, you play as the coach on the sideline. You make decisions and communicate them to the players on the pitch. If you feel confident, you can sit back and watch the match unfold, but if you feel it is not going your way, there are many things you can influence.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You use the same controls for adjusting formation and moving players around as you did before the match (but limited to the players on the field). Look at the match unfold and see if you can find the weak spots of your opponents. Perhaps try with a different playmaker, or change the formation.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Manage your players</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">After each match, the form of the players will change. Update your lineup accordingly. You want to avoid having players with poor form in the match, as they perform a lot worse. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Scout your opponents</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As the league progresses, you can go back and watch any match already played. Figure out what formation an opponent has played so far. Maybe they will play the same in your next game? Use this to your advantage.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2509150/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735667078","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2509150/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1735667078","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2509150/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735667078","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2509150/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735667078","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Be The Coach</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game is set in a fictional city in England around the year 1980.
