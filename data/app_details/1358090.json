There are only four actions: <i>spin clockwise</i>, <i>spin counter-clockwise</i>, <i>swap by 180\u00b0 degrees</i>, and <i>focus (slow down)</i>. If you want to beat the hardest levels, you'll need impeccable timing and precision.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1358090/extras/line1.png?t=1698076863\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1358090/extras/gif2n.gif?t=1698076863\" /><br>Simplicity and minimalism are key features of Open Hexagon. While some levels have special quirks and mechanics, the goal is always the same: <i>survive as long as possible</i>.

Players can create their own levels by using the simple yet powerful Lua scripting language. The amount of freedom that level designers have is unprecedented: keep your levels simple, or go wild and implement brand new mechanics and even entire new games!
