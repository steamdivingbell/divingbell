{"about_the_game":"Settlements Rising is a city-building and colony management simulation game set in medieval times.

They can work in over 35 different professions. Each villager has needs for hunger, energy, health, and warmth.

They are born, grow, receive education, and eventually age and pass away. They gain experience in their jobs.
