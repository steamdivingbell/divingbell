{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Shadow of the Demon Lord Expert Paths of Shadow Bundle</h2>   <br> This product contains the following: <br>  <br> <br> <strong> Paths of Battle</strong> <br> <br> Finally, Paths of Battle introduces the knight, a brand new path for characters devoted to protecting the innocent and championing noble causes as the Shadow looms ever larger. Do you have what it takes to fight the Demon Lord with cold steel and gritty determination? <br>  <br> <br> <strong> Paths of Conflict</strong> <br> <br> Paths of Conflict presents a selection of weapon-focused expert paths that will help you achieve glory in Shadow of the Demon Lord. You can blast a hole through your enemies with pistols, shriek as you hack them apart with an axe, or, like a surgeon with a scalpel, take them apart, limb by limb. Take up arms and fight for the end of all things! <br>  <br> <br> <strong> Paths of Power</strong> <br> <br> Paths of Power deals with the sorcerer, spellbinder, warlock, and wizard, and in most cases offers upgrades and enhancements to make them even more exciting to play. In addition, this supplement introduces a new path: the occultist, a dreaded devotee of dark magic, who peers into places others fear to look. <br>  <br> <br> <strong> Paths of Purpose</strong> <br> <br> Paths of Purpose provides options for players seeking to hone their expertise in new ways. Suitable for characters of all novice paths, Paths of Purpose helps ensure you can play the character you were born to play! <br>  <br> <br> <strong> Soldiers of Fortune</strong> <br> <br> Soldiers of Fortune presents three new expert paths for characters with a martial bent. The bloodletter is a vicious brute who revels in carnage, while the commander can devise battle plans to secure a decisive victory. And for those who prefer to take shots from the back ranks, the targeter can transform any character into a deadly archer. <br>  <br> Note about the conversion: The core of this product is 30 expert paths. Many of the revisions to the core paths introduced in these newer versions were later incorporated into the core rules. Consequently, some of the paths in this product now duplicate the core rules. The full list of the paths is as follows.
