Want to check out specific moments of celestial alignment? Hopefully, because that's about it for the moment.

It is being built with, and for the moment has only been tested on, the Vive HMD with generation one \u2018wand\u2019 controllers. Other headsets and controllers may currently work, but I haven't yet put any effort into testing if they do.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><u>HOME is an interactive section of a larger experience currently in active development:</u></h2>Updates will be pushed out as more sections are fleshed out. Future versions will expand on the current Solar System model as well as add deeper dives into our home planet and the other planets in our Solar System.<br><br>Please, send me feedback. I've made the development process public at this stage to encourage a feedback cycle.
