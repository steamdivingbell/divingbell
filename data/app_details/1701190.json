{"about_the_game":"Chessformer is a grid-based puzzle platformer with Chess pieces. Each of the pieces moves as expected, but they fall down after moving and can't move again until they stop falling.  Pieces also stack on top of each other which is key to solving most levels. The goal in each level is to capture the opposing king, who is lazy and never moves, so don't worry about losing any pieces.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1701190/extras/GIF_1.gif?t=1642521385\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1701190/extras/GIF_2.gif?t=1642521385\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"4 Levels","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1701190/0bb7ec5ec97e262f0a56be14267221b1c2904d54.jpg"},{"name":"8 Levels","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1701190/e8604d2e28279ea8652c446096263cf0dbdc4a6f.jpg"},{"name":"12 Levels","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1701190/4d0a23bd2a176b60e571cdc2d1e87d8470b3afaf.jpg"},{"name":"16 Levels","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1701190/a74dd87805503460323c9f7f8be674dee91d1dec.jpg"},{"name":"20 Levels","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1701190/a4bed5ee6f49895622d5fc2c31d5a2d25b34d086.jpg"},{"name":"24 Levels","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1701190/46d070951bdc413c80e0623dc6cfa394708fbdfd.jpg"},{"name":"28 Levels","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1701190/b27067a17e6aef080694b540508313068e7610b5.jpg"},{"name":"32 Levels","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1701190/9c3651a48066badd47529bc25644ee91bfbed69f.jpg"},{"name":"36 Levels","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1701190/8713b53467ee4d0de7e2f5de627001012e285f43.jpg"},{"name":"40 Levels","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1701190/f54357f91ffc8078adde684c30a564bd3d590d54.jpg"}],"total":12},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1701190/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1642521385","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1701190/page.bg.jpg?t=1642521385","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1701190/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1642521385","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1701190/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1642521385","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Chessformer is a grid-based puzzle platformer with Chess pieces.
