Movement parts such as wheels, wings and hover blades need to be built with redundancy in mind, as parts can get shot off during the course of a battle. Bots may be built block by block, but will be stronger -and prettier- using advanced build plates. Each bot is centered on a core which has limited HP and must be protected. Any part that is disconnected from the core will be lost instantly, so strong redundant connections are needed for an optimal design.<br><br><br><u><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>weapons/movement</strong></h2></u><br>Every functional part in Diode Arena uses energy, including movement parts and weapons. To build an effective bot, you must balance your energy budget. Fortunately, there is a system of customizable modules, which let you specialize different systems for efficiency or power. You can also equip additional energy generation or storage capacity. This allows you to build bots that land into different archetypes, such as an extended brawler or a hit-and-run burst attacker.<br><br><u><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Diode Arena Demo</strong></h2></u><br>Using the demo version of Diode Arena you will be restricted to play only in tiers 1 and 2 on official servers.
