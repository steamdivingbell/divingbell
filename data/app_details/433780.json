{"about_the_game":"The soundtrack to the award-winning game which has been consistently praised by the press and the fans, brought at last to Steam.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs Jasper Byrne has spent most of his life making music, the soundtrack was an incredibly personal project for him.  It was a chance to show all his influences, both cinematic and from music itself.  And to do something genuinely different from the drum'n'bass he was known for under the handle, &quot;Sonic&quot; (releasing on seminal d'n'b labels such as Goldie's Metalheadz, Virus Records, V Recordings and loads more.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n19 tracks, ranging from ambient through to trip-hop, and even jazz and indie rock.  It was cited by many websites as one of the soundtracks of the year.
