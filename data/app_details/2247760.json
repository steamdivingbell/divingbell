{"about_the_game":"Revive &amp; Prosper takes you to a voxel world, where you'll be extracting resources and building a thriving base using belts and smart water control. <br>The complex production chains and tricky resource management will really put your strategy and simulation skills to the test. <br>There's nothing like optimizing and managing the perfect production line after a day full of adulting!<br><br>In this single-player automation game, you gather and manage resources, construct, automate and expand. <strong>A crew of mutants and their golem helpers</strong> will do all the manual work for you. <br><br>You'll <strong>shape the terrain</strong> to make paths for your crew and a place for your base. <br>Each map presents a challenge to plan efficient <strong>mining, harvesting, and production</strong>. <br><br>You'll also<strong> work extensively with water</strong>, which represents a source of energy, a necessary resource for production and growth, and also an effective weapon against <strong>aggressive Martian flora</strong>.<br><br>You go through technological ages from simple wood to chemical, atomic, and space. <br>You'll build a spaceship and expand
