{"about_the_game":"This bundle contains the M-95 Degman Premium MBT, 1.000 Gold and 7 days of Premium Time. In Armored Warfare, the M-95 Degman Tier 8 MBT is relatively fast and fairly agile while carrying some potent firepower for its Tier. In fact, its owners can choose from two powerful guns \u2013 the 125mm 2A46 Russian-style smoothbore gun known from many Russian MBTs, and the 120mm CTG NATO-style smoothbore gun that you know from the Challenger 1 Falcon MBT. It\u2019s worth noting that the 120mm shells have higher penetration values and the gun can also fire Falarick ATGMs while the 125mm gun has higher damage per shot. Both guns will feature good handling as well as overall performance to offset the vehicle\u2019s weakness, which is its mediocre armor. The Degman must rely on its mobility and firepower to survive, making it an ideal vehicle for aggressive, daring players.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1830425/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1685966326","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1830425/page.bg.jpg?t=1685966326","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1830425/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1685966326","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1830425/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1685966326","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Turn Notifications","id":32}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This bundle contains the M-95 Degman Premium MBT, 1.000 Gold and 7 days of Premium Time.
