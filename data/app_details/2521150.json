{"about_the_game":"In a vast and mysterious universe, a brave space ranger named Max embarks on a mission of utmost importance. The greatest villains of space, known as 'The Black Alliance,' are sowing chaos and destruction in the star systems. Max, aboard his standard spaceship, the 'Vanguard,' sets out on a perilous journey as a galactic hero determined to chase down the leaders of the Black Alliance.<br />\r\nWith access to different spacecraft, Max relies on his combat skills to face the challenges that arise in his path. He can pilot the standard ship, the 'Vanguard,' where speed and firepower are balanced, allowing him to adapt to different situations. Additionally, there is the attack ship, the 'War Axe,' which possesses high attack power but lower speed. Lastly, there is the speed ship, the 'Swift Blade,' which sacrifices attack power for higher speed.<br />\r\nThroughout his quest, Max will confront enemy ships, deftly dodge asteroids and deadly bombs that fill the scenery. However, he will be prepared for every challenge, leveraging the unique abilities of each available ship. Strategy, dexterity, and courage will be required to overcome each battle and advance towards the ruthless leaders who dare to challenge order in space. Get ready to join Max in this incredible intergalactic saga and discover if you have what it takes to become a true hero of space!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Starry Recruit","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2521150/3384b54e448f0d2769a2750755b15f1079755998.jpg"},{"name":"Starry Novice","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2521150/fbd9dfd1a0af1e7f3991e1d7f7fda965d891b04c.jpg"},{"name":"Starry Enthusiast","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2521150/fbd9dfd1a0af1e7f3991e1d7f7fda965d891b04c.jpg"},{"name":"Stellar Guardian","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2521150/fbd9dfd1a0af1e7f3991e1d7f7fda965d891b04c.jpg"},{"name":"Celestial Savior","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2521150/fbd9dfd1a0af1e7f3991e1d7f7fda965d891b04c.jpg"},{"name":"Pirate Slayer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2521150/e0cdbd2ccb246a3819e73e8edec6a7f9cb932a3c.jpg"},{"name":"Alien Annihilator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2521150/73255e3b8e147b3579071864b4ca0062491273b9.jpg"},{"name":"UFO Extinguisher","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2521150/f9781fc5a26189a919910f795f259113e17c0ab2.jpg"},{"name":"Pirate's Downfall in the End Word","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2521150/e0cdbd2ccb246a3819e73e8edec6a7f9cb932a3c.jpg"},{"name":"Alien's Return in the End Word","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2521150/73255e3b8e147b3579071864b4ca0062491273b9.jpg"}],"total":26},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2521150/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724526036","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2521150/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1724526036","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2521150/2d1d1ac9dafa5dea58fbe0c16feeeffce53d7b1b/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724526036","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2521150/2d1d1ac9dafa5dea58fbe0c16feeeffce53d7b1b/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724526036","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"In a vast and mysterious universe, a brave space ranger named Max embarks on a mission of utmost importance.
