{"about_the_game":"<strong><i>Bread &amp; Fred</i></strong> is a challenging co-op platformer from Apogee where two players must cooperate to jump and climb to the top of a snowy mountain. Play as both Bread and Fred in their exasperating and sometimes maddening climb that requires precision with every jump.
