There are no zombies, no cannibals, no aliens. Just the the cold dark vastness of space. However, don't let that fool you.  YOU WILL DIE! No way Around it.  It's going to happen, eventually. \r\nNever the less, that doesn't mean you can't have a long and productive life in space, with a little help from technology.\r\n\r\nAlthough, we're nearly ready to give everyone the chance to critique all our hard work, there are a few mechanics still needing some extra attention to catch up with the rest of the class.\r\n\r\n* Building additional hub for your station still not implemented. \r\n* Tutorials for Researching new items to craft.  \r\n* Replacing and Tweaking Animations.\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\n* Occasionally, animation resets when mining ore back to Zero G animation. \r\n\r\nComing Soon:\r\n* Space Station Hubs:  Build and add to your Station. \r\n* More Craftables:   Make your station a home and craft furniture and more. \r\n* Station arcade:  Space can be boring luckily you have your stations computer to play games on.
