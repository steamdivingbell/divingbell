Set in the mesmerizing landscapes of Cappadocia, T\u00fcrkiye's most enigmatic region, this game weaves a tapestry of Anatolian lore, arcane rituals, and futuristic technology. Inspired by the time-honored art of Turkish shadow puppetry, this unique experience fuses 2D platforming with interactive cinema, all set to a haunting score by legendary composer Inon Zur.
