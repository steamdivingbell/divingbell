{"about_the_game":"The Ranch of Rivershine soundtrack is my first foray into composing music influenced by both folk and country, as well as orchestral chamber music.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI started working on this OST when Eloise (the game developer) reached out to me back in 2021. While I've worked with Eloise in the past, we haven't made this large of a game or soundtrack. I've put so much work into these melodies and arrangements, and I hope that energy translates to your listening experience as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMusic isn't just an emotional enhancer, but also a sort of postmark on where we were in life when we heard the music (or in my case created it). I hope this soundtrack can not only enhance the game for you, but also give you something to remember and latch onto years after playing. I've put my heart and soul into each piece, and I hope that it reaches you emotionally.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI'd like to give a special shoutout to Eloise. For not only allowing me to be a part of her created world, but also for all of her flexibility and creativity. Without her world and ideas, this music wouldn't exist. I wouldn't have gotten the chance to compose such an electic mix of folk music with orchestral instruments. Not only that, but she gives me almost free reign over whatever I write, and is always open to changes or experimentation. For that I am grateful.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI also want to give a huge HUGE thank you to all of the musicians who played on this soundtrack. Especially with more folk influenced music, live soloists play a huge role. I can't thank them enough for taking the time to play my music, and play it so beautifully. Thank you again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLastly I want to thank my girlfriend, family, and friends for all of their unwavering support. Composing music is mostly a solitary activity, but with their help I was able to power through when needed. Thank you again to all of my friends, who are always there for me when I need them. Your support means more than you can imagine, especially to some random guy from a tiny town in South Carolina USA. :)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI'd also like to say that this isn't all the music for the game! More music will be coming out. Depending on its size it will either be added to this album, or made into a 2nd volume. I will be adding the album to streaming services when all pieces are done. <br />\r\ncredits<br />\r\nreleases May 12, 2023<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMusicians:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIrina Markevich - Violin (track 1)<br />\r\nRebecca Rovny - Fiddle (tracks 2, 11, 13)<br />\r\nJeff Ball - Fiddle (track 4)<br />\r\nJason Foit - Clarinet (tracks 6, 7, 12, 13)<br />\r\nTyler Mire - Flugelhorn (tracks 7, 10)<br />\r\nLucia La Rezza - Viola (track 8)<br />\r\nBrett McDonald - Irish Flute (track 11)<br />\r\nJohn Paul Hayward - Cello (track 11)<br />\r\nKatie Shesko - Flute (track 13)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLive guitars, bouzouki, bass guitar, lap steel, piano, mandolin: Matthew Harnage<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdditional Mixing by James C.
