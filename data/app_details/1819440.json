{"about_the_game":"Block Line Engineer is a physics based sandbox automation simulation game where you build machines from basic parts like motors, rotating joints and connector plates. Once your machine is done you teach it how to move and maybe combine it with a different machine to form a block line. Block lines are moving blocks to block receivers. Optimize your block lines to achieve maximum throughput.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Realistic Physics</strong><br>Both machines and blocks are simulated in a way that mimics real life physics. Machines need to be driven by motors. Links with many parts attached are heavier. Weight needs to be taken into consideration when choosing the right motor (choose too small of a motor and you end up with a slow moving, overloaded machine.)<br></li><li> <strong>Easy click and place machine building</strong><br>Just click on whatever part you want to add and the game will show you were that part can be attached.<br></li><li> <strong>Simple machine teaching</strong><br>Just drag the link you want to move to where you want it to be and add a move command. Open or close the gripper and add a grip command. Play back your command chain to see your machine move through all the poses you defined (and hopefully do something useful along the way.)<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1819440/extras/DragAndPointIk5.gif?t=1663118825\" /><br></li><li> <strong>Unlimited possibilities</strong><br>Want to create a machine with 6 independent arms?
