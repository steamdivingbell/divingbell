{"about_the_game":"The Marines have landed! Explore new warfare capabilities in Arma 3 with the Expeditionary Forces Creator DLC. Prepare your Marines for action on the Amphibious Warfare Ship, assault enemy shores with AAV-9 Mack IFVs and Combat Boats, bring supplies ashore with the LCC-1 Landing Craft, perform raids behind enemy lines with new Hunter reconnaissance vehicles, and take part in the invasion of Altis from a new perspective.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">HOW TO LAUNCH</h2><br>Arma 3 Creator DLC: Expeditionary Forces is optional to install and load. To play Arma 3 with this DLC enabled, please visit the DLC section in the Arma 3 Launcher, make sure Expeditionary Forces is owned and loaded, then launch the game by clicking the PLAY button.<br><br><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong><br>This PC game is a work of fiction. Neither the United States Marine Corps nor any other component of the Department of Defense has approved, endorsed, or authorized this product.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">KEY FEATURES</h2><br><strong>AAV-9 Mack</strong><br>The AAV-9 Mack is an amphibious Infantry Fighting Vehicle capable of ferrying a squad of 13 Marines from ship to shore at high speed. It is equipped with either a 30mm or 50mm autocannon and a 7.62mm coaxial machine gun. It features an extendable periscope for the commander and hatches in the back to allow troops to turn out and return fire.<br><br><strong>Combat Boat</strong><br>The Combat Boat is a 17 meter long multi-role vessel. Its high speed, combined with a versatile design, makes it suitable for amphibious assaults, maritime patrol, and fire support. It can carry a squad of 16 troops plus crew, and can be fitted with a variety of weapons.<br><br><strong>LCC-1 Landing Craft</strong><br>The LCC-1 is a landing craft used to ferry equipment and vehicles from ship to shore. Its design allows it to change between a slow-speed shallow draft ship and a high-speed catamaran. It has a maximum payload of 200 tons and is capable of reaching speeds up to 35 knots (or 65 kph).<br><br><strong>Amphibious Warfare Ship \u201cUSS Takmyr\u201d (LPD-36)</strong><br>The Amphibious Warfare Ship is the core of Marine Expeditionary Units. Acting as a floating barracks, it allows MJTFs to deploy all the assets required to sustain operations abroad. Named after the Takistani capital following one of Operation Arrowhead\u2019s fiercest battles, the LPD-36 USS Takmyr is the ship assigned to carry the 29th MEU to Altis and execute Operation Resolute Cyclone.<br><br>Its design features a flight deck with hangar for launching helicopters, and a well deck to launch landing crafts or amphibious assault vehicles.<br><br><strong>One New Faction</strong><br>The Marine Joint Task Force has arrived. It is a self-contained expeditionary unit capable of operating independently from amphibious warfare ships and specialized in fighting in littoral areas. It comes with a variety of new equipment, including helmets, vests, uniforms, night vision devices, and scuba diving gear.<br><br><strong>Hunter Reconnaissance Vehicles</strong><br>Taking advantage of the capable MRAP chassis, the Hunter Reconnaissance Vehicles greatly expand on their firepower and sensors. Three new variants are available: Fire Support Vehicle (featuring a 30mm rapid-fire autocannon and Titan missiles), Anti-Tank (featuring a dual Titan-NLOS launcher and 7.62mm coaxial machine gun), and Low Altitude Air Defense (featuring a 30mm rapid fire autocannon, SAAMI missiles, and short-range radar for drone detection).<br><br><strong>AH-99J Python</strong><br>At the request of the Marines, an upgrade for the AH-99 was developed in the late 2010s. Named AH-99J Python, the helicopter trades some of its stealth capabilities for long-range datalink antennas, more powerful radar, and external stores allowing it to carry a wider array of weapons, including AGM-122M Sidearm anti-radiation missiles and Titan NLOS pods.<br><br><strong>Resolute Cyclone SP Mini-Campaign</strong><br>On the eve of the NATO invasion on Altis, Marines from the 29th MEU are tasked with securing the western part of the island. Join the MJTF in this single player mini-campaign, use stealth to infiltrate enemy territory, cut the enemy off from reinforcements, and liberate Kavala from the AAF.<br><br><strong>Rope In Hand MP CO-OP</strong><br>A platoon from Light Armor Reconnaissance is tasked with clearing the road for the Marines who are rapidly advancing towards Athira.
