You are free to place whatever animals, plants and scenic objects you desire. But be warned because every action has a consequence and you wouldn't want your ecosystem to collapse! Work with E.Corp to become an island expert and make your millions.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1533860/extras/Splitter.png?t=1669937804\" /><br><br>You will be working with a company called E.Corp who are your friend when it comes to making money and progressing through the game! You will need to send them your animals to help them out, whether it's for a new exhibit in a zoo or to be used for research. You should assist them as much as possible and make a pretty penny at the same time!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1533860/extras/ecorp.gif?t=1669937804\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1533860/extras/Unlocking.png?t=1669937804\" /><br><br>As you get deeper into the game and earn more money, you will be able to unlock many new species of animals and plants! There are various ways that you can do this, the easiest is by completing missions. The next method is animal research, this will cost you but after funding the research of an animal you will be able to unlock and purchase them for the island. Finally, you will get random visitors throughout your time playing Ecoplanet, to get them to stay you must meet their requirements and convince them your island is the best to call their home.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1533860/extras/ItemResearch.gif?t=1669937804\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1533860/extras/IslandToursSplitter.png?t=1669937804\" /><br><br>Open up your very own island tours business and let guests view your island in boats, helicopters and submarines. Open up food, drink and souvenir shops to maximize your profits and keep your customers happy.

Some of the genetics that you can breed for are below:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Height<br></li><li> Hunger<br></li><li> Speed<br></li><li> Lifespan<br></li><li> Reproduction Rate</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1533860/extras/TerrainEditingSplitter.png?t=1669937804\" /><br><br>Using the terrain editor you can create tall mountains and deep rivers to accommodate for the animals on your island.
