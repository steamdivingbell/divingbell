Eventually, Kotaro learns from a &quot;god&quot; that he has been transported back in time to the Edo period as a soul, and that he is now in Yoshiwara, the pleasure quarter in Edo, the capital of 19th-century Japan.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong><u>\u25c6 A Grotesque Mystery Adventure Set in Yoshiwara</u></strong><br>Without knowing why he has arrived in this era or how to return to the modern world, Kotaro begins to wander around Yoshiwara in search of clues to unravel the &quot;mystery.&quot; Soon, he encounters the murder of an oiran (courtesan) and takes on the role of a &quot;detective&quot; to solve the case. However, he is drawn into a series of grotesque murders.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong><u>\u25c6 A Time-Loop Narrative That Brings You Closer to the Truth</u></strong><br>The mystery of the &quot;oiran murder,&quot; a central part of the story, cannot be solved in a single playthrough.
