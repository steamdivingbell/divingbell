{"about_the_game":"The events take place during the first ascension to the throne of Vlad III Tepes, the historical Dracula. He reclaims his throne from the hands of Vladislav, who murdered his father, tortured and killed his brother. In front of Dracula's army, Vladislav abandons his throne and flees to Transylvania to save his life, but Dracula takes his best warriors to hunt him down personally. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe core gameplay is a combination of Castlevania 3 and Super Meat Boy, on top of which some new and unique elements are added. In Castlevania style, there is a little delay in the hit, so you have to predict enemy behavior and position, plan your attacks and wisely use the ammo and sub-weapons at your disposal. In Super Meat Boy's style, the levels are short, you have infinite lives (in the casual mode), and you instantly respawn after you die. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo beat each level you have to overcome all obstacles perfectly: no hit, no mistake. In pro mode you can access more content: more levels, more enemy types, more sub-weapons, weapon upgrades, but it all comes with a cost: you have limited lives. You can slightly expand them with a couple of 1ups scattered around the game, hidden in secret places, but you have to really know what you\u2019re doing if you want to beat the game in pro mode. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo buckle up and take control of one of the coolest villains in history in his manhunt for judgement and revenge. Use skill and cold-blooded planning to crush the enemies beneath your feet just to raise them back up in pales. Pick up the sword, and let the manhunt begin!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1814760/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735752441","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1814760/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1735752441","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1814760/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735752441","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1814760/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735752441","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"The game contains violence, gore, torture and nudity.
