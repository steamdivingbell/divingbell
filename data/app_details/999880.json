{"about_the_game":"Take VR journeys through the TRAPPIST-1 system of exoplanets and to NASA\u2019s Spitzer Space telescope, which played a key role in their discovery. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTravel along with one of NASA\u2019s Great Observatories in the Spitzer module to see how its 16+ year mission enabled astronomers to study the universe as it appears in infrared light. Then interactively take control of Spitzer yourself to observe sources in infrared sky and review your data once it\u2019s been transmitted to Earth.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe TRAPPIST-1 tour takes you on an imagined voyage to an incredible system of 7 Earth-sized worlds discovered and characterized by Spitzer working in collaboration with other telescopes on Earth and in space. The immersive imagery is inspired by our best current scientific understanding of these exoplanets. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis experience has been developed and updated by the Communications and Education group at Caltech/IPAC in support of the Spitzer mission, which concluded science operations on January 30th, 2020.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/999880/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1611790036","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/999880/page.bg.jpg?t=1611790036","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/999880/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1611790036","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/999880/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1611790036","categories":[{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Take VR journeys through the TRAPPIST-1 system of exoplanets and to NASA\u2019s Spitzer Space telescope, which played a key role in their discovery. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTravel along with one of NASA\u2019s Great Observatories in the Spitzer module to see how its 16+ year mission enabled astronomers to study the universe as it appears in infrared light.
