This pack features 30 maps including a Victorian-style Mansion Setting, a large assortment of blank Mansion Area Templates for DM's to fill, a bonus pack of 28 Furniture Tokens to fill them and the Tramp Freighter Ship map from Shipstarter, my collection of ships. This unusual setting and first pack represents the primary tendril of my upcoming Lovecraftian Meanders which will provide a large array of additions to this genre and this map pack.
