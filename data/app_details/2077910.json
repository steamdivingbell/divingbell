{"about_the_game":"The Skelton zones on the surface are not the only places trapping travelers. Enter the Blood Pits as a new rescuer. The mission: Save as many as you can as you descend down the elevator and rescue travelers on each level. Fight through endless waves of mutants and followers as they keep the final remnants of true human DNA locked away. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn FPS style action where you navigate through the dark caves and structures. Dig through rocks and shoot the opponents. Locate the 'travelers' and make it back to the elevator alive to descend just one floor deeper. There is no end. You do not escape to a better life, this is all there is. The only question to ask of the rescuer: how many final human travelers can you save?","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"10 LAYERS DEEP","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2077910/0fe37a111a1d855ed5cecca5b0bc1cb695cd3430.jpg"},{"name":"FIRST LIFE SAVED","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2077910/dd99d30548c95baa3fb452331e2fc578218ddb7b.jpg"},{"name":"KILL MAGNET","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2077910/ee55769ed6288cd00164b4b0614f78f74f823629.jpg"},{"name":"20 LAYERS DEEP","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2077910/cbe26ccf3fe831b91ecbd534b33288ecd43e1883.jpg"},{"name":"AMMO THIEF","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2077910/a587fbdcb32a1928cedbcb66b2f348dde9088bc6.jpg"}],"total":5},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2077910?t=1713537445","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2077910/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1713537445","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2077910/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1713537445","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2077910/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1713537445","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Violence and Blood"},"detailed_description":"The Skelton zones on the surface are not the only places trapping travelers.
