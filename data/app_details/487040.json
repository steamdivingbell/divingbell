No... the 88 Heroes!<br><br>Prepare to infiltrate Dr. H8\u2019s lair with the help of the strangest, dumbest and most pointless superheroes ever! With 88 levels between you and Dr. H8, only 88 seconds to complete each level and the 88-minute Doomsday clock already ticking, lead 88 unique characters \u2013 each with their own special abilities \u2013 on a platform-hopping, enemy-smashing, danger-dodging mission to save Earth from complete destruction!<br><br>Can the 88 Heroes save the day?
