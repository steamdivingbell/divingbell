{"about_the_game":"The autumn breeze brings you to the sunless city of Darkwood, where you intend to find some inspiration and finish your new horror book in peace.

Nevertheless, the gray of the sky and the red rye fields are bewitching! One can say, they have become something of a muse for the not-so-hospitable locals. So beware. The harvest festival is approaching and I'm afraid by that time you won't be able to leave the city.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2984060/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1717487895","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2984060/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1717487895","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2984060/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1717487895","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2984060/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1717487895","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The autumn breeze brings you to the sunless city of Darkwood, where you intend to find some inspiration and finish your new horror book in peace.
