{"about_the_game":"All aboard, set sail for the Planet Zoo: Oceania Pack! Explore breathtaking archipelagos and experience the beauty and culture of the continent\u2019s sun-kissed Pacific islands. Featuring five unique animals found waddling on sandy beaches or hiding in rich forests, along with more than 200 brand-new scenery pieces inspired by Polynesian traditions. Test your zookeeping skills with a new scenario focusing on wildlife conservation atop a radiant island paradise.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>FIVE ICONIC ANIMALS</strong></h2>Meet wonderful new animals from the wild coasts of Oceania: the North Island brown kiwi, Tasmanian devil, little penguin, quokka, and the spectacled flying fox. Discover the small North Island brown kiwi cautiously foraging and exploring its new home in your zoo; hear the impressive screech of a boisterous Tasmanian devil as it roams and fights in its habitat; marvel at the colonies of hundreds of little penguins waddling and resting on their bellies; recognize the heartwarming smile of a quokka; and look up to see the majestic spectacled flying fox soaring and exploring its walkthrough exhibit.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>200+ BOLD SCENERY PIECES</strong></h2>Expand your zoo with a wider range of gorgeous new scenery pieces influenced by the Oceania region. Focusing on natural building materials such as dried leaves, wood, fibres, and weaves alongside patterned heavy carved wooden decorations and colourful flower adornments, their authentic beauty is enhanced by the vivid colours of the land. Add a more playful touch to the landscape with Tiki carved decorations, which have various expressions and are also customisable! This happy face could wear a crown of foliage, a vibrant lei, or serve as a torch to light up your zoo during the evening.  Alongside these fun pieces, discover impressive glow-in-the-dark faux lava and new flora \u2013 most notably the unique nikau palm, and the king fern which will tower over your guests. All these stunning additions will help you build the most idyllic zoo for your animals and guests to enjoy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>AN EXCITING CAMPAIGN SCENARIO</strong></h2>Say \u2018Hayo\u2019 to familiar faces! Reuniting again with Bernie Goodwin and his daughter, try your hand at our brand-new campaign scenario set atop the blissful sun-soaked island that is the Goodwin Family Wildlife Park. Emma has reached out with plans for a more personal new zoo project, which she will build alongside her father. Will Bernie be able to let go of the reins whilst you help Emma build the zoo from the ground up, and have you got what it takes to support this family project?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2502240/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1706276135","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2502240/page.bg.jpg?t=1706276135","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2502240/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1706276135","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2502240/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1706276135","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"All aboard, set sail for the Planet Zoo: Oceania Pack!
