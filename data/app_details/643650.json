{"about_the_game":"\u2018The Pillars of the Earth\u2019 tells the story about the construction of a cathedral in 12th century England \u2013 an almost impossible undertaking in a time of war and great despair. Conspiracies and political intrigue endanger the lives of Aliena the noblewoman, Jack the outlaw-turned-mason, Philip the monk and their hometown of Kingsbridge. Will faith and love prevail in the face of violent attacks, ruthless kings and greedy bishops? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe soundtrack, composed by Tilo Alpermann, reflects these themes: darkness and violence, longing and loss, faith and passion. Tilo Alpermann\u2019s composition wonderfully orchestrated by the FilmHarmonic Orchestra in Prague is a piece of art retelling the story of 'The Pillars of the Earth' without words and visuals. A wonderful achievement.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/643650/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1581558790","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/643650/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1581558790","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/643650/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1581558790","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/643650/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1581558790","categories":[{"description":"Additional High-Quality Audio","id":50}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"\u2018The Pillars of the Earth\u2019 tells the story about the construction of a cathedral in 12th century England \u2013 an almost impossible undertaking in a time of war and great despair.
