{"about_the_game":"Gravepact is a survival roguelite where the goal is to destroy as many incoming enemies as possible, while collecting experience to spend on attacks, passive items and skills to build your character into a powerful conduit of destruction that lays waste to everything in your way.<br><br>Eight strangers find themselves pulled towards a long forgotten graveyard, under the power of an invisible force they are incapable of resisting. Why were they gathered here? Who commands the coven of witches determined to keep them there? What dark secrets are your companions hiding from you, or even from themselves?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Features</strong></h2><strong>Eight characters with branching class upgrades that provide additional skills and improve your primary attack in their own way.</strong><br>Start from a Gravekeeper shoveling zombies over the head and end with a Wraith Queen that commands angry ghosts to shred her enemies to pieces.<br>Or begin as a humble Occultist threshing enemies with zig-zagging Eldritch Bolts as he works his way up to becoming an Archmage of unimaginable power.<br>From magic and archery to summoning and just good old fashioned hacking and slashing, there is a playstyle for everyone.<br><br><strong>Bank upgrades</strong><br>Levelups in Gravepact do not constantly interrupt your gameplay the way they do in most Survivor type games Open up your character screen at any time to spend your level-ups on new weapons, items and upgrades, as well as improve your skills. A + sign on your portrait will let you know if there is something new to be gained.<br><br><strong>Forge new weapons, spells and powers</strong><br>Hate having to get a specific item to upgrade a specific attack into another specific attack? Gravepact does away with narrow limitations. You don't need any specific passive item to upgrade any specific attack. Attacks are upgraded using gems you find during the game and any base attack type can be turned into an ultimate attack type. IE: A base weapon like the Javelin can be turned into any Ultimate weapon like the Knife of Hearts or the Muramasa. <br><br><strong>Dig up the past to increase your power</strong><br>All of the characters have something to contribute beyond their skill in carnage. As you discover more about them and the place you are stuck in together your collective power will grow. Better stats, new and improved starting bonuses, in-run character updates and events, and more.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3102450?t=1737995358","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3102450?t=1737995358","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3102450/51d6d1ddd3734438029dc1dfe001d1e261186ac0/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737995358","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3102450/51d6d1ddd3734438029dc1dfe001d1e261186ac0/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737995358","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"One character indicates he has committed many crimes in the past, including rape and slavery.\r\n\r\nAnother character witnessed the sexual abuse of a young male servant.\r\n\r\nThe main villain will encourage the player to engage in self abuse."},"demos":[{"appid":3198770,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Gravepact is a survival roguelite where the goal is to destroy as many incoming enemies as possible, while collecting experience to spend on attacks, passive items and skills to build your character into a powerful conduit of destruction that lays waste to everything in your way.<br><br>Eight strangers find themselves pulled towards a long forgotten graveyard, under the power of an invisible force they are incapable of resisting.
