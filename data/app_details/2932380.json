{"about_the_game":"<strong>New units join the fight!</strong><br><br>11 new units are ready to enter the battle for Gladius Prime with the <strong>Demolition Pack</strong>!<br><br>These new units are ready to demolish all the enemies\u2019 defenses and they will give you more new strategic options.   <br><br><strong>Sydonian Dragoon - Adeptus Mechanicus</strong><br><br><i>Fast close-combat walker unit</i><br><br>Dragoons are tried and tested Skitarii warriors of the Adeptus Mechanicus who are given the honour of riding to war atop venerated, stilt-legged Ironstrider Engines. These fearless cavaliers thunder through enemy fire to plunge lance-first into the thick of the enemy's ranks, the pent-up energies of their taser weaponry blasting the foe back in a blazing storm of sparks. Those foolish enough to mount a counter-assault are stamped unceremoniously into the dirt.<br><br><strong>Field Ordnance Battery - Astra Militarum</strong><br><br><i>Large man-portable artillery pieces able to shell out enemy units at long range</i><br><br>Ordnance teams crew some of the largest human-maneuverable weapons fielded by the Astra Militarum. On Gladius Prime, the imperial regiments exclusively use anti-infantry Bombast Cannons. This is less down to any particular military plan and more due to an Adeptus Administratum counting error in an ancient shipping manifest. <br><br><strong>Chaos Terminator - Chaos Space Marines</strong><br><br><i>Elite heavily armoured infantry that excels against all targets and can use powerful combi-weapons</i><br><br>Chaos Terminators form the elite of their masters' Heretic Astartes warbands, for though they are ponderous compared to their standard Power Armour-clad comrades, nothing short of a dedicated anti-tank laser can stop a Terminator in full stride. These seasoned killers often act as the personal guards of an esteemed Champion of Chaos, enforcing the commands of their leader with pitiless efficiency and taking their pick of the spoils after each victory.<br><br><strong>Talos - Drukhari</strong><br><br><i>Heavy assault creature with powerful close-range weapons</i><br><br>The Talos Pain Engine is a ghoulish melding of stitch-puckered flesh and armoured artifice, boasting tremendous resilience and a nightmarish array of weaponry. Each is the proud creation of the Drukhari Haemonculi, who employ their Talos as torture devices, surgical assistants and armoured murder machines with equal delight.<br><br><strong>Wraithlord - Craftworld Aeldari </strong><br><br><i>Versatile monstrous creature equipped with a vast array of weapons and able to perform powerful melee attacks</i><br><br>Each Wraithlord is a precious component of its craftworld\u2019s forces. Body and animating spirit alike are revered relics of a vanished age, for only the souls of the strongest Eldar heroes have the psychic presence to give life to these wraithbone shells. These long-departed nobility fight as they did in life \u2013 if they favored the press of close combat or the art of killing from afar, this will be reflected in the Wraithlord\u2019s choice of weapon.<br><br><strong>Skorpekh Destroyer - Necrons</strong><br><br><i>Elite armoured close-range infantry unit</i><br><br>Not all of the Necron Destroyer cult favour ranged weaponry or hover modifications. Rushing forward like ungainly tripods, their hyperphase limbs sweeping in a whirlwind of gore, Skorpekh Destroyers feed their need to kill whenever they are unleashed upon the battlefield. Nothing else can override the hard-wired desire to destroy all organic life that empowers these deranged Necrons.<br><br><strong>Burna Boy - Orks</strong><br><br><i>Anti-infantry unit equipped with a versatile flamethrower</i><br><br>Burna Boyz are dedicated arsonists all, advancing on the foe amid gouts of billowing flame. They love nothing more than burning other peoples\u2019 stuff, and the owners too if they can get them. These lunatics will set light to anything or anyone for the simple joy of watching them \u2018do the burny dance\u2019. They can prove utterly lethal to tightly packed or lightly armoured infantry, the roiling blasts of their burnas flushing their victims out of cover amid the sizzle of cooking flesh. Faced with more heavily armoured enemies, the Burna Boyz simply twist the apertures of their burnas to provide a tight, metal-slicing jet of blue heat. Charging into combat, Burna Boyz use these weapons to slice even incredibly resilient foes into glowing, heat-seared chunks.<br><br><strong>Arco Flagellant - Adepta Sororitas </strong><br><br><i>Expendable light melee infantry</i><br><br>Arco-flagellants lope alongside faithful armies in packs, their lashlike limbs whipping back and forth as they follow their priestly masters to battle. When the enemy is sighted, they are driven into a frenzied killing rage by a potent cocktail of adrenal stimulants and neural kill-signals, whereupon they hurl themselves into battle with no thought for self-preservation or restraint. Hacking and slashing with cyber-implanted flails, pneu-mattocks and cleavers, they fight on dementedly until there is nothing left of their foes but a pile of mutilated corpses.<br><br><strong>Assault Terminator - Space Marines</strong><br><br><i>Heavy melee infantry unit equipped with a powerful weapon and shield</i><br><br>The first company veterans deployed as Terminator Assault Squads forgo ranged combat, instead blasting their way with thunder hammers and deflecting enemy fire with their towering storm shields. This combination is especially effective in the close confines of boarding actions or tunnel-fighting, where a single squad can slaughter many times their number of foes without taking a single casualty.<br><br><strong>Fire Warrior Breacher - T\u2019au</strong><br><br><i>Short-range infantry unit that excels in counterattacks</i><br><br>T\u2019au Breacher infantry specialize in brutally effective close-range assaults, clearing enemy structures and fortified positions of threats in a tight, tactical formation. They deliver sharp, shockingly sudden frontline displays of raw incendiary power that grind enemy soldiers into dust, discharging Pulse Blasters and hurling Photon Grenades until they are certain every path is clear. <br><br><strong>Maleceptor - Tyranids</strong><br><br><i>Synapse monstrous creature with support psychic capabilities</i><br><br>Though blind, the rare and mighty Maleceptor is a living vessel for the Hive Mind. Warp energy spears from its eyeless cranium to vaporize anything in its path, and those with minds strong enough to survive its keening psychic screams are laid low by its powerful talons.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2932380/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736763276","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2932380/page.bg.jpg?t=1736763276","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2932380/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736763276","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2932380/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736763276","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>New units join the fight!</strong><br><br>11 new units are ready to enter the battle for Gladius Prime with the <strong>Demolition Pack</strong>!<br><br>These new units are ready to demolish all the enemies\u2019 defenses and they will give you more new strategic options.   <br><br><strong>Sydonian Dragoon - Adeptus Mechanicus</strong><br><br><i>Fast close-combat walker unit</i><br><br>Dragoons are tried and tested Skitarii warriors of the Adeptus Mechanicus who are given the honour of riding to war atop venerated, stilt-legged Ironstrider Engines.
