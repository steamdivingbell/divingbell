{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Origin</h2>When we wanted to really learn to type, we tried countless other typing games and apps and none of them did what we wanted. So we decided to build our own. We liked how it turned out so much, that we decided to share it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Learn to type</h2>Most people don't want to become competitive typists, they want to be able to type quickly and easily in their daily lives, ideally without looking at their hands. By starting with word and letter frequency analysis, we developed our learning curriculum with the goal of improving your touch typing as much as possible, as quick a possible. Our system tracks your in-game performance (locally) and uses that data to customize your experience as you play.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Speed and Technique</h2>The Speed Test let you measure and track your progress, and see you how you compare to friends and foes. But there is more to to being an excellent typist than pure speed. It also tracks a whole set of metrics to help you increase accuracy, reduce errors, build consistency, and avoid the bad habits that lead to repetitive stress injuries.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2906450/extras/Banner_KeyboardSwitch_half_small.gif?t=1717560253\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Modes</h2>When learning anything, practice is key, but no one wants to do the same mind-numbing drill for the millionth time. Each game mode lets you have fun, improve your typing, and compete against your friends on the leaderboards. For example, <strong>Narrative Mode</strong> combines competitive typing and speed running, and the <strong>1k &amp; 5k Challenges</strong> have you compete to score the fastest cumulative time on the most common words in the English language.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2906450?t=1717560253","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2906450?t=1717560253","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2906450/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1717560253","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2906450/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1717560253","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"VR Supported","id":53},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Origin</h2>When we wanted to really learn to type, we tried countless other typing games and apps and none of them did what we wanted.
