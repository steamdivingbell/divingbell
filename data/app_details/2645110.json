{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What is Xenos?</h2>Xenos is a retro pet battler/creature collector featuring all of the things that make the genre great. Many different species of Xenos(50 and counting as of writing this!), 5 rare forms for each Xeno, randomly generated stats and movepools, strategic turn based combat. Its all there! While hunting for all the rare Xenos you can enjoy a world full of parody, fourth wall breaks, and the story of how Xenos and humans live side by side.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GamePlay Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Randomized Stats - All Xenos have randomly generated stats. Species of Xenos may lean toward one stat or another, but there is massive variety between individuals. Any Xeno can be built to suit any style.<br></li><li> Randomized MovePools - When Xenos level up and would learn a move there are a variety of moves they can potentially learn. You may have two of the same species with totally different movesets. Don't worry, there are move learning items for when you need to get the moveset just right.<br></li><li> 5 Different Rare Variants - Searching for rare variants is a huge part of Xenos. Not only do the variants have cool, unique looks, but each variant also adds a buff and adds several additional moves to the movepool. They are hard to find, but not impossible so keep searching!<br></li><li> Strategic Battles - Xenos isn't about getting in there and destroying the enemy in one swoop. You will have to plan your moves and energy point usage to whittle the enemy down and keep your Xeno topped up on health. Slowly drain your enemy little by little or save up energy to unleash massive attacks!<br></li><li> Play at your own pace - Battles are strategic, but that doesn't mean they have to be slow! Speed up battle with 4 different speed settings!</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Who is Xenos for?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Pet battler/Creature collector fans - As a huge fan of the genre, I am setting out to make the game that I would want to play as a fan. If you are someone who eats up any pet battler you can get then this is a no-brainer.<br></li><li> People who like to collect - Another big inspiration for Xenos is the collectible mystery figure craze of the 90s and early 2000s. Rare variants, random stats, and variable movesets will keep you hunting for Xenos for as long as you have time to kill.<br></li><li> People looking for a relaxing time killer - Sometimes you just want to mindlessly wander back and forth in a field and hunt for some rare monsters. The motivation behind several of the systems in Xenos is to make an enjoyable experience where you can dive deep into strategy or just turn your brain off for a while. </li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">So what about the story?</h2>While my main focus for Xenos was creating an engaging gameplay experience,  I know how important a good story is. The world of Xenos is a world fractured by people's opinions on the alien creatures. You will visit several towns all with their own opinions on Xenos. You will see varying viewpoints from towns as a whole as well as on a personal level. You will quickly discover that not everything is black and white. While uncovering the story there are also plenty of breaks for references and jokes. The world of Xenos is complex but not not overly serious.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2645110/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734448807","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2645110/page.bg.jpg?t=1734448807","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2645110/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734448807","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2645110/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734448807","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2799220,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What is Xenos?</h2>Xenos is a retro pet battler/creature collector featuring all of the things that make the genre great.
