{"about_the_game":"Arguably the most well-known indie game of all time, Cave Story features a completely original storyline wrapped with personality, mystery and hours of fast-paced fun.

Uncovering Mimiga Village you discover that the once-carefree Mimigas are in danger at the hands of a maniacal scientist. The Mimigas\u2019 only hope rest squarely on the shoulders of a quiet, amnesiac boy who can't remember his own name.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\tRun, jump, shoot, fly and explore your way through a massive action-adventure reminiscent of classic 8- and 16-bit games.
