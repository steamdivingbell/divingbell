{"about_the_game":"Danger Cliff is a 2D Collectathon Platformer that harkens back to the golden age of internet browser games. You play as Clifford--an overwhelmingly positive young adventurer--followed by his best friend Boxer. One day while the duo was out exploring a set of mysterious sky ruins, Boxer's home starship was blown out of the sky! With no one more competent willing to help, Clifford and Boxer volunteer to explore several huge zones in search of the ship's missing parts before whoever shot it down can get their hands on them.<br><br><strong>Gameplay:</strong> In classic Collectathon style, you start off in a hub world with access to only one level containing several collectables. The more collectables you get, the more new levels you unlock! Eventually, you'll unlock a super-tough boss course which, upon completion, will grant you access to the next set of levels!<br><br><strong>Cone Rush:</strong> Clifford's signature move! When activated, he'll transform into a drill and fly in the direction held. This can be done once horizontally and once upward before needing to recharge by landing. Many of the game's challenges are too large to tackle with a standard jump, so mastery of the Cone Rush is critical! On top of that, there are additional moves such the Air Dash and Power Jump which are not required to beat the game, but allow skillful players to pull off some crazy tricks!<br><br><strong>Content:</strong> The game contains 19 main courses, each with multiple objectives. There are also several extra levels, including dedicated final boss and secret final boss levels, 7 endless challenge rush stages, harder rematches against 6 major bosses, unlockable challenge modes, and more! With a high level of skill, players can beat the final boss after around 2.5 hours of gameplay, while completing the game by getting all 100 collectables will take around 5 hours (First time playthroughs will likely take much longer).","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2271120/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1721994568","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2271120/page.bg.jpg?t=1721994568","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2271120/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1721994568","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2271120/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1721994568","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Danger Cliff is a 2D Collectathon Platformer that harkens back to the golden age of internet browser games.
