But since our hero was only programmed to understand sound, that\u2019s the only way he can interact with his environment.  Each sound you generate can be seen as a pulse of light, and it\u2019s this mechanic that serves as your primary tool for navigating A.V.\u2019s open world.  To help you along, a set of musical instrument algorithms allow for different types of interaction with the world, letting you open access to new areas.  In the midst of this adventure, though, there\u2019s a catch.  The computer you inhabit isn\u2019t all that happy with your newfound sense of self-awareness, and has sent a load of antivirus programs into the system to stop you.  Make too much noise, and you\u2019ll draw their attention.
