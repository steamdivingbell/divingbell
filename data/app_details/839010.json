{"about_the_game":"In Real Winners: Victoryball, you'll operate as a sports robot doing their best to win. Pick up and play rules that change the match and end up with a game that's nothing like where it started. Rules can change everything from the size of the players to adding buzz saws to the field. Fast paced and silly, Real Winners: Victoryball is a great game to pick up and play with friends, relative or frenemies! Real Winners: Victoryball is a <u>4-player local party game.</u><br><br>Real Winners: Victoryball comes with four distinct game modes:<br><br><strong>Victoryball</strong> begins as classic soccer. Kick the ball into the opponents goal. Add a laser fence and a baseball bat for a real challenge.<br><br><strong>Dodgeball</strong> poses the question: What if dodgeballs were also bombs? The answer is: Way more explosions. <br><br><strong>Trophy Troubles</strong> is a free for all where bots scramble to grab the trophy and hold onto it as long as possible. <br><br><strong>King Of The Hill</strong> gets a bit of a twist. This co-op mode finds the bots defending the King Ball from an onslaught of zombots that want to kick him out of his courtly circle. <br><br>Score often, score loudly.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"You really like us!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/839010/aac653d65715f514da49b4e1ea30e91cc0b7a577.jpg"},{"name":"Hol up","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/839010/072aebe162518ead9a4a1dd1b81bbad4efc8ee7f.jpg"},{"name":"Bods 'n Quads","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/839010/e572d39a9abd53315c1891201e7b19e3f738496e.jpg"},{"name":"Rules Lawyer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/839010/e8785590201a62f2b5d6e97d8897a29e5cefb11b.jpg"},{"name":"I'll Be Back","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/839010/32f67a397e26643f89bf346f0ba5a4444bcc826b.jpg"},{"name":"Nonrefundable","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/839010/b96dfde0651f0f803fdf38fee300d9a1c75f3aaa.jpg"},{"name":"Fun for One","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/839010/5c91e5ecc99d7cc0712b7573a9956443be17b105.jpg"},{"name":"Str8-up Savage","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/839010/02aa7cd1b7e2c776bf56a623b73bfde384fc46d7.jpg"},{"name":"They are Risen Indeed","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/839010/bd99377f17334b87850cda084b0431f140083f47.jpg"},{"name":"U Up?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/839010/91281beccae001f944edd66ea9701757a84e9c78.jpg"}],"total":30},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/839010/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1539018796","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/839010/page.bg.jpg?t=1539018796","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/839010/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1539018796","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/839010/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1539018796","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"In Real Winners: Victoryball, you'll operate as a sports robot doing their best to win.
