{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Title: Run and Gun 2: Opossum City</strong></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Genre: Zombie Shooter</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Description:</strong> Not only open world, it\u2019s \u201copen season\u201d on zombies. Welcome to Opossum City, it\u2019s nice to eat you. Here you are trapped in a gothic urban landscape, surrounded by the undead, and low on gas. Your mission: escape the zombified streets, uncover the ghastly secrets of Alex Manor, and try to keep your head\u2014literally.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Key Features:</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Open World Exploration</strong>: Roam freely through a procedurally generated city. Until you hit a dead end street.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>8-Player Co-op Multiplayer</strong>: Why face certain doom alone? Easily connect with your Steam friends. Just click &quot;host&quot; and invite your steam friends to your game. Just like parallel lines, you and your Steam friends have a lot in common but will never meet.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Multiple Locations</strong>: A stereotypical creepy gothic city, an abandoned mall (is there another kind now?), a creepy cemetery, a farmhouse with boarded windows, and a gothic mansion loaded with puzzles. Before you step out, be sure you are dressed to kill.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Challenging Puzzles</strong>: So many big brain puzzles it has the zombies salivating.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Drivable Cars and Flyable Helicopters (with mini guns!)</strong>: Navigate Opossum City with a variety of vehicles. Because what\u2019s an escape plan without a joyride in a zombie apocalypse?</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>High-End Graphics</strong>: Unreal Engine 5 nanite and lumen yield stunning visuals that make the apocalypse look scarily real. You might just think you are running Crysis.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Engaging NPCs</strong>: Meet a cast of quirky characters offering side quests. Including a bowling ball who will send the undead fools flying! You\u2019ll get more strikes than an Amazon fulfillment center.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Nostalgic and Light-Hearted</strong>: Enjoy a light-hearted and nostalgic nod to classic zombie horror games and films, blending humor and horror. Go out and paint the town dead!</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Objective:</strong> Survive endless zombie ambushes, solve the mystery of Alex Manor, and make it out of Opossum City alive. It's just another day in the life, right?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Ideal for fans of zombie shooters, open-world adventures, and cooperative multiplayer chaos. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or new to the genre, Run and Gun 2: Opossum City offers a mix of thrills, chills, and laughs for everyone.</p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Thanks Looser!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2743310/9b3b6fec11732c197164aa4c506526964790ebb5.jpg"},{"name":"Opossum Piss","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2743310/d4904fc1c4cb531a6ce182f0ed5a6b0addb73b48.jpg"},{"name":"BODY COUNT","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2743310/ebe5918f612b275e5a234be97f2a8d5dd9202270.jpg"},{"name":"Hackerman","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2743310/f5de94ab79738e0f649db6b1f2c78ca4cc04b2c4.jpg"},{"name":"Get Wrecked","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2743310/4dd2769a0776505847b1f6384ce29a2fb27f7ab0.jpg"}],"total":5},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2743310/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735567994","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2743310/page.bg.jpg?t=1735567994","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2743310/744c59cc91eaa65de17da3a470d4dcf393e9fc94/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735567994","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2743310/744c59cc91eaa65de17da3a470d4dcf393e9fc94/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735567994","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Mild gun and zombie violence throughout the game."},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Title: Run and Gun 2: Opossum City</strong></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Genre: Zombie Shooter</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Description:</strong> Not only open world, it\u2019s \u201copen season\u201d on zombies.
