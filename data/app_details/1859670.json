{"about_the_game":"<strong>Recommended to play with keyboard and mouse, only partial controller support</strong><br><br>During a hard day of work at Syn Archives, you hear an alarm go off! Suddenly, you and your coworkers are stuck inside the building. You are asked by your manager to figure out what has happened, and to report back to him. Time to put on your detective's hat and figure out what transpired!<br><br>Provisional Detective is a mystery solving game, where with the help of an ancient artifact you try to figure out what happened in the facility! Inspired by games like Paradise Killer and Danganronpa, you walk around a sci-fi inspired environment where through dialogue with the various NPC's you try to figure out all the information there is to find an explanation for the situation at hand. The dialogue includes branching paths and a bit of humor. Enjoy finding out more about Syn Archives where you, the protagonist, work for through reading documents and talking to the NPC's. <br><br>Feel like a true detective when you ultimately have to choose what exactly happened and how it came to be! Through clues and your own intuition you will have to show what you have found during your investigation, but be careful! One small mistake in your logic and you might give the wrong information to your manager, resulting in perhaps the wrong person being accused!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Useless","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1859670/c650e5ada306ce3ffca9a933f8c80237d07e4455.jpg"},{"name":"Bad Ending","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1859670/53124648099e9b31213df4625a2b17410250c7b2.jpg"},{"name":"Almost there!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1859670/5bf8be142c9062dfe98d0a04f424410d790fedcf.jpg"},{"name":"You did it!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1859670/6d813ec15e1eeb1faf5088bf1bb5fd1d1e7aeecd.jpg"}],"total":4},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1859670/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1717093635","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1859670/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1717093635","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1859670/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1717093635","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1859670/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1717093635","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Recommended to play with keyboard and mouse, only partial controller support</strong><br><br>During a hard day of work at Syn Archives, you hear an alarm go off!
