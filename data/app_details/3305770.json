{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>This is a racing game. With seals.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You flop on land, you glide in water, and you try to win. That\u2019s it. No ancient prophecies. No world to save. Just you, a seal, and the finish line.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">At its core, <strong>Flipper Frenzy</strong> is a physics-driven racing game where awkward movement is half the challenge. On land, you\u2019ll galumph, flop, and slide like you\u2019re late for an appointment. But once you hit the water, you suddenly transform into a sleek aquatic powerhouse. Race alone, challenge your friends in split-screen, or go online for a splash of unpredictable chaos.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The current version has racing, customizable seals, multiplayer, and several unique tracks\u2014each with its own strange flavor (like dystopian seal worlds and sky tubes). But that\u2019s just the start. As development continues, expect new game modes, seal parkour, obstacle courses, PVP battles, and a growing roster of pinnipeds to play as.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>If that sounds like something you'd be into, jump in.</strong> The water\u2019s fine.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Key Features</strong></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\ud83e\uddad <strong>Seal Racing (Obviously)</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Race seals. Flop on land. Glide in water. Master both to win. It's harder than it sounds.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\ud83c\udfae <strong>Multiplayer Mayhem</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Compete with friends or strangers. Play online or split-screen with local co-op. Win gracefully or flop furiously.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\ud83c\udf89 <strong>Customizable Seals</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Choose your seal\u2019s colors, patterns, and general &quot;vibe.&quot; If you're going to finish last, at least do it with style.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\ud83c\udf0e <strong>Authentic Tracks (Not Reskinned Templates)</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">No &quot;lava world&quot; or &quot;ice world&quot; clones here. Each track is designed to feel distinct, memorable, and (sometimes) confusing in the best way possible. Current tracks include:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Foggy Lighthouse Island</strong> \u2013 Mysterious and damp.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Frozen Glaciers</strong> \u2013 Cold. Slippery. As expected.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Tropical Oasis</strong> \u2013 Tropical, but somehow still challenging.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Sky Tubes</strong> \u2013 Gravity? What's that?</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Seal Dystopia</strong> \u2013 Weird, unsettling, and full of questions.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>What\u2019s on the Horizon?</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With enough support, <strong>Flipper Frenzy</strong> could grow into more than just a racing game. Here are some of the bigger goals I\u2019m aiming for:</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\ud83c\udfc1 <strong>Seal Parkour Showdowns</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Navigate chaotic obstacle courses filled with jumps, flops, and wild physics. Outlast the competition to be the last seal standing.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\u2694\ufe0f <strong>PVP Arena Battles</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">No racing. Just seals going head-to-head in flop-to-flop combat. Knock, bash, and belly-slam your way to dominance in chaotic arenas.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\ud83c\udfd0 <strong>Seal Sports</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Volleyball, dodgeball, and maybe a few other sports that seals probably shouldn\u2019t be playing\u2014but they will anyway.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\ud83e\uddad <strong>Social Seal Lobbies</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A dedicated space for seals to gather, group up, and queue for races. Show off your customized seal, chat with other players, and prepare for the next big event.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>More Tracks &amp; Seals \u2013 These Are Happening</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Some things aren\u2019t &quot;stretch goals&quot;\u2014they're just part of the plan.</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Game Items\u00a0</strong>&amp; Abilities \u2013 In addition to seals and tracks, I\u2019m looking to add <strong>game-changing items and abilities</strong> that keep every race unpredictable.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>More Tracks</strong> \u2013 No lazy reskins. Each track will have its own distinct theme, layout, and memorable moments. No \u201clava version of the grass track\u201d nonsense here.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>More Seals to Play As</strong> \u2013 Right now, you\u2019ve got harbor, ringed, harp, and ribbon seals. But with time, the roster will expand to include:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Leopard Seals</strong> \u2013 Big. Powerful. The kind of seal you don\u2019t mess with.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Weddell Seals</strong> \u2013 Quiet. Mysterious. The seal that <i>definitely knows something</i>.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Elephant Seals</strong> \u2013 Loud. Massive. Impossible to miss.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Sea Lions</strong> \u2013 Not technically seals, but they\u2019re in the family, so they get a pass.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>What Makes This Game Different?</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You know how most racing games have an &quot;ice world&quot; or &quot;lava world&quot; that\u2019s just a reskinned version of the grass track? <strong>This isn\u2019t that.</strong> Tracks in <strong>Flipper Frenzy</strong> are designed to feel distinct\u2014not like they were slapped together with the same pieces but in different colors. Foggy islands, upside-down sky tubes, and weird seal dystopias are the kind of places you'll race.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">It\u2019s also not a &quot;modern gaming experience.&quot;<br>No battle passes. No premium fish coins. No FOMO countdowns. <strong>You buy it, you play it.</strong> Updates bring more content, not &quot;exclusive offers.&quot; And if you stop playing for a while, no one will spam your inbox with &quot;we miss you&quot; emails.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Honestly, I\u2019m too old to understand half that stuff anyway. I grew up on Nintendo\u2014where you bought a game, played it, and that was it. <strong>That\u2019s the vibe I\u2019m going for here.</strong></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Who\u2019s Making This Game?</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">It\u2019s just me. I\u2019m a solo developer, which means I wear all the hats\u2014coding, hand-modeling, animating the seals, and building most of the levels from scratch. No asset flips. No third-party &quot;content packs.&quot; <strong>Okay, there are some store-bought assets.</strong> I\u2019m not a wizard. But most of it is handmade, from the awkward waddle physics to the tracks that (hopefully) don\u2019t feel like they were pulled from a Unity starter kit.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This project started as a bit of a hobby, but like a little wooden toy hoping to become something more, I\u2019m hoping it can grow into a <strong>real game</strong>. If you like what you see, maybe you can help make this thing a reality.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>For now, it\u2019s a racing game. With seals.</strong></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3305770/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736202327","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3305770/page.bg.jpg?t=1736202327","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3305770/bb984c62f764194112523527e08825a26d264e36/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736202327","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3305770/bb984c62f764194112523527e08825a26d264e36/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736202327","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>This is a racing game.
