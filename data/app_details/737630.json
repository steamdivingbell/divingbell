This migbt as well be the full game\u201d<br>5 \u2013 Giovanni Sizino<br><br>\u201cIncredibly fun game. Shooting myself around the training/menu area and raining arrows on target dummies feel amazing and then jumping into a game against real people takes it to a new level. It can be intense and my aim is awful so most kills come from melee but I am absolutely loving this game!!  I experienced no VR discomfort while playing with joystick turning disabled and I experience it a lot in other fast-paced games.\u201d<br>5 \u2013 Joey Thompson<br><br>\u201cI am not that good at games, too many fiddly buttons to press and master on most of them for my comprehension. Hibrow however is super easy to master, and is tremendous fun. It's not that often that I can say that I have finished a session on a game with such a degree of satisfaction.
