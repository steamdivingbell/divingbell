{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Better Days</h2>  Complications suffered while traveling through the Bajoran Wormhole lead to a historically significant mission to Bajor itself. <br> Starfleet has directed your vessel to carry out a survey mission to the Gamma Quadrant. It should be a relatively simple exploratory mission but, having left Deep Space 9 behind, your passage through the Bajoran Wormhole causes some damage to the ship which forces you to return to the Alpha Quadrant. Further complications mean that you cannot seek help from Deep Space 9, so you must head to Bajor. But it is a very different Bajor than the one you were expecting to find. <br> The away team must locate the means to repair their ship, while delicately navigating the unexpected cultural situation on the planet. Difficult decisions need to be made regarding Starfleet directives and the future of the Bajor you find yourself upon. Will the crew be able to successfully infiltrate Bajoran society and find their way home without impacting the timeline? <br>  <br> Although this is a standalone adventure, a one-page mission brief provides inspiration for continuing the mission. <br>  <br> This product adapted from this 22-page PDF adventure for the <i><strong>Star Trek Adventures</strong></i> roleplaying game is written by Christopher L. Bennett, and is set during <i>The Next Generation </i>era with the player characters being the crew of a Starfleet vessel. This adventure also contains advice on adaptation for use in campaigns based in other <i>Star Trek</i> eras. <br> This adventure requires a <i><strong>Star Trek Adventures</strong></i> core rulebook to use. You will receive a standard version of the PDF as well as a printer-friendly version on white background. <br>  &quot;","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2453140/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1698931689","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2453140/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1698931689","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2453140/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1698931689","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2453140/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1698931689","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Better Days</h2>  Complications suffered while traveling through the Bajoran Wormhole lead to a historically significant mission to Bajor itself. <br> Starfleet has directed your vessel to carry out a survey mission to the Gamma Quadrant.
