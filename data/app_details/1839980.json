As a '90s kid from a challenging background, I\u2019ve always been drawn to gritty, dystopian settings and flawed characters.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is a deeply personal project, with a lot of myself exposed in an exaggerated and pulp dressing and an atmosphere that embodies a dark expression of fatalism and hopelessness, the overall setting is inspired by neo-noir films and psychological dramas such as Hitchcock's Vertigo, Park's Oldboy and Scorsese's Taxi Driver. For the visuals and pacing of the story, I've drawn a lot from movies like Argento's Suspiria, Lynch's Blue Velvet and Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The setting may sound nihilistic but, at its core, Gloomy Juncture leans into common issues and I'm trying to explore themes of mental health, obsession, violence, guilt and human struggles.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">For gameplay, I want to recreate the experience of getting lost in a classic graphic adventure yearning to see &quot;what's next&quot;. Games like Grim Fandango and Broken Sword were key inspirations for the core mechanics, while titles such as Tomb Raider (1996) and Hotel Dusk: Room 215 influenced the puzzle-solving. The gritty, noir atmosphere, on the other hand, is inspired from games like Max Payne and The Wolf Among Us.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Setting the game in the '90s felt natural, aligning both with the classic adventure gameplay I'm evoking and the visual style inspired by early 3D and N64-era.
