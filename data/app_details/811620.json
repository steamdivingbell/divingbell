{"about_the_game":"Welcome to Organosphere \u2013 an epic sci-fi adventure that catapults you into the chaos-ridden remnants of Johannesburg, now ominously known as Johazardousburg.

The Arcadia, or &quot;The Prawn,&quot; your spaceship hub in orbit over South Africa, will be your high-tech fortress in the sky. From its metallic confines, you'll strategize your next move, utilizing an arsenal of features that place victory within your grasp:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Beam Up to The Prawn: </strong>When the battle heats up, ascend to the Arcadia and plan your next assault, overlooking the dystopian landscape below.<br></li><li><strong>Summon Your Motorcycle:</strong> With just a call, beam down a special armored motorcycle to your location and tear through the streets, outrunning your enemies.<br></li><li><strong>Customizable Weaponry: </strong>Forge a unique weapon that adapts to your style, capable of transforming into over 70 different combinations, all customizable on the fly.<br></li><li><strong>Tactical Air Strikes:</strong> From the Arcadia, deploy mini drop ships to lay waste to enemy positions, turning the tide of battle in an instant.<br></li><li><strong>Reload Drones:</strong> Never fear running out of ammo.
