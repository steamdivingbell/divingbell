Choose your loadout and enter quantum unstable zones rich with active matter \u2013 the most valuable and the most dangerous resource in all multiverse. Fight against rivals from other timelines, survive physics-breaking anomalies and try to stay alive. Harvest active matter, gather loot and extract to a safe place before the whole zone ceases to exist with everything inside it.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Active matter changes things and bends space and time, so you might encounter operatives and other survivors that lost their mind and humanity after exposure to this substance.
