{"about_the_game":"Dive headfirst into the mind-bending world of Psychoverse City, where gravity takes a vacation and the neon-soaked cityscape awaits your platforming skills. Get ready for a retro-fueled adventure that will transport you back to the groovy 80s!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEmbark on a psychedelic journey as you traverse a series of uninterrupted levels, leaping and dashing atop wiggly and twisty buildings. Feel the rush as you smash through ad-boards, only to grapple-hook onto floating cars like a true action hero. And hey, who needs stairs when you can bounce off massive fans and zip-line through a flurry of city debris?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut here's the twist: you're not just a player, you're the star of an epic advertisement! Take commands from a director who's filming the ultimate showcase of Psychoverse City. Strike your best poses, capture the most jaw-dropping shots of each scene, and let your inner superstar shine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nImagine a fusion of the fast-paced gameplay of Mirror's Edge, the exhilaration of a Ninja Warrior course, and sprinkle in a generous dose of pink-tinted trippiness. That's the essence of Psychoverse City\u2014an electrifying, corny, and outrageously fun adventure you won't want to miss!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGet ready to groove to adrenaline-pumping beats, unleash your inner ninja, and embrace the cheesy goodness of the 80s.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDisclaimer: Side effects may include an uncontrollable urge to wear neon leg warmers and break out into spontaneous dance moves. Proceed with caution!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/970040/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1686885181","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/970040/page.bg.jpg?t=1686885181","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/970040/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1686885181","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/970040/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1686885181","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Dive headfirst into the mind-bending world of Psychoverse City, where gravity takes a vacation and the neon-soaked cityscape awaits your platforming skills.
