{"about_the_game":"Ten-hut devs! It\u2019s time to storm the battlefield with new characters from the Soldier Character Pack! Choose from 16 characters to lead your players to military success, whether it\u2019s on land, on sea, or in space! Each soldier comes with a sprite, enemy image, faceset, bust, and sv battler! And if that wasn\u2019t enough, every character comes in 2 variations, one wearing a hat or helmet and one without, so you can switch it up when your characters need to be more formal or when they\u2019re kicking back and relaxing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDressed in crisp black and white uniforms, 10 of this pack\u2019s characters are prepared to join your heroes in a modern tale of bravery and monster-butt kicking! Turn your players into brunette male or female recruits and have them befriend the other soldiers in the barracks, whether they\u2019re the cheerful blonde flirting with the others or the serious raven-haired man who has something to prove. And when it\u2019s time to receive their next orders, have your heroes visit the gray-haired and resolute commanders in their metal-decorated jackets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut what if your game takes place in a sci-fi world of spaceships and intergalactic battles?
