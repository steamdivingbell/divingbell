{"about_the_game":"The California Zephyr \u2013 the train many enthusiasts and railroaders alike considered the single-most magnificent passenger train to ever journey across America \u2013 is now available for Train Simulator! Featuring the train\u2019s complete consist of eight unique car types, the DLC also includes highly authentic Western Pacific and Rio Grande Electro-Motive diesel power. <br><br>The California Zephyr made its first run in 1949 and was the ultimate expression of America\u2019s post-World War II \u201cstreamliner era.\u201d On a journey of 2,532 route-miles, the streamliner crossed the American west between Chicago and San Francisco\u2019s Bay Area. Nicknamed the \u201cSilver Lady,\u201d the luxurious train carried travellers, riding in dome cars and comfortable sleepers, across the plains of America\u2019s Heartland on the Burlington Route, through the Rocky Mountains on the Rio Grande, and over the Sierra Nevada via Western Pacific\u2019s Feather River Canyon rails. <br><br>The Budd Company built the California Zephyr\u2019s passenger equipment. Eight car types would eventually become standard on the train, and each is included in this DLC: a streamlined baggage car; vista-dome coach; vista-dome buffet-lounge-dormitory car; 10-roomette, 6-bedroom sleeper; 48-seat diner; standard coach (converted from 16-section sleeper); 5-compartment, 6-double bedroom sleeper; and the train\u2019s signature vista-dome bedroom-lounge-observation. All the California Zephyr cars were individually named with the prefix \u201cSilver\u201d and each lived up to that shimmering image, being constructed of fluted stainless steel. <br><br>Western Pacific powered its leg of the California Zephyr with EMD F-units, and beginning in 1950, FP7s became the standard lead units for the California Zephyr on the WP. Train Simulator\u2019s FP7 California Zephyr set includes Western Pacific FP7 and F7B units for use on the Feather River Canyon route, and also included are Rio Grande EMD F9A and F9B diesels which served as regular power for the streamliner on the D&amp;RGW. <br><br>The \u201cSilver Lady\u201d made its last transcontinental run in March 1970, but even then its tradition carried on, as Rio Grande elected to continue (through 1983) the Denver-Salt Lake City leg of the train\u2019s schedule, with the streamliner renamed the \u201cRio Grande Zephyr.\u201d The new Train Simulator DLC includes passenger equipment both with and without California Zephyr markings, so that both California Zephyr and Rio Grande Zephyr consists can be created. <br><br>The California Zephyr, a cherished fixture of the American railroad scene, is now available for Train Simulator \u2013 and it delivers the unforgettable experience of taking the throttle of one of America\u2019s greatest, most stylish, and most iconic passenger trains. The Train Simulator FP7 California Zephyr pack includes a trio of career scenario for the Feather River Canyon and Soldier Summit routes (both available separately), and additional scenarios \u2013 both for the Feather River Canyon route and Train Simulator\u2019s acclaimed D&amp;RGW Soldier Summit route \u2013 are available at Steam Workshop!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Scenarios</h2><br>The FP7 California Zephyr DLC includes three career scenario for the Western Pacific Feather River Canyon route (available separately):<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tTrain 17 Westbound <br></li><li>\tTrain 18 Eastbound - Part 1 <br></li><li>\tTrain 18 Eastbound - Part 2</li></ul><br>The FP7 California Zephyr DLC also includes two bonus career scenarios for the Soldier Summit route (available separately):<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tRio Grande Zephyr Part 1<br></li><li>\tRio Grande Zephyr Part 2</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
