{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">TENEMENT is a single player, 2D offline arena shooter against up to <strong>64</strong> bots. Storm around 8 huge levels all guns blazing as you wipe out the enemies with six different weapons at your disposal. Kill streaks earn unlocks and unlocks mean new characters, weapons, levels and perks. Choose your favourite character and select from 14 different perks to upgrade them with. Blaze your way up the leaderboards as you complete thousands of free-for-all combinations or play 200 pre-configured scenarios in 'daydream' and 'nightmare' mission modes. Design your own game mode with 100 of your own missions!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">HOW WILL YOU PLAY?</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">It's up to you how you play Tenement. Will you become a sniper, a run and gunner or something else? Snipers can hide in the shadows, taking ludicrously long shots and protecting themself with strategically placed sticky bombs. Run and gun play allows you to hunt down the enemies, confronting them head on with a powerful close range weapon like the shotgun. However you play, you will experience heart stopping moments as you toss holy hand grenades, call in helicopters, airstrikes and even nukes. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3257220/extras/tenement1.gif?t=1730304040\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO?</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The maniacal collection of characters each have their own pros and cons and the levels each have their own charm. Look out for magical gifts from heaven such as Vitellius Feasts, Findlay Diamonds and Snuff Bombs, each with the power to change the game in a heart beat. Avoid the terror of the Medusa, turn the worm for extra perks and rack up the airstrikes and nukes to make them 'holy'. Win extra perks at the start of the game on the random spinner, or even be awarded the power of <i>Red Carlos</i>. Collect the right combination of gifts to go on the absolutely mind bending slow motion, movie-like killing spree known as '<i>Slaughter in the Bronx</i>' where you become godly, racking up insanely high kill streaks with ease.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3257220/extras/tenement2.gif?t=1730304040\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>You will have to take on the mighty Needle-Drunk to unlock the cavern!</i> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3257220/extras/Movie_042.gif?t=1730304040\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There are 100 Steam achievements to get and many of them unlock something new in the game, for example a perk, a character, a weapon mode, a level etc. Here is a breakdown of some of the things you can unlock as you progress through Tenement.\u00a0</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PERKS</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">What's a shooter without perks! Tenement gives you a vast array of perks of which you can use 2 simultaneously. Different styles of play and even the situation at hand will influence your combination of perks, but once you start unlocking them you will just <i>have</i> to try them out!</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">   Fast Fire</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Double Grenades</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Double Ammo</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Longer invincibility shell</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Lucifer Copter</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">More Rare Gifts</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Super Melee</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Extra Health</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Double Damage</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Extra Agility</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Longer Grenade Throw</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Short Grenade Fuse</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Long Grenade Fuse</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Quick Spawn</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3257220/extras/Untitled-5.jpg?t=1730304040\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MAPS</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">All the maps in Tenement are 2D, but they appear 3D, apart from the platforms which have been simplified to make them much more visible than the background. Each map is set in a different year, some in the past, some in the future, but each has been carefully honed for your enjoyment. Every map is littered with different weapons and powerups, not to mention the nooks and crannys which help make the action more exciting.\u00a0</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Tenement</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Favella</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Submarine</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Temple</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Epoch</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Topaz</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Substate</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Cavern</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3257220/extras/Untitled-4.jpg?t=1730304040\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CHARACTERS</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Every character has different agility and health, from very slow but powerful to really fast but weak.

Almost anything you collect has a dramatic effect on the gameplay, potentially bringing you from the bottom of the scoreboard to the top in one breathtaking moment.</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Findlay Diamond (Kills everyone, can trigger 'Slaughter in the Bronx' mode)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Snuff Bomb (Kills everyone)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Medusa Key (Turns one player in the Medusa)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Perk Globule (Gives you an extra random perk)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Vitellius Feasts (Drops different foods which can upgrade you, for example a carrot gives nightvision and invisibility, a sausage turns everyone else into a sausage, a banana gives you the ludicrously overpowered bullet hell that is '<i>heavy bullets</i>')</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In mission mode you can also rescue miniscule businessmen, defuse thunder crash bombs, disconnect mainframes, unlocks Medusas, and find copies of the good book, not to mention motherlodes of gold.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3257220/extras/Untitled-1.jpg?t=1730304040\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CALL INS</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">By going on kill streaks you (or the enemy) earn the ability to call things in. These can be extremely powerful and push your kill streak to almost comical levels. The game will go crazy as you achieve impressive streaks, reacting with pinball style overlays, graphical post processing effects, sinister voice overs and amazing music from one of the 8 different composers who worked on the game. Holy airstrikes and nukes also feature bullet-time style slow motion with religious music and imagery which combine to make awesome cinematic moments. And the ever present &quot;host&quot; will comment on your play every step of the way! You can even turn on swear mode for that little bit more impact.\u00a0</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Helicopter</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Lucifer Copter</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Airstrike</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Nuke</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Holy Airstrike</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Holy Nuke</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CONTROLS</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Tenement supports keyboard and mouse controls, where the mouse controls the crosshair., and the camera follows the crosshair. It also supports PS and XBOX pads, please note the camera behaves slightly differently in joypad modes since the crosshair is not visible, which means the camera follows the player instead. You can zoom in and out, view scores or pause at any time. You can avoid picking something up by holding right mouse button, or a shoulder button on the joypad (this can also be flipped so you need to hold it down to collect a weapon).</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WHATS IT INSPIRED BY?</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Tenement is inspired by the likes of Modern Warfare online mixed with old style 2D platform games of the 90s and the configurability and replayability of Worms. Also thrown into the mix are SmashTV and The Running Man. With a healthy dose of humour as well as inspiration from movies, religion and gameshows it is sure to raise a few eyebrows. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">One thing that sets Tenement apart is the AI: up to 64, smooth, intelligent bots in one map, who are always doing their thing even when completely offscreen. This means there is always multiple battles going on that you aren't even aware of, this makes it really feel like a true online multiplayer game against humans. But with the added advantage that you do not need the internet to play, you can pause without worries, and the gameplay can even speed up and slow down without issue. Play wherever you like, pause whenever you like, and come back later and resume. That is the main advantage over a true multiplayer online game.\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With lots of cinematic references to hundreds of different films and a gameshow type feel Tenement will entertain and suprise you as your work your way up the 39 religious ranks to become a TYNEPUNK. Once there you may decide to <i>prestige</i>, and do it all again. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3257220/extras/Snap_2024-09-30_at_20.53.07.png?t=1730304040\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Tenement also features a mission mode with a mission editor. Each mission in the game is loosely based on a movie title. There is a 3rd mission mode which you can name yourself and even design 100 missions, perhaps you can base them on your favourite movies, bands or something else? Then let your friends see if they can complete it! If you're feeling lazy, there is even a mission generator which will produce 100 random missions for you to use in the 3rd mode, regenerate fresh ones whenever you like!\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">And if you like rolling demos, leave Tenement on the splash screen for &quot;attract mode&quot;, watching the AIs battle it out can be very entertaining. There is also spectate mode, stick it in slow motion, put your favourite tunes on and use it as background visuals.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Tenement has so much more to offer than even listed here, with tons of cool secrets that you will find as you play. Designed by 1 person over a period of 2 years, the game has evolved into something quite special. Enjoy, and remember, just have fun out there.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3257220/extras/Snap_2024-09-30_at_20.54.27.png?t=1730304040\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3257220/extras/Movie_055.gif?t=1730304040\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT IN DEVELOPMENT.

If you're feeling lazy, there is even a mission generator which will produce 100 random missions for you to use in the 3rd mode, regenerate fresh ones whenever you like!\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">And if you like rolling demos, leave Tenement on the splash screen for &quot;attract mode&quot;, watching the AIs battle it out can be very entertaining. There is also spectate mode, stick it in slow motion, put your favourite tunes on and use it as background visuals.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Tenement has so much more to offer than even listed here, with tons of cool secrets that you will find as you play. Designed by 1 person over a period of 2 years, the game has evolved into something quite special. Enjoy, and remember, just have fun out there.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3257220/extras/Snap_2024-09-30_at_20.54.27.png?t=1730304040\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3257220/extras/Movie_055.gif?t=1730304040\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT IN DEVELOPMENT.
