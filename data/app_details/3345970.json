It was a great work. I have to admit, at first I thought it was sus marketing. But it wasn't. It was genuinely great. I love walking sims, and the way the player moves through 3D space as a single concept or intention is absolutely magical. I feel sorry that I played this wonderful work for free.\u201d<br>Game Mediation<br><br>\u201cFrom the moment I started Benign Land, I was captivated by its mysterious and reflective atmosphere. Each scene offers a new perspective, mixing historical elements with a touch of fantasy and surrealism. The soundtrack is a real highlight, intensifying the emotions as we advance through the scenes.\u201d<br>Charles
