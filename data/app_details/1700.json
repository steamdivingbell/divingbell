But as food and drink becomes scarce, the wars become even more violent as each race \u2013 from trolls, goblins, and rat-men, to humans \u2013 struggle for survival.  Now, evil has arisen in this sunless world in the form of the God of Destruction, Akbaa. It\u2019s up to you to defeat Akbaa and save Arx from his reign of terror. You must use bravery and cunning to uncover the long hidden secret of Arx. As your epic quest unfolds you will explore ancient temples, bustling cities and abandoned mines; unearth legendary artifacts and face terrifying foes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build Your Champion</h2>You will become the hero of an underground world. Create a customizable character and allocate skill points in categories such as spellcasting, weapons, armor, and stealth to build your champion.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Wield Powerful Magic</h2>Take out enemy creatures with an innovative casting system featuring 50 powerful spells. Using the mouse, draw runes in mid-air and combine gestures to unleash powerful magical abilities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Forge Your Own Path Through An Immersive World</h2>Arx Fatalis mixes intelligent storytelling with nonlinear gameplay and challenging puzzles, and every choice you make in the game could have drastic impacts on the world.
