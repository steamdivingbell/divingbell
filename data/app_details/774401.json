Be wary of their charged attacks!<br><br><i>Brute</i>: In desperate need of anger management. While slow, in close range the Brute is devastating. Take them down as soon as you can!<br><br><i>Swarmer</i>: Fragile, and highly mobile. The swarmer is the glass cannon of the Boltheads, and one of the only two enemy units that attack from the air. Deadly if you allow their numbers to build up in numbers. <br><br><i>Big Red</i>: Useless at a range, but up close Big Red will self-destruct, dealing terrifying amounts of damage to you or the crystal.
