{"about_the_game":"A.V.A: Dog Tag is a first-person military shooter. The game's key feature is its complex class system. Players can freely select from 3 classes (Point man, Rifle man, Sniper) based on the formation of friendly/enemy troops and as the combat status changes. Compete in this teamwork-based tactical combat experience by strategically countering for enemy's weakness while making up for your own team's weak points through active tactical team formation enabled by class selection.
