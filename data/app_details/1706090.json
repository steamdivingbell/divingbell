{"about_the_game":"Bean and Nothingness is a challenging, turn-based puzzle game in which you turn beans into monsters to help you -- but then these same monsters will get in your way.<br><br>Each puzzle has a set of recipes -- instructions for how to create various monsters.

These monsters can help you -- for instance, both the roller and the bomb are capable of destroying the cracked blocks between you and the goal tile in the puzzle above.

Likewise, getting caught in the bomb's explosion kills you.<br><br>As you progress in the game, you'll meet new monsters (and other mechanics); for each monster, you'll have to learn how it behaves in some easy puzzles, and then move on to more difficult puzzles, where you'll have to combine the mechanics you've learned in new ways. <br><br>Expect puzzles that:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Challenge you to come up with creative ideas<br></li><li> Require you to make efficient use of resources<br></li><li> Test your ability to manage &quot;tactics&quot;-like, grid-based interactions</li></ul><br>Bean and Nothingness is a long game, with over 180 puzzles, with difficulties from &quot;elementary&quot; to &quot;extremely challenging&quot;.
