{"about_the_game":"The famous General Electric \u2018U-Boat\u2019 comes to Train Simulator in two distinctive Seaboard liveries.<br>General Electric introduced its \u201cUniversal Series\u201d diesel road-switchers in 1959, and over the following two decades more than 3,500 \u201cU-Boats\u201d - as the locomotives were nicknamed \u2013 were constructed. The final and most  powerful four-axle (B-B) model in GE\u2019s U-Boat line was the 3,600-horsepower U36B built from 1969 through 1974.   <br><br>Constructed primarily for the Seaboard Coast Line (which owned 108 of the total 125 built), the U36B was put to work on SCL\u2019s fastest and heaviest freight hauls, but it was also versatile enough to handle almost any duty. Seaboard Coast Line was merged into the Seaboard System Railroad in 1982 and SCL\u2019s fleet of U36Bs continued to serve in mainline duty into the 1990s, after which a number found further work on U. S. short lines.  <br><br>The GE U36B for Train Simulator is available in Seaboard Coast Line and Seaboard System liveries. Features of the model include EMD-style Blomberg trucks as were used on all SCL\u2019s U36Bs, rear headlight control, gyralight control, forward headlight control and classification lights. Accompanying the U36B are SCL\u2019s noted yellow-liveried covered hoppers and a Seaboard Coast Line M-5 caboose, each of which are ideally suited for service with this historic  U-boat.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the Seaboard U36B on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for the Miami \u2013 West Palm Beach route (available separately and required to play these scenarios).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Scenarios</h2><br>Three scenarios for the Miami \u2013 West Palm Beach route:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tHighball to Hialeah<br></li><li>\tBetter Hop to It \u2013 Part 1<br></li><li>\tBetter Hop to It \u2013 Part 2</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
