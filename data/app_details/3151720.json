Explore a handcrafted, interconnected world full of mystery and melancholy, from crumbling cities to eldritch asylums. Engage in fast-paced combat that\u2019s tightly interwoven with slick movement, where guns are as important for traversal as they are for combat. Unlock game-changing abilities as you delve deeper into Anfransone, each uniquely recontextualizing how you play. Watch your back, as a ruthless visionary known only as the Milliner will do everything in its power to stop you and all you stand for.<br><br><strong><u>Features</u></strong><br><br><strong>World</strong><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3151720/extras/World.png?t=1727407192\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Explore the handcrafted, interconnected world of Anfransone.

Each shot from your weapon knocks you backward, which can be used as a pseudo double jump! Enemies punish poor movement and positioning, so knowing where and when to move is key.<br><br><strong>Movement</strong><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3151720/extras/Movement.gif?t=1727407192\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Movement in The Milliner is expressive and free-flowing. As you acquire new abilities, your moveset quickly snowballs into a powerful kit that can be used to cross entire rooms without ever touching the floor.
