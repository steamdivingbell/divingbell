Your job is simple enough: keep things in order and handle what needs doing until morning.

You\u2019ll complete these tasks one by one. Serving guests, tidying up, and occasionally taking a moment to pet the motel\u2019s lobby cat. But as the night progresses, you\u2019ll need to stay sharp. The game features multiple endings, leaving your fate in your hands. Will you outlast the night, or become another victim.
