{"about_the_game":"Transform the look of your favourite animals in Meadow! This pack contains two new skins: one Zebra skin for the Goat and one Hyena skin for the Wolf.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nZebras. Are they white with black stripes, or black with white stripes? This question keeps the entire scientific community up at night. We do know that their individual stripe patterns are unique to them, like our fingerprints are to us. A sad Zebra fact for you: they don\u2019t sound anything like Chris Rock. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHyenas are most known for their laugh like cackling, but not all species of hyena do them and it has nothing to do with their sense of humour. The \u201claugh\u201d is an indication of nervous excitement or a sign of submission to a more dominant individual. If you want to learn something really freaky about hyenas you can look up their process of giving birth. We\u2019re not going to go into detail here.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2616010?t=1701956043","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2616010?t=1701956043","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2616010/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1701956043","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2616010/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1701956043","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Transform the look of your favourite animals in Meadow!
