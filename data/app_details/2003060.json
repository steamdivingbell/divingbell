The prologue version of the game is a shortened version of the full game. You can learn about the main game mechanics here. Try to command your great army and defeat the first boss.<br><br>Your objective is to stop any visitors to your Monsters\u2019 Domain. Start from simple monsters and skeletons and with time build up your defences. You can play any monster from your army and give them specific orders to follow. Every killed hero makes them stronger and gives you an opportunity to equip them better or develop new skills or monstrosities. You can reanimate fallen intruders or collect pieces of your slain warriors and research new ways to use it. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2003060/extras/Kopia_06__5_.gif?t=1725435555\" /><br><br>Develop your preferred Style. You can focus on specific Style or mix them together to create a unique army of loyal Monsters. Choose from Necromancy, Vivisection, Mutation, Runes, Elixirs, Talismans, Forge, Techie, Strategy, Roguery, Drilling or Sorcery and different schools of Dark Magic.<br><br>Grow your beasts and monsters, make them unique or identical with others to unlock specific skill trees, upgrades and abilities.

The vivisected finger of the mage combined with some elixirs can be a very powerful upgrade for your simple skeleton. Reanimated corpse of a fallen hero with some fresh mutations and newly forged weapons can make a really nice new Boss for your realm.<br><br>Loot all you can as bodies decay and some treasures can be lost to nasty imps or other thieves. Store you treasures as a lure for visitors or forge them into powerful objects. Every piece matters. Study new materials and runes, develop schematics for your traps and devices, collect limbs, flesh and bones for your experiments and new creations.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2003060/extras/Kopia_06__7_.gif?t=1725435555\" /><br><br>Learn and experiment.
