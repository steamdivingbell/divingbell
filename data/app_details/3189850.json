The city state of Greyhawke is a large offworld human city state with a fully self sustained economy. The city was formed with the use of large corporate funds back on Earth, and those corporations have now become the region\u2019s overlords. You have escaped the life that those corporations planned for you, joining up with a small outfit working together and taking jobs against those same corporations. The player runs multiple infinitely generating missions that range from stealing corporate secrets to planting false evidence, all while finding the best escape route from each building. <br><br>As you complete missions against each of the different companies, you\u2019ll learn more about the history of the city and about the safe house you\u2019ve inhabited. Each corporation has their own goals and objectives, each of which the player will discover as they do missions against them. As each corporation\u2019s secrets are revealed, it becomes clear that everyone is after the same thing.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3189850/extras/Gif1.gif?t=1727490986\" /><br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3189850/extras/TitleChars.png?t=1727490986\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>RIFT:</strong></h2>The other agents will send you messages throughout the game to help guide you against different corporations.<br><br><u><strong>Contacts:</strong></u><br><br> <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3189850/extras/Sky.png?t=1727490986\" /><br>The Runner's friend and the one who introduced them to RIFTnet.
