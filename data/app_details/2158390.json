It's a simulation game where you can get revenge and feel exhilarated in this situation.<br><br>The game is divided into several stages, and each stage has missions that can give you a headache, and if you solve a specific mission, you enter the next stage.<br><br>Depending on the stage, the map on which the mission is carried out is changed, and I tried to give various fun with interactions using various objects in a new environment.<br><br>It consists of missions that are not difficult, so we aim for a play that is not difficult. I made an intuitive game because I thought that the more complicated and difficult the mission is, the more stress it can accumulate rather than relieve it.<br><br>Come on [Before Resignation, the day before you quit] and play the game you wanted to play the day before you quit!!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2158390/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1683039051","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2158390/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1683039051","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2158390/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1683039051","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2158390/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1683039051","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The day before leaving the company is a game in which the main character, who suffers from a stress disease after being unfairly treated, such as handing over work, stealing the performance of an incompetent manager, and nagging of an old boss, takes revenge on his boss the day before leaving the company.<br><br>It is highly immersive with revenge that contains character-specific stories similar to reality, such as taking off the wig of an old boss who wears a wig or hitting him with a frying pan.
