{"about_the_game":"Liphidain: Key Keeper is a classically inspired Pixel art 2D Action Platformer, with a focus on compelling combat and movement. Explore mixed environments in a familiar fantasy setting with lore and story that has been being developed and formed for over 20 years. From ancient guardians to foes of recent origin you'll fight to restore the knowledge and power that mankind had lost so long ago. You'll see the world change as you progress through the narrative, and some challenges will grow over time so don't leave them undone for too long.<br><br>Players will take on the role of Arysana, a sorceress and adventurer who's life has been constantly turned upside down by forces outside her control. Will she be able to take back the reigns of her own destiny? Will she find the source of her powers? Will she be able to ignite the flames of the past to restore Liphidain's bright future? Find the answers to these questions as well as much, much more on this journey through dangerous and colorful lands.<br><br><strong>The Purpose of Pixel Art</strong><br><br>We have decided that the retro pixel art medium is the best way for us to convey the visuals of the story and world to our audience. This versatile and charming style allows us to connect with player's imagination, bring fantasy to life, and be visually appealing to a wide group of players. With strong animations to make characters pop off the screen and environments that are both engaging and beautiful we feel pixel art can showcase the emotion of visual story telling in ways other mediums might fall short.<br><br><strong>Give and Take between Linearity and Freedom</strong><br><br>Our approach to game pacing and story telling will be nestled between the challenges the game presents to the player on it's surface and their willingness to branch out, and attempt to sequence-break. Though the story will be set-in-stone there may be some surprising changes the players will experience if they step outside the narrative's carved path. We plan on hiding secrets and special achievements with this in mind, and so players may want to choose to attempt an area that is extremely challenging in order to see these events unfold.<br><br><strong>Part of a bigger World</strong><br><br>Liphidain: Key Keeper is part of the &quot;Dissonance of Darkness&quot; story arc, the events told in this story will be parallel to other threads of that same arc. The events following Arysana will be those amidst a time when the adventuring party she traveled with have split-up to accomplish tasks requiring multifaceted attention. As such, there will be other games detailing not only the overall story arc from start to finish, but also those detailing the accomplishments of Arysana's companions whilst she dispatches her own objectives. The conclusion of this story will begin with the reforming of that adventuring group and the exploits they will accomplish together as a whole.<br><br><strong>A Note on Placeholder Artistic Assets</strong><br><br>Currently we are working with artists to finish the unique assets that will accompany the game at launch. As of the current build, are using assets that may look familiar, this is intended to show case the strength of our character designs and animations within the screenshots. It is also useful to utilize these assets for the purposes of level design among other reasons. Rest assured however, we are working on getting working unique biomes for all of our players to enjoy.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3228530/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726683045","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3228530/page.bg.jpg?t=1726683045","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3228530/2d6b9da81b8fb85b79609ae23ec076588eae038a/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726683045","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3228530/2d6b9da81b8fb85b79609ae23ec076588eae038a/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726683045","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"As a team we are committed to making Liphidain: Key Keeper and all of the other games within this franchise, products that can be enjoyed by audiences of ages from teens on upward.
