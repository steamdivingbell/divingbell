{"about_the_game":"<strong>&quot;It's a sobering thought, isn't it? To be able to look out your window and see the end of the world.&quot;</strong><br><br>The world is on the verge of being consumed by the Fog, an ever-growing mist that corrupts and destroys all life within it.

However, catastrophic events soon destroy the very foundations of their lives, and they are forced to make the choice between their precious friendship and following the path they each believe is right. Their faith in their beliefs, and in each other, will be pushed to the limit as they decide what to save and what to sacrifice as the world collapses around them.<br><br><strong>&quot;There is no stopping the coming apocalypse.

In addition to fighting enemies to level up, you must also scavenge the field to find healing supplies, as well as new gear that comes with their own skills and traits to further customize your party.
