{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Treasury of the Pharaohs</h2> Tombs and Treasures of the Pyramids!<br> <i>Treasury of the Pharaohs</i> brings you over 30 magical items for 5th Edition campaigns. Each one is ideal for explorers in an ancient kingdom inspired by Egyptian history, culture, myth, and legend, a land of pharaohs and pyramids, deserts and tombs, verdant oases and dusty wadis, soaring monolithic temples and seedy back streets and black markets. These items are perfect fodder for tomb robbers of every stripe, uncovering long-lost ruins once hidden by the sands or forbidden to outsiders, but now ready to join a daring rush into the dangerous marketplace of artifacts and antiquities. From glittering gold and lush lapis to alabaster, ivory, papyrus, and faience, the treasures of the pharaonic kingdom fire the imagination of treasure hunters the world over, who stand ready to defy mummy guardians, swarming scarabs, and eldritch curses that threaten doom upon any who would violate their sacred burial spaces. Their rest disturbed, tyrants and terrors that have long slumbered may rise to bring ruin upon lands that had forgotten them, but no warning or risk is too great when the plunder of dynasties awaits just behind the next dune.<br> This tome contains treasures of great value to tomb robbers and guardians alike, like the <i> map cartouche</i> and <i> tomb warden's stele,</i> along with deadly weapons like the <i> scarab scourge</i> and <i> dune trap javelin</i> to protective gear like the <i> dynast aegis</i> and <i> mail of the radiant pharaoh.</i> These items are redolent with the mysteries and magic of the desert, like the <i> oasis mirror</i> and <i> faience idols</i> to the <i> alabaster icons of Bast</i> and the <i> canopic chest of eternal repose!</i> If your 5th Edition players hunger for the riches of the ages and to garb themselves like the god-kings of old, they are going to love what they find in the <i>Treasury of the Pharaohs</i> .<br>  <i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by:</i> <strong>Connor Bates</strong>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1784280?t=1634651041","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1784280?t=1634651041","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1784280/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1634651041","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1784280/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1634651041","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Treasury of the Pharaohs</h2> Tombs and Treasures of the Pyramids!<br> <i>Treasury of the Pharaohs</i> brings you over 30 magical items for 5th Edition campaigns.
