{"about_the_game":"Nero, born and raised in Los Angeles but deported to Mexico, crosses the border illegally to return to the only home he knows. He tracks down his brother, but as long as he's undocumented, he'll live in fear of losing it all again. His solution: to join the U.S. army as a green card soldier, a shortcut to citizenship, and fight for his life and his country. This is a story of borders and of identity when that identity is deemed unlawful.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/965500/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1551901038","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/965500/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1551901038","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/965500/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1551901038","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/965500/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1551901038","categories":[{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Native Steam Controller Support","id":33},{"description":"Captions available","id":13}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Contains profanity and brief war violence."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h1>Steam Video</h1><p>This content is only available in an online streaming format.
