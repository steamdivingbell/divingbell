{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A special kind of Jump-and-Run game in honor to the classics from the 80s home computer era. Our hero, little Nina, has been trapped into a large cave with multiple levels - you can help her to escape from there. In every level, there is a teleporter that moves Nina to the next level. Those teleporters work from batteries - so you have to collect all batteries in a level to avtivate the end level teleporter to escape from that level.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There are numerous hazards in every level: poisonous spiders dangling from the ceilings, pools filled with deadly liquids (water, slime, lava), flying balls that send out electrical shock bolts, evil people chasing Nina. Movement is done by walking, running and jumping, also climbing walls and ladders. There are lift platforms (moving horizontal and vertical), in-level teleporters that need coins to operate, and electrical forcefields that block passageways.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can play either alone, or party up with friends or family and play locally with up to 4 players in a game (coop mode). There is no &quot;points counting&quot;, so no rivalry is needed. But all players have to complete a level to count it &quot;done&quot;. So it is &quot;play together&quot;, and not &quot;who wins the game&quot;.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3171170/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729127466","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3171170/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1729127466","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3171170/0bb722862e72717ad23eef1763a88ad6839f4f5f/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729127466","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3171170/0bb722862e72717ad23eef1763a88ad6839f4f5f/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729127466","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A special kind of Jump-and-Run game in honor to the classics from the 80s home computer era.
