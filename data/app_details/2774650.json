{"about_the_game":"Manahex is a fantasy-themed card and board game for 2-4 players. It is played against other players online, either in short sessions (10-45 minutes, depending on player count) or asynchronously. At its core it's an old-school trading card game where each player brings their own personal deck to the match, but the resource acquisition and fighting takes place on a board instead of through cards only.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>Before playing, a random map of hexes is generated. Each player chooses a deck and the starting position for their mage. Then starting hands are drawn and the game begins. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2774650/extras/SpawnMage.gif?t=1724180659\" /><br><br>Each turn you can move your mage to an adjacent hex and take control of it. The color of each hex signifies which type of mana it produces, and you can use the mana of controlled hexes to pay for cards in hand. All your hexes replenish at the beginning of each turn so you'll be able to afford more expensive cards as the game progresses.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2774650/extras/ControlHex.gif?t=1724180659\" /><br><br>Some of the cards are spells, which can directly affect things in the game (e.g. deal damage to another mage). Other cards are creatures or structures, which are created next to your mage on the map. Most creatures can move around and attack enemies, and a lot of them also have magical abilities. The structures are stationary, but usually have powerful ways to boost your other units.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2774650/extras/SummonCreature.gif?t=1724180659\" /><br><br>Each mage starts the game with 12 HP, and if that number ever reaches 0 that mage is knocked out of the match.
