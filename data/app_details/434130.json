{"about_the_game":"Witch &amp; Hero is an 8-bit style action game. You play as a hero accompanied by a witch taking on the evil Medusa, whom has destroyed many villages and towns with the monsters that stand before her. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMedusa turned the witch into stone, so she is no longer able to move. So it\u2019s up to the hero to defeat the monsters and collect their blood in order to recover the witch for a limited duration. The witch\u2019s destructive magic easily destroys monsters, but you will have to rely on the hero\u2019s will power primarily. He is able to try and try again, but the witch cannot, thus the hero must protect her. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures <br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Retro 8-bit pixel graphics and sound, along with simple controls <br />\r\n-Wipe out huge waves of monsters through 20 stages with 2 difficulties <br />\r\n-Choose between Trial mode and infinite mode for an in-depth challenge","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Hard to Kill","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/434130/7ccb8b8b6064e73159d6aa480a8e6ade457de978.jpg"},{"name":"Mammonist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/434130/9542d7848f49e44b39a9847e8fb141ca17b0c305.jpg"},{"name":"Seasoned Hero","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/434130/5b176836262c7c227b462aa48f8a2b169341e716.jpg"},{"name":"Strongest of the Strong","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/434130/7d078a5e3d5ae38c5ba9750ed1ec201924128a22.jpg"},{"name":"Witch Unscathed","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/434130/49c0c6bbee323c1aac2f1214277d647f3294e34a.jpg"},{"name":"Can do without","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/434130/9bf5a37d19d02f78a227d6ef70d8d8a8cfcc942d.jpg"},{"name":"VIP Customer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/434130/9eabccd22911985d57e5dcb2cfb15fa11a4f980c.jpg"},{"name":"Victorious","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/434130/65306de7b78617addac8278bef5a4b847d028268.jpg"},{"name":"Legendary Hero","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/434130/d743c9aeff6c03554e227a2d9b5bacaa97614efd.jpg"},{"name":"The Sea of Monsters","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/434130/740a4d5e9e20bc1498ac70390d2c2bfb60cc4cd0.jpg"}],"total":15},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/434130/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725004315","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/434130/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1725004315","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/434130/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725004315","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/434130/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725004315","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Witch &amp; Hero is an 8-bit style action game.
