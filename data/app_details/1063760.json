{"about_the_game":"<strong>YOU ARE A GNOME</strong> <br>One of the weakest species of magical creatures that inhabit the world. You'll need to exit the safety of your cozy burrow to face the perils of the Overland. Collect as much mana on the surface as possible, but beware of the Giants who won't hesitate to destroy a nuisance such as yourself.  Work together with your friends to extract as much mana from the land as possible while playing a dangerous game of cat and mouse with the Giants. You can use the mana you've gathered back at the burrow to upgrade your base and unlock new gnome classes that give you specializations in foraging, building, or even combat.<br><br><strong>EXPLORE THE VAST OVERLANDS</strong><br>Slide down hills to outrun pursuers. Use your mana to place down earthbombs that allow you to do super jumps. Look high and low for mana gems that give tons of mana or mana rocks that require multiple gnomes to break by jumping on them.<br><br><strong>WORK TOGETHER</strong><br>Play with up to 32 gnomes. Act as bait for your friend who is busy constructing a teleporter back to the burrow. Sacrifice yourself so that the Courier gnome with 100 mana can make it back safely. Once you die, the game isn't over for you. You could potentially be revived by a prepared gnome who crafted an effigy for you, or just revive back at the burrow to start again.<br><br><strong>CROWN THE KING</strong><br>The last class you'll be able to unlock is the King. Once a gnome becomes the king, all gnomes will be teleported to the Overland and the Reign of the Gnomes will officially begin. There will be special resource spawns during this time that will help you in future playthroughs. However all the Giants will be focused on bringing down the King, and once they do so the current Gnome Kingdom will come to a close...but gnomes will always try again.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1063760/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1722543657","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1063760/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1722543657","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1063760/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1722543657","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1063760/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1722543657","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>YOU ARE A GNOME</strong> <br>One of the weakest species of magical creatures that inhabit the world.
