He is very rich and noble, but leads a rather closed lifestyle.  It's no wonder: what kind of madman would take a rabbit as a butler, and hire a fish as a personal servant?

The aristocrat offers Olivia to drink a special pomegranate tea, and, after a couple of sips, the girl's life irrevocably changes.  <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2260150/extras/2ss_en.png?t=1681837479\" /><br>Five different endings: Olivia's adventures can end at any moment!
