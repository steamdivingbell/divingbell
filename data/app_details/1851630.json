Everyone knows it, even if his critics pretend otherwise. To be completely honest, they are all just jealous and have much wickedness in their evil hearts because they are nowhere near as masculine as Jim. Their small petty minds cannot comprehend Jim's huge heart that is always ready to help people, whether they want it or not. <br><br>His booth always appears where it is most needed. Unsuspecting pedestrians and commuters alike benefit from Jim's wise counsel as he screams unspecified sermons at them with a vociferous virile voice. <br><br>But his noble routine has been disrupted. An ancient Steam Greenlight game has finally been released from the depths of Early Access and now runs rampant throughout the internet.
