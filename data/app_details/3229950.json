{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Inspired by Slay the Spire, combine marble ball with card deck-building. This game is for players who like to experience more luck and randomness but less strict strategy card game.</h2><br>Combo Ball Slayer is a roguelike card deck-buiding game. We really love the experience of building a unique and interesting card deck, and Slay The Spire has done a milestone demonstration. <br><br>If you are a fan of Slay The Spire,<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Things you will be familiar with:</strong></h2>1. Starting with a basic card deck, and gather new cards from battle, shop and events.<br>2. Turn based battle with card draw. Energy based card play.<br>3. Roguelike random map generation.<br>4. Collecting relics to totally change your play style.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Things that will be new to you:</h2></strong><br>1. Cards need to trigger 4 types of marble balls to deal damage or effects, instead of causing damage and effects directly.<br>2. Manage you marble ball pool, including deciding what types or balls to fill, and the type of balls also affect your card usage strategy in certain turns.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3229950/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727087331","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3229950/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1727087331","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3229950/048116665ba72789f3c1eadc102750c6cbd27295/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727087331","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3229950/048116665ba72789f3c1eadc102750c6cbd27295/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727087331","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Inspired by Slay the Spire, combine marble ball with card deck-building.
