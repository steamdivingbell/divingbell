Use different equipment and items to survive the attacks until your ship is ready to leave.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Just Keep Shooting!</h2>Wield up to 6 types of guns that attack at once, and fight back the endless waves of enemies with your myriad of shots. Weapons can be upgraded in different ways. You can also freely customize the combination of weapons.\u00a0<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ultra Simple Controls</h2>The controls are extremely simple, and can be done with just the mouse. There is no moving about, jumping, or switching out weapons like a typical FPS game. The controls are only for shooting, using items, and looking around.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Enemies Aplenty</h2>Many different kinds of enemy monsters will appear. You will have to learn their characteristics and deal with them accordingly. Be especially careful of enemies that come in groups, and the big Boss Monsters. If you\u2019re lucky, you might also meet a Bonus Monster.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Customization</h2>There will be more you can do as you level up or gain Achievements. You\u2019ll be able to customize your defensive buildings and your character\u2019s skills.\u00a0<br>Use these to your advantage to help you clear the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Replay to Try New Strategies</h2>With an abundant amount of different equipment combinations you can try, you can expect a different experience in each run. You will need to consider the compatibility of different equipment. The items will also need some thought to use effectively, as their effect varies greatly in how you use them.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Game Start","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2168880/07f62dd24aac03fc9cb6ad65219e188653854dd9.jpg"},{"name":"Desert","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2168880/358eb670c43561e6ed4f97a4bd33d9f22aa28798.jpg"},{"name":"Iceberg","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2168880/6bda50042d74ae150ec06412370721dbc238d063.jpg"},{"name":"Volcano","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2168880/e7c9da83424cb60cb1d63154a39171e24e052edc.jpg"},{"name":"Level 5","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2168880/d37330b66e8d6a4b5179beb9aaea4e3108bc782d.jpg"},{"name":"Level 10","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2168880/f6239e5d0d4d9f222b454084a4d1304323d10d5f.jpg"},{"name":"Level 20","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2168880/e23814c663a99cf55e494104cb7a227ddf4c2a6b.jpg"},{"name":"Level 30","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2168880/a78d3d90457001ebc0e38271df66749645a2a81a.jpg"},{"name":"Clear the game","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2168880/b8334a7bf5541e88c74afc8f56509e07e5531d38.jpg"},{"name":"Hard mode","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2168880/b3b9e35a796e0e35eb85f8e4bd11e3b014e53aad.jpg"}],"total":14},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2168880/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724997385","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2168880/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1724997385","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2168880/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724997385","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2168880/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724997385","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Rogue Blaster is a shooting game that adds a twist to the FPS genre by adapting some rogue-lite aspects.<br>The planet you crash-landed on is teeming with monsters!
