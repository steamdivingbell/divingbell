As Feldmarschall List can you drive your 40th Army Korps hard and fast through the mountain passes, around Mount Olympus and seize Athens to secure the southern flank for the coming invasion of the Soviet Union. Or as the resource-strapped commander of the Middle East, Gen Wavell, can you hold the passes with your tough, veteran ANZACs and achieve what no Allied army has been able to do in the war so far and stop the Germans. It also covers the 1940 Italian offensive through the Balkan approaches to Greece. It contains 19 scenarios.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/524175/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731886330","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/524175/page.bg.jpg?t=1731886330","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/524175/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731886330","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/524175/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731886330","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/524175/extras/Foothill_Break.jpg?t=1731886330\" /><br><br>Foothills of the Gods covers the German offensive to conquer Greece in 1941.
