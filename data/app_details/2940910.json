{"about_the_game":"Grunt1991 is a multiplayer shooter set in various brutal stages across the war torn arenas of 1990's Sierra Leone! Being based on the conflicts that took place in this beautiful yet war ravaged country, there will be blood, conflict and vengeance!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith 8 guns and multiple weapons to choose from at launch and many more planned there is a sizeable arsenal to select and play with. The 90's features many different types of weapons with multiple versions of pistols, sub-machine guns, machine guns, rifles, shotguns each with unique skins, attachments, animations and audio. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach weapon feels lifelike and unique when you use it, making for realistic gunfights. Guns have unique ballistic, spray pattern, fire speed and weight values - just like the real thing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nApart from guns there are also multiple unique grenades and melee weapons to choose from, making warfare even more versatile and chaotic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGrenades have varying damage and range values, making each deadly in a unique way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGames can be played in daytime or at night time. In day time there is naturally a lot of light, making warfare open and frontal. At night time a more stealthy approach is often needed as visibility is low and enemies can be hard to spot.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTravel all around the locations of Sierra Leonne with 4 maps to play in at launch with 4 more planned. Maps are varied in size, location and style and each one is unique and offers something new.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaps range from small intimidate arenas designed for only a couple of people to huge open areas that support up to 20 players. Some maps have allot of cover and shelter while others allow for more open warfare to ensue. Some maps are blocked of and walled in while others are open ended and expansive. These variations offer different types of gunfights and experiences.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaps support up to 20 players with a variety of game modes on each available.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAligned Games\u00a9 was started by me, Johannes Christiaan Nienaber in 2013 as a video-game development studio. At that time I focused on the creation of smaller scale games, but have since moved into developing bigger and better games.
