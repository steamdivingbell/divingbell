{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">What a steal! This old virtual pet game from the 90s was almost <strong>free</strong> at a yard sale two blocks away, and it was <i>just</i> the thing you were looking for!

If you keep her happy, you might gain a friend for life! </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">More than just a Virtual Cat</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The more you take care of Babette, the more things seem <i>off</i>. Feeding her, playing with her, petting her... it becomes more and more difficult. She seems to be developing a mind of her own. You hear footsteps outside your house. Doors opening downstairs. Eyes in the dark, staring at you. Who is inside your house? And is this cute kitten trying to break free?  </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Keep Babette Happy!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Throughout the game, you will cuddle up in your bedroom and play through five levels, each more difficult than the last. Keep Babette happy by using the unique button combination of the pet egg to perform mini-games: Pet her! Feed her! Play with her! Blood sacrifice! Play hide and seek! Do badly, and Babette will get mad. Balance keeping Babette happy with filling the progress bar to finish the level and make her go 'night night!'</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Survive Nightmare Mode</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">After the events of the main game, you get vivid nightmares.
