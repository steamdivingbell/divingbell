{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This isn't what our grandfathers fought for! Rise from your soulful, old apartment and resist the Western heathens \u2013 the Quadrobers, who are trying to impose their rules! Or, join the modern Quadrobers and show the Skufs that the era of sweaty, beer-bellied men is over! Choose your side and fight for dominance across four unique locations!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">SKUFS VS QUADROBERS is a game where modernity clashes with tradition. Brutal Skufs, hardened by life and stuck in their old ways, battle resourceful Quadrobers who will use any means to win. Diverse game locations packed with enemies, created with modern game development standards, and a cross-over story inspired by Russian TV dramas are featured to resolve this conflict.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Skufs: Brutal old-school types, possessing unpredictable, rough-and-ready ingenuity. Their abilities are based on improvisation and unconventional solutions.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Skufs\u2019 skill arsenal will include:<br><br>1. Redneck Ingenuity: Only our tough guys know how to make something out of nothing! Turn scrap and junk into weapons! Taking a running start, they fall belly-first into the ground, creating a shockwave that knocks out all Quadrobers around.<br>2. That'll Come in Handy: The wife asking you to take out the trash again? No problem! For a Skuf, trash is not trash, it\u2019s a weapon! Too bad it only holds 3 bottles. A well-aimed bottle and the Quadrober is on the floor!<br><br>Quadrobers: Modern and resourceful individuals, using cunning and technology to achieve their goals. Their abilities are a mix of unexpected tricks and skillful manipulation.<br><br>The Quadrobers' skill arsenal will include:<br><br>1. Sweet Talk: This skill uses petty lies to turn two people with similar views against each other. Imagine: two Skufs, who just yesterday were watching a game together, now fighting each other!<br>2. Dirty Trick: A classic move! Lure a drunk Skuf to a spot where someone recently relieved themselves and let them feel the full weight of your treachery!<br>3. Quick Snack: Low health and getting beat up by heavy-drinking guys? No worries! Wet pet food is always on hand to quickly replenish your health!<br><br>No Skufs were harmed in the making of this game, but some Quadrobers might have been.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3446850/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738276209","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3446850/page.bg.jpg?t=1738276209","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3446850/c69ebe92f845af0ac120c4878ea74f094ca6c3cd/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738276209","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3446850/c69ebe92f845af0ac120c4878ea74f094ca6c3cd/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738276209","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This isn't what our grandfathers fought for!
