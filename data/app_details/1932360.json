For the rest of December we will be optimizing the game on the road to launch. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We know that the current base game has a bug that makes the game difficult to play for half the community. The reason for this is due to the current game engine (Direct3D) no longer being capable of running the programs required to play this game in a smooth fashion in PvP on certain PC's. We have determined that it's time to make the jump to the DirectX &amp; Vulkan game engine to prepare for Quest Launch.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>PROTOTYPE VERSION 1.0</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As the solution to the bug many of you are having is a complete engine overhaul of the game. This single change will cause many other bugs to pop up, while fixing the current bug. For this reason we have decided to make the next major update to be the engine overhaul. I apologize that the rest of December will go with out a patch as leaving the game difficult to play. However with this new version of the game our god like coder Doglord has cleared his unity editor and rebuild the game. Streamlining it to work on lower end computers, such as RTX 1060's and Quest 2 standalone headsets. He has managed to get rid of over 100 gigabytes of old code, assets, and avatars. All cluttering the current base game via compressed files. With this purge Doglord has noticed that the project file now reads Death_Duel_VR_V01.00.00 so technically this is the first iteration of version 1.0.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>FREE TO PLAY DDVR</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We have always wanted to combine the Demo version with the base game. The reason for us to go free to play is simple. We wish people to enjoy our game. However we understand that our game isn't AAA or AA quality. We are not developers by profession. We are gamers making our dream game. So we under stand the quality isn't what alot of people expect. Don't fear if you have already spent money on the game however. People who download the Free to Play will only receive limited weapons, armor and no single player. If you have the base game you will receive the full version of the game, with all gamemodes, access to the weapons and armor that have or have yet to unlock. This way people can pick up the game give it a try and if they don't care for the game. They can put it down with out suffering financially.</p></p><br><h1>Roadmap</h1><p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Death Duel VR Unveils 2024 Development Roadmap: A Year of Exciting Updates and Enhancements</h2><br>Hello Duelists!

I'm here to announce our latest update for DDVR which will bring more blood, gore, and dismemberment to the game. This feature will make fighting more realistic. As a playtester put it,<br>&quot;It feels like I'm wieldling a dangerous weapon now!&quot;<br><br>Our developer Doglord has been working hard on other things as well, such as vastly improved tracking and calibration, and a whole host of bug fixes and netcode improvements.<br><br>We also promised a little suprise in the road-map last update. We had to delay it to make certain we could do it. So without further ado, it's time for the suprise announcement you have been waiting for...<br><br>We have begun work on: DEDICATED SERVERS which in turn will lead to \ud83e\udd41 \ud83e\udd41 \ud83e\udd41 QUEST COMPATIBILITY BY Q1 2025!!! \ud83e\udd73 Suprise!<br><br>Remember always be ...

You can cut off legs, feet, hands, arms, and heads, this is now available for both PVE and PVP gameplay.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1932360/extras/Dismemberment_4.gif?t=1738523682\" /></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1932360/extras/DiscordBanner.jpg?t=1738523682\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Hello Duelist\u2019s, This is Community Manager Tyrus Rechs.
