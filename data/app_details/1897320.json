Complete objectives through the Trial levels, or hop into Endless to show that you can garden with the best of them!<br><br>Collect Plant Food by snipping up any bugs that dare approach Snippy's garden, then feed the plants to grow fruit. Collect as many points as you can by snipping, feeding and harvesting your crops! Although things start off simple enough, rounds will get faster and faster as you collect points, so don't lose your cool! If an enemy destroys a plant, you'll get a MISS.
