{"about_the_game":"Just as in life, we don't know everything - we must learn. You are thrown into the world, knowing nothing, nothing at all. As more and more attempts go by slowly you begin to evolve your knowledge. Until you are able to actually do something. Use common sense, and you should find its not difficult. As always in life, unless you have some very serious medical condition, there are no health bars. No tutorials, no heads up displays, nothing. When you die, that's it, game over; get better or something I don't know. <br><br>So here's the thing, the game is a story being told, 'around the fire', each attempt is a new story from which you gain knowledge and experience to further progress next time. The game visuals are what you 'imagine' as the story is told.
