{"about_the_game":"Introduce eight amazing new animals to your zoo with the North America Animal Pack! Featuring iconic species highly requested by the community, the North America Animal Pack brings a diverse assortment of growling, swimming, and cantering additions, complete with five new enrichment items to help them feel at home. The North America Animal Pack also comes with one new timed scenario to challenge your zoo-managing skills at the foothills of the famous Blue Ridge Mountains.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>EIGHT ICONIC NORTH AMERICAN ANIMALS</strong></h2>Within the North America Animal Pack you\u2019ll find the moose, cougar, California sea lion, North American beaver, American alligator, black-tailed prairie dog, arctic fox, and American bullfrog. This makes a total of seven habitat animals and one exhibit animal. From the towering moose, Planet Zoo\u2019s largest and heaviest species of deer, to the tiny prairie dog, you can enthrall your guests with a range of fascinating North American wildlife.<br><br>Visitors will love watching every new animal display unique behaviours. For instance, the arctic fox, who has the lowest temperature tolerance in the game, hunts by adorably diving face-first into the snow, just as it does in the wild. California sea lions call out with their distinctive bark, and shake their blubbery folds. Diminutive prairie dogs, meanwhile, the smallest adult animals you\u2019ll find throughout Planet Zoo, stand tall in a sentinel pose before yipping and leaping around.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>MASTER A NEW TIMED SCENARIO</strong></h2>Welcome to Jameson Wildlife Park! Nestled within the lakes at the foot of the famous Blue Ridge Mountains, this newly developed attraction invites you to take over management duties. You\u2019ll expand the zoo by clearing terrain in order to weave new habitats into the landscape, working around marshy wetland  and letting your creativity flow while providing animals large, naturalistic habitats in which to thrive.<br><br>As well as spearheading planning and construction, you\u2019ll endeavour to increase species diversity by incorporating the North America Animal Pack\u2019s additions. Help these animals get settled in lovingly designed habitats, educate guests on their needs, and develop successful breeding programs to continue the zoo\u2019s prosperity into the future.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1747960/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1706277371","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1747960/page.bg.jpg?t=1706277371","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1747960/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1706277371","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1747960/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1706277371","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Introduce eight amazing new animals to your zoo with the North America Animal Pack!
