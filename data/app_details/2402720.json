{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><strong>Welcome to Axe Me Down!</strong></strong></h2><br>In this 2D Indie Platform Battler, your main objective is to push your friends off the screen with your throwing Axes which come in many shapes and forms.<br>The game only has Local Multiplayer but can be played with friends worldwide with Steam Remote Play, and it is highly encouraged that you do so.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Game</strong></h2><br>Axe Me Down comes with six Arenas, six Axe Upgrades and six different gamemodes: <strong>Axedown</strong>, <strong>Deathmatch</strong> and <strong>Treasure Hunt</strong>, as well as their respective Team Modes.<br><br>You begin with only three Axes and four Arenas unlocked, more being obtained as you earn certain Steam Achievements. Good luck figuring out which ones!<br><br>The main idea of the game is that you can Jump and Dash for mobility around the arena while throwing Axes at other players. You may also find Treasure Chests while battling which when opened will grant you Axe Upgrades, which are very powerful tools to come out on top of your friends.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Modes</strong></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Axedown</h2>The main objective is to push all players out of the Arena and not die while doing so. Every player gets a set amount of lives and when they are thrown out of the Arena they lose one. The last player alive wins.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Deathmatch</h2>The players' main objective is to score Kills by pushing other players out of the Arena, without any regard for their own lives as there are infinite of those. This mode is timed, when the time ends the player with the most kills reigns victorious.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Treasure Hunt</h2>This mode, unlike the others, doesn't have anything to do with Kills or Deaths. There are glowing Treasure Chests that spawn around the map and the main objective is to open those, scoring a point and giving all players the same random Axe Upgrade.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Our Plans</strong></h2><br>We plan on making this game as great as it can be. We will be updating it frequently to keep the game well-balanced and tidy from bugs. <br>We'll be putting our best efforts into making changes for the fun and health of the game, may they be purely visual or related to game mechanics.<br><br>The current plan for the game is to, through our updates, have:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>20 completely original Arenas (As well as Reskins for some Arenas)<br></li><li>15 different Axe Upgrades<br></li><li>Character Selection<br></li><li>Ever-Improved Visual Aesthetic<br></li><li>And, of course, Fully Online Multiplayer</li></ul><br><strong>*Warning*</strong>: This game can support up to Six players, but doesn't work with more than Four Xbox controllers (You can mix it with other devices to get six.)<br><br>Thank you for reading through, we at Harmonika Games hope you enjoy and have a lot of fun with the game!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"First Blood","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2402720/98121fe9445b5273ae1fb8f9a698c8a21960398f.jpg"},{"name":"Passing Skill","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2402720/4900440855275da2a2ac812c257d6383a16464b9.jpg"},{"name":"Warrior Blood","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2402720/a20d3a1a99e98df0a5f1d903ee86becb853084c6.jpg"},{"name":"Trust No One","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2402720/0f0888ca4c8fd3e5cdca9fc4a8e6dd545efa8712.jpg"},{"name":"Become Thy Enemy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2402720/7543a23a59d7ccb1152b3e7f236dec4819cb5b69.jpg"},{"name":"Take this!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2402720/34a62f852be72bbd0ed6cfd402246b4f075bee7c.jpg"},{"name":"Master Hoard","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2402720/9c813a782e56a91bf21cfb1d722dd350651495d3.jpg"},{"name":"Ol' Reliable","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2402720/cfa3225a01090db380b5a43c627c9839e7eded7f.jpg"},{"name":"Wait for the Ricochet","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2402720/6442d1be3917b04ea2566aad29ce8b044b079c37.jpg"},{"name":"Golden Axe","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2402720/29072c2dab268aa864092ec05928f725501e7603.jpg"}],"total":19},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2402720/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1685112085","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2402720/page.bg.jpg?t=1685112085","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2402720/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1685112085","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2402720/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1685112085","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><strong>Welcome to Axe Me Down!</strong></strong></h2><br>In this 2D Indie Platform Battler, your main objective is to push your friends off the screen with your throwing Axes which come in many shapes and forms.<br>The game only has Local Multiplayer but can be played with friends worldwide with Steam Remote Play, and it is highly encouraged that you do so.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Game</strong></h2><br>Axe Me Down comes with six Arenas, six Axe Upgrades and six different gamemodes: <strong>Axedown</strong>, <strong>Deathmatch</strong> and <strong>Treasure Hunt</strong>, as well as their respective Team Modes.<br><br>You begin with only three Axes and four Arenas unlocked, more being obtained as you earn certain Steam Achievements.
