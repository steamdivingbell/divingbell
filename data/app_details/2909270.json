If you can give them the help they need they can flourish into productive hubs which can help other islands in turn. Islands can have all manner of magical properties, some useful and some not. Some islands may free citizens of the need to eat or sleep, while others experience constant rotting where food decays rapidly. Others are simply extremely cold or filled with hostile life forms.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2909270/extras/AboutBuildSell.png?t=1738757362\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Experiment With Economics</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Try out fantasy versions of real-life economic principles.
