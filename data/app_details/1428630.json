{"about_the_game":"Simple but hopefully challenging game to test your situational awareness. This game doesn't offer deep lore or story progression, but hopefully a little fun but frustrating experience for those who're looking for more difficult games to beat. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIdea is simple. Collect diamonds and make it to the next room where you collect more diamonds. Rooms grow slowly in size developing traps and maze to keep you on your toes, randomly generated of course so you can't study patterns. Powerups may help and may also be necessary for successful game. No saving, only performing. How far in can you make it before giving up? Is it impossible or can you find a strategy that makes this so easy I have to return to the writing table and rethink everything? I surely hope not, that would be awful. The small help section in the game should give you some bulletpoints to get some wisdom if you wish to undestand a little about the game mechanics. Hope it's all worth couple dollars. Have fun.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1428630/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1716959841","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1428630/page.bg.jpg?t=1716959841","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1428630/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1716959841","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1428630/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1716959841","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Simple but hopefully challenging game to test your situational awareness.
