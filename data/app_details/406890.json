{"about_the_game":"You grip your club, a beautiful sunflower putter, and take a breath. You pause for a moment to look around. The seas are serene today. Focusing on the tee, you line up your club with the pineapple and cut a perfect shot through the air. Suddenly a floppy shark smacks it and now you\u2019re out of bounds. Blast that bouncing shark, and blast your so-called friend who dropped it there.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFruit Golf is an asymmetrical virtual reality (VR) miniature golf game where the balls are fruit and your friends wreak havoc on the course! A fun and accessible party game for VR newcomers and veterans alike, all you need is one headset and some friends.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne player puts on the headset to play a round of miniature golf in wacky environments like a kitchen counter or the castle of the vampiric blood orange. Then by using a free companion app for smartphones or tablets, everyone else gets to work dropping goofy obstacles like salt and pepper shakers, explosive barrels, and that blasted bouncy shark. But beware\u2026 once the next player steps onto the green, it\u2019s payback time. It\u2019s zany! It\u2019s chaos! It\u2019s da cherry bomb!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery round is different. Every round is ridiculous. Fruit Golf is a whole basket full of fun.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/406890/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1692039631","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/406890/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1692039631","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/406890/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1692039631","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/406890/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1692039631","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"VR Support","id":31},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You grip your club, a beautiful sunflower putter, and take a breath.
