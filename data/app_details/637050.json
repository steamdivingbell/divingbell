The version available on Steam features 4 story chapters. We do not plan any further updates. Please try the demo before you decide to buy this game, and please buy it only if you're looking for a party-based TBS about spellcasting with no expectations of further content. <strong>This version will not be updated</strong>.<br><br>In the middle of 2022, we experienced a burnout and considered closing the studio for good. After taking a break, we decided to give this idea one more try, making our best effort and giving it everything (time, money, passion):<br><br>We partnered with a veteran game designer (with millions of copies of his previous games sold here on Steam) to develop a dark fantasy story-driven game about mages in the world of Rund \u2013 with a much more complex, and scalable, system for spellcasting, crafting and exploration; and with a proper storyline (we have a full-time writer working on the project). It will be our &quot;everything or nothing&quot; moment: either we forget about Rund, or we succeed and you love the new game.<br><br>We aim to introduce this new game with a playable demo some time in 2024.<br><br>Meanwhile, we leave Spire of Sorcery available for purchase, as it features enough content to play for a few hours \u2013 and represents the original mechanics that we now develop further. It is not a bad game, and it shows the potential for what we currently build.</p><br><h1>SPLATTER CAT GAMING REVIEWS SPIRE OF SORCERY</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/637050/extras/YT_link.jpg?t=1706543106\" /></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>On the western coast stretches the Empire, the last known shard of human civilization.
