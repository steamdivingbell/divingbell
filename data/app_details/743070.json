{"about_the_game":"Paddle Master VR is a cross between a breakout-style game and racquetball, inspired by a popular mobile game (Ballz).   You play inside something like a racquetball court, but with numbered blocks that you must destroy.   You have a gun that you use to shoot balls at the blocks, and a paddle to keep the balls in play when they bounce back to you.   When your balls are all gone, your gun is automatically reloaded, and a new row of blocks appears, and any old blocks are moved closer to you.  You lose when any blocks get pushed past the red line marking the front of the play area.  Oh, and the balls have a tendency to explode... How long can you last?","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Yay, I didn't lose!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/743070/164015af4185197df1f659c54efab042b3b8773c.jpg"},{"name":"Paddle Apprentice","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/743070/f7db5bd9a40e1e5976318cec75d32285a0e50be9.jpg"},{"name":"I am the Paddle Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/743070/d5df8659aad0c2c074e1c3be74fb0c197690f40f.jpg"},{"name":"Did the wall just move?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/743070/94ba83792e65aec56bd23b91f322be42ce94781c.jpg"},{"name":"Board Clear!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/743070/39f332a696d26164ce628e6796f32524e6ffca39.jpg"},{"name":"How far back does it go???","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/743070/c26e8deae69d29a1c4912329579033dd989ccd6e.jpg"},{"name":"Um, I broke the scoreboard...","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/743070/266ef86bc2b084d60da4bbe7d1222cbdbef5ca53.jpg"},{"name":"Two balls are better than one","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/743070/5b846b3bfbaee0c30456297c394cb3d2cf9b11ee.jpg"},{"name":"A decent set of balls","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/743070/3d56c59ba0c945d50df0bda20d22c6f7f1f6397f.jpg"},{"name":"A massive set of balls","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/743070/9f781803d5f447efa31745db1befcf34180952a2.jpg"}],"total":22},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/743070/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1699473087","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/743070/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1699473087","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/743070/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1699473087","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/743070/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1699473087","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Paddle Master VR is a cross between a breakout-style game and racquetball, inspired by a popular mobile game (Ballz).
