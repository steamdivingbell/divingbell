{"about_the_game":"Stand your ground against a seemingly insurmountable threat that is after your precious sun. Defend your solar system in a continuous conflict that progresses from tame introductory levels to epic high-octane space battles that will challenge even the most experienced pilots.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Power-ups</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/742910/extras/Solaroids_-_Become_Unstoppable_but_Don't_Lose_Your_Focus_-_Trimmed_10sec-_Optimized_100.gif?t=1690324818\" /><br>As the levels progress and the threat continues to grow, so will the kinds of weapons at your disposal. Perform advanced maneuvers while dodging asteroids, mines, and enemy missiles as you upgrade the capabilities of your ship and rack up higher and higher scores. Equip primary, secondary, and defensive weapons - the choice is yours.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Upgrades</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/742910/extras/Solaroids_-_Repairable_Attachments_-_Trimmed_10sec_-_Optimized_100.gif?t=1690324818\" /><br>Add additional outrider attachments to your alpha fighter and create an extremely powerful ship.

Play co-op against waves of enemies or square off against each other in a wide-open combat arena. Players can join at any time with no need to setup complex game modes.
