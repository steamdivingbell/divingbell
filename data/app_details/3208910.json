{"about_the_game":"As the family dog, it's your job to protect your loved ones from danger - especially from the kind they can't see. In <strong><i>The Good Dog: Chasing Shadows</i></strong>, play as a dog defending its family from an onslaught of paranormal entities. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3208910/extras/Description_01.png?t=1725646887\" /><br><i>The Good Dog</i> offers a variety of game modes. In <strong>Protect</strong>, you must survive the night as waves of entities enter your home and attempt to harm your sleeping family. Distract the entities by squeaking your toys or barking, or attack them if they get too close - whatever it takes to keep them away from your family. In <strong>Fetch</strong>, you must explore a range of dilapidated locations to retrieve something for your owner while avoiding the entities roaming the level. <br><br>In the <strong>Story Mode</strong>, explore the game's detailed environments to discover why the paranormal creatures have targeted you. Each environment can be explored freely, with some areas of the map opening up as time passes and as you make discoveries about the world. Solving each puzzle will bring you one step closer to saving your family. Be cautious, however; the paranormal will be tracking you throughout your journey. Using your unique abilities, you\u2019ll need to avoid these threats at all costs - or take a chance at slowing them down with tooth and claw.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3208910/extras/Description_02.png?t=1725646887\" /><br>Use your keen sense of smell to search the area for tools. Roll around in the dirt to cover your scent and hide from threats. Dig up hidden items to solve puzzles and fight back against the paranormal. Bark at certain immaterial entities to disperse them, or at physical entities to draw their attention away from your family. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3208910/extras/Description_03.png?t=1725646887\" /><br>With over a dozen unique breeds to choose from, each with a different set of stats and abilities, you'll be able to play the game the way you want. Will you choose a small breed to fit into tighter spaces and evade danger, or a larger breed with more health and attacking power? Will you prioritize your stamina, tracking capabilities, stealth, or something else entirely? No matter how you want to play, there will be a breed for you.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3208910/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725646887","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3208910/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1725646887","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3208910/386b56134e739304479f1fc7bc4c370852839b0b/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725646887","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3208910/386b56134e739304479f1fc7bc4c370852839b0b/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725646887","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"As the family dog, it's your job to protect your loved ones from danger - especially from the kind they can't see.
