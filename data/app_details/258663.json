{"about_the_game":"One of the most modern electric multiple units (EMUs) for the London rail network comes to Train Simulator, a perfect accompaniment for the South London Network route.<br><br>The Class 378 \u2018Capitalstar\u2019 was first introduced to service in 2009 to replace ageing classes of EMUs in service around London. Based on the Class 376 used by Southeastern, the \u2018Capitalstar\u2019 was specifically designed for the London Overground network with a focus on easy access and capacity - coaches do not have doors or partitions between them, creating an open end to end interior space allowing easier movement along the train during peak times and more standing room for passengers.<br><br>A total of 20 four-car units, classified as Class 378/1, currently operate on the East London Line and South London Line, and 37 units, running as Class 378/2, can be seen on the North London Line, West London Line and Watford DC Line. Class 378/1 units run on 750 V DC third rail only; Class 378/2 units run on 750 V DC third rail and 25 kV AC overhead lines.<br><br>Both variations of the EMU are represented in the model for Train Simulator, with DMSO, MSO and PTSO coaches. Features include two-tone horn, \u2018Underground\u2019 style whistle and passenger view.<br><br>The EMU is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the London Overground Class 378 \u2018Capitalstar\u2019 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for the South London Network route (available separately and required to play these scenarios).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Scenarios</h2><br>Four scenarios for the South London Network route:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tAfternoon Trip to West Croydon<br></li><li>\tCapital Quays<br></li><li>\tCapitalstar to Clapham<br></li><li>\tNew Cross Run</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
