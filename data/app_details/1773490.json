{"about_the_game":"It's the magic of a carnival through the eyes of a child!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCome on down to the show and play a range of fun carnival games! From a fishing pool to a bouncy castle to a ghost train, each minigame is unique from the last, and holds its own little tricks and secrets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe showgrounds can be explored openly, in whatever order (or disorder) you choose, provided you can cough up the tickets! The sideshow staff is a mob of quirky characters with an endless supply of bizarre and entertaining dialogue, and it's their job to guide you through this hand-made world of childlike wonder and freedom.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut what's the final goal for this protagonist - a six-year-old girl named Baldwin? It's simple; Baldwin is entranced by the beauty of a pink stuffed bear, and the only way to obtain this prize is by accumulating enough tickets. She must adventure through the show and collect tickets through the minigames or secret treasures to reach her goal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn versus mode Baldwin isn't the only little girl chasing after the bear! With split-screen multiplayer, a second player can control Baily, as both scramble to grab tickets and find secrets first, while also sabotaging each other in minigames, like a classic party game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1773490/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1648848111","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1773490/page.bg.jpg?t=1648848111","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1773490/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1648848111","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1773490/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1648848111","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"This game contains the badly-drawn explosions of zombie heads, and one vague reference to psychedelic drugs.
