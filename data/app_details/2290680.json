{"about_the_game":"Welcome to our sci-fi space adventure, where players take on the roles of a crew aboard a spaceship as they work together to survive in the vast and dangerous universe. With the ability to play as the captain, engineer, botanist, or scientist, players can choose their own path and adventure. However, with the multitude of ways to die in space, players must also be prepared to face the challenges and dangers that come with exploring the unknown. The game features randomly generated universes and round-based game play, adding to the unpredictability and excitement. The ultimate goal is to reach the end destination, but the game can also end when the entire crew perishes or the ship is destroyed.
