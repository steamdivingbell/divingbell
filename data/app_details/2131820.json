If you have played the current version of Red Moon, you will find that it is not complete and is a game framework. I plan to develop this game in a modular way. To put it simply, every time I finish a system, I will update it to the game for everyone to play. After absorbing everyone's opinions and suggestions, I will make some small updates, and then start to develop the next system, so as to follow the cycle. For example, the current version only has an item system, a basic motion system, and a MOD system. The current version of the Red Moon is at best a walking and changing simulator. In the next version, I will update the weapon system, life system, and basic combat system, so that the Red Moon becomes a mini action game that can fight to a certain extent. In the next version, I will update the building system, big map, and so on, Every time I make a piece of cake, I will flash it into your mouth immediately to avoid you waiting for years to play","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2131820/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1682172530","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2131820/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1682172530","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2131820/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1682172530","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2131820/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1682172530","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"The game includes the character's naked body, as well as exposed clothing,breast shake,hip shake."},"detailed_description":"Hello, everyone.
