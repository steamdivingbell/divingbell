{"about_the_game":"Many years ago one sad and scared boy built a strange labyrinth under his bed. It was a prison for dangerous monsters, full of long corridors and narrow tunnels. The boy tried with all his might, but he couldn't fight back the beasts. They were stealing his favourite toys, souvenirs, treasures, memories... everything was getting lost in the abyss.

A loss so big it would be unbearable even for a grown-up.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1527880/extras/Steam_02.gif?t=1731935920\" /><br><br>The boy was paralysed with fear for long months.
