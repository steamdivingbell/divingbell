It confines many powerful entities within it, which may be ferocious beasts, cultivators who failed to transcend tribulations, or even ancient deities. Cultivators enter its internal mysteries through specific rituals, allowing their spiritual consciousness to delve inside. Here, they can simulate tribulation trials, or even challenge the legendary Perfect Tribulation, thereby gaining unimaginable strength. This method of trial is both safe and effective, as even if a cultivator fails in the trial, they do not face the threat of death. The mysterious power of the Chaos Plate can protect their souls, allowing for infinite reincarnation and thus countless chances to start over.
