{"about_the_game":"&quot;Pathfinder Society Scenario #5-04: Equal Exchanges - Necessary Introductions<br> <br>  <br> A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for 1st- through 4th-level characters. <br> Since the defeat of Aslynn, the Waterfall has become more of a staple around the Grand Lodge, starting to hold strange, isolated meetings with leadership and seemingly putting together some plan. Her most recent request is that a team of Pathfinder agents journey to Hwanggot and meet with the underworld dragon, Valashinaz as a introductory team. Venture-Captain Yi Da Som arranged the meeting through Valashinaz's kobold assistant, Purepurin. Unfortunately, between then and the PCs arriving, Purepurin forgot about them in the midst of pickling recipes from goblins and creepy crawlies invading the vaults! It's up to the PCs to help Purepurin bring Valashinaz's vaults under control while she summons the dragon to ensure these introductions go off without a hitch! <br> This adventure is the first part of the four-part Equal Exchanges metaplot arc in the Year of Unfettered Exploration.
