{"about_the_game":"In the game Escape from Clive, players need to collect various materials, weapons and supplies, but you have to be careful of the enemies. If you are ambushed, you will lose all the materials. The collected materials can also be used to create more powerful weapons, so that you can kill all sides in the next battle. Therefore, when escaping, you need to solve the enemies as much as possible to obtain more materials. At the same time, the game also has three modes of play: Normal,Endless Parkour, and Chicken Dinner. Although they are all completely different ways of playing, you can also experience the tense and exciting escape action.<br />\r\n1. Normal: The main gameplay of the game, collect materials, and then use the collected materials to upgrade weapons, but all equipment will be lost if you die in this mode.<br />\r\n2. Endless Parkour: A casual gameplay, which is currently being developed and improved. In this mode, players will keep rushing forward and need to kill the enemies blocking the front. If they collide with the enemy, the player will lose life.<br />\r\n3. Chicken Dinner: A huge electric grid surrounds the players. Players do not have any weapons and equipment at the beginning. They need to collect materials while being careful of the opponent's ambush. After killing the opponent, they can upgrade and randomly obtain a magic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to the three game modes, we also have a large number of skins, pets and other systems. Players can use the gold coins they get to buy skins and recruit pets.<br />\r\nIn addition, this game currently has many shortcomings. Some situations are stupid and funny, but this is also one of the features of our game. In addition, as long as you buy this product, you can enjoy our long-term update service. Because I am an independent game developer, there is no possibility of company bankruptcy or dissolution, and I will continue to update all my products.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3070340?t=1727272410","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3070340?t=1727272410","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3070340/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727272410","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3070340/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727272410","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In the game Escape from Clive, players need to collect various materials, weapons and supplies, but you have to be careful of the enemies.
