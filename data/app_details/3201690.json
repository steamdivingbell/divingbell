{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When you wake up in a world overrun by zombies and incomprehensible creatures that seem to have been thrown together in this bizarre place, the only thing you can do is survive. Scavenge for resources, work with other players who could be your allies or enemies and face unpredictable environments with each boundary you cross. You'll have to adapt quickly, whether it's a city, a forest, or something even stranger.
