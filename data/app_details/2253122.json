{"about_the_game":"De Havilland Canada developed the DHC-6 Twin Otter in 1965. Designed as a rugged STOL (Short Take-Off and Landing) commuter aircraft, the Twin Otter carried passengers and cargo into harsh environments like the sub-zero Antarctic and the scorching North African desert. Viking Air Limited purchased the Type Certificates for all out-of-production de Havilland aircraft in 2005 and announced the Viking Series 400 Twin Otter Production Program two years later. By mid-2015, Viking re-established the Twin Otter as a successful commuter airliner. The E-flite\u00ae UMX\u2122 Twin Otter is an ultra-micro class scale replica that can be the perfect first twin-powered model for intermediate to experienced RC pilots. It's convenient and easy to fly, and is outfitted with functional features including LED navigation and landing lights, twin brushless motors with counter-rotating 3-blade props \u2013 plus it can be equipped with optional floats to fly from pools, ponds, and lakes!<br><br>This model is equipped with Horizon Hobby and Spektrum exclusive AS3X (Artificial Stabilization \u2013 3-aXis) and optional-use SAFE (Sensor Assisted Flight Envelope) Select technologies, and when SAFE Select is turned on using the mode switch (B on the Spektrum InterLink DX controller) it offers:<br><strong>Pitch and Bank Angle Limits</strong><br>These envelope limits keep the airplane from rolling or pitching upside down.  They also prevent excessive climb or dive angles.<br><strong>Automatic Self-Leveling</strong><br>The airplane instantly returns to and holds level flight when the sticks are released and in the center position.  It\u2019s also helpful for keeping the wings level during takeoffs and landings.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2253122/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1710365669","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2253122/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1710365669","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2253122/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1710365669","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2253122/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1710365669","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"De Havilland Canada developed the DHC-6 Twin Otter in 1965.
