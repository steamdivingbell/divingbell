{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Willow Guard</strong> is a story-driven indie RPG that immerses players in the world of Tersa, where the Gods have abandoned the animals they once uplifted.

Players step into the role of Ghweros, a seasoned Willow Guard tasked with uncovering a dark plot to tear open portals between Tersa and the monstrous otherworld. Outside of combat, players will interact with a diverse cast of characters, uncover clues, and explore new locations in an engaging, choice-driven narrative. Combat in Willow Guard blends retro-inspired hack n\u2019 slash mechanics with a customizable action deck system.
