{"about_the_game":"It was on May 10, 1869 at Promontory, Utah that the \u201cGolden Spike\u201d ceremony made America one land, linked by rail from ocean to ocean.

The wood-burning locomotives were designed for dual service, with 60-inch-diameter drivers and 16 x 24-inch cylinders and a total engine weight of 65,400 pounds. Following the historic events of May 1869, the Jupiter went on to a long career working for the Central Pacific and its successor, the Southern Pacific.<br><br> In the mid-1970s, the U. S. National Park Service had full-sized, operating replicas of UP No. 119 and the Jupiter constructed, a process that included the creation of engineering drawings of the locomotives. It is from those plans that Smokebox has created the Train Simulator version of the famed Jupiter. And as can be expected from the creator of the Union Pacific FEF-3 4-8-4 and AT&amp;N 2-8-0, the Jupiter features extraordinary operating realism and exacting detail authenticity true to the wood-burning locomotives as built in 1868. <br><br>The Central Pacific Jupiter pack includes the historic Jupiter as well as sister locomotives Storm, Whirlwind, and Leviathan; authentic flat cars, baggage car, various styles of Emigrant coaches, and a coach-caboose with detailed passenger views; and a variety of new track and scenery assets designed to allow route builders to create their own 19th century railroad routes!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2>Fittingly, given that Central Pacific\u2019s crown-jewel accomplishment was its crossing of California\u2019s Sierra Nevada Mountains, the pack includes three captivating and challenging career scenarios on the Train Simulator Donner Pass route (available as a separate purchase).<br> <ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Storm's on its Way  <br></li><li> Storming the Hill<br></li><li> Storm's Passing</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
