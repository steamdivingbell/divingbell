{"about_the_game":"ABOUT FUBG<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFUBG: Fight Unknown Battleground is a thrilling multiplayer shooter developed by GameX, an indie studio passionate about delivering intense combat experiences. FUBG plunges players into the heart of action across seven dynamic game modes: Team Death Match, where strategy and teamwork lead to victory; Capture the Flag, a fast-paced hunt for the enemy's banner; Conquest, where territorial control is the path to success; RUSH, a high-stakes offensive-defensive clash; Kill Confirm, rewarding quick and strategic eliminations; Free For All, a true test of individual skill where it\u2019s every player for themselves; and Search and Destroy, a tactical mode where precision and planning win the day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSet in a variety of detailed environments, FUBG offers a diverse arsenal and gameplay mechanics that cater to different playstyles, from stealthy snipers to front-line assault troops. With its robust multiplayer framework, players can compete against friends or allies worldwide, forging alliances or rivalries. Join the battleground, embrace the chaos, and carve your path to glory in the ever-evolving landscape of FUBG.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame Modes<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1. Team Death Match (TDM)<br />\r\nTeam Death Match is one of the most straightforward and popular multiplayer modes. In TDM, two teams compete against each other with the primary goal of killing opponents to earn points. The team that reaches a set score first, or has the highest score when the time limit expires, wins the match. This mode emphasizes teamwork, map knowledge, and fast-paced action.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2. Capture the Flag (CTF)<br />\r\nCapture the Flag is a tactical team-based game mode where each team has a flag at their base. The objective is to infiltrate the enemy base, capture their flag, and bring it back to your own base while still retaining your flag. This mode requires significant team coordination, defense strategy, and offensive planning.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3. Conquest<br />\r\nConquest is typically found in larger-scale games involving large maps and vehicles. Teams must capture and control several strategic points on the map, which continuously accrue points for the controlling team. The game is won by the team that exhausts the enemy team\u2019s respawn tickets, which are consumed each time a player respawns after being killed, or by having more points at the end of the timer. This mode combines large-scale combat with resource management and area control.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4. RUSH<br />\r\nRUSH is a progressive, objective-based mode where one team attacks set objectives while the other defends. The attackers must plant explosives at designated M-COM stations and defend them until they detonate. The defenders must prevent this by defusing any explosives planted. The attackers must destroy all objectives to advance to new sections of the map, pushing the defenders back. The game continues until all objectives are destroyed or the attackers run out of respawn tickets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n5. Kill Confirmed<br />\r\nKill Confirmed adds a twist to the traditional Team Death Match format. Players must collect dog tags from fallen enemies to score points for their team, while also having the opportunity to deny points by picking up dog tags dropped by fallen teammates. This mode encourages player movement and strategic play to control areas rich in kills.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n6. Free For All (FFA)<br />\r\nFree For All is an every-player-for-themselves scenario where the goal is to achieve a certain number of kills first, or have the most kills when the time limit expires. This mode tests individual skill and situational awareness, as alliances are not possible and every other player is a potential threat.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n7. Search &amp; Destroy<br />\r\nSearch &amp; Destroy features one team attempting to plant a bomb at one of two strategic sites, while the opposing team tries to defend these sites and prevent the bomb from being planted. If the bomb is planted, the defenders must defuse it before it explodes. There are no respawns in this mode, so each player has only one life per round, making it a high-stakes, tactical gameplay mode that emphasizes precision and teamwork.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach of these game modes offers a different way to experience competitive gameplay, catering to various play styles and strategic approaches. Whether you prefer fast-paced skirmishes or tactical battles, there's a mode that suits every type of player.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2262200/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1716648769","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2262200/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1716648769","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2262200/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1716648769","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2262200/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1716648769","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"ABOUT FUBG<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFUBG: Fight Unknown Battleground is a thrilling multiplayer shooter developed by GameX, an indie studio passionate about delivering intense combat experiences.
