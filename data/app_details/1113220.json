{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">STORY</h2>The story of the game is based on sci-fi novel &quot;Frango Anomaly&quot;. The hero is a human clone who escaped from space pirates. The first location is asteroid FA-17, colonized a couple of millennia ago. The mining of crystals is still ongoing, but... right now crystals are dropping in price.
