{"about_the_game":"The exclusive, one of a kind, deal of a lifetime, king of the hill soundtrack for the game FORCED. The soundtrack is composed by Fredrik H\u00e4th\u00e9n: a super genius musician who had the god-given super power of being able to put up with our constant demands, changes and impossible deadline. The soundtrack features 43 tracks, including all from in game themes, to legacy music from the early stages of FORCED. It also features a cover drawn by Fredrik's wonderful girlfriend Emma Grahn - and a note from the composer.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/260880/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1478176822","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/260880/page.bg.jpg?t=1478176822","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/260880/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1478176822","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/260880/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1478176822","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"The exclusive, one of a kind, deal of a lifetime, king of the hill soundtrack for the game FORCED.
