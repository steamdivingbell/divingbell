The world is very different from the one you knew when you entered the bunker. People are scarce and many are prone to violence. Others just want to survive and are very appreciative of anyone that can help them do that.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2418120/extras/steam7.gif?t=1718059731\" /><br><br>In a world where there aren't many good people left, it turns out being one of those good ones is extremely rewarding.
