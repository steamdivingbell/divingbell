You were chosen due to your resilience to the various tests of your mind and body. You weren't the only one the scientists selected for their experiments, because there were others just like you. Each of you was put into groups of eight and induced into a cryosleep for a few months, but what was supposed to be months became years.<br><br>Your eyes slowly opened and your senses came back as you remembered where you were. It felt as though you were brought back from the dead and this made you wonder how long you were in cryosleep.
