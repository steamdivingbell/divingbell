I'm not afraid to say: you have infinite ways to complete a level. It is because we made the game physics as open and flexible as possible. Everything can happen: The video shows an unfortunate chain of events: knife hits the table, planks break, planks flying and hitting your friend towards the sawblade (which is a fail - but Hat Trick is completed).<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1663650/extras/downhillgif.jpg?t=1714072947\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1663650/extras/sawblade.jpg?t=1714072947\" /></p><br><h1>CLICK BELOW TO JOIN US ON DISCORD</h1><p></p><br><h1>TOTAL THROW CONTROL</h1><p>We developed a new throwing method for fun, but it worked out so well, we decided to make this game.
