{"about_the_game":"Glyphscape is a Handcrafted RPG adventure, set in a densely interconnected world of wilderness, dungeons, and diverse civilizations. <br><br>Play as The Dreamer, a powerful being who has broken free from their curse of eternal slumber. You emerge to find a world falling into chaos, and only you can set it right. Old stories tell that The Dreamer was once a great hero. If only you could remember your past...<br><br>Features:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Rich Interconnected World</h2>The world of Glyphscape is composed of over 250 regions, totaling over 4km of playable area both above and below ground. Each dungeon, town, river, and tree was placed by hand in an effort to create a deep and interesting world to explore. Many paths require unique items in order to be accessed, and old dead-ends may become surprising shortcuts as new abilities are unlocked. Additionally, many paths are hidden in plain sight and only require a discerning eye to access.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">(Nearly) Perfect Information Turn-Based Combat</h2>The environment holds many surprises, but there are no secrets between foes in Glyphscape's combat. As this is a turn-based RPG, you will have ample time to strategize and plan your next move. To ensure no blunders, the relevant combat statistics are displayed on one of the ASCIIDECK's auxiliary display screens. Player weapon damage is determined by dice roll, so there is always room for surprises.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unique RPG Leveling System</h2>As you level up, your adventurer's background will begin to resolve. Upon dreaming after leveling up, you will be presented with two paths. One is a memory, the other a dream. It is up to you to decide your past, and thus your future. Each chosen path will bestow unique traits and benefits.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Open-Ended Spellcrafting</h2>Pursue the arcane arts by crafting spells from component Glyphs, which may be learned from conjurers throughout the world. Augment spells with additional Glyphs to change damage type, boost range, or alter the nature of the spell completely.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Deep Worldbuilding</h2>The history of Glyphscape extends far beyond the events of the game, with over 50 years worth of chronicled events, factions, and fables. This history was used as a starting point for the events of the game, creating a world that feels deep and whole.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3103690/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730073017","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3103690/page.bg.jpg?t=1730073017","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3103690/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730073017","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3103690/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730073017","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Glyphscape is a Handcrafted RPG adventure, set in a densely interconnected world of wilderness, dungeons, and diverse civilizations. <br><br>Play as The Dreamer, a powerful being who has broken free from their curse of eternal slumber.
