Maintain subsystems, fend off enemies, and stay alive long enough for evac to arrive. Powerful upgrade choices, procedurally-generated ships, and permanent progression. Survive with friends or handle things all by yourself.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">1-8 PLAYER CO-OP</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Manually maintain your ship's subsystems long enough for evac to arrive. Management has provided you with tools to enhance your maintenance capabilities. Operate machines and dispatch intruders. Repair equipment and break trespassers. Automate your maintenance tasks and install defenses against intruders!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MINIGAME MAINTENANCE</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Every subsystem must be maintained by completing minigames. Flush the core, feed the eels, shoot the asteroids, tighten the valves, align the antenna, and prevent intruders from activating the self-destruct sequence. If one subsystem goes down, the entire ship immediately explodes. Who built these ships to work like this?</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ROGUELITE CUSTOMIZATION</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Choose powerful upgrades between rounds to increase your chances of survival! Become an unstoppable force to be reckoned with in combat. Master the ways of optimized engineering. Carve your own path. Survive increasingly difficult challenges as more and more of your ship's subsystems break down. Complete tasks manually or find ways to automate them. Necessity is the mother of invention!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PROCEDURALLY GENERATED SHIPS</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Explore through sprawling ships to find materials and complete tasks. Each ship is stitched together from remnants of the cheapest materials management could find. Overcome different challenges every run, with no two runs playing out the same way.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EXPRESS YOURSELF</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Customize your appearance to show off your sense of style. Choose from 6 different species: Cat, Dog, Hyena, Owl, Fox, and Eel. Emblazon your customizable spacesuits in whatever color speaks to you most.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MADE BY HUMANS</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We're a small indie team that fits inside of a minivan and every asset and sound and line of dialogue and line of code is hand-crafted by humans. We set the multiplayer session limit to 100, but we can't test it because we don't have a QA team. If you want to stress-test your internet connection and your graphics card with your 99 friends, please post the video online so we can see it.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2909320/extras/CrowdSmallHi.png?t=1739852516\" /></p>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2909320?t=1739852516","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2909320?t=1739852516","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2909320/f0aee285bf983363e69a73e91df143801e9aa740/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739852516","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2909320/f0aee285bf983363e69a73e91df143801e9aa740/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739852516","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Players can die in this game."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2909320/extras/About_This_Game_gif_1_v4.gif?t=1739852516\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Star Crew is a 1-8 player co-op sci-fi roguelite.
