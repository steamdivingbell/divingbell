Engage in buying and selling goods, investing in cities, completing trade contracts, and managing your family to achieve the ultimate honor of becoming the foremost merchant.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you run your business, you can also experience life simulation\u2014marrying, having children, and building a family that aids your trade ventures. Our ultimate goal is to monopolize commerce across the region, becoming the biggest merchant in every city while ensuring our family's legacy continues.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game features 80 ancient cities based on real geography, from Yanzhou in the central plains to Luoyang in Guanzhong, and beyond. Journeying across the map may take a year in-game, but the potential profits make it worthwhile.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With 89 diverse goods available in various cities, prices fluctuate over time, requiring strategic buying and selling. Special city festivals can also lead to historically low prices for certain items!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Different cities release trade demands, and transporting scarce goods can yield significant profits. Forming a trade caravan is essential for cargo capacity and protection against bandits.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Random events add unpredictability to your journey, from lucky finds to thefts. Entering new cities may present dilemmas involving local pleas for help or family-business conflicts, each leading to different outcomes.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You're not just a trade leader; you're also a family patriarch. Accumulate wealth to build a mansion, marry, and raise a large family. As generations pass, you must appoint a successor to carry on the family business for centuries.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In addition to manual trading, establishing a business is a major income source in the later game stages. If you need a break, let your business generate wealth for you. Each city can host a business, and achieving over 50% market share makes it a leading firm.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Game statistics track your annual asset changes, most traded goods, and frequented places, documenting your journey.
