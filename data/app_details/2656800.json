{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Baugarten - Experience the power of Science</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In a post-apocalyptic world, the knowledge that allowed humans to thrive has been lost. Re-build civilization and experience how using scientific principles can accelerate progress.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Baugarten, empire building seamlessly integrates with scientific concepts. Put them at the core of your empire's success, or try thriving without them. The game offers a single, dynamic experience whether you feel like using your brain - or not.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Key Features:</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Empire-Building</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Baugarten, you build your own empire. You build production sites, infrastructure, supply chains, housing. You trade with others, you take care of your population, explore new regions, struggle against the environment. Resources are scarce and you need to make sure, you don't waste them to thrive. Keep everything optimised and you will succeed.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Varied Building Types</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Customize a range of structures, each with unique mathematical and scientific attributes. Develop efficient farms, construct intricate factories, and create elaborate trade routes or opt for simpler approaches. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Balance short term needs with long-term strategy</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As your society develops, you will need to balance short term needs of your population with the large resource intensive investments in infrastructure that will help you thrive in the long run. How will you allocate your scarce resources?\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Integrated Scientific Elements</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Baugarten weaves scientific concepts seamlessly into empire-building gameplay. Science helps you decide what size your farms should be, what crops to plant, how to optimise the infrastructure that connects your production sites etc.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Optional  Science Use</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Baugarten is not a learning game. It is a real PC game that happens to make some of the scientific principles that underpin our world explicit. As a player, you have the freedom to choose whether you will apply scientific principles or not. You can opt to use math and science to maximise your empire's efficiency or simply focus on empire building without it.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>The beauty of optimisation</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">All games with simulation elements are underpinned by hidden mechanics about how the world works. These can only ever be manipulated by trial and error. At times, this can be frustrating, as with increasing complexity, it is impossible to know, whether your empire is still optimised. In Baugarten, you can go the extra step and use math and science - to make sure you scratch that itch of having run everything at 100% performance.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Educational Gameplay</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Baugarten is designed first to entertain and then to educate. Explore the practical applications of scientific concepts in a dynamic virtual world to enhance your empire building and strategy. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Beautiful World to Explore</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Immerse yourself in a visually stunning world, full of diverse landscapes and cultures. Roam the map and discover the wonders of your ever-expanding empire, regardless of your chosen approach.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If you are intrigued, you can download an early prototype from our web-site (.
