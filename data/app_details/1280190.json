{"about_the_game":"Falling Frontier is a revolutionary sci-fi RTS where ship design, recon, and logistics are critical elements. Your expeditionary force has just completed construction of its first space port in orbit of a new world, but you are not alone. Rivals from the old colonial wars between Earth, Titan, Venus, and the other lineages that divide humankind have also arrived in the same star system.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1280190/extras/image_01_loop.gif?t=1736171799\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A New Star System</h2>Explore a vast procedurally generated star system filled with planets, moons, asteroid fields, and nebulae.

Shots can strike unintended targets after missing or ricocheting off hulls and each ship has subsystems that can be damaged or destroyed upon impact.

A weaker opponent can choose to engage in guerrilla warfare, raiding supply depots and refineries, blockading colonies, and otherwise attacking each point in the enemy supply chain. Likewise, a stronger force cannot simply combine their ships into a single massive and unstoppable fleet and must instead strategically distribute smaller defense flotillas throughout their territory. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1280190/extras/image_04_loop.gif?t=1736171799\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Intel</h2>Use probes, scout ships, and recon stations to explore and monitor the vast emptiness between planets. Recon stations scan defined angles with either passive scans that grant limited information or active scans that give away their position.
