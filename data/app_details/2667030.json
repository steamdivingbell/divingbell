{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Spriggan is an immersive multiplayer experience, combining first-person strategy with dynamic character roles. Step into a world where your choices and specializations \u2013 from diverse combat styles to resourceful crafting and meticulous city management \u2013 shape your journey. As night descends, your castle becomes the battleground against unyielding forces. Stand shoulder to shoulder with your comrades, defending your bastion with valor. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">By day, the city is your canvas. Explore its confines, delve into the mysterious swamp, and allocate your citizens to essential roles. From farmers to researchers, from builders to guards, every job is crucial in fortifying your stronghold. Prosperity lies in your hands \u2013 manage your resources wisely, expand your domain with new structures, and enhance your defences with innovative technology. 'Spriggan' offers a dynamic day-and-night cycle where your strategic prowess during daylight prepares you for the nocturnal onslaught. The city you build by day must be defended by night \u2013 in unity and strength.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combat</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Combat in 'Spriggan' is both rewarding and skill-demanding, featuring diverse styles for varied gameplay.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Melee</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Our directional melee combat system requires strategic thinking to breach enemy defenses. Expect a selection of weapons, each with unique timings and playstyles. Our aim is to introduce at least ten distinct weapons in the final version.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Ranged</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Ranged combat follows a straightforward philosophy. Aim with a right-click and release arrows with a left-click. Remember, holding your bow drawn for too long can impact accuracy.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Magic</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Magic in 'Spriggan' is innovative, drawing on the caster\u2019s soul strength and the souls collected from foes and allies. Overextending magical abilities can have dire consequences, making soul management a critical aspect of gameplay.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">City Management</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The survival of your citadel hinges on effective city management.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Citizens</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Citizens perform essential tasks, from farming to crafting, crucial for sustaining resources. They can also be trained as soldiers, such as archers and swordsmen, playing a significant role in citadel defense.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Upgrades</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your citadel is a work in progress. Resource and population management will enable you to build beneficial structures like hospitals, stronger gates, walls, and civilian facilities like grain mills and smitheries.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Progression</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As with most rougelites the primary form of progression you obtain is knowledge, however in Spriggan we give you a little bit more than that! We decided to introduce skill trees to the characters in the game; as you level up your character by playing youll be able to unlock different passive modifiers and activatable abilities to shape your ideal playstyle.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiplayer</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Yes, Spriggan will be multiplayer! You are able to host games and invite up to four(subject to change ofc) of your friends to them, we felt that this was a very important feature because of how much more diversity it adds to the strategy and fun factor of the game. Having multiple players means that you can synergize abilities and specialties to become an even more effective fighting unit!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Realism</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Our commitment to realism in 'Spriggan' enhances the immersive experience.
