Today's date is October 3rd, 1994. </i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>You've been out on maternity leave, and tonight is your first day back to work. A bit of a surprise, but you were suddenly scheduled to work an overnight shift by your supervisor Dr. Evander Walsh. The last few days have been heavy storms in the area, causing the entire hospital to suffer a power outage late in the evening. Most of the medical records were lost while the system was syncing during the outage. But Dr. Walsh is fairly tech savvy, so he was able to recover some of your data. He has left you some text files on your computer to read and help explain what's going on, so check the desktop as soon as you start your shift.</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Normally your day shifts involve you working with your patients on the ground floor, and Blocks 1 and 2. However, one of your patients was mistakenly dosed with a deadly experimental drug. So now 10 of your patients have been quarantined down in Block 3. Not much is known about what the patient was dosed with, so it needs to be treated with haste. Per Dr. Walsh's instructions he left you on your computer, you need to figure out exactly which patient was dosed with the deadly medication and have them... taken care of as soon as you can.</i> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3233080/extras/desc3.png?t=1729083678\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Explore the psychiatric section of the hospital which houses your 10 inpatients you need to keep an eye on through out the night. Throughout the night you must keep their cell lights off, as the recent power outage is causing them to randomly flicker back on. You have a limited amount of time to find out which patient was infected with a deadly experimental drug. The only clue you'll find is within the file room, but you need to find a way to unlock the door. Use the disk writer in the basement to write your backup patient logs to a floppy disk and copy them to your office computer. Use the computer in your office to view logs and check for any corruption or anomalies that may help you find a way to unlock the file room door. As you are monitoring your patients, you will notice they each have names written on clipboards outside their doors, which will be valuable information once you have access to the patients' folders in the file room. Once you've identified the afflicted patient, pull them from within the electrical room control panel to hopefully end the nightmare.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Made in Godot 3.6</p>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3233080?t=1729083678","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3233080/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1729083678","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3233080/328ac4f87298add78eafc7d6665ca7094cb17c43/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729083678","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3233080/328ac4f87298add78eafc7d6665ca7094cb17c43/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729083678","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Disturbing Content, Blood and Gore, Fictional Drug Reference"},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3233080/extras/desc1.png?t=1729083678\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Patient is a small indie atmospheric horror puzzle experience loosely made in the style of an older PS1 horror aesthetic.
