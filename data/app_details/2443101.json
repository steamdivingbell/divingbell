{"about_the_game":"The Analogue Engines Bolt-on contains 8 extra wave generation engines to boost capabilities of SFXEngine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBreath Wave is a white noise signal with internal band-pass filter. Useful for adding breathyness to existing sounds, and for an infinity of real-world sounds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGrey Wave is a multi-functional white noise generator. Unique noise is generated for each channel, so the effect is stereo. You can line up lots of these with a smooth factor of 1.0, and doubling the Period each time to create better and better approximations of pink noise.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMono Grey Wave is a multi-functional white noise generator. The same signal is generated left/right, so this is a monophonic version of Grey Wave. You can line up lots of these with a smooth factor of 1.0, and doubling the Period each time to create better and better approximations of pink noise.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPulse Wave Adv is a more complex pulse/square wave generator. Three pitch values are summed up, and two amplitude values multiply together to create more complex sound combinations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSaw Wave Adv is a more complex saw wave generator. Three pitch values are summed up, and two amplitude values multiply together to create more complex sound combinations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSine Wave Adv is a more complex sine wave generator. Three pitch values are summed up, and two amplitude values multiplies together to create more complex sound combinations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStatic White Adv is a more complex, and still super-fast, white noise generator. Three amplitude values are multiplied together to create more complex sound combinations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTriangle Wave Adv is a more complex triangle wave generator. Three pitch values are summed up, and two amplitude values multiply together to create more complex sound combinations.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2443101/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734436102","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2443101/page.bg.jpg?t=1734436102","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2443101/4e2b69db1cabad8cc265a94585e7aac186140421/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734436102","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2443101/4e2b69db1cabad8cc265a94585e7aac186140421/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734436102","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Analogue Engines Bolt-on contains 8 extra wave generation engines to boost capabilities of SFXEngine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBreath Wave is a white noise signal with internal band-pass filter.
