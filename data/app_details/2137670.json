{"about_the_game":"The homeworld contracted your company for its first terraforming project, but something has gone terribly wrong... Instead of waking on Viridius Betus, you find yourself stranded inside an asteroid, and the arrogant AI that your team was supposed to babysit has decided it's the boss now. Worse still, the surveys said this part of space was supposed to be lifeless... Imagine your surprise to find that your new home is infested with bio-mechanical monstrosities - hungry ones!<br><br>Drill, craft, and blast your way through winding caverns. Upgrade your utility pod with plasma cannons, missiles, and laser drills. Build an army of tireless drones to do your bidding. You are going to need every advantage to venture deep into the asteroid's secrets if you want to repair the ship and make your escape. Discover the genesis of this place, or become its lunch.<br><br>Terraforming may be the homeworld's last chance for salvation, but sending their best was too expensive. Instead, they stranded you in... the Veridian Expanse.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Drift Engine:</h2><br>Veridian Expanse is built on the custom Drift Engine, written in C for maximum performance and portability. It sips your battery power, and runs just fine on older machines. The custom HDR lightfield model allowed cranking the dynamic lighting and shadows in the game up to 11. On top of that, the game's huge map is fully destructable so you can explore where you want.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Pixel Perfect Art:</h2><br>A fancy engine is worthless without pretty pixels, so we had the amazing unTied Games make ours. Every pixel is perfectly placed and lovingly lit for a look you just won't find in many other games. :D","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2137670/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729528245","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2137670/page.bg.jpg?t=1729528245","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2137670/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729528245","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2137670/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729528245","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"The homeworld contracted your company for its first terraforming project, but something has gone terribly wrong...
