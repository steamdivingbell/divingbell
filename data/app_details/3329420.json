She's gotten used to it over time, but that doesn't mean she likes it. She doesn't have anyone she can call a friend, and she can't even remember the last time she chatted merrily with someone! But one day, she decides that enough is enough. She wants to change! She doesn't know exactly how yet, but the desire to do so is there... </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In fact, her desire is so strong that it summons a spirit! Levizera heard her plea loud and clear. She wants to change? Then she'll make Hiyori an offer she can't refuse... literally! Waifu App is a magical piece of software that will grant her wish if she can make men think of her as wife material a thousand times. The deadline is 90 days, and she'll be cursed to live and die alone unless she meets it! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Follow Hiyori on her crazy journey of socialization and change on her way to learning how to make friends!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3329420/extras/Waifu_App_-_90_Days_to_Escape_a_Lonely_Fate_Description_2_EN.png?t=1735355741\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Choose your own adventure as Hiyori starts breaking out of her shell and exploring more of the town.
