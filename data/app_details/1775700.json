{"about_the_game":"<strong>Survive the night.</strong><br><br>In Hunted: Survive the Night you play as 1 monster vs up to 4 survivors. Trapped in an unknown location the survivors has to find and play 6 haunted music boxes until the song finishes. Doing so opens the gates out to the foggy path, waiting for your freedom. The survivors aren't completely helpless as they can find weapons laying around, this doesn't damage the killer, but stuns it instead. Giving the survivors a small window to escape and hide. Remember not to linger for too long. If time runs out before you escape, the gates will close forever and will take your life at the same time.<br><br>This is <strong>first person only</strong> for both the killer and the survivors. Hunted is focusing on realism and horror. Hunted is primarily based on luck, teamwork, sounds and most importantly. Stealth.
