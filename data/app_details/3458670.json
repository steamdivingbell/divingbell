{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Horseshoe Curve is a three-track railroad curve on Norfolk Southern Railway's Pittsburgh Line in Blair County, Pennsylvania. The curve is roughly 2,375 feet (700 m) long and 1,300 feet (400 m) in diameter. Completed in 1854 by the Pennsylvania Railroad as a way to reduce the westbound grade to the summit of the Allegheny Mountains, it replaced the time-consuming Allegheny Portage Railroad, which was the only other route across the mountains for large vehicles. The curve was later owned and used by three Pennsylvania Railroad successors: Penn Central, Conrail, and Norfolk Southern.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Horseshoe Curve has long been a tourist attraction. A trackside observation park was completed in 1879. The park was renovated and a visitor center built in the early 1990s. The Railroaders Memorial Museum in Altoona manages the center, which has exhibits pertaining to the curve. The Horseshoe Curve was added to the National Register of Historic Places and designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1966. It became a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 2004.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This dlc features the Horseshoe Curve section Altoona to Cresson.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Features:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> <br>- new detailed US route <br>- interactive industries and commodity chains <br>- 4 new missions <br>- Amtrak P42DC PH 5 &amp; PH 6 50 Years locomotive <br>- Amtrak Amfleet I Coach, Cafe &amp; Business <br>- functional door steps on Amfleet <br>- responsive day and night interiors for passenger coaches <br>- Deadman's control for ES44AC, AC44C6 &amp; P42DC locomotive <br>- automatic DPU marker lights <br>- dynamic vehicle weathering <br>- fuel consumption</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- realistic curve squeal sounds</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Included Trains:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- Amfleet I, coach, business, cafe &amp; II coach <br>- Viewliner baggage coach <br>- P42DC and Amfleet I, II &amp; cafe detailed interiors <br>- NS 4851 TAG AC44C6 <br>- NS 8099 (Southern Railway) <br>- NS 8100 (Nickel Plate Road) <br>- NS 8114 (Norfolk Southern) <br>- NS 8102 (Pennsylvania) <br>- NS 8103 (Norfolk &amp; Western) <br>- NS 8105 (Interstate) <br>- NS ES44AC <br>- PRR GP9</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3458670/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738905077","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3458670/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1738905077","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3458670/b54ed76468e0e0672667825f5b70795dba01342f/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738905077","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3458670/b54ed76468e0e0672667825f5b70795dba01342f/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738905077","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Horseshoe Curve is a three-track railroad curve on Norfolk Southern Railway's Pittsburgh Line in Blair County, Pennsylvania.
