{"about_the_game":"Explore a wormhole!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRiemann\u2019s Lens simulates the non-euclidean geometry and strange visual effects associated with a Riemannian wormhole. While it is unknown whether these objects exist in nature, nothing prevents us from investigating their properties and consequences with our computers. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRiemann\u2019s Lens is an interactive virtual art display that allows you to fly around and through a wormhole, with simple scenery rendered in the euclidean space on either end. The size and geometry of the wormhole can be adjusted. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCustom scenery can be defined with a scripting language.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe simulation uses a compute shader to perform non-euclidean ray-tracing, and relies on the graphics card to perform some heavy computations. It has been developed on a machine with a GeForce GTX 1650, and it manages 2-5 fps. Expect some lag. The graphics card must support OpenGL 4.3+, and compute shaders.
