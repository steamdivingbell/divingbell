{"about_the_game":"Empires and Tribes is a unique hybrid of a medieval city builder and a role-playing game.<br>You will undertake the duties of a mayor in the 13th century and manage the expansion of your city, ensure the production of resources, develop innovative technologies, negotiate new laws with the city council and raise a powerful army to protect yourself from rival principalities.<br><br>In Empires and Tribes you will find the classic game principles of a real-time strategy game combined with the possibilities of a role-playing game in first person perspective. In addition to city planning and economic decisions, you can expect political power struggles in the city council, an indecisive priest, a strike-hungry population, bandits, begging monks, thieves and four hostile principalities in the immediate vicinity. <br>Demonstrate leadership, economic and diplomatic talent to maintain your place in the challenging world of Empires and Tribes.  Plan and expand your settlement wisely and with skill, and you will lead it from a small fishing village to a thriving hub of trade. Tap natural resources, create residential areas and build public buildings such as chapels and taverns to meet the growing needs of your inhabitants. Protect your settlement by building castles at strategically important points and expanding them with towers, gates, courtyards and various expansions.
