Absolutely not. For one, it just doesn\u2019t feel like any world we\u2019ve explored before... To think of the dungeons as Zelda-like is doing them a disservice. These are labyrinthine areas with intricate puzzles that connect and interrelate to each other... And through all this are the characters, a motley cast that feel a bit like Alice in Wonderland written by Irvine Welsh... Park Story is every bit the Scottish fable. It\u2019s thick with humour, colour and character, and we were endlessly surprised by it.\u201d<br>The Xbox
