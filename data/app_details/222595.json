{"about_the_game":"The powerful and impressive BR DP1 Deltic evokes the UK\u2019s glorious railway heritage, and this attractive prototype diesel locomotive is now available for Train Simulator.<br><br>The amalgamation of engine manufacturer Napier &amp; Sons and locomotive builder English Electric in 1942 opened up the potential to use the powerful Napier Deltic diesel engine in mainline locomotives. In the mid-1950s, English Electric produced a demonstration locomotive, officially numbered \u2018DP1\u2019, using the Deltic engine, which was to be the forerunner of the well-known \u2018Deltic\u2019 class of locomotives.<br><br>The DP1 had a particular American feel, with its high sides and streamlined styling, made more prominent by its sleek livery, long aluminium beading, high cab windows and large nose headlight, fitted for effect rather than practicality. Two 18 cylinder Deltic engines were fitted, giving 3,300 horsepower (2,500 kW) in total and a top speed of 90mph.<br><br>The DP1 was demonstrated and tested on the Settle-Carlisle line before entering service as a main line locomotive alongside its sister Class 55 \u2018Deltics\u2019, although these lacked DP1\u2019s distinctive look. As a main line locomotive, DP1 had a relatively short working life, being retired in March 1961 after a major engine failure, but easily serving its purpose to demonstrate the Deltic\u2019s power and prowess.<br><br>Two years later, in 1963, DP1 was donated to the Science Museum in London and is now on display at the National Railway Museum\u2019s Locomotion site in Shildon, England. <br>The DP1 Deltic for Train Simulator is available in its distinctive blue demonstrator/testing livery, featuring two-tone horn and cab lighting, plus BR Mk1 maroon coaches as used on modern day rail tours, complete with passenger view.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the BR DP1 Deltic on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for the Settle-Carlisle route route (available separately and required to play these scenarios).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Scenarios</h2><br>Three scenarios for the Settle-Carlisle route:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tBreathing New Life<br></li><li>\tPrelude to a Pioneer<br></li><li>\tDeltic Highlander</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
