{"about_the_game":"Fairytale Furnishing is a game about interior designing and furnishing homes for fairy tale heroes. Customize the princess's tower, the hero's cabin, or the witch's cottage to your taste. Unlock new items. Revisit completed locations to decorate them differently. In the process, uncover the story that connects the characters with each other.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Furnish:</h2><br>Across game levels, you'll find yourself in the empty abodes of fairy tale characters - like a princess's tower or a witch's den. You'll furnish their homes, placing furniture and other items, thereby better revealing the personalities of their owners.
