{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>It's Only Money</strong> is a 3rd person open world simulation game where you take the role of an Undercity resident \u2013 someone forced to live amongst the sewers and subways by the newly elected evil Mayor.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Along with other Undercity residents, you will venture to the surface to steal, fight and destroy. Take down corporations owned by the Mayor\u2019s corrupt cohorts. Win back the city for everyone, block by block. Buy houses, businesses, clothes, cars and whatever else your materialistic heart desires. Play alone or bring up to three friends to share in the chaos. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1415220/extras/apng_hotdog.png?t=1729524607\" />Rockhaven is your playground. Explore a dynamic city filled with shops, houses, activities, and missions. Unleash your creativity as you exploit the open world to your advantage: pickpocket the wealthy, steal cars for a wild joyride, or jack a UFO and take it for a spin! Test your combat skills with new moves available at the Dojo, or take on the Mayor\u2019s inner circle in epic Takeover missions, including boss fights against his lieutenants.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Feeling tactical?

Every house you buy brings more people back from the Undercity to the surface, allowing you to customise their living spaces for gameplay buffs and unique items. Invest in properties like the landlord you\u2019ve always wanted to be. Become the 1%! Profit off the land and contribute nothing to society! Concentration of wealth? Sounds like a poor people problem.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Business ownership isn\u2019t just about money; it\u2019s about power.

We got you covered. Go bigger with the latest addition to Rockhaven\u2019s underground scene - the 'Metro Dungeon'.

Whether you're tweaking the headlight colour, installing hydraulics for jumps, or kitting out your ride with NOS, the possibilities are endless, with millions of part combinations. Unlock new parts by jacking and crushing cars around the city, then bring them back to your garage to build the wildest ride Rockhaven has ever seen.
