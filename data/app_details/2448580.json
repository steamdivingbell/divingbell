The Sentry Beam\u2019s watchful red eye uses motion-tracking to lock onto a target and emit a narrow laser beam of super-heated amplified light \u2013 perfect for slicing through fast-moving Raiders.

Its visor alters its vision to display multiple blurred targets when only one is present, causing it to simultaneously fire at each in a scattershot attack more difficult to evade than a single bolt. Efficient and aggressive, the Ravager is an imposing addition to any Outpost\u2019s defenses.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">1 WEAPON:\u202f </h2><strong>-Demolition Cannon </strong><br>Discovered in the Sanctuary\u2019s armory by Nautilus during his blood-soaked escape, the Demolition Cannon was used to decimate any who stood in his path.
