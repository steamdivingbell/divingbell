{"about_the_game":"An assembled, linear version of the dynamic in-game music, heavily influenced by 16-bit sounds of the Super Nintendo. Featuring two versions of the music, as a \u201cside A\u201d: Serenity, a SNES-style symphonic mix, and \u201cside B\u201d: Chaos, a heavy electronic mix. The worlds are the same structure and duration, just viewed through the lens of a different Fate. The dynamic in-game music is comprised of up to 16 instrument channels, which change volume and form to evolve along with the players\u2019 choices. Each track roughly marks a point in the game where another fate\u2019s temple has been added to the world, highlighting the relationship between the different voices.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTrack listing: <br />\r\n01.
