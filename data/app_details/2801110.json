{"about_the_game":"Explore towns built around oases and expanses of heat and sand with the Winlu Desert Exterior pack! Winlu is back with another tileset for MV and MZ, this time focusing on lots and lots of sand and on stone, clay, and fabrics that can turn an empty desert into a livable town. A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, and 5 B sheets are ready for you to create desert maps with abandoned watchtowers scattered between sand-covered roads and cacti, bustling merchant cities with statues guarding the gates and pots filled with food tucked behind pillows where your heroes can rest, and even rocky cliffs that lead to forgotten mines and partially buried pyramids! Also included are 20 character sheets for objects to add more movement and details to your maps.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis tileset comes with lots of great tiles for palaces, cities (rich and poor), cliffs, oases, deserts and  pyramids. It also offers a wide range of vegetation from different palms, trees and a large selection of cactuses. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nContents:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* 20 character sheets<br />\r\n* 10 tile sheets<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTerms of Use:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack is for use in RPG Maker Series or the engine of your choice.<br />\r\nOK to be used in Commercial projects<br />\r\nContents can be edited<br />\r\nOK for use in games with gore<br />\r\nOK for use in adult-rated games","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2801110/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1706808967","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2801110/page.bg.jpg?t=1706808967","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2801110/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1706808967","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2801110/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1706808967","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Explore towns built around oases and expanses of heat and sand with the Winlu Desert Exterior pack!
