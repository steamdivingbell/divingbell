{"about_the_game":"Hank is an astronaut who has been assigned with a mission to build rocket launch pads on the moon. On his last day of work, the moon base is surprised by an alien attack, and Hank is caught in the middle of a battle of epic proportions, fighting for his life with little resources. In face of imminent destruction, the only chance for our hero to survive is to reach an emergency escape vehicle named LESS (Lunar Escape Systems). However, this will not be an easy mission...<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2322060/extras/ezgif.com-video-to-gif__2_.gif?t=1709682445\" /><br><br>MoonLess is a vintage-styled side scrolling platform game for those who are up for a challenge. Not only you will face hordes of enemies and tricky obstacles in order to reach the boss at the end of each stage, but will also have to keep track of your oxygen levels, ammunition and space suit - since the slightest damage can quickly lead to deathly consequences. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2322060/extras/ezgif.com-video-to-gif__4_.gif?t=1709682445\" /><br><br>Hank's unlimited single shot weapon can be either charged for a more powerful beam or upgraded to a double shot with limited ammunition by picking up a special power up. Limited grenade power ups are available as an special attack, and can help you fend off larger hordes of enemies. An oxygen meter provides a time limit before Hank starts struggling with hypoxia, and should be renewed by picking up extra tanks along the way. Finally, Hank's limited movement is greatly enhanced by his attached jetpack that automatically recharges when idle, allowing the player to reach higher platforms or evade enemies.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2322060/extras/ezgif.com-video-to-gif.gif?t=1709682445\" /><br><br>With a soundtrack produced exclusively for the game by Synt5, MoonLess has all the elements for a good retro-style fun.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2322060/extras/ezgif.com-video-to-gif__6_.gif?t=1709682445\" />","achievements":{"total":0},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2322060/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1709682445","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2322060/page.bg.jpg?t=1709682445","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2322060/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1709682445","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2322060/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1709682445","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Hank is an astronaut who has been assigned with a mission to build rocket launch pads on the moon.
