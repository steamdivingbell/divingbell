{"about_the_game":"Experience life as a vampire in this simulation-heavy sandbox RPG -- with an emphasis on the &quot;role-playing&quot; part of &quot;role-playing game&quot;. Engage with the various activities offered by the setting or live a quiet life. Hunt well-protected targets such as nobles for an assassination-style challenge. Turn invisible and follow NPCs to observe their daily lives. Explore the surrounding wilderness, perhaps in one of your animal forms.
