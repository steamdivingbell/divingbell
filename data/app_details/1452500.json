Having accepted a request from The Morning Bell newspaper to \u201cuncover the mystery of a small English town\u201d, Naomi finds herself far from her home in New York, in Rainy Woods. Upon beginning her investigation, Naomi \u2013 camera in hand \u2013 soon discovers an inexplicable phenomenon in which the townspeople transform into cats and dogs as night falls... Then, as just she\u2019s looking into that particular mystery, a murder occurs... Join her as she attempts to reveal the truth about Rainy Woods.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1452500/extras/TGL_welcome.gif?t=1707213944\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1452500/extras/TGL-EN-photography-580x61.png?t=1707213944\" /><br>As a journalist, Naomi is able to earn money by taking photos of Rainy Woods at the request of The Morning Bell and the town\u2019s residents.
