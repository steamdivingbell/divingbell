{"about_the_game":"Welcome to Goofy Gorillas, the biggest nostalgia-driven virtual jungle gym!<br><br>Do you want to play your typical childhood games with your friends? Maybe you'd want to play Tag with Inflatable Hammers, or perhaps even a Boxing Glove to raise the stakes a little more? Why not turn your friends into enemies in a Deathmatch battle with all of the items mentioned? You and up to 9 other players can partake in these activities while also earning GP (Goofy Points). Levels are gained through earning GP, which can then be used to unlock unique cosmetic items to show off while you're winning in your game mode of choice!<br><br>If you just want to chill without the fear of being chased or you don't feel like turning your friends into enemies just yet, we have you covered! Goofy Gorillas prioritizes creating a social hub before any game mode begins, so you're able to do whatever you want to do - with small mini-games that can be played at any time too! While there's no gamemode active, you and your friends can play games in the games area that include Four in a Row and arcade machines.<br><br>Players can show off their speedrunning skills in the two different time trial events in all jungle gyms, with an in-game leaderboard showing off everyone's personal best times within that party!<br><br><i>Goofy Gorillas now also uses proximity voice chat, so you can truly immerse yourself with others by communicating in-game and sounding like you're really there!</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>THE GAMEMODES!</strong></h2><strong><i>Deathmatch!</i></strong><br>The standard of any multiplayer game. This is the perfect gamemode for those who want to mindlessly cause chaos with friends! Just spawn in with an item, get stuck in the brawl and come out on top, or just respawn with another item if you weren't successful! The first player to reach the score limit wins, or if no one reaches that, then the time limit will decide who becomes victorious!<br><br>Collectable items such as Stink Bombs and Banana Peels can be picked up around the venue and be used to fight off other players, or to simply catch others off guard. It's entirely up to you how you use them!<br><br><br><strong><i>Infector!</i></strong><br>Infector is another classic game. It plays just like Hide &amp; Seek, but there's a catch... One player is chosen as the Infector, and by catching the Runners, they too will become an Infector. Once everyone has been caught, the Infector team will win... or lose if there's just a single player still standing. The runners will have nothing to defend themselves besides their ability to hide and run... unless they find a conveniently placed Stink Bomb or Banana Peel.<br><br>Be careful who you trust in this gamemode; once your &quot;friend&quot; has been caught, they will not be your friend anymore!<br><br><br><strong><i>Infector: After Hours!</i></strong><br>The Goofy Staff have gone home for the night, so the whole jungle gym will be in complete darkness. The Survivors will be equipped with glowsticks to help navigate around and the Infectors will be armed with flashlights, which are also designed to help navigate around, but they are also used to whack the Survivors! All of the rules from Infector apply in this gamemode too.<br><br>To make the experience just that little more creepy, nametags will not be visible above the players, so you'll have to be extra cautious around everyone you bump into!<br><br><br><strong><i>King of the Castle!</i></strong><br>A new addition to Goofy Gorillas. A randomly designated area will be highlighted in the jungle gym and the first player to find it must then stand their ground from opposing players. Should the King be dethroned, the next player will take their place and begin their reign. The longer the reign, the more points you get!<br><br><br><strong><i>Tag, You're It! + Tag: After Hours!</i></strong><br>A much requested game mode. The Tag that everyone knows so well is now here in Goofy Gorillas, except this time it's with Inflatable Hammers, Boxing Gloves and Goofy Guns! Everyone hides from the player that is chosen to be It. If they catch a player, they will both swap sides, and they will be the newly selected player to be It!<br><br>Every player is given a fixed amount of points, if they are It, their points will tick away! The only way to stop the points from falling is to tag a player. When a player loses all of their points, the match will end.<br><br><br><strong><i>Juggernaut!</i></strong><br>One player is selected at random to become the Juggernaut, who is given a little too much health and can withstand a lot of attacks. The rest of the players much attempt to take out the Juggernaut with all of the items before the timer ends. The Juggernaut only has access to Stink Bombs and Banana Peels in order to slip up the attackers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>THE JUNGLE GYMS!</strong></h2>Goofy Gorillas consists of three jungle gyms, all designed to offer different gameplay experiences.<br><br><strong><i>Original.</i></strong><br>This jungle gym is very large and is perfect for slower-paced gamemodes with lots of players involved. It features a soccer field, a basketball court, a mini-racing track, two ballpits, a bowling alley, lots of different slides and many, many hiding spots! If you want to get totally lost in a jungle gym, this is the right place to be!<br><br><br><strong><i>Refurbished.</i></strong><br>The Refurbished jungle gym is approximately half the size of the Original map and is designed for faster-paced gamemodes and is ideal for any party size! While it only features one ballpit and the soccer field, the compact structure of the jungle gym makes for fun and interesting engagements while partaking in the gamemodes!<br><br><i><strong>The Complex.</strong></i><br>Built using the same space as the Refurbished map, The Complex is designed for all things close-quarter combat related! With a much simpler layout than the other maps, it's great for those who find themselves lost quite often and it's also perfect for those who just want to go all out and cause havok!<br><br>But what's the catch? Well, this map features the Sweeper machine! Jump over the spinning platform, or duck under it... If you get hit, you'll REALLY feel it! This machine is capable of incapacitating anyone, even at the slower speeds, so do be careful if you venture into the Sweeper lair (there are plenty of warning signs)!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Ghoulish Gorilla's Project","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2627570/c051684dce42ca09d194f54c7672990bc8887909.jpg"},{"name":"OG Speedrunner","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2627570/c9ff7db4e923a5bffb3ae02b355043c541013b5f.jpg"},{"name":"This Fruit Is MINE!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2627570/036f6d4d96db44da1b98729c03402405df84819d.jpg"},{"name":"The Jungle Is My Home","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2627570/7e2e32de9a6439452f4c3989e37fe7ad01483142.jpg"},{"name":"Nimble Farmer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2627570/fe8dc1de4c8310e2db573047cec3b9b59778882b.jpg"},{"name":"The Right Tool For The Job","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2627570/ed89b48019177651bbce4e9e825801ccbb49629f.jpg"},{"name":"Got That Knockout Power!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2627570/cf3ee0fa7ab431a5d47c1feb572d7f0ca936c042.jpg"},{"name":"Can't Dodge This!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2627570/a058cda38b88495672ec221c9f820fc97f04f701.jpg"},{"name":"The Marksman","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2627570/ac1c3aefd388b7f860803bce9263fe1462c60001.jpg"},{"name":"Spray and Pray","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2627570/9ecfe16be401f1136536ecd80aec5bf311b611cb.jpg"}],"total":30},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2627570/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1739691880","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2627570/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1739691880","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2627570/8fcac79f4d20452bc8f35c410262c29339262e95/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739691880","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2627570/8fcac79f4d20452bc8f35c410262c29339262e95/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739691880","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Welcome to Goofy Gorillas, the biggest nostalgia-driven virtual jungle gym!<br><br>Do you want to play your typical childhood games with your friends?
