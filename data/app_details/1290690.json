{"about_the_game":"Cheyenne Storm is the one inmate trapped within the prison walls who is innocent of all charges.  She has always been misunderstood and struggles to understand the powers she seems to have over mother nature.  Being misunderstood is exactly what landed her in the confines that hold her in now.  She could easily use her powers to break out, but that would be playing as wicked as the cop who framed her to put her here.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe refuses to ever go against the rules but she also knows that she serves a much greater purpose than she will ever begin to understand.  She desperately needs to win at this contest of breaking more bricks than her opponent in order to be given the reward of freedom from this evil hell that binds her beautiful soul.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCheyenne can bring forth storm clouds within the walls that can aid her in the game.  While she refuses to resort to wicked tactics like blow attacks, she can and will use the power of nature and storms to give her the upper hand.  Clouds formed from her waving hands can present vision problems for her opponent and she can stir winds which will bring balls she loses back to her side and back to her control.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1290690?t=1656154839","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1290690?t=1656154839","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1290690/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1656154839","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1290690/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1656154839","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Cheyenne Storm is the one inmate trapped within the prison walls who is innocent of all charges.
