Of course, many thought that the Valley had ruined him, but in fact it was a man who tried to do so. Which is not surprising, considering how many enemies a hired killer can have. One night, when Wolfhound arrived at a routine meeting with his client, the mercenary was ambushed. The abandoned plant, where the meeting was supposed to take place, was turned into a pile of rubble and dust, but the vigilantes could not find Wolfhound\u2019s body in it. They couldn\u2019t find his car either. The mercenary\u2019s enemies celebrated their victory and went on with their lives, forgetting about Wolfhound like a bad dream.
