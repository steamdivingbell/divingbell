{"about_the_game":"Shanghai Gold is a Boomer Shooter set in 1930's Shanghai. Embark on a fantastic voyage across Shanghai and the vast regions of China in search of treasure and adventure. Along the way, you will encounter foes, both human and mythical, all with their own motives for acquiring the ancient relics left behind by China's long line of dynasties.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeaturing:<br />\r\n- 8 action packed levels full of secrets and surprises. Each level features a unique environment, giving plenty of stunning sights to see.<br />\r\n- 10 different enemy types. You'll fight insane cultists, ancient dragons and even some rats.<br />\r\n- 8 weapons. You'll never get bored with this variety (hopefully).<br />\r\n- A pretty cool art style, featuring many, many painted sprites. I put a lot of time into making them.<br />\r\n- A banging soundtrack.<br />\r\n- A really cool and awesome target audience. That's you, by the way. The one reading this. I made this game for you to play. I know you love first person shooters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShanghai Gold is set to release sometime in 2025. All those numbers listed and all the art and designs are subject to change by then. (Hopefully for the better).","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2849930/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729202134","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2849930/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1729202134","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2849930/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729202134","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2849930/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729202134","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"The gameplay consists entirely of shooting human, animal and monster enemies, with some blood showing.
