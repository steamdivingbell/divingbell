{"about_the_game":"Efpiyes was inspired by the venerable shooters of the 90s: an era of straightforward, fast-paced action, LAN parties and creative tools you didn't need a gamedev degree to use.

Choose good old-fashioned Deathmatch or change it up with some King of the Hill or Tag.<br>Game Modes Currently Implemented:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Deathmatch: Kill other players. Player with highest kills minus deaths wins.<br></li><li> King of the Hill: Occupy the hill and fight off other players.
