{"about_the_game":"Your typical Arcade Physics based Tennis-like Simulator! Control The Pong and hit The Ping as many times as you can! The more times you do, the higher your score! Try to beat your friends with skill or patience! Hitting the ball at certain angles and speeds sends the ball flying! If you can keep up with this speed, your score goes higher and higher! A game that balances risk or patience!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGameplay consists of moving your mouse up and down. Doing so moves the paddle in a cylindrical motion around the center of the screen. While doing so, you are able to bounce a ball back and forth getting a higher score each time the ball is hit. The goal is to get the biggest score possible! Getting a highs score is completely dependent on finding tricks to make the ball go faster or finding ways to make the ball hit the paddle more often. This is a game of patience and/or skill.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Pong","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2252930/9e7487088397440ec31ece6e6c71cb2c8f186b53.jpg"},{"name":"Ping","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2252930/d8cba0c31e595f4f31a53358822aa972ccee9b3b.jpg"},{"name":"100 Hits In A Row","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2252930/3571df7b14c2add586ad11052a5fb4d003a11606.jpg"},{"name":"1000 Hits In a Row","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2252930/ba96f0740dd129ae646d94937e0007f0a4432ec1.jpg"},{"name":"Reset King","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2252930/198269dac5f3fe0c11a9a3c30953743f0ae6af73.jpg"}],"total":5},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2252930/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1676562189","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2252930/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1676562189","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2252930/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1676562189","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2252930/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1676562189","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Your typical Arcade Physics based Tennis-like Simulator!
