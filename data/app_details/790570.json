{"about_the_game":"Innocent VR immerses you in the not too distant year of 2218, where Earth has been devastated by natural disaster caused by excessive logging and destruction of natural resources. Unknown viruses have filled every corner of the world with raging mutated creatures. The most terrible of such viruses is known as &quot;carbonized disease&quot; and is the greatest threat to humanity ever known. Infection with this disease will cause a human to carbonize from the inside out without ever rotting, or as some will put it &quot;coke.&quot; Embark on an adventure filled with challenging puzzles to solve, avoiding crisis and solving the riddle of this carbonation while unlocking the mystery of these natural disasters.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">KEY FEATURES</h2></strong><br><strong>*Hollywood Visual Effects</strong><br>1. Grand scenic horizons, including snowy landscapes, incredible mountains, and karst caves. <br>2. Fully immerse yourself in a world where the fate of humanity rests solely on you.<br>3.
