{"about_the_game":"This short game (20-60 mins gameplay) is designed to teach fraction concepts in an exciting interactive sci-fi escape room based game. You explore a derelict space station to restore its power, hack its terminals, and get to your shuttle to save an endangered planet, while enjoying astonishing views of Earth. The gameplay unfolds in a massive 16,000 sq ft highly-detailed space station with over 20 sections across 5 floors and 8 game levels. While you solve the challenges, you are learning and applying middle school math fraction concepts in a step-by-step manner based on actual school syllabi. Unlike most educational games, Galactic Protection Squad has been field-tested on hundreds of students, and research shows measurable improvements in student learning.<br><br><strong>Educational Details:</strong><br>This game examines the following curricular concepts in mathematics: simple multiplication, balanced equations, whole numbers, parts of a whole number, subtracting from a whole, and visual representations of simple fractions. In the first 7 levels, players build their skills in these educational concepts and the final level is an assessment, testing the player's new knowledge. There are altogether 40 concepts involving fractions in middle school math, and future game episodes will complete the rest of these learning goals.<br><br>Visualizing and interacting with fractions is a struggle for many students, in elementary, secondary, and university years. This game is a virtual reality experience where students build kinesthetic intuition towards operations involving fractions while engaging with problem-based activities in an experiential setting. This adventure escape room based game allows students to use their curiosity for solving the puzzles, which sequentially build the skills necessary to understand, visualize and complete operations with fractions.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1231640/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1643833469","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1231640/page.bg.jpg?t=1643833469","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1231640/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1643833469","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1231640/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1643833469","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This short game (20-60 mins gameplay) is designed to teach fraction concepts in an exciting interactive sci-fi escape room based game.
