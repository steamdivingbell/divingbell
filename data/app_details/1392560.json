Serious Fun Football is a game on the one hand created seriously, where realism is almost as high as in the world-famous football titles and on the other hand a casual game, where it's all about pure fun.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">What does the gameplay look like? It's fast-paced 3vs3 play, which you probably know from your own experience while playing with your friends outdoors. There are no corners, no penalties, and no throw-ins. There's a focus on shooting, passing, and cooperation. Keep in mind that here there are not a lot of mechanisms that will assist you in controlling the footballer. You run, shoot, pass, aim and receive the ball using only your skill.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>WIDE VARIETY OF CHOICES</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1392560/extras/Wide_variety_of_choices.gif?t=1732126470\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Choose from the online game against other players or vs AI. If you prefer to play alone or have a party game with friends on your PC you can always do that in offline play. Career mode is for those who would like to create a footballer and make a true \u201cgoat\u201d out of him. All games are 3vs3 but you can decide if you want to control just one player or the whole team. Friendly match - just click and play.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>REAL FOOTBALL ATTRIBUTES</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1392560/extras/Statistics.gif?t=1732126470\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If someone has high attributes he will pass, shoot better, and run faster.

There are no corners, no penalties, and no throw-ins. You decide if you control one player and focus mostly on ball anticipation, tackles, positioning, running, shooting, or controlling a full team of 3 where passing and tactics come into play. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In SFF you can choose from two difficulties - serious or fun. Each match can be played from 3 different camera angles - horizontal, vertical, and TPP.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>GOALS</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1392560/extras/Goals.gif?t=1732126470\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Serious Fun Football is a type of game that is easy to start but hard to master. Controlling your player/s to score a goal (especially vs a good team) you will need to learn how to aim with your passes and shooting. Using fences and precise movement should help a lot.  To become a true professional SFF player you will have to take into account many factors like ball speed, stamina, strength, the distance of players, and more.
