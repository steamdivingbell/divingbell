{"about_the_game":"&quot;Doll's Liminal&quot; is a first-person exploration survival horror game set in a remote region of Japan. In the area known as &quot;Doll's Liminal,&quot; an experiment called &quot;Freight Transport Test&quot; is conducted to see if one can pass through the area and reach the other side safely. The unit for measuring the depth of space is called &quot;Depths,&quot; and the strange phenomenon of Japan, the &quot;Doll's Liminal,&quot; attempts to take those who enter it to the deepest layer of &quot;Depths 399.&quot;<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2270020/extras/01.gif?t=1703702070\" /><br><br>Explore the interior of the Doll's Liminal, collect items, and aim for Depths 399. If you can shoot enough bullets into the &quot;Blood Trail Dominator&quot; located in Depths 399 and neutralize it, you can pass through the Doll's Liminal and reach the other side.<br><br>Many dolls are placed inside the Doll's Liminal, and many of them are believed to have souls within them. If a doll with a soul is left unseen, it will start moving and sneak up on intruders. If caught by a doll, you will be dragged into the deepest Depths in an instant. While it may seem convenient to want to go to Depths 399, if you are taken there without having enough equipment or ammunition, you will simply end up being toyed with by the dolls and have your soul taken away.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2270020/extras/02.gif?t=1703702070\" /><br><br>Avoid getting close to the dolls, evade them, and use your gun to take them down as you proceed through the Doll's Liminal with caution.
