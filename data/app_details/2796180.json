Featuring photorealistic graphics, fully dynamic scares and microphone detection.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>How Do I Play?</strong></h2><strong>You find yourself in the middle of a mysterious forest. Your goal is to find people who have previously gotten lost in the forest. You must be <u>SILENT</u> at night because the forest is listening to your voice through your <u>microphone</u> as you explore. It tries to make you <u>SCREAM</u> with various jumpscares. When you scream, you get one step closer to losing. You also have to constantly check your surroundings because real threats that are trying to hunt you down are on your tail. You lose when you scream or get caught by threats, and the game restarts, but this time the locations of the previously found lost people have also changed. You can't even predict what fear the game will throw at you at any given time because the whole process is <u>randomized</u>.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Game Features</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><i></i><li> <strong><i>Microphone Detection</i></strong><br></li><li> <strong><i>Unpredictable FULL Dynamic Jumpscares</i></strong><br></li><li> <strong><i>Found-Footage - VHS Style Graphics</i></strong><br></li><li> <strong><i>Different AI's Hunting You Down</i></strong><br></li><li> <strong><i>Photorealistic Environment</i></strong><br></li><li> <strong><i>Huge Forest with Different Locations in Every Direction</i></strong><br></li><li> <strong><i>Replayability (Scares and missing person locations are dynamically randomized every playthrough, making each playthrough a unique experience.)</i></strong></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Game Lore</strong></h2><strong><i>After a night you can't remember, you find yourself at a familiar-looking crime scene.
