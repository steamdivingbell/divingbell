This game is somewhat linear, but you are encouraged to explore the large, snowy forest you find yourself in. There are secrets and collectibles (which can influence the ending of your game if you find them all).<br></li><li><strong><u>Main Characters</u></strong> - You play as a human named &quot;Jahmir&quot; and an AENGI-L named &quot;Ani-4&quot; (Ania). They're tasked with going to the nearby national park and capturing/killing any android they find, and rescuing the kidnapped engineers. While there, they will need to fend off the robotic &quot;Mosquitos&quot; and &quot;Weeping Angels&quot; that plague the park.<br></li><li><strong><u>FPS Action</u></strong> - You use an M16 Rifle and an AA12 shotgun while out in the forest. Since you're a new hire, you aren't given much ammo, so it must be used sparingly. Not every enemy must be engaged.<br></li><li><strong><u>Multiple Enemy Types</u></strong> - There are 5 types of enemies with unique attributes about them that make them hard to kill. There are Weeping Angels, Fallen Weeping Angels, Mosquitos, Fallen Mosquitos, and DEMUNs, all patrolling and looking for unwanted visitors, aka, you.<br></li><li><strong><u>Dialogue</u></strong> - This is a narrative game. There are multiple people in the Hub area you can talk to to learn more about the world of Technophobia and the people themselves, before going on a mission. There are also dialogue choices. Your dialogue choices do not affect the ending of the game but are there to learn more about the story.<br></li><li><strong><u>Collectables</u></strong> - There are hidden collectables to be found in the forest. Finding them all will unlock the ability to have the true ending of Technophobia: DAgtH.<br></li><li><strong><u>PSX Graphics</u></strong> - This game has a PSX-lite style of graphics. The graphics are not true to the original PlayStation(s), but it takes inspiration from the style!<br></li><li><strong><u>Multiple Levels</u></strong> - There are 5 main story levels. Upon completing the game, you can choose to play through an extension of the story as the android, &quot;Ania&quot;. Ania's extension has an extra 2 levels. There are 7 levels in total.<br></li><li><strong><u>A Punishing Game</u></strong> - If you get hit once, you die.
