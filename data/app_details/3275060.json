{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Blackstar Ranger is a high-octane immersive first-person space combat game. From the seat of your advanced fighter, you will complete contracts for BLACKSTAR, the most esteemed Private Military Faction in the solar system. With 6DOF capability, you will battle emerging threats intent on consolidating power throughout the system.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Strap in tight, deep space fighter combat is visceral and chaotic. It takes a special sort to live up to the title of Blackstar Ranger.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>DEMO FEATURES</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">NOTE:\u00a0 The demo only supports English language for now.\u00a0 There is text localization planned for German, Russian and Simplified Chinese for full launch. Others may follow later.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Blackstar Ranger Demo features the first two contract missions from the full game. In the first mission you will be tasked with defending Minerva Station from incursions of pirate fighters. The second mission will require you to deal with a pirate cruiser and fighter elements blockading a logistics station. These missions are highly replayable and an excellent showcase for how overall combat will feel in the final game.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> The training range is also included in the demo. Here you will get instruction on your fighter systems from the AI trainer. An in-cockpit menu will allow you to select topics about your craft that you would like to learn. The training range also allows the player to test out systems and weapons on training drones and turrets. You can hone your skills in a non-lethal environment before ever accepting an official contract.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>FULL GAME FEATURES</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Take on various heart pounding, highly replayable contract missions.
