{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1889400/extras/Description_Items_1.png?t=1651867205\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>On A Roll 3D Levels 7 - 9 DLC</strong></h2> <br><strong>With three brand new worlds, get ready to roll through levels 7, 8 and 9 of On A Roll 3D.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Level 7 - Space Station</h2>On A Roll 3D takes you beyond the stratosphere to a world of planets, moons, rockets and satellites. Take a shortcut via a UFO teleporter, or go on a &quot;moonroll&quot; in a low gravity chamber. You'll come across some old favourites in the shape of spinning spikes, flame throwers and circular saws, each with some extra lethal enhancements, and you'll have to contend with brand new exploding stars, timed switches and space rovers. Be careful not to fall off the edge of any platforms... it's a long way down.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Level 8 - Boulder Passage</h2>Navigate the well-worn paths and rickety, broken bridges of this arid, rocky landscape. With lots of sharp things, plenty of fire and a few explosions you'll need to make your way over narrow platforms, down steep hills and over perilous gaps to reach your goal. Complex switch systems linked to trapdoors and rotating blocks stand in your way, but you might find brief respite in the form of a game of skittles...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Level 9 - Toy Town</h2>Bouncy trampolines, crazy beach balls and Rubik's cubes adorn this vivid world of interactive playthings, many of them highly unsafe. Make use of a new set of lever-operated platforms, take a break to play a rotating maze game or stack up your ABC blocks to reach high places. Throw in a bit of reversed gravity and you'll need all your skill and timing to manoeuvre through the colourful chaos. And if that wasn't enough you also get to fire yourself out of a cannon!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>With all the usual favourites from the main game, a new set of fastest time leaderboards for each DLC area and three new bosses to defeat, this DLC presents the ultimate challenge for any On A Roll 3D fan.</strong></h2><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1889400/extras/Description_Items_2.png?t=1651867205\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1889400/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1651867205","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1889400/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1651867205","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1889400/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1651867205","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1889400/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1651867205","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1889400/extras/Description_Items_1.png?t=1651867205\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>On A Roll 3D Levels 7 - 9 DLC</strong></h2> <br><strong>With three brand new worlds, get ready to roll through levels 7, 8 and 9 of On A Roll 3D.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Level 7 - Space Station</h2>On A Roll 3D takes you beyond the stratosphere to a world of planets, moons, rockets and satellites.
