{"about_the_game":"Experience the thrill of racing through dense, forested valleys, over awe-inspiring viaducts and deep into swooping tunnels. Germany\u2019s classic Inter City Express awaits on our longest route yet with Train Sim World 3: Schnellfahrstrecke Kassel - W\u00fcrzburg. <br> <br>Climb aboard the first true high-speed train in Germany, the ICE 1, and accelerate up to 280 km/h through Hesse and Bavaria countryside. The eloquent mix of tunnels and viaducts offering a unique view as you punch through landscape, and unique challenge as you stay on top of the forever changing speed limits, master LZB and PZB to stay on schedule. <br> <br>Go for a modern twist and drive the sleek and refined ICE 3. State-of-the-art, the ICE 3 features unrivalled power and speed, but its efficiency comes at a cost; manage your speed to ensure you don\u2019t give passengers a rough ride, the train is so light, the forces of nature could otherwise take control! <br> <br>Weave between the super-fast passenger services and run under moonlit skies in the DB BR 185.2. High-speed lines and freight traffic are no strangers, with cargo haulage taking place in twilight hours, as well as gaps throughout the day. Refine your braking aboard heavy trains as you could be put into any passing loop for an ICE to rocket by. <br> <br>Ride and drive trains in hills and valleys, complete platform and trackside tasks, or simply go trainspotting from your favourite vantage point.
