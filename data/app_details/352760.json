It\u2019s charming, addictive, creative, and if a franchise will ever be born from this title, it certainly has a great deal of potential for the future. I highly recommend it.\u201d<br>8/10 \u2013 Scouse Gamer<br><br>\u201cThe overall presentation is fantastic, the characters are cute and the Kaiju are varied which keeps things interesting. There is satisfaction collecting survivors and building defenses ... There\u2019s a surprising amount of depth to the game and it requires thought before each stage starts.\u201d<br>7/10 \u2013 Brash Games<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly fun to jump into with even the simple task of building up towers to see how effective they are when paired up having the power to compel further experimentation.The same too can be said for watching swathes of adorable Kaiju dropping like leaves in autumn.\u201d<br>7/10 \u2013 James Slack Games<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/352760/ss_d9134e0e086f7e2aea91281651b6bf2b479cc6be.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664879255","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/352760/ss_d9134e0e086f7e2aea91281651b6bf2b479cc6be.600x338.jpg?t=1664879255"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/352760/ss_542bf630aad925ed1ee95bd31b6971529fbf9d3c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664879255","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/352760/ss_542bf630aad925ed1ee95bd31b6971529fbf9d3c.600x338.jpg?t=1664879255"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/352760/ss_6fe0028964e90073f40c927aba1d388cf15ccadf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664879255","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/352760/ss_6fe0028964e90073f40c927aba1d388cf15ccadf.600x338.jpg?t=1664879255"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/352760/ss_2b662061c983380b16eafa12c0791f50442a3f2f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664879255","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/352760/ss_2b662061c983380b16eafa12c0791f50442a3f2f.600x338.jpg?t=1664879255"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/352760/ss_8688e9da389e94744dcc1411e8c5285f7e9fbcd6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664879255","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/352760/ss_8688e9da389e94744dcc1411e8c5285f7e9fbcd6.600x338.jpg?t=1664879255"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/352760/ss_d3585de2144c34c4be24eef64b155fe418c9627d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664879255","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/352760/ss_d3585de2144c34c4be24eef64b155fe418c9627d.600x338.jpg?t=1664879255"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/352760/ss_f55abf91c3468370e9c630c79f2433f9e86fdf60.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664879255","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/352760/ss_f55abf91c3468370e9c630c79f2433f9e86fdf60.600x338.jpg?t=1664879255"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/352760/ss_c3c355ea358b2eafb35cdeb3de9fe915b0a24c7c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664879255","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/352760/ss_c3c355ea358b2eafb35cdeb3de9fe915b0a24c7c.600x338.jpg?t=1664879255"},{"id":8,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/352760/ss_abe084d3c3faa6fae17fd4114883cfbbd2f1c059.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664879255","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/352760/ss_abe084d3c3faa6fae17fd4114883cfbbd2f1c059.600x338.jpg?t=1664879255"},{"id":9,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/352760/ss_2019d064fb68e433112a2d75042772fc183ea263.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664879255","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/352760/ss_2019d064fb68e433112a2d75042772fc183ea263.600x338.jpg?t=1664879255"},{"id":10,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/352760/ss_04e7d370f41cc1ea54a7381065e35a506a951e88.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664879255","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/352760/ss_04e7d370f41cc1ea54a7381065e35a506a951e88.600x338.jpg?t=1664879255"},{"id":11,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/352760/ss_19381300bfcf4078331e686ebe96666f6ff23c30.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664879255","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/352760/ss_19381300bfcf4078331e686ebe96666f6ff23c30.600x338.jpg?t=1664879255"}],"short_description":"A hybrid strategy Action-Strategy game with a bright and unique art style.
