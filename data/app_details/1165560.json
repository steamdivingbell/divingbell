{"about_the_game":"ONAR <br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Onar&quot; is a 3D fighting game set in the dystopian world of Oridian, where citizens are compelled to take part in the perilous tournament called &quot;Onar&quot; as their only chance to clear insurmountable debts. However, entering Onar carries a grave risk\u2014if you lose the match, you face execution by the state.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nONAR - Gameplay<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Onar&quot; offers various gameplay modes, including a single-player story mode, local player versus player (PVP), and a single-player tournament mode. It is designed to be a fast-paced, easy-to-pick-up, yet challenging fighting game. The rules are straightforward: the winner of the match is the fighter with the highest number of points. Attacks are categorized as either left or right, and points are awarded by the judges only when an attack lands without being blocked by the opponent's left or right block. Stepping outside the ring results in a reset and points deduction. Skilled fighters can chain together attack sequences and utilize command attacks to increase their score in their quest for victory.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCAMERA<br />\r\n\u201cOnar\u201d stands out from many other fighting games due to its distinctive split-screen PVP gameplay. Its core and straightforward mechanics revolve around the side from which you attack and defend. This unique camera angle adds a compelling twist to the gameplay experience, setting \u201cOnar\u201d apart from the rest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nATTACKING<br />\r\nIn \u201cOnar,\u201d attacking is categorized into two core types: Left attack and Right attack. Players can activate these attacks using the Left and Right Trigger buttons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBasic attacking is categorized into three types: Close Range Attack, Long Range Attack, and Evasive Attack. Players can activate these attacks by using the left (movement) stick in different directions: forward for Long Range, back for Evasive, and idle for Close Range. Each of the three attack types includes five basic moves with varying ranges and speeds, and players can perform these moves with either the left or right limb. Since opponents can only block attacks from one side, the core mechanic of the game involves assessing the enemy\u2019s intentions during battle to execute successful attacks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBLOCKING<br />\r\nIn \u201cOnar,\u201d a fighter can only block attacks from one direction at a time, either Left or Right. It is imperative for a fighter to choose their block direction correctly to prevent the enemy from scoring a point with their attack. Blocking is executed by simply moving your character left or right using the Left Stick.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMOVEMENT<br />\r\nMovement within the arena is controlled using the Left Stick. Fighters are categorized into four core archetypes, 1, Mid, 2, Light, 3, Bulk, 4, Heavy and their movement speed is determined by their archetype.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCOMBOS<br />\r\nIn addition to the 15 basic attacks, fighters can execute a series of combo moves that yield higher point rewards. A combo move becomes available once a basic attack successfully lands on the opponent, and the fighter inputs the combo move before the attack window expires.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPOWRMOVES<br />\r\nIf a fighter lands enough attacks, they can unlock the Power Move mechanic. When indicated, the Power Move can be activated by simultaneously pulling both the left and right triggers. This is the simplest of advanced moves, and the fighter is rewarded with a pre-baked combination of hits on the opponent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPARRY<br />\r\nIf a fighter blocks within the parry window, the fighter will automatically execute an attack after a successful block. Certain fighters are easier to parry depending on their archetype.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCOMMAND MOVES<br />\r\nCommon moves are executed by inputting a series of commands, like Left, Left, Right, Left Trigger. These inputs trigger one of three fighter-specific moves: a flaming projectile, teleportation to a different location, or a ground smash that generates a shockwave.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDODGE<br />\r\nDodging is executed by pressing the A button while simultaneously tilting the left stick in the desired dodge direction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLINKERS<br />\r\nLinkers are reserved for the most skilled fighters, as the linker input window opens for a very brief moment after successfully landing an attack. Linkers are only available with specific attacks within a combo string, and they reward the most points, making them a highly satisfying fight mechanic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRING OUT<br />\r\nIf a fighter steps out of the ring, they are given 3 seconds to re-enter. If they fail to do so, both fighters are teleported back to their starting positions, and the fighter who exited during the teleport is deducted points. This ensures uninterrupted match flow and avoids repetitive wall encounters while keeping the fight confined to the arena.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTIME<br />\r\nEach fight lasts for 90 seconds, consisting of a single round. This design keeps the matches fast-paced and the stakes high.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWIN or LOSE<br />\r\nThe fighter with the highest number of points wins. If both fighters have equal points, it results in a draw, and neither fighter wins. In story and tournament mode, fighters can only progress by securing a victory.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1165560/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724341801","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1165560/page.bg.jpg?t=1724341801","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1165560/be4f6eefc6a53fd550534985fd8ba300e34c26af/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724341801","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1165560/be4f6eefc6a53fd550534985fd8ba300e34c26af/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724341801","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Onar contains violence common in fighting game combat created for mature audiences and some finishing moves that depict acts of violence between rival characters."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"ONAR <br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Onar&quot; is a 3D fighting game set in the dystopian world of Oridian, where citizens are compelled to take part in the perilous tournament called &quot;Onar&quot; as their only chance to clear insurmountable debts.
