{"about_the_game":"<strong>Math &amp; Topology</strong> is a puzzle that challenges the topological and mathematical skills of the player.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2><br>The core gameplay mechanic is connecting tiles using lines. Tiles may be different types: <i>plain</i>, <i>sources</i>, <i>targets</i>, <i>operators</i> and <i>bridges</i>. The ultimate goal of each level is to fill all the target tiles with the corresponding numbers. To get the desired number, you can either obtain it from the source tile or combine some numbers in the operator tile.<br><br>However, obtaining target numbers is only half the battle in the game. Finding the path from tile to tile that does not interfere with the others is quite challenging too. And bridge tiles will help you to draw this spaghetti!<br><br>But bear in mind that some apparent paths could be insidious traps that prevent you from level completion!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Introduction</h2><br>The game has over 120 introductory levels and several interactive tutorials teaching player core mechanics. They will show you what different tiles do, how to use each operator, and even how to deal with tricky levels.<br><br>The introduction is split into parts, each responsible for a specific game aspect. Each starts with a text description, then some levels focus on this aspect. Introduction parts for operators also contain interactive tutorials, visually demonstrating how an operator works.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Levels</h2><br>Two tile shapes are used to build levels: square and hexagonal. The gameplay remains the same, as the shape only affects the neighbor count for each tile.<br><br>Some levels present only topological problems, as they do not contain any operators. Some require the player to consider how target or intermediate numbers are calculated. Some solutions fill the whole field. Some not. And sometimes it is <i>necessary</i> not to use some of the tiles!","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2442860?t=1732829532","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2442860?t=1732829532","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442860/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732829532","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442860/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732829532","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>Math &amp; Topology</strong> is a puzzle that challenges the topological and mathematical skills of the player.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2><br>The core gameplay mechanic is connecting tiles using lines.
