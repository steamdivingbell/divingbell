Deployable traps, turrets and environmental destruction opportunities are needed to supplement this power when facing near-overwhelming forces of reactive and aggressive enemies. Successful escapes will need to utilize a mixture of skill and planning, with discovery and upgrading of new equipment providing an edge in combat.<br><br>Combining all these elements evokes the feeling of being a beleaguered and outnumbered SENTRY.
