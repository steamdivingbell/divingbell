This is the first mobile MMO I\u2019ve actually been able to get into. The gameplay is fun and challenging, and the systems in place feel like a true retro MMO. I was also really impressed by the GUI and tutorial. Normally, mobile MMOs feel extremely overwhelming by throwing a ton of complex systems and hard to understand GUI right from the start, which turns me away from wanting to learn the game. I was pleased to see that wasn\u2019t the case here\u2014the game is very user friendly and easy to pick up. So far I\u2019ve been loving the game and am excited to keep on exploring and learning the vocations.\u201d<br>4.5/5 \u2013 App Store<br><br>\u201cThis is honestly very underrated game ngl, dude this even has a voiceline and this is the very first game i saw to have voiceline with low downloads, and the story, a masterpiece...
