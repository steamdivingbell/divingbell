The page images avoid directly referencing topics and content that would disturb younger players but cannot be considered suitable for viewers of all ages, even if they are presented without context in the gallery. The voice over directly follows the text on screen and so should be turned off when at work or in the presence of sensitive individuals.\r\n\r\nOverall the game contains mature themes and is not suitable for children. However, all of this content is provided in the form of a dark fantasy novel with vivid descriptions of combat and it's effects on the human (and inhuman) body. There are no cutscenes or animated violence, and the images have been selected and edited to keep them from being too extreme. The game should be suitable for anyone who enjoys horror novels and Lovecraftian fiction."},"detailed_description":"The Crawling Horror is dead, but its legacy of madness lives on!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n  YOU are a hunter; a man or woman of wealth and leisure who has turned their time to hunting the fiendish monsters that assail humanity.
