{"about_the_game":"This is an open world role-playing game with a medieval magical background, requiring players to explore. You can defeat invading enemies or lead followers to defeat evil leaders. Monster camps, wilderness bosses, dungeon dungeons are full of adventure and passion.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay Introduction </h2>1. Initial gameplay: Beginners can accept NPC tasks, which are generally relatively easy to complete, and can quickly increase levels and coins. After the initial equipment and level are formed, you can choose to cultivate followers or freely explore.<br><br>2. Mid game gameplay: In the mid game, players need to level up to a certain level and can selectively kill monsters that have dropped equipment materials. Of course, they can also clean up monster camps and open gold coin treasure chests.<br><br>3. Post game gameplay: In the post game, players can kill various wilderness bosses or attack more difficult ruins camps. However, it is important to pay special attention to monsters that can easily cause bleeding or poisoning. Having enough antidotes before challenging is a wiser choice.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Accompanying Operations </h2>1. Introduction to Servants: Players can recruit officials to recruit one Servant in the game by recruiting tokens, up to a maximum of four Servants. The growth of the recruited Servants varies, and the higher the growth, the higher the attribute bonus as the level increases.<br><br>2. Servant gameplay: Players can control the following status of all followers, which can lead them to battle together. After canceling the following, the followers will patrol in place. The follower has a strong desire for combat and will actively attack all enemies. In the early stages, it is important to stay away from powerful boss monsters.<br><br>3. Follower Equipment: Players can click on the follower avatar to quickly open the follower panel, and then equip or remove equipment for the follower. After the follower dies, all equipment will drop and form a package.<br><br>4. Follower Resurrection: Dead followers can be resurrected through the resurrection button at the bottom of the follower panel, which requires the consumption of a resurrection scroll (see the introduction of resurrection scrolls below).<br><br>5. Servant healing: Players can operate through the healing and detoxification buttons next to the Servant avatar, but it is more recommended to use F1~F4 (corresponding to 4 Servants respectively) to quickly heal injured Servants, and use F5~F8 (corresponding to 4 Servants respectively) to quickly detoxify.<br><br>6. Abandon follower: If a player no longer likes a follower, they can click the abandon button on the follower panel to abandon that follower (it is recommended to remove the equipment first before giving up).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Field BOSS </h2>There are many wilderness bosses in the game that players need to explore, and after defeating them, they can obtain different items or treasure chests.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Dungeon dungeon copy </h2>There are intermediate and advanced dungeons in the game. After players are fully prepared, they can lead their followers to explore various dungeons (remember to bring the dungeon keys in advance).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Important props </h2>1. Teleportation scroll: used to quickly teleport to the vicinity of the explored teleportation monument. If there are followers nearby, they will teleport together. You can directly purchase or open a treasure chest to obtain it.<br><br>2. Resurrection Scroll: Used to resurrect dead followers. When you click the resurrection button, the item in the backpack will be automatically consumed.<br><br>3. Lost Stone Statue: Can prevent players from dropping equipment when resurrecting from death, and automatically consume it when selecting Stone Statue Resurrection.<br><br>4. Antidote: Obtained through venom exchange, used to relieve the poisoning status of players or followers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Status Description </h2>1. Bleeding state: The player or follower will continue to bleed, and after a period of time, the bleeding state will automatically disappear.<br><br>2. Poisoned state: The player or follower will continue to be poisoned, and after being poisoned, all health recovery (including recovery potions) will be suspended until death.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2969220/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1717906790","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2969220/page.bg.jpg?t=1717906790","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2969220/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1717906790","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2969220/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1717906790","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"In the game, battles will include a small amount of bleeding scenes and defeat and death scenes\r\n"},"detailed_description":"This is an open world role-playing game with a medieval magical background, requiring players to explore.
