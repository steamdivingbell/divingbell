{"about_the_game":"The \u014cme Line is a 37.2 km long line connecting Tachikawa Station in Tachikawa City, T\u014dky\u014d, and Okutama Station in Okutama-town, Nishitama-county, T\u014dky\u014d. The line runs through residential areas from Tachikawa Station to \u014cme Station, but from \u014cme Station onward it runs along the Tama River through the mountains. The area between \u014cme Station and Okutama Station is known as the Adventure Line, and although it is in T\u014dky\u014d, it is an area where visitors can enjoy abundant nature and activities right after getting off the station.<br>The \u201cHoliday Rapid Okutama\u201d train used to run directly from Shinjuku Station to Okutama Station on holidays, but the train line is now separated at \u014cme Station, and the \u201cHoliday Rapid Okutama\u201d between \u014cme and Okutama Stations is operated as a temporary train.<br>After leaving Tachikawa Station, the train runs through a residential area until it reaches \u014cme Station. On the way, the train passes through Nishi-Tachikawa Station, the nearest station to the Sh\u014dwa Kinen Park and Haijima Station, a major transportation hub. There are many trains to \u014cme Station, and the line is double-tracked up to the Higashi- \u014cme Station area.<br>After leaving \u014cme Station, trains travel along the valley along the Tama River to Okutama Station. The scenery is very different from the scenery up to \u014cme Station, with a single-track line and lush greenery of trees and mountains.<br>The Okutama area is also home to a number of tourist attractions such as canoeing and ranching, and the entire Okutama line has been converted into a hotel, called the \u201cAlong railway line marugoto Hotel\u201d .<br>We hope you will enjoy the \u014cme Line, which has two distinctive features a double track running through a residential area and a single track running through the mountains.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Highlights</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Farewell to the Chuo Line Rapid Service / Tachikawa Station - Nishi-Tachikawa Station<br>The track extending to the left after departure from Tachikawa Station is the Chuo Line Rapid Service.
