As players face hordes of undead, they'll witness mature violence, including blood splatter, and the necessity of eliminating these threats to survive. However, we've ensured that the violence portrayed is not extremely graphic, maintaining a balance that adds to the gritty realism of the apocalyptic world without overshadowing the core focus of driving and survival. Our aim is to engage players in the immersive experience of navigating a post-apocalyptic environment while minimizing the emphasis on gratuitous violence."},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The sun stopped setting three years ago, bringing an endless day and a virus called &quot;Helio Parasitus&quot; that turned humans into ravenous, mindless husks.
