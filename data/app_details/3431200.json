{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game is a jigsaw puzzle that tests the player's observational skills, offering five different difficulty levels to choose from. The game interface is clean and straightforward, with no complicated background music or voiceovers, allowing players to focus entirely on the puzzle. In the 10*10 difficulty setting, a complete image is divided into 100 smaller pieces and shuffled. Players use the left mouse button to move these pieces, reassembling them into the original picture. As the difficulty increases, not only does the number of pieces grow, but the complexity of the images also rises, demanding more from the player's observational skills and patience. This game is suitable not only for those who enjoy quiet contemplation but also for individuals looking to improve their observational abilities.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3431200/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736251122","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3431200/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1736251122","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3431200/58536ff8af16a2f2b50d5d2dd5af402ad3659623/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736251122","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3431200/58536ff8af16a2f2b50d5d2dd5af402ad3659623/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736251122","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game is a jigsaw puzzle that tests the player's observational skills, offering five different difficulty levels to choose from.
