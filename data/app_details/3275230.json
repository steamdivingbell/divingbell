{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Trapped in a mysterious estate called the &quot;Labyrinth Inn&quot; with no recollection of how you got there, you only know one thing: the key to your escape might be related to these strange &quot;D.O.T.S.&quot; scattered throughout the estate's seemingly infinite interior. Spaceships? Swamps? High schools? What ISN'T inside this kooky hotel!?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3275230/extras/Gameplay.gif?t=1731125814\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Maze Estate Escape, you and up to two friends are tasked with collecting D.O.T.S. within a series of mazes. Collecting enough will open the elevator doors and allow you to progress deeper in  the estate, while also giving you a selection of upgrades to choose from.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">To impede your progress, a series of undead gem wraiths guard the D.O.T.S. accompanied by their chosen leader: a boss with their own unique ability. The bosses, mazes, and upgrades you encounter will be different every run, so be prepared for anything!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Fight back against the maze's monsters with fireballs, power-ups, and Fever abilities to make it out alive!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3275230/extras/Characters.gif?t=1731125814\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Maze Estate Escape features a quirky cast of characters, each belonging to a specific class.
