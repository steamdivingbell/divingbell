Craft, build, and struggle to survive, alone or with friends, in this terrifying new open-world survival horror simulator.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A Survival Horror Simulator</strong></h2><br>Experience complete freedom to tackle the world how you want. You decide what you do, where to go and how best to survive. There are no NPC's barking orders at you or giving you missions you don't want to do. You give the orders, you choose what happens next.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Fight Demons</strong></h2><br>Enter a world where nowhere is safe and fight against a range of mutated creatures, some who are almost human like, and others who are like nothing you have ever seen before. Armed with pistols, axes, stun batons and more, protect yourself and those you care for.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Build and Craft</strong></h2><br>Feel every interaction; Break sticks to make fires. Use an axe to cut out windows and floors. Build a small cabin, or a sea-side compound, the choice is yours.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Changing Seasons</strong></h2><br>Pluck fresh salmon directly from streams in spring and summer. Collect and store meat for the cold winter months. You're not alone on this island, so as winter rolls in and food and resources become scarce you won't be the only one looking for a meal.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Co-op Gameplay</strong></h2><br>Survive alone, or with friends. Share items and work together to build defenses. Bring back-up to explore above and below ground.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"THIS CAN\u2019T BE HEALTHY","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1326470/130f67b8530ce6245da67735b2253a15206f7076.jpg"},{"name":"DYNAMO","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1326470/1ab486ee73093951bb24cb984d353fa480e69ab2.jpg"},{"name":"COLLECTOR","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1326470/a5eec71dc514ceddd69326424012d534422039c1.jpg"},{"name":"1%","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1326470/fe2a8600628b09f9deb3b90ec8565a2d41e65b4f.jpg"},{"name":"FOODIE","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1326470/95ba817dcf298c2d7cc9d2a54c0223deccac9e5e.jpg"},{"name":"SURVIVOR","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1326470/574d0dd3391c2d62357b912e51340e21502510cd.jpg"},{"name":"WHAT COULD GO WRONG","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1326470/ff3982bcd15d7de6bbbed06d9c0f06aaa561a47e.jpg"},{"name":"THIS PLACE ISN\u2019T SO BAD","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1326470/b8b74d683d75a5b029d47284c8557c7f8ea26a54.jpg"},{"name":"NEVER GOING HOME","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1326470/0d9bc163508b021846ce51df7a9b0bd3d904da7f.jpg"},{"name":"TRUSTED","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1326470/8d6078acbed693b1b5ffd6020b0e151e155318b3.jpg"}],"total":32},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1326470/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1708624856","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1326470/page.bg.jpg?t=1708624856","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1326470/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1708624856","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1326470/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1708624856","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"Sons Of The Forest contains intense violence, blood and gore, as well as horror themes and occasional nudity.\r\n"},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"An entirely new experience from the makers of the \u2018The Forest\u2019<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1326470/extras/VirginiaWaterfall.gif?t=1708624856\" /><br><br>Sent to find a missing billionaire on a remote island, you find yourself in a cannibal-infested hellscape.
