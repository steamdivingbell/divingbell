He's on a mountain from his home town, trying to blow off some steam and blend with nature. He's an expert at his job, and knows almost everything about the mountain. He lives in a small town at the foot of the mountain and sometimes takes tourists for a trek. Currently he has been trekking for a couple of days and now seems to be very far from town. Here he gets to see nature in harmony, with animals and birds alike. This peaceful setting is disturbed by a storm that sets in and there is a loud explosion. A plane has crashed into the mountain and Jack decides to take a look at what happened. He finds some survivors and aids them. Now Jack has a long way to town and rescue will take a lot of time.
