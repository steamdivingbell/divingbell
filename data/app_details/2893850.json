The game features two game modes. The first mode is to fly in space with your own spaceship. The other mode is walking on the surface of moons or planets.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Flying a spaceship allows you to move between planets and moons. Each star system is a wide area where you can fly left and right at will. Along the way, you will find planets, moons and places from which you can make a hyperjump to other star systems. This way, you can explore the entire Arantian sector of the galaxy, where the gameplay takes place. There are 27 star systems available, with 88 celestial bodies to land on.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Walking on the surface is the mode where the main part of the gameplay takes place. You can fight enemies, sneak past them, collect resources, gather scientific data, and perform various missions. On inhabited worlds the opponents will often be rebels of various kinds, bandits, smugglers, troops of rebellious factions. On uninhabited planets they will more often be dangerous beasts. Not only better weapons, but also various accessories such as medical kits, personal energy shields, invisibility generators and levitating skateboards can be helpful.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">On some planets you will find towns. There you can sell your collected spoils, buy new weapons and supplies, and install upgrades to your ship. You can also buy a brand new, better spaceship. You will also get mini-quests in cities. For completing them you will receive not only hyperdollars, but also valuable mission points. Mission points allow you to develop your character's skills, such as attack, defense, science, mining, gadgeting and survival.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Talking to the locals, you can learn about the local  geopolitical situation, as well as a little about the surrounding planets and star systems.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The beginning of the game, is pure exploration, getting to know this sector of the galaxy. Once you reach a certain planet, you may come across the beginning of the main storyline. This main quest will take you on a journey through the entire sector and allow you to delve even deeper into its affairs. It will shed new light on the situation of the planets you've visited before, and even the entire galaxy.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Hyperspacer is a one-man project that I worked on for three years.
