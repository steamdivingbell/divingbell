{"about_the_game":"Things that go bump in the night are nothing new to the town of Lunaris. It's time to get the gang back together and help a ghoul in need in this LGBTQ+ Visual Novel DLC. Step back into the shoes of the Hunter and investigate a haunting happening in the Lunarian woodland with your colleagues August and Piper and get some help from the resident creatures of the night in a comedic mini-tale created over the course of just four weeks! This was a small love letter to our supporters who were missing the characters as much as we were. Playtime is an average of about 40 minutes - 1 hour.  <br><br><strong>FEATURES</strong><br><br>- Choose your pronouns<br>- Revisit the romances from WTNC <br>- 1 new unlockable CG<br>- Partially voiced (<i>character names + reactionary noises only</i>)","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2173950/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1667591220","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2173950/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1667591220","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2173950/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1667591220","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2173950/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1667591220","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Dark humor, harsh language."},"detailed_description":"Things that go bump in the night are nothing new to the town of Lunaris.
