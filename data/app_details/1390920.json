{"about_the_game":"Marbles: Razor's Wrath is the first installment of the Marbles series by Independent Games Limited. Play as Marble 2.0, a plucky little robot left behind in the post-apocalyptic world.

If he finds them, him and his minions will destroy the world!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVisit multiple worlds on your journey, and use platforms to explore the skies, as you unlock new abilities to help you defeat Razor's evil minions. Use your core slam power to jump on enemies heads and even solve puzzles! There are no set paths for you to follow, you make your own way to retrieve the crystals - perhaps you may even stumble across hidden treasures to dress Marble 2.0 up! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGameplay is highly customizable with filters available in the main menu for you to try out.
