She also had a lot of trouble making any friends at the office before lockdowns because she was very shy, awkward, and generally seen as weird. Much to Yua's surprise, upon returning to the office Aiko seems to have gotten significantly more confident and bold during lockdowns.

She tends to be very reclusive and shy and always just stuck to keeping her social circle limited to just 1 very close friend. Now after lockdowns, her oddities seem to have been magnified for some reason, and while it may just be from the lockdown, Yua can't shake the feeling that something is definitely off about her that wasn't before.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2599530/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1702673715","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2599530/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1702673715","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2599530/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1702673715","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2599530/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1702673715","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"Sexual content consists solely of occasional jokes/innuendo.
