{"about_the_game":"The Curse of Fafnir is a roguelike fantasy dungeon crawler that features things such as magic, mana, basic enemies, mini bosses, bosses, and a multi floor dungeon! You play as a rogue mage who tapped into dark arts to try and gain more power but as soon as you opened a dusty old book, Fafnir was summoned and not pleased, which caused him to place a curse on you and sent you to a eternal dungeon. To survive you must battle through all the floors until you make it to Fafnir so you can break the curse and return back to the overworld.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1451500/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1624391630","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1451500/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1624391630","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1451500/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1624391630","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1451500/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1624391630","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Curse of Fafnir is a roguelike fantasy dungeon crawler that features things such as magic, mana, basic enemies, mini bosses, bosses, and a multi floor dungeon!
