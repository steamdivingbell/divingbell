{"about_the_game":"Ivan is a young boy who has shut himself off from everything and everyone. A tragic event has deeply upset him altering his behavior. Ivan\u2019s mother decides to ask a psychologist, Dr Alexander, for help. In order to keep in touch with his suffering. Dr Alexander suggests they create a story session by session; this will make it possible for Ivan to explore his real problems without talking directly about them, since his suffering is still too intense for him to face it explicitly.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this story the main character, Vain, represents Ivan\u2019s alter-ego.<br />\r\nSo the game has two different narrative streams: on one hand, in the Dr Alexander\u2019s office, the boy-psychologist dialogues unfold; on the other hand you can follow Ivan\u2019s storytelling as it develops and flows with the help of Dr Alexander, which indeed is the player\u2019s key to explore Ivan\u2019s amazing inner world, acting as Vain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe gameplay is set inside Ivan\u2019s and his psychologist\u2019s story, where the world is a figment of Ivan\u2019s imagination \u2013 a fantasy world of mystery where Vain will head out on an adventurous journey full of danger and symbolic references! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the story narrated by Ivan, you will find yourself in the shoes of Vain, a young explorer who lost his memory and ended up in an unknown world. You\u2019ll play a classic 2D rpg game with a turn-based combat system. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this game there are challenging riddles \u2013 in other words,  puzzles to be solved in the explorable areas. The player will solve them in order to activate switches or to reach some platforms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game features an original soundtrack composed by Italian musician Manuel Magrini. In this game, the soundtrack plays a key role in creating the right atmosphere and expressing Ivan\u2019s feelings in every single moment of his adventure.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2184180/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1671387535","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2184180/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1671387535","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2184180/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1671387535","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2184180/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1671387535","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Ivan is a young boy who has shut himself off from everything and everyone.
