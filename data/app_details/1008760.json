{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Meanders Map Pack: Planetside</h2><br>This 24 Terrain Map Pack lets you leave the confines of a heavily armoured laser turreted compound, disembark from a Dropship Ramp, or UFO Hangar and take your sci-fi adventures down (or outside) onto the surface of various planets, hostile dangerous terrains including Lava Chasms, Ravines, Deep Craters, Sulphuric Acid Pools, Geysers, Crystal Caverns and Luminescent Biomass, Crashed Ships and a Lost Alien Artefact. Perhaps it is just trackless waste or perhaps there is a reason for visiting, an issue with the Ore Refinery, Hazardous Waste Depot or a visit to the distant Settlement. Maybe they've crashed here and the Ship Repair Hangar has instructed them to dig around for a rare part at the Garbage Disposal Yard. Regardless your players will need the services of the Vehicular and Personnel Decontamination Sector if they are not to bring aboard, or inflict upon the planet, anything they shouldn't...<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>2 x Fortified Colony Walls with Guns and Towers<br></li><li>2 x Crashed Ship Maps<br></li><li>1 x Crashed Alien Artefact Map<br></li><li>3 x Hostile Red Planet Surfaces<br></li><li>3 x Heavily Cratered Planet Surfaces<br></li><li>1 x Natural Ravine<br></li><li>1 x Ravine End<br></li><li>1 Boiling Pool and Geyser Sector<br></li><li>1 Lava Rent Sector<br></li><li>1 Sulphuric Acid Crystal Cave sector<br></li><li>1 x Dropship Ramp<br></li><li>1 x UFO Hangar Bay<br></li><li>1 x Ore Refinery<br></li><li>1 x Hazardous Waste Storage<br></li><li>1 x Decontamination Sector<br></li><li>1 x Ship Repair Depot<br></li><li>1 Settlement Outpost<br></li><li>1 Garbage Disposal</li></ul><br>Maps are sized specially for FG at 1350x900 and under 500 kb each to help prevent slow-down during play.
