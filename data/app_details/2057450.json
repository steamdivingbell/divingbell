{"about_the_game":"Lilliput's Workshop is a logic puzzle game based on an automated sandbox. If you've played SpaceChem or worked on redstone circuits in MineCraft, then Lilliput's Workshop is also worth a try.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game allows you to assemble a track system using various parts to guide a small train that transports blocks of a specific shape to their destination and complete the task. You can also use the game's built-in level editor to create your own unique levels and share them with players around the world via the internet to challenge their minds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLilliput's Workshop uses a nostalgic, childlike art style. Even if you're not interested in boring logical thinking, we hope you'll experience the same pure fun from this game as you did when you were a child building castles out of blocks.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2057450/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730189390","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2057450/page.bg.jpg?t=1730189390","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2057450/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730189390","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2057450/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730189390","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Lilliput's Workshop is a logic puzzle game based on an automated sandbox.
