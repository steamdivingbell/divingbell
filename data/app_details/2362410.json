{"about_the_game":"&quot;HOLD YOUR BREATH&quot; is a top-down survival game set in a world on the brink of ecological collapse. Air pollution, asteroid impacts, ozone layer depletion, and elevated levels of carbon dioxide have rendered most locations uninhabitable. In this apocalyptic setting, humanitarian crises and socio-political breakdown further aggravate the situation, making survival extremely challenging.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the most unique and perilous challenges in the game is the struggle for access to clean air. Players must find ways to source, purify, and conserve air to avoid suffocation in this toxic environment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA vast world awaits you, ripe for exploration not just for air, but also for other vital resources: food, water, weapons, and armor. Players can follow different narrative paths, from mere survival to interacting with bandits and uncovering the secrets of this devastated world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSurvival is the cornerstone of the gameplay. Players need to adapt to harsh conditions, securing food, water, and shelter while crafting weapons and armor to protect against wild animals, bandits, and other unknown threats.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDanger lurks at every corner in this world. Lack of air, radioactive zones, aggressive creatures, and hostile groups can all lead to your demise. Beyond physical threats, players encounter moral dilemmas that can alter the course of the story and the outcome of their survival.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn &quot;HOLD YOUR BREATH,&quot; players are continually faced with the choice between risk and potential reward. Is it worth venturing into danger for valuable resources? Should you trust strangers? Each decision you make could have long-term implications.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDive into the world of &quot;HOLD YOUR BREATH&quot; if you're ready to confront a reality where every breath could be your last. The choice is yours: fight for every liter of air or succumb and become yet another victim of this ruthless world.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2362410?t=1705856327","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2362410/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1705856327","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2362410/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1705856327","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2362410/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1705856327","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"&quot;HOLD YOUR BREATH&quot; is a top-down survival game set in a world on the brink of ecological collapse.
