{"about_the_game":"<strong>Everlasting Abundance</strong> (the game) is set in a dystopian future where a AAA game company controls everything and pushes its predatory practices like loot boxes and forced gambling into the everyday lives of people. You play as an orphan teenager, and along with your little sister <strong>Kiyoko</strong> and your childhood friend <strong>Mirai</strong>, you will need to break out of your daily routine and join a faction of independent rebels called the <strong>Circle</strong> in order to try to defeat <strong>Everlasting Abundance</strong> (the regime). However, ushering in a new era of freedom isn't as easy as 1-2-3. Conflicts will arise. Tears will be shed. Meat &amp; potatoes will be eaten. And the flowers will grow back... Probably.<br><br>This game is 3 to 4 hours long, has 4 different endings and an original soundtrack (heavily influenced by classic JRPG music).
