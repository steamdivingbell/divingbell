{"about_the_game":"Adventure is calling!  Choose your Mission and a Captain, Crew and Ship.  Take Actions to advance through their story cards.  Actions boost your Action Speed for this run, and completing cards increases it permanently. Once your Action Speed is high enough you will complete Missions, permanently increasing your Maximum Morale. Keep an eye out for positive events that will make the game clock run quicker. You may also invest in your Officers to speed up each run. But taking Actions costs Morale, and once it's depleted, you will experience a Mutiny and start a new run. Just how far will your crew follow you?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Pursue 10 Mission paths to increase your Morale.<br></li><li>Complete 10 Captain, 10 Crew and 10 Ship paths to increase your Action Speed.<br></li><li>Select from 15 different Officers that give passive and active real-time speed bonuses.<br></li><li>Gain permanent advantages each run to go further and faster.<br></li><li>Click Events to speed up your run for certain kinds of Action.<br></li><li>Automate your runs.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Morale</h2>You will start each Mission with a finite amount of Morale. Once you run out of Morale you will experience a Mutiny. Complete Mission levels to increase your base Morale. Mission elements will auto-complete once you reach the necessary Action Speed.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Action Speed</h2>Action Speed is how long a particular kind of Action will take to complete. Taking Actions of this type will temporarily increase this multiplier for the duration of a run. Completing levels of Captain, Crew and Ship cards will permanently increase this multiplier.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Missions</h2>Select a Mission and complete its steps and cards by getting your Action Speed Multipliers high enough to earn permanent increases to your Maximum Morale.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Captain, Crew and Ship</h2>You may choose your Captain, Crew and Ship before each Mission. Choose what would best serve the needs of your Mission in terms of what kinds of Action Speed bonuses they will give. Each level of card will take more Morale to complete, so consider progressing all your cards evenly.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Plan</h2>The Actions you take will be stored and repeated in subsequent runs. You may modify or cancel your Plan at any time, or Cull the actions that are unnecessary for the completion of a card. All actions will be taken in the order listed:  Officers first, then Captain, Crew and Ship by tier until you run out of Morale.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Officers</h2>Your Officers will each give a cumulative 10% bonus to one kind of Action and a passive 10% penalty to another. You can increase this bonus by taking their Officer actions.  If their Events are clicked they will double the speed of their Action type, speeding up your run.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Events</h2>Throughout the game certain positive and negative Events will occur in the Mission area. Clicking on them will cause your game to run faster or slower for one Action type for 60 seconds. Your Officers will influence the Events you receive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mutiny</h2>Once your Morale reaches zero a Mutiny will occur. Choose a new Captain, Crew, Ship and Mission and restart with the permanent Action Speed and Maximum Morale bonuses you have gained from your previous adventures.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Re-spec Tips</h2>As your Action Speeds increase, consider changing out your Captain, Crew and Ship to help you with the changing needs of your Missions.  Remember to choose appropriate supporting Officers.  Also consider switching Missions if your Action Speed bonuses become better suited to completing the requirements of another Mission. All actions previously taken on any card will be remembered when you return to them at a future point.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Completed Fifth Episode","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2610320/6c807ba3aa8f989abe63d51ad6dc3dcb83a2bf58.jpg"},{"name":"Completed Tenth Episode","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2610320/6b7e7116be61e76f085492b8a164947ab418dcec.jpg"},{"name":"Doctor-Captain Starling","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2610320/5327680180ebdaf0626074902a7ada55942fa83e.jpg"},{"name":"Admiral Tyro","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2610320/9f0c5dee37219fd1f3fd11c198d80c0ea412360e.jpg"},{"name":"The Prime Radiance","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2610320/c040563382737a67efb3e3467da5d6485b2c9996.jpg"},{"name":"Harmony Weaver","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2610320/9c074f00b2a4b5a1e1de6908828a2a9e5c94bb37.jpg"},{"name":"Knight-Commander Thistle","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2610320/8c1527f9c0a1eb4012d204020e96e2264bc66d7a.jpg"},{"name":"Ambassador Kingsly","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2610320/4d0b2bb2693407422db0b8bf87027d92d0c8d427.jpg"},{"name":"Captain Cartwright","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2610320/98313f8a13070b4052d45b080c98146c497cbc75.jpg"},{"name":"Director Sjin","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2610320/e4cee6880cf4220a24afd28c4cc773874a010142.jpg"}],"total":53},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2610320/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1722005741","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2610320/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1722005741","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2610320/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1722005741","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2610320/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1722005741","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Adventure is calling!
