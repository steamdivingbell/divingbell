{"about_the_game":"Death Point is a classic stealth-action, which not only should inspire player but also surprise him. It\u2019s an adventure, filled with excitement and empathy.

Character, whom you take under his wing not in the best moment of his life, is alive, and helping him to get out of trouble, you and a mysterious voice in his head will solve the mystery, which turns your little adventure in a thriller. You\u2019ll have to get out of the underground prison cell, walk on the streets of a strange city, get to a ruined cemetery and under ground again before you ascend almost to the sky.
