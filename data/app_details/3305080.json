{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">ONE DAY AT A TIME</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game is about one day in your life. One really bad day. When monsters are released into the world. You have to defeat the 7 deadly sins (the rulers of a place named no rules land). Every hour means a new level. This game includes:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">BASIC CONTROLS: This is a first person game. The controls are wasd to move, space to jump, 'F' for flashlight, and E' to interact. It has a minimal ui, only showing stuff like stamina when running, and the objective progress for some levels.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">HORROR: If it wasnt obvious and you dont use your eyes, this game is a horror game. But because im so cool. There are no jumpscares. I prefer a sense of dread over loud screaming. If you get scared easily then this game might be for you. If you however play horror so much its dull, well then feel free to play my game anyway.\u00a0 I garentee satisfaction or twice your disapointment back.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">FUN GAMEPLAY MECHANICS: Did you know, if you play this game, press all the movement keys and space you explode, try, it is funny. This game is still receiving updates and so it does not have much as of right now but i have some fun stuff planned in the future.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">3 SCARY ATMOSPHERES: As of the intial release of this game, it has 3 levels. Try to stock up on soup cans in the convenience store. Or explore the dangerous ruins of under the city. Or perhaps just take a walk around the neighboorhood. Who knows what lies in these places.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Any bugs or issues please notify me. Be warned as i am very lazy and will probaly take a while to see or fix it.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3305080/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737508821","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3305080/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1737508821","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3305080/b27cdf95ddf7dad42016d4c71284b51fcc9dc7c1/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737508821","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3305080/b27cdf95ddf7dad42016d4c71284b51fcc9dc7c1/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737508821","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">ONE DAY AT A TIME</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game is about one day in your life.
