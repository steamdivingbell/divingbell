{"about_the_game":"In this experimental arena game, capture enemies around you once every ten seconds, and avoid them the rest of the time. The harvested enemies' DNA will fill up a progress bar that, when full, lets you assimilate one enemy, which in turn will upgrade your agent. Weave your way around dangers, maximize captures, and choose wisely which enemies and associated upgrades you want to assimilate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you complete objectives and reach higher scores, you will unlock new enemies, new capacities, and new objectives. The research must go on.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor better accessibility the game features a set of different palettes apart from the original one shown in the screenshots and trailer.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Enzyme","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2341130/7793e192f642327e22079f6a7507bf98069e2d28.jpg"},{"name":"Protein","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2341130/4358b852789493e2ea36355c6cf6efb27b11d50b.jpg"},{"name":"Polymer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2341130/3ed06d06a401208a2e02e6a594eb9fd7a2ddc7dc.jpg"},{"name":"Scavenger","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2341130/f7fd48ad8d6aefcbb0e496a997a362bf1468245c.jpg"},{"name":"Collector","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2341130/783e61ab12e58020b469e14fe1314a2e62dde6f6.jpg"},{"name":"Explorer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2341130/725f3e448c97cd052830a370f9d23ad8822835e9.jpg"},{"name":"Pioneer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2341130/033d6d7a6c0502821a8bb4e038e4d8f73df7b69b.jpg"},{"name":"Ascetic","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2341130/af5803b40ace403cb78742965d91b1cba5cb9c05.jpg"},{"name":"Harvester","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2341130/2111f8eda27c081827a0d7563f645bb0dbc2969f.jpg"},{"name":"King of the Hill","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2341130/748fec4815428d725187270497474430e874e889.jpg"}],"total":10},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2341130/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1711560774","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2341130/page.bg.jpg?t=1711560774","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2341130/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1711560774","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2341130/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1711560774","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In this experimental arena game, capture enemies around you once every ten seconds, and avoid them the rest of the time.
