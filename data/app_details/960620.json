{"about_the_game":"With <strong>Pumpkin Garden House</strong> we would like to introduce you to the wonderful art of the Polish illustrator <strong>Elwira Pawlikowska</strong>. This puzzle box is the first in our special <strong>Halloween Edition</strong> series and will be released during our <strong>Halloween 2018</strong> event. We hope that you will enjoy the fresh and unique art, the challenge, and have a great time building this puzzle in all the available variations.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/960620/extras/banner14.png?t=1603225468\" /><br>Apart from the usual completion achievements, this puzzle box comes with a very special and limited achievement!

The UHD image captures the original illustration in great detail and you will be able to observe even the finest of details exactly as the artist has painted them on the canvas. The puzzle as such is of moderate difficulty, presenting many distinct areas to concentrate upon while also having certain elements that would aim to trick your eye. The border of the illustration will also provide a significant challenge, especially on higher puzzle tilesets, so it might not be the wisest move to start from it.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/960620/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1603225468","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/960620/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1603225468","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/960620/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1603225468","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/960620/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1603225468","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"With <strong>Pumpkin Garden House</strong> we would like to introduce you to the wonderful art of the Polish illustrator <strong>Elwira Pawlikowska</strong>.
