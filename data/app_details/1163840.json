Now the Elder King is growing weak. Imps in his Root Court are offering bounties to track down Hard Ogres, elusive beasts that, according to legend, ripped the last king to pieces. Scattered across the realm, those pieces may still hold the power to change history. But others are vying for influence too.

You'll search for clues far and wide, and you'll also search deep within. The kingdom is brimming with secrets. It's a kingdom that wants you to listen.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">HOW TO PLAY</h2><br><br>Play the game by finding clues for quests throughout the world. Clues exist in dialogue, books, notes, item descriptions, dreams. Everywhere. There are no quest markers or active quest logs. Seek out influential characters and dig into their stories. Use your sword with care, and don't ignore any people or locations. No matter how small something seems, it might hold the key to understanding a bigger mystery. Hardland is a world that reveals itself when you pay attention and piece together its lore.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FEATURES</h2><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Unparalleled Depth</strong> - Explore bustling towns and hamlets across Hardland's open, multi-layered world. Discover remote regions, hidden crannies, and destinations you can only reach by stretching your imagination. Hardland offers tens of hours of playtime with more than a hundred unique NPCs, quests from different factions, and thirteen endings.</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Dreams</strong> - You'll dream every time you sleep at a campfire, but there are deeper dreams to explore too. Find campfires in special locations and pay attention to clues for dream recipes throughout the kingdom.</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Non-Linear Questing</strong> - There's a secret meeting tonight? Maybe you'll go rob graves instead. Or maybe you'll run off to ride a wild boar. Hardland won't force you to follow the story in any order; the game is highly non-linear, with complete freedom to explore at your own pace.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1163840/extras/Steam-Store-GraveRobbing-03.gif?t=1590001424\" /></li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Adventure</strong> - Talk to people. Build trust and relationships. Wear disguises and see things from a new perspective. Pick locks to enter houses, and jump off cliffs with just a measly bird to help you fly. Trade with merchants for gold and items, or sneak up behind them to steal something for free. Take a shovel to dig for treasure, and wield a sword to carve out goblin hearts.
