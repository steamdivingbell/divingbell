{"about_the_game":"<strong>ANNIHILATION</strong> is a solo-developed, arcade survival shooter that takes the beloved genre and adds new perspectives, comedic parody, and some mercantile aspects to uniquely change the formula.<br><br>Combining the chaotic fun of an action roguelike with the rewarding plans and execution of a small treasure-building commerce system, the game provides players with 2 outlets with which to master, balance, or compensate for: pure reflexive skill and cerebral strategy.  Either will aid your advancement, but both will alter the odds in your favor for surviving long enough to die in the final wave...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Overview:</strong></h2>In a world overrun with shadowed zombies, take on the helm of Annihilator and purge the endless horde one block at a time in bloody, 2D combat.  Secure loot to amass munitions and money.  Survive waves to unlock perks and upgrades.  Sell items for immediate currency or lend out supplies for consistent war dividends. Invest in combat development projects to strengthen existing equipment or acquire powerful mechanic-enhancing augments.  But perhaps most importantly, gain the affinity of your personal quartermaiden to alter the game's RNG and lighten your inevitable journey to the end.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2728130/extras/test-store-banner--x2.png?t=1736222897\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Features:</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Engage in bloody 2D side-scrolling combat<br></li><li>Battle through a series of 100 arcade waves: 99 beatable, 1 infinite<br></li><li>Capture resource zones via king-of-the-hill to secure additional cargo loot<br></li><li>Exploit the unique store / bank / and supply loan system to your fullest advantage<br></li><li>Immerse in the tense strategy tug-of-war between short and long term profit / logistics<br></li><li>Unlock 100+ individual perks / upgrades, most with additional enhancing tiers<br></li><li>Invest in over 50 research projects to strengthen your war effort<br></li><li>Develop 20 powerful augments to advance your capabilities<br></li><li>Uncover 15 character helms and starting bonuses to change your runs<br></li><li>Annihilate 12 synergistic enemy types and 3 boss profiles<br></li><li>Wield 7 different weapon classes: each with their own ammunition type and stat variants<br></li><li>Deploy 5 auxiliary devices to round out your destructive arsenal<br></li><li>Unleash 7 special abilities to turn the tide of battle against the horde<br></li><li>Customize your quartermaiden to your preference and unlock her 10 starting blessings<br></li><li>Gain legacy affinity from your best doomed runs and alter the game's RNG in your favor<br></li><li>Master 100+ achievements, each providing additional rewards<br></li><li>Rock out to the game's epic original soundtrack<br></li><li>And enjoy the satisfaction of playing a new video game with no micro-transactions or paid future content</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Satisfying Combat:</strong></h2>From standard weapons to handheld plasma wall generators, every gun has a purpose.  Whether it's to risk your life while saving money on ammunition, or for obliterating an entire screen of zombies along with your wallet\u2014the pros and cons are varied.  But this is your wartorn apocalypse, so you get to manage your loadouts in whatever way matches your style.  And while the rapid autofire of an smg will make your spacebar happy, with a skilled enough manual triggerfinger, even the starting pistol can achieve deadly firerate.  Mix in special abilities, turrets, barricades, grenades, mines, and defensive orbs\u2014and you might start to understand why they only sent you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Compelling Strategy:</strong></h2>Starting off you'll have scarce resources and currency, but don't let that stop you from developing paths to profiteering and stacking the rewards into a small fortune to further fund your war arsenal.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Rewarding Tension:</strong></h2>Should you spend the extra money now on heavier ammo for a safer next wave, or will you instead choose to rely on your proven abilities and use the money to invest for future gain?  In Annihilation, war supplies and currency are your lifeblood just as much as the health bar.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Versatile Customization:</strong></h2>Tired of games not fitting your palette of preference?  In Annihilation, almost every sprite's color can be changed to your liking: from the HUD and menus, environment and projectiles, to the player and enemies\u2014even your quartermaiden.  Now you can finally game to your favorite colorscape or mix things up to match your mood.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Maximum Replayability:</strong></h2>In Annihilation, death is half the fun!  And on top of amassing personal highscore records, every run earns you gems which can be used to unlock greater starting perks, helm options, and sexier outfits for your quartermaiden.  Having trouble advancing?  Keep playing and the challenge will lessen with acquiring stronger bonuses and building up legacy affinity: which governs the likelihood of more legendary drops.  &quot;Beaten&quot; the game once already?  There are 3 possible endings in total\u2014the last 2 requiring specific conditions being met both prior to and during your final stand in Wave 100.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Achievements Worth Achieving:</strong></h2>Game achievements should be more than just icons and text.  That's why in Annihilation, every accomplishment is rewarded with progression gems.  And while these can always be earned through normal gameplay, achievements are a great way to receive large bonus amounts and speed up the process of unlocking further customizations.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Have You Met Vexxi?</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2728130/extras/test-store-anim--x8.gif?t=1736222897\" /><br>Meet your loyal quartermaiden and war intelligence officer.
