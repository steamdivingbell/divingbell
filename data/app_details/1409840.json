The player takes on the role of the ruler responsible for building and bringing to splendor the magnificent Tenochtitlan city-state. This amazing architectural wonder was historically located on an island in the middle of Lake Texcoco. This in itself will represent a technological and economic challenge for the player, who will have to provide food for his people and to maintain a permanent trade connection with the outside world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1409840/extras/Gif2.gif?t=1739825309\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game perfectly combines three different aspects of city management. The player must take care of the economic, military and religious growth of the city-state.
