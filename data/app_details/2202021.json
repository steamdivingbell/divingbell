The specifications for the locomotive called for a micro-processor-equipped 4,000-horsepower unit with HEP (hotel) power that would be both stylish and trim (to ensure the diesel could operate throughout Amtrak\u2019s entire system). To create the pioneering locomotive, General Electric collaborated with its German subsidiary (which provided high-speed bolsterless two-axle trucks and enlisted its time-proven FDL-series 16-cylinder engine to provide the power. Amtrak designer Cesar Vergara created the distinctive design of the potent locomotive.<br><br>In the spring of 1994, 44 Amtrak P40DCs rolled out of GE\u2019s Erie (Pennsylvania) plant wearing Amtrak\u2019s stunning red, blue, and silver Phase III livery. Beginning in 1995, a dual-power sister, the P32AC-DM, was constructed for Amtrak and Metro-North, and in 1996 the first of what would eventually total 228 P42DCs were constructed by GE.
