{"about_the_game":"<strong>Terminal 1</strong> is an airport building and light business tycoon game. Build up cargo, maintenance, and passenger services. Use cafes, restaurants, shops, and other amenities to attract passengers to your terminal. Design your airport for maximum efficiency, considering immigration checks between zones and baggage handling. Add supplementary services, such as: catering, flight checks, cleaning, crew change, and water services. Manage fuel deliveries for optimum revenue. Choose from a variety of upgrades, such as two story buildings that allow passengers to reach aircraft with jet bridges. You'll need to ensure your planes run on time and balance demand and supply. As in modern passenger terminals, balance business costs with sustainable development in an attempt to gain carbon credits and reach net zero.<br><br><strong>Build</strong> - Build the runways, taxiways, aprons, roads, airport buildings, and passenger terminals.   Set security zones and choose where to place check-ins, gates, baggage carousels, restaurants, escalators, and more inside the terminal building.<br><br><strong>Upgrade</strong> - Decide which upgrades are most important and worth investing in for your airport's development. Upgrades may not only change statistics but unlock more game-play considerations.<br><br><strong>Manage </strong> - Airport managers are unable to control or micromanage every detail. Instead choose which global policies are best for the direction of your airport. Do you want to provide power supply units to aircraft if it will take the time of your transporters? Do you want to outsource fuel management or can you profit from fuel sales to aircraft?<br><br><strong>Balance </strong> - Aviation contributes to 2-3% of global carbon emissions. Consequently, sustainability is a major topic in modern airport development and operation. Can you balance the costs of renewable energy, sustainable aviation, and other initiatives to achieve net zero on your carbon credit balance?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3197060/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737161543","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3197060/page.bg.jpg?t=1737161543","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3197060/55e8fa4658ce7672d8f05bd31c4ba0ddce05e3a5/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737161543","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3197060/55e8fa4658ce7672d8f05bd31c4ba0ddce05e3a5/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737161543","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3442930,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<strong>Terminal 1</strong> is an airport building and light business tycoon game.
