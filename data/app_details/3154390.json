The players have no control over movement depth, nor is it a mechanically relevant detail. Player characters all have ranged combat abilities which are used to defeat their opponents in fast paced, precise, tactical combat. Each map the players occupy is composed of platforms, cover, and unique interactable elements that players can use to get an edge on their opponents.</strong></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Destructible Terrain:</strong></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The core feature of Neon Knights that separates it from competing arena shooters is its environmental interactions. Most notably: the environment shifts, breaks, and moves in a realistic manner. These environmental factors also affect the players in unique ways. The design of maps, terrain composition, and how different characters interact with the environment are all factors the player must consider when approaching gameplay and competition.
