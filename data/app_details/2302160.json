The built-in mod management interface allows near-infinite extension of a game. With just a tiny bit of JSON knowledge, it is possible to create and add new cards, recipes, scenarios, locations, and even completely new games. This game is so moddable that it already includes <strong>Stacks:Village</strong>, a fantasy village sim, as a mod - accessible via the top-right corner of the starting screen. See this youtube video for gameplay details. The comprehensive modding manual is a work in progress, please stay tuned.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2302160?t=1733838334","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2302160?t=1733838334","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2302160/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733838334","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2302160/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733838334","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>Stacks:Space</strong> is a space-themed base builder card game with rogue-like elements.
