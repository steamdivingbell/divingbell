For example, a Military ship will have more weapon slots than a Science vessel and a level 2 ship will have more weapon slots than a level 1 ship.  Weapons can be upgraded in the Starbase Shop and added to these slots and then used in real-time space battles.  All weapons use energy generated from the engines.  Some weapons such as laser cannons use much more energy than other weapons.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1882170/extras/shipCombat.png?t=1681775988\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Real-time crew-to-crew combat</h2>When an enemy ship's shields are down and it has been damaged enough, you can board their ship, sending selected crew members over.  The boarding player can loot the boarded player's cargo and bring it back to their ship.  Both players will control individual crew members, and can shoot at each other, injuring or even killing each other.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1882170/extras/crewCombat.png?t=1681775988\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hybrid Permadeath</h2>When your ship is destroyed, there are two options.  You can decide to salvage your ship and recover whatever wasn't looted by pirates or permanently scrap your ship, collecting an insurance payment that you can use to start a new game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Inner-ship Experience</h2>As captain of the ship, you can select crew members and assign them to repair shields, hull plating, and other damages.  Crew members that are injured during an attack can recover in sick bay or you can assign medical officers to heal them.  Throughout the ship there are various crew stations including Navigation, Tactical, Engineering, Medical and Command.  When crew members are assigned to these stations they earn experience in a specific skill.  These skills have a direct impact on how well a ship fairs in battle and solving problems.  For example, if a crew member assigned to a tactical station is a level 2, the player will have a better chance of hitting an enemy during battle than if that same player assigns an officer with level 1 tactical skill to the station.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1882170/extras/crewStationsAndRepairs.png?t=1681775988\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fuel/Power System</h2>Every ship has a certain amount of engine slots. Each slot can hold an engine that will burn fuel and produce energy. This energy will be used to power shields, weapons and other devices. Engines can be upgraded for increased fuel efficiency and power production. In addition to engine slots, each ship has a certain amount of energy cell slots that can be filled to increase a ship's energy storage capacity, thereby allowing ships to recover shields and fire weapons more quickly.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1882170/extras/enginesFuelEnergy.png?t=1681775988\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Starbase Shop</h2>Each galaxy has one or more starbases where you can dock your ship for safety and upgrade your ship's shields, hull plating, weapons, scanners, crew and more.
