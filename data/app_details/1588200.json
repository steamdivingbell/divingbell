Each place hides its own secret and story that you need to uncover.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2>You wake up in your house but everything seems different. While you are traveling in the world, you realize that you are apparently the only person. As you discover and explore places, you realize that you may not be as alone as you thought you were after all. Evil creatures lurk around the dark. Ghosts appear to you and you witness supernatural events. There is only one goal that drives you. You want to know what happened and why you are the only person in this cruel world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Creatures &amp; Ghosts</h2>Being the only person in this world doesn't mean you're the only creature. Evil is waiting for you everywhere, you have to pay close attention to your surroundings and listen for noises in order to move safely through dark forests and deserted places. Any creature and any spirit can mean your death. Always be vigilant while you marvel at the beautiful landscapes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game mechanics</h2>It is easy to get lost in a big world like this, so the player always has access to a map of the world of Caught in Nowhere for assistance. In addition, regardless of the story, you can save anytime and anywhere, as long as there is no creature or ghost around you. You will also discover ways to move faster and more safely through the world. Under certain circumstances, you will die more often. Since you cannot actively fight the creatures or ghosts, you have to be able to either move around cleverly or run fast and be able to hide.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1588200/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1691470202","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1588200/page.bg.jpg?t=1691470202","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1588200/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1691470202","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1588200/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1691470202","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"This game may contain content that is not suitable for all ages or for viewing in the workplace: General Adult Content"},"detailed_description":"<strong>Caught in Nowhere </strong>is a desolate world full of mystery. <br>Waking up in your house, you slowly realize the life around you has disappeared and you are alone.
