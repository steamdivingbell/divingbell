{"about_the_game":"Game JOYDOOR. Joydoor-the main character who got to the world from which he needs to get out. You have to help him get out of this terrible world. In the game you are waiting for opponents who will disturb you-be careful, because you have only 1 life. You need to look for clues (one or more) that are scattered throughout the map to get out of this terrible world. When you find all the keys you need you have to get to the door which is located much further from the keys.  You will find a lot of interesting and confusing levels.Very simple operation, but very interesting story. (The game has such languages as-English, Russian, Italian,German, French. Therefore, it will be easy to understand the game)","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/917800/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1535213239","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/917800/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1535213239","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/917800/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1535213239","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/917800/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1535213239","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Game JOYDOOR.
