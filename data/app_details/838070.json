{"about_the_game":"The Gametrekking Omnibus is a collection of tiny games (and &quot;notgames&quot;) inspired by travel in Asia. <br><br>In 2010, after a successful Kickstarter, I set off to travel Asia on a shoestring budget with a vague plan to create small, experimental games about the things that impacted me along the way. This omnibus, originally released in 2012, and now available on Steam ten years later, is a collection of the games that came out of that journey.<br><br><strong>Note: these games do not present an objective perspective on the countries they depict. Rather, they are subjective reflections on the experiences and histories that impacted a vagabond outsider traveling through these locations--a kind of travel writing made up of interactive sketches.</strong><br><br>The games in this collection represent small, unusual videogames that require no particular gaming skills, and rarely take more than five minutes to play through. They have few clear rules or objectives, and seldom include elements that align with traditional notions of &quot;fun.&quot; Rather, they are games about slowing down and paying attention, being open to unusual experience, encountering the other, and processing response. I often refer to them as &quot;notgames&quot; or &quot;game poems.&quot;<br><br>The Game trekking project has been featured by <i>Wired</i>, <i>PC Gamer</i>, <i>EGM</i>, <i>Le Monde</i>, and others, and even included in <i>The Cambridge History of Travel Writing</i>.
