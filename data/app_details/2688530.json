Challenge the same thing again and again is just not that fun over time.<br>So maybe it's a good idea to try adding more variations to boss battles, while somehow still keep everything balanced.<br>That's why I developed this game. I'll be glad if you like this idea too.<br><br>I'll continuously improve it and add more content.
