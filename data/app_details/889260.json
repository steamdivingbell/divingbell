Far too dangerous for humans, so monkeys will have to do it!<br><br><strong>Bonkies </strong>is a space-monkey simulator where you experience life as a crew of bionic monkeys building the future of humanity among the stars, paid by the hour in bananas. Build moon habitats, rockets and floating space hotels - heck why not a nuclear reactor or two on a lake of frozen methane? Anything is possible when you strap a jetpack on a monkey, equip it with an industrial strength robot arm and wave goodbye to labor rights!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hardcore co-op</h2>Do not be fooled by its cute exterior, Bonkies is the base jumping equivalent of a couch co-op game. A Bonkies assignment will require a dedicated team of tough as nails, true space engineers with unparalleled eye-hand coordination. Unless you choose <strong>Chill mode</strong>, then it becomes more akin to a stroll in the park (if the park was filled with nuclear reactors about to blow, rocket engines spinning out of control and teammates being crushed by several metric tons of construction debris). You will laugh, you will cry, you will assign blame.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Robotic precision</h2>You have full control with our dual stick joystick controls: A minute to learn, a lifetime to master. You will have little to no control with our sorry excuse for keyboard-controls. Precision and speed is the name of the game when you pilot your Bonkie, and if you or a teammate unwittingly tear down the whole structure, guess what?
