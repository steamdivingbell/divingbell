{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">BEING A TEENAGER SUCKS. So we made a videogame about it.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Hey remember when your parents, your friends, and society at large all conspired to make you feel ugly, lazy, stupid, and unloved despite the brilliant human spirit contained within you? No? Well, allow us to refresh your memory via the timeless medium of a slice-of-life role-playing game!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Consume Me, you take on the role of Jenny, young, in love, and entering her final year of high school.

Do chores to get money from mom at a rate much lower than minimum wage! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Can you win the heart of the boy of your dreams? Can you hold on to it? Can you chart a course towards a sustainable future? Can you fit just one more TODO goal on your plate, or is it already full to bursting? Most importantly, does any of this matter--either in the game, or in a broader sense? I don't have time to spoil the story here, so I'll just give you a free tip: if you have the spare money, buy some coffee at the corner store and drink it for an extra free-time unit.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:\u00a0</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>A darkly funny coming-of-age story</strong>: You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll get a little hungry, sometimes all at the same time!
