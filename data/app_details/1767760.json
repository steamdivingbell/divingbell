{"about_the_game":"Tomb Keeper Mansion Deluxe Pinball includes a total of 3 pinball tables. Tomb Keeper Mansion Pinball, Outergalactic Aliens Pinball, and Neon Nights Pinball are all included and can be accessed from the main menu. Please note: There are separate versions of these tables found in \u201cSlot Shots Pinball Ultimate Edition\u201d which includes a slot machine function among several other new and updated features.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTomb Keeper Mansion is a fast paced fantasy themed pinball table featuring eight main missions, four multiplier and extra ball missions, an extra kickback mission, multiball, and a very special coffin shot. There are a total of 17 missions! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTomb Keeper Mansion also has a lower playfield that opens up on a mission activation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures include Steam online leaderboard support, full controller support, and mouse /keyboard support (keyboard uses both S and L keys and Shift keys for flippers). Please Note- There is a known bug with the Unity game engine regarding pressing both shift keys at the same time, which is why we recommend choosing one shift key (right or left) and one other keyboard control for the other flipper. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you currently own Neon Nights Pinball or Outergalactic Aliens Pinball you can uninstall these tables as this bundle includes all 3 and each table can be accessed via the main menu.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOutergalactic Aliens Pinball is an exciting eight flipper pinball table featuring an out of this world space theme! Get ready to listen to a twelve minute original sound track while playing through eight main missions, skill shots, multiball, and one super secret mission that you may never complete! Mwhaha.
