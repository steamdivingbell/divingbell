Join\u00a0Castaway Station\u00a0and embark on an unforgettable adventure to survive and escape from a hostile planet!<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>We took roguelike deckbuilders to a new level in this unique, quest-based survival game. In this deeply narrative-driven game, play two characters as a team, create your own cards, name the beasts you discover, and build decks where cards have limited durability. <br><br><strong>Teamwork is Key</strong><br>You have four characters to choose from, each with their own sets of unique cards and special abilities. Character cards include Teamwork cards that either player can play, and that can work synergistically with the two characters. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396510/extras/image1.png?t=1693240244\" /><br><br><strong>Master the Unique Card Mechanics</strong><br>We\u2019ve introduced some different card mechanics in Castaway Station. In addition to each character\u2019s deck, character cards are also tied to equipment you find, giving you a wide range of customization in battles. These character cards all have a durability mechanic in which a card uses one charge each time you play it. When you play the final charge, the card is depleted and plays twice. You unlock new cards for every 10 cards you deplete.<br><br>We also have a third deck\u2500the Story deck, that offers unique cards based on the encounter, the enemies, the location and even the weather. These cards further expand you choices. Either character can play a Story card. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396510/extras/image2.png?t=1693240244\" /><br><br><strong>Choose Your Quests</strong><br>There are 28 missions that are available to the Castaway Station crew. Some are required to further the narrative. Many are repeatable to grow your strength and assets. You choose missions in the shuttle\u2019s Mission Log. <br><br>In the Shuttle you can also replicate single use items, enhance your equipment, recharge your cards, and\u2026<br><br><strong>Create your Own Cards</strong><br>One of the more unique aspects of Castaway Station is the Synthesizer where you can create your own custom character cards with a wide variety of attack and defense options. These cards don\u2019t use charges and can be some of the most powerful in the game. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396510/extras/image3.png?t=1693240244\" /><br><br><strong>Track the Xenomorphs You Discover</strong><br>As you discover the flora and fauna on Prima Centauri B, you create a Bestiary with details about the xenomorphs and tips for fighting them.
