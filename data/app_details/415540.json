Not a shred of human behavior left in him.<br><br>The man attacked a young girl before he was discovered. He was found...well...gnawing on part of her leg!<br><br>Canis Mysterium is an adventure scenario for the Call of Cthulhu roleplaying system, designed to be played in one or more gaming sessions.
