{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1623830/extras/Ecoplanet_.png?t=1623774136\" /><br><br>Ecoplanet is a tycoon-based eco-simulation game with a variety of opportunities to manage, design and expand your own islands. You are free to place whatever animals, plants and scenic objects you desire. But be warned because every action has a consequence and you wouldn't want your ecosystem to collapse! Work with E.Corp to become an island expert and make your millions.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1623830/extras/Splitter.png?t=1623774136\" /><br><br>You will be working with a company called E.Corp who are your friend when it comes to making money and progressing through the game! You will need to send them your animals to help them out, whether it's for a new exhibit in a zoo or to be used for research. You should assist them as much as possible and make a pretty penny at the same time!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1623830/extras/ecorp.gif?t=1623774136\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1623830/extras/ProcGen.png?t=1623774136\" /><br><br>Procedural/random generation has been implemented in as many ways as possible to increase longevity and replayability of the game! Each island is different, the animals have unique genetics. The missions are procedural and will adapt to your island state, meaning every experience will be different each time you play. Sometimes you might have to start your ecosystem with land animals sometimes it could be ocean animals!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1623830/extras/procgen.gif?t=1623774136\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1623830/extras/Unlocking.png?t=1623774136\" /><br><br>As you get deeper into the game and earn more money, you will be able to unlock many new species of animals and plants! There are various ways that you can do this, the easiest is by completing missions. The next method is animal research, this will cost you but after funding the research of an animal you will be able to unlock and purchase them for the island. Finally, you will get random visitors throughout your time playing Ecoplanet, to get them to stay you must meet their requirements and convince them your island is the best to call their home.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1623830/extras/researchingspecies.gif?t=1623774136\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1623830/extras/Breeding.png?t=1623774136\" /><br><br>Breeding is one of the most important systems implemented in the game, not only will it be necessary to maintain a species but you also have the creative freedom to selectively breed your animals to produce animals with specific traits/genetics. Some of the genetics that you can breed for are below:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Height<br></li><li> Hunger<br></li><li> Speed<br></li><li> Offspring<br></li><li> Reproduction Rate</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1623830/extras/Marine.png?t=1623774136\" /><br><br>Ecosystem designing doesn't stop on the land! There has been an abundance of marine creatures made for life in the ocean! Make sure you learn to build above and below water to maximize your profits whilst creating beautiful islands.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1623830/extras/marinelife.gif?t=1623774136\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1623830/extras/Developers.png?t=1623774136\" /><br><br>Its just me! My name is Brad and i'm the solo developer of Ecoplanet. The idea started in September 2018 but it was designed to be an educational simulation tool as part of my university degree. However after two years of developing, once graduating I decided I wanted to turn it into a commercial game. I have always been a fan of tycoon games ever since I started playing Roller Coaster Tycoon so I have used that as inspiration to fuel the tycoon side of the game, with other inspirations coming from more of my favorite games such as Viva Pinata!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1623830/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1623774136","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1623830/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1623774136","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1623830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1623774136","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1623830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1623774136","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1623830/extras/Ecoplanet_.png?t=1623774136\" /><br><br>Ecoplanet is a tycoon-based eco-simulation game with a variety of opportunities to manage, design and expand your own islands.
