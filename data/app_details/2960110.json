{"about_the_game":"Hello, I hope you enjoy the game... First of all, the game is in Pegi 7 category. In the game, some zombies are not easy to kill, and each weapon has its own unique characteristics. Game has also a leaderboard that you can show your zombie killing skills worldwide. To list the features in general; You can add any picture you want (as a portrait, if possible) to a zombie in the game. You can do this from the Options menu. I thought this would be a fun feature. By the way, responsibility for snapshots resulting from uploading inappropriate images and improper use of them in the electronic environment belongs to the user. Some of the voice acting has also been tweaked to be entertaining. You can find zombies with a radar also. You have basically two types of weapon, one is an automatic assault rifle, and the other one is a gun. Rifle has a wide range however gun is more accurate. You can control the character with the right, left, forward and back keys. You can change your perspective and shoot with the mouse. As you get points, zombies get faster and sometimes they can appear behind you off the radar! Meanwhile, sometimes you may hear sounds, you can ignore them, but sometimes they may actually belong to a zombie coming behind you.<br />\r\nSince this is the first version, I kindly request that you not be too harsh in your criticism :) I tried to create it on my own with limited resources available to me. I have started gathering requests for the second version. I greatly need your valuable support...  I hope you like it.  Thank you very, very much.
