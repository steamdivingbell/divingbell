{"about_the_game":"This game is a unique twist on the classic Tetris-style gameplay. In this game, balls of various colors fall from the top of the screen. Your objective is to connect balls of the same color and make them touch both the left and right walls simultaneously. When this happens, the balls are removed from the screen and you earn points.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe balls obey the laws of physics, rolling and bouncing around the screen in a realistic manner. This adds an extra layer of challenge and unpredictability to the gameplay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the key features of this game is the chain reaction scoring system. If you manage to remove balls in a chain reaction, your score increases tenfold for each consecutive removal. This mechanic encourages strategic play and offers the potential for massive scores.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2933980?t=1713596311","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2933980?t=1713596311","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2933980/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1713596311","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2933980/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1713596311","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This game is a unique twist on the classic Tetris-style gameplay.
