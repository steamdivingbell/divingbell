{"about_the_game":"The \u2018Expedition Units\u2019 pack contains a mix of elite troops and thick winter uniforms. For when the temperature drops you have Gebirgsj\u00e4ger and Alpenkorps alongside regular troops geared up for cold weather, or strike fear into your enemies with elite units like the Royal Bavarian Lifeguards and extra heavily kitted out, grenade laden stormtroopers. There are seven mustaches and beards, two facial items, plus three faces.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is a wide variety of German uniforms included in this pack, from the high ranking Generalmajor and specialist Alpenkorps uniform with skis, to the Royal Bavarian Lifeguards rifleman. For cold weather you\u2019ll find wind jackets, great coats and balaclavas to make sure every class can dress for battle in freezing conditions! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHeadgear includes the unusual \u201cStirnpanzer\u201d helmets with extra armor plate, a stahlhelm hastily camouflaged with clay, and the distinctive (and antiquated) \u201cPickelhaube\u201d! Many helmets include options with balaclavas, goggles, or other details appropriate for winter warfare. For those with a passion for fashion - but not necessarily practicality - the German staff officer Picklehaube offers a masterclass in military splendor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA variety of facial hair is included, with two mustaches depicting the famous Generals August Von Mackensen and Paul Von Hindenburg, and a third portraying the infamous fictional Corporal Himmelstoss from the silver screen. Four beards are inspired by notable German scientists, including your favorite mathematician Bernhard Riemann, and Heinrich Hertz who had the unit of frequency named after him! From a well-kempt straight beard, to thick stubble, to a magnificent neckbeard, show your love for science. There are also two facial items with broken glasses, if you\u2019ve been in serious combat between pondering theorems.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2214671/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727166359","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2214671/page.bg.jpg?t=1727166359","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2214671/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727166359","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2214671/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727166359","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence or Gore, General Mature Content.\r\nGore and blood can be disabled completely with an in-game setting.\r\n"},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"The \u2018Expedition Units\u2019 pack contains a mix of elite troops and thick winter uniforms.
