{"about_the_game":"Time is no more, your world is frozen in a perpetual agony a moment before its end. You wake up in this desolate land, where most of the inhabitants are consumed by the Oblivion. An affliction that gradually erases their memories and personalities, turning them into empty shells, eternally condemned to wander aimlessly. It is up to you to meet the challenges of this world and find the origin of this apocalypse and, perhaps, bring it to an end. <br><br>You are the last adventurer in this land devastated by the end of the world and oblivion. Armed with a gauntlet that allows you to manipulate the continuum, an energy that permeates your entire world, you must find the origin of the end of time. Before the Last Hour is a roguelike, offering both rpg and deck builder components. Explore the wastelands, defeat ever more powerful and epic enemies to finally give your world the ending it has been waiting for. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1948290/extras/hand_crafted_rogue_like.jpg?t=1652891311\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Items, combos and bosses</h2><strong>Explore and equip yourself</strong> - Find and combine over 100 unique items to choose from to create a unique and powerful build.
