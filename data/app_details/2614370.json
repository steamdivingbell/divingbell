Armed with little more than your wits and an aging RV, it's your mission to endure and conquer the relentless zombie hordes while transforming your mobile home into an impervious fortress. Build a bunker under your RV to serve as your last resort refuge. Here, you can cultivate essential crops and create a true home for yourself. As you dig deeper, you might uncover hidden treasures and resources vital for future constructions. Construct multiple types of traps above the ground, but most importantly, combine them into deadly chains. With your creativity, you can connect traps of different kinds into one grand trap system. Gasoline, fire, air, tar, electricity, water... Do you already have a good recipe in mind? And when you use up all the available local resources, embark on missions that will help you stay alive even longer.
