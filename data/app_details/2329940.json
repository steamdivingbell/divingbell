{"about_the_game":"In Tyrium you will build a base with multiple buildings and collect Tyrium, a mineral that gets converted to credits in a refinery building. To collect it, you will build collector units.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe goal is to build up an army of vehicles like tanks, rocket launchers, aircraft and infantry units. With this army, you will attack the enemy base to secure map control. The game is won when the enemy headquarters or all enemy units are destroyed.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the moment, we have 5 buildings and 8 units available, some of which can be upgraded to unlock better units. The game currently features one map, with plans to add much more in the future. We also plan to add more game modes like base defense, where you must defend against enemy waves, and another playable faction with more units and buildings. There is no multiplayer mode yet, but we're looking into adding it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe would love to hear your feedback and suggestions as we continue to develop the game.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollow our devlog for updates.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2329940/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1683668363","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2329940/page.bg.jpg?t=1683668363","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2329940/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1683668363","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2329940/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1683668363","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In Tyrium you will build a base with multiple buildings and collect Tyrium, a mineral that gets converted to credits in a refinery building.
