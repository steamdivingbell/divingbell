{"about_the_game":"Cornucopia is the story of Luna, Xylia, Jasper, and K.A.M. - a ragtag group of amateur security guards in charge of defending the Starship Cornucopia. When its artificial gravity gets suddenly disabled, it's up to the four to solve the problem and save its passengers from a mysterious threat.<br />\r\nIt's also an all-new release for the Gameboy Advance! Hot off the heels of my last title, Tremblay Island, this title will be a full release, compatible with every GBA on the market, as well as (of course) emulators. On top of that, expect the following:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n50+ levels with 3 playable characters!<br />\r\nFully animated cutscenes!<br />\r\nAll-new original soundtrack (that I'll be putting on Spotify, of course!)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBest of all, the game and the source code are free... and always will be! I'll be hosting the source code up on GitHub for anyone to learn how to make their own GBA game, and I'll never charge money for the final release.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThanks to Madelyn Watts for giving me the idea for and designing the characters!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2260950/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1674238275","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2260950/page.bg.jpg?t=1674238275","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2260950/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1674238275","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2260950/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1674238275","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Cornucopia is the story of Luna, Xylia, Jasper, and K.A.M. - a ragtag group of amateur security guards in charge of defending the Starship Cornucopia.
