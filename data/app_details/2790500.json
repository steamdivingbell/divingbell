The magical wisps look small at first, but they can fuse together to create a much more agile form! Also on this floor is the blaster wolf, a pet you can tame with magical fruit you find. <br></li><li><strong>Spider Nest</strong> - A boss floor that is inhabited by numerous spiders, most notably the Spider Queen! She's a ginormous beast that will follow you and make sure you pay the price. Cocoons full of baby spiders are also present here. <br></li><li><strong>Spectral Sanctum</strong> - A boss floor that is ruled by the Elder Gargoyle. A fancier version of the library, this floor lets the Elder show off his abilities, like creating the wisps! Stop the mastermind behind it all. Or is it just an illusion..?<br></li><li><strong>Treasure Floor</strong> - Take a it easy with a treasure break! Grab as much as you can, and there's no time limit so take your time. The shopkeeper is common here so spend your treasures on some goodies!<br></li><li><strong>Bonus Room</strong> - This extra room can be found from a treasure exit or by using a magical warp flute item.
