{"about_the_game":"Please note: This is NOT the final version of the Character Editor!<br><br>This is &quot;Version 1&quot;, a somewhat simplified and basic version that does not have all the features enabled. While we were polishing our Makeup and Tattoo systems, we discovered a brand new asset on the Unreal Engine marketplace specifically for converting Daz3D textures for use in UE. The product is amazing, and we will definitely be integrating parts of it into our own material systems. But this will take time. Rather than delaying the release of the CE demo, we decided to release a &quot;basic&quot; version now, with certain features disabled, and then release the updated full version sometime later.<br><br>This current version allows you to change your Body Type, Genitalia Type, and test out the hundreds of advanced shaping options. The full version, which we'll release later, will include all the features related to materials, such as - Skin Texture/Color, Eye Texture/Color, Hair Color, a few Clothing options (with Texture/Color settings), Nail Color (and possibly Texture), and other minor things.<br><br>For now, please play around with the huge amount of advanced shaping options.

We want to see how this demo performs on various PC specs without any optimizations, so we can get a rough idea of how much optimization we'll need to do in the future.
