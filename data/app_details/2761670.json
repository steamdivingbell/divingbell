{"about_the_game":"&quot;Sinister Night 2&quot; draws heavy inspiration from the classic horror film &quot;The Thing&quot; and traditional Chinese culture. This sequel masterfully blends the tense atmosphere of social deduction with the enigmatic allure of Chinese horror. In this haunting exploration of an ancient Chinese mansion, players assume the role of a streamer participating in what seems to be a conventional reality show, unaware that tragedy has already struck \u2014 two members have been possessed by the spirit of a bride from a ghost marriage. With the onset of the crimson nightmare and the revival of the ghost marriage ritual, fear and despair start to spread. Players must find offerings that can appease the restless spirits or expose the possessed among them to avoid the vengeful wrath of the wronged souls from the afterworld.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Breaking the routine of Social Deduction Game</h2>Ditching the traditional role assignments of games like Werewolf, this game provides a more open-ended environment. The use of items, task completion, location information, and voting all serve as vital clues in solving the mystery. Players must adjust their strategy flexibly based on the situation at hand.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Eerie Expedition in an Ancient Chinese Mansion</h2>This abandoned Chinese traditional architecture was once the site of a tragic ghost marriage ceremony where a family met an unfortunate fate. Now, a group of brave streamers ventures into this place only to find themselves seemingly transported back to that sinister night. Inside the mansion, red lanterns hang high, food still warm, and the spirits of those who perished in the tragedy seem to still wander within its walls.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Thrilling Slaughter Fest</h2>When the &quot;Crimson Dream&quot; descends, a ghost marriage ritual fueled by resentment returns to the mortal realm. Possessed individuals transform into the bride of the marriage, bringing endless terror and revenge. As players struggle to survive, they must also collect clues and identify the true culprit to avoid becoming the next victim.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Complex Strategic Gameplay</h2>Players have an array of tactics at their disposal, such as placing Zhong Kui statues to ward off evil, injecting adrenaline to speed up their escape, or using night vision goggles, crows, or compasses to uncover more clues. However, remember that the teammate who is overly enthusiastic and constantly waving an EMF detector might be the cunning mastermind in disguise.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Here's Dead Wife!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2761670/579bd3e17098815c296cffaf05bd3630b62a290c.jpg"},{"name":"Treat?Trick!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2761670/e4b882e61ac34980498b8e55a29c0b7caa954d5c.jpg"},{"name":"Taste Blood!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2761670/82f9a3f9f7e5a2003853766ba56a631190768837.jpg"},{"name":"Kill Out","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2761670/075692028c0782e0893fdce9cc8d6979957f49c3.jpg"},{"name":"Beyond Dispute","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2761670/d25ce845716bff7f83ab3dfffca0de3db1274ffe.jpg"},{"name":"Tied","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2761670/f84e7adfb5ed6d35a26f41b98858a8c1fd9c2862.jpg"},{"name":"I voted\uff01","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2761670/2bddb31eec9142b21f75b751a2f9b9345f2f0119.jpg"},{"name":"See the light again","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2761670/6133720947d792a626a91af8660402a17e66de89.jpg"},{"name":"The Last Supper","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2761670/86e3933d58617cf08bf635b48f17d08946f561ec.jpg"},{"name":"Conversion","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2761670/b3b4fe1ddd1b7bb291dc84099ad661a5e0baebe0.jpg"}],"total":22},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2761670?t=1739461828","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2761670/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1739461828","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2761670/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739461828","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2761670/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739461828","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;Sinister Night 2&quot; draws heavy inspiration from the classic horror film &quot;The Thing&quot; and traditional Chinese culture.
