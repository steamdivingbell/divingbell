It's been so long since we have been allowed to have fun and decide for ourselves how we want the game to unfold. Grimoire really knows how to let the player create their own narrative, without having some message forced on them while they wander on rails.\u201d<br>&quot;Great&quot; \u2013 Matt Chat (Youtube Channel)<br><br>\u201cPure Incline!. The best 1st person, party based RPG in at least 15 years, without a doubt. If you loved Wizardry 6 &amp; 7 and are looking for more, this is it. Lots of story, puzzles, stats, complex combat, huge gameworld, recruitable npcs, lock picking. Wide variety of spells, items, monsters. Some crafting/alchemy, with a lot more coming in a future patch. NPC factions and multiple solutions to most goals. There haven't been any blobbers with this level of detail in a very long time and there likely won't be for an even longer time to come. Easily worth the money for anyone who enjoys this kind of game.\u201d<br>10/10 \u2013 Metacritic
