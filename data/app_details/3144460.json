{"about_the_game":"Ignifugo is a top-down action roguelite with auto battler elements. Choose your own path through five biomes with procedurally generated maps as you control a combat shell with slots for placing units. Units are the primary way of attacking and trigger their abilities automatically while you maneuver the character to avoid incoming hits. Strategically place units in the shell, as each one is damaged individually and can break, leaving it unusable until the next level. Once all units break your shell shatters and reveals the core \u2013 a second playable character which does not have access to unit abilities anymore.<br><br>Borrowing from the auto-battler genre, each unit has their own abilities, belongs to a set of classes and can be leveled to gain health and additional abilities. Having multiple units of one class in your shell unlocks class bonuses. As you fight through different biomes you earn currency which can be spent on buying/ upgrading units and different kinds of items. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3144460/extras/ModifyShell2.gif?t=1736241543\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3144460/extras/About_Banner_Key_Feature_Overview.png?t=1736241543\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li> Unique blend of action gameplay and strategic shell modification<br>    </li><li> Hand drawn vector art style<br>    </li><li> Banging synthwave soundtrack<br>    </li><li> Gameplay forward - action without a ton of dialog (simple story told through environment)<br>    </li><li> Shell and core system \u2013 shell regenerates between fights, the core does not<br>    </li><li> HEAT LEVEL system - actions during a run dynamically change the difficulty<br>    </li><li> Incandescence - beating a run with a shell unlocks the next difficulty level<br>    </li><li> 60+ Units with two unique abilities each<br>    </li><li> 11 Unit classes with up to 3 tiers of class bonuses each<br>    </li><li> 5+ Unlockable shell types (= playable characters) with different attributes and visuals<br>    </li><li> 80+ Passive items with unique effects<br>    </li><li> 27+ Consumable items<br>    </li><li> 7+ Melee weapons<br>    </li><li> 9+ Active abilities<br>    </li><li> 60+ Enemy types and bosses<br>    </li><li> 5 Biomes with procedurally generated maps and levels<br>    </li><li> 15+ Steam achievements to unlock<br>    </li><li> <strong>1 Developer pouring a lot of love into the game</strong></li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3144460/extras/About_Banner_Items_and_Rewards.png?t=1736241543\" /><br><br>Over 120 items can be earned and bought as rewards from elites, bosses and certain map encounters.
