{"about_the_game":"Asteroid Deflector is an indie game based on simple physics. You have to prevent asteroids from hitting a planet by changing their trajectory with various projectiles (shells, laser beams, atomics...) while working with - or against - the gravity of the planet and the sun of this solar system. Whilde doing that, you have to take care of weapon research, the planets economy and population.<br><br>This is my first game done in spare time. Expect some hours of fun and a good laugh at the goofy story. There is also an endless game mode to hunt for high scores. Please don't expect a refined, multimillion dollar blockbuster game. I'm always open to suggestions and improvements.<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br>- Career mode with 12 levels.<br>- Endless mode.<br>- 23 technologies for research, including four distinctive weapons and a mighty planetary force field.<br>- Manage money, infrastructure, population and keep the people motivated.<br>- Seven (YouTube friendly) spherical songs will help you get in the flow of deflecting asteroids.<br>- Atmospheric sound effects.<br>- Special endgame in story mode (maybe there is more to the asteroids...).<br><br><strong>Gameplay</strong><br>- Simple physics-based fun.<br>- Don't destroy the asteroids (lame), deflect them!<br>- Asteroids burning up in the star generate money (because... why not?).<br>- Expensive research will improve your weapons.<br>- Impacts on the planet will decimate the population and their moral (may result in losing the game).<br>- After a first learning curve, the gameplay can get quite hypnotic or meditative.<br>- Unlimited continues in career mode, saves are done after each level.<br>- It's all about gravity, mass and kinetic energy - but in a fun way!<br><br><strong>FAQ</strong><br>* Are there costly ingame purchases or will there be expensive DLC?<br>- No ingame purchases, it's the full game. <br>* Is this a mobile port?<br>- No, but I may port it to mobile (and remove some features in the base version with the &quot;XL&quot; in the name, in case you were wondering).<br>* A space cannon would never work!!!<br>- First of all - it's just a game. And you may be up for a surprise, if you do some research on &quot;Project HARP&quot;. Also keep in mind: the mass of planets differs a lot and so do escape velocities.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Score 100","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/818830/0e5c389c82f43ed994e0a87bb9671a29fdff0b2b.jpg"},{"name":"Score 500","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/818830/f768be5b23659ad2bd8b72f8c669b26e02792057.jpg"},{"name":"Score 1,000","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/818830/ac6f284c483c9cb69b7f87341aebdd51147576dd.jpg"},{"name":"Score 2,000","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/818830/7a6ee0f1a46b764318ebc734d213bb8f56927545.jpg"},{"name":"Score 5,000","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/818830/b83d0d1b2d6d4e6e7b9ee906f09b84dfc0532f26.jpg"},{"name":"Score 10,000","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/818830/81dd82998beb5f1edefc411ad6ffc44b50e5373c.jpg"},{"name":"Score 100,000","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/818830/0b0aa71d4119258ab7bf3884c8dbcd03bf9e6658.jpg"},{"name":"Campaign complete!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/818830/ae6e33157f8c6b29e2ce464bf6a36790ec8163d8.jpg"},{"name":"An unexpected turn","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/818830/db038cebcf51274cabcd30c7da83641c234d7de0.jpg"},{"name":"Moral desaster","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/818830/da96da4e54bd9499bdf780d7767e8f24bfe6b524.jpg"}],"total":13},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/818830/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1586414164","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/818830/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1586414164","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/818830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1586414164","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/818830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1586414164","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Asteroid Deflector is an indie game based on simple physics.
