Click here for the Studio One Sessions!<br><br>Throughout 34 \u2018Drum Sessions\u2019 across a wide range of tempos, Simon Phillips turns in a dynamic performance across a variety of rock styles from Brit hard rock to Texas blues. Each \u2018Drum Session\u2019 contains all the parts you\u2019ll need to create your song (Verse, Chorus, Fills etc). Simply choose a drum session that matches your tempo and feel, then drag and drop the parts into your sequencer software and arrange as you like to create professional drum tracks in seconds.

For more control - and to create your own custom drum mixes - we recommend the matching Multi-Track libraries, enabling you to add effects and EQ to the individual drum tracks. Either way, they\u2019re simple to use, and sound fantastic.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/305336/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1511590850","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/305336/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1511590850","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/305336/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1511590850","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/305336/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1511590850","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>All content included is royalty-free</strong><br><br>Chock full of essential loops to form the building blocks of your rock songs, Session Tracks features master drummer Simon Phillips (The Who, Jeff Beck, Joe Satriani, Mick Jagger, Toto etc.) laying down groove after groove, inspired by some of rock\u2019s greatest moments, from AC/DC to Led Zeppelin to ZZ Top.
