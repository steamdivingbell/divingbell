Especially those who can get used to traditional business simulations should take a closer look at the game because its style and gameplay are reminiscent of classic mixup of the genre. Something that impressed me deeply was the size of the game, because nearly 300 MB are not even a patch for today's standards and yet everything is there what you need to deliver entertaining and long-lasting fun. Other developers can take an example. So if you like economic simulations and have a weakness for the fire brigade, police and rescue, you will be served properly and rewarded with many entertaining hours.\u201d<br>4.2 / 5.0 \u2013 <br><br>7 / 10 \u2013 <br><br>\u201cRescue HQ \u2013 The Tycoon is a good simulation strategy game. I was curious how well a game where you run a police department, fire department, and ambulance service at the same time would work. I was pleasantly surprised that it worked quite a bit better than I expected. Basically the objective of the game is to build up your headquarters with new equipment while hiring and training your staff. You then send them out to emergencies in order to earn money and reputation to grow your headquarters. Anyone who has played one of these type of games before should have a good idea of what to expect. The reason that Rescue HQ \u2013 The Tycoon works so well is that it does a good job streamlining the mechanics making it easy to build the headquarters you desire. I had a lot of fun playing the game and fans of this genre should as well.\u201d<br>4 / 5 \u2013
