There are a lot of bad endings you can run into, but that made getting to the Good End all the more satisfying.\u201d<br />\r\n(J.A. Niigata, Japan)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cA rather difficult game with many choices that make replaying it worth it. The game also manages to create a sense of horror that you'd only find in 2D.\u201d<br />\r\n(H.T. Tokyo, Japan)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cSound production in the Mansion was intensely well done. The audio really brings out the stillness of the Mansion and amplify the presence of the unseen creature.\u201d<br />\r\n(S.S.
