{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1060180/extras/q4.png?t=1580608925\" /><br><br>Hello, I am a personal developer who develops the games I want to achieve by continually learning programming knowledge. When I noticed that there were many games of infinite flight type, I suddenly thought: &quot;Hey! This type of game is very suitable for Cyberpunk!&quot; So this game was born. In 'Cyber Driver' you will play as a taxi driver, flying and picking up guests in an infinite city full of cyber atmosphere. Please expect 'Cyber Driver' to be a small, cyber-style arcade flight game that can switch from the first person perspective. It's fast, easy, tight, and repeatable, with elements of collection and challenges. Your only goal in the game is to constantly break the scores you have created before in the unique cyber atmosphere.
