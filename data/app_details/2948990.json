{"about_the_game":"Initial Story<br />\r\nIn the 80s, our hero, a young man named Bruno, lives an apparently ordinary life in his small town. One beautiful day, while playing with his friends and kicking the ball into the attic window of his house, Bruno goes in search of his ball. Upon entering the attic to look for his ball, Bruno discovers an ancient artifact with a bright glow. Upon touching the object, he is suddenly enveloped by a strange aura, fainting shortly afterward. As night falls and he begins to sleep, he is haunted by intense and recurring nightmares. Every night, as he falls asleep, he is transported to a dark and disturbing realm where he faces his deepest fears. In the most recent nightmare, he finds himself in an unfamiliar room, and the only way out is a strange door. Upon crossing it, he enters a cycle of nightmares that seems endless, where he sees no way out other than facing his worst fears.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\nPixel art and animations<br />\r\nAction-packed gameplay, focusing on melee combat combos, dodging enemy attacks, and shooting arrows against opponents and casting spells<br />\r\nIntense and mind-bending boss battles<br />\r\nExtensive exploration of a narrative-rich world and atmosphere","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2948990/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1713565694","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2948990/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1713565694","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2948990/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1713565694","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2948990/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1713565694","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Initial Story<br />\r\nIn the 80s, our hero, a young man named Bruno, lives an apparently ordinary life in his small town.
