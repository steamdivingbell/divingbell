{"about_the_game":"Within The Vault is an action packed isometric roguelite with a heavy influence from classic film noire. Play as The Fixer for the mafia as he descends into The Vault, a maze of weapons and the family's secrets, for one last job straight from The Boss himself. Up until recently, The Fixer's job was simply to get into The Vault, grab whatever weapons were needed for a contract, and get out. But with those same weapons walking around and an ominous rumbling from deep within The Vault, it looks like his job's become a whole lot less simple.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game features striking visuals, hand drawn to fit the shadowy aesthetic of the world's mafia, with big band inspired music driving you through the action. Enjoy a story unfolding through multiple runs, with dynamic dialogue that reacts to your journey to immerse you in the cast of characters. Procedurally generated levels, random weapon spawns, and in-run upgrades mean each run feels fresh, and with permanent upgrades unlockable at The Hideout, you're never leaving The Vault empty handed.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3020480?t=1717635997","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3020480/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1717635997","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3020480/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1717635997","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3020480/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1717635997","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Within The Vault is an action packed isometric roguelite with a heavy influence from classic film noire.
