{"about_the_game":"<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2991400/extras/Himegashima_Island_Description_1_EN.png?t=1729091090\" /><br>Under the pretense of receiving training to become the head of the Kinusato family, Kokomi is sent to stay with his relatives on Himegashima. However, his cousin Asuka demands that he enjoy his summer on the island and make lots of happy memories. Having grown up sheltered, there's a whole new world of things for Kokomi to experience. The hot midsummer sun and the cries of cicadas everywhere... The gentle waves crashing against the shore and the bustle of restaurants on a busy night... Kokomi will experience all Himegashima has to offer and more during his short time there.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2991400/extras/Himegashima_Island_Description_2_EN.png?t=1729091090\" /><br>Explore the gorgeous island of Himegashima and earn Good Boy Points to unlock new privileges by helping its residents. Whether it be unlocking new locations such as a hair-raising swamp or getting to hang out with your friends, no good deed goes unrewarded! Of course, it wouldn't be much of a summer without plenty of outdoor activities to participate in. Collect fish and insects to fill out your field guides, then use those insects in heated bug-fighting matches! Just be forewarned, there's quite a bit more depth and complexity to raising the perfect warrior than meets the eye. You'll have to manage your bonds with your bugs, acquire and combine bug skills to give you an edge in battle, and even let bugs past their prime go in order to transfer some of their power to your future champions. If this all sounds daunting, don't worry! A quick trip to Kakeru Dojo will teach you all the ins and outs of bug fighting and have you raising an undefeatable army in no time!<br><br>As if that isn't exciting enough on its own, these are but a select few of the many activities Himegashima has to offer! Create as many memories as you can and do everything in your power to make this the best summer ever!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2991400/extras/Himegashima_Island_Description_3_EN.png?t=1729091090\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2991400/extras/Himegashima_Island_Description_01_EN.png?t=1729091090\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2991400/extras/Himegashima_Island_Description_02_EN.png?t=1729091090\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2991400/extras/Himegashima_Island_Description_03_EN.png?t=1729091090\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2991400/extras/Himegashima_Island_Description_04_EN.png?t=1729091090\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2991400/extras/Himegashima_Island_Description_05_EN.png?t=1729091090\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2991400/extras/Himegashima_Island_Description_4_EN.png?t=1729091090\" /><br><strong>Minigames</strong><br>Enjoy various minigames such as rock paper scissors, treasure hunting, fishing, and bug fighting.
