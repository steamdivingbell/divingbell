{"about_the_game":"Welcome to the sinister world of A Murder of Crows, a horror game that will take you to an eerie forest. Your mission is to find five mysterious crows in this nightmarish environment and uncover a dark secret that terrifies the forest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou'll take on the role of a brave explorer who is fascinated by the stories about the eerie disappearances in this forest. Your journey begins at an abandoned, dilapidated entrance gate shrouded in swirling mist. The gate creaks ominously as you slowly open it and venture into the darkness.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe forest welcomes you with an eerie silence. The cracking of branches beneath your feet echoes through the trees, while the wind carries mysterious whispering voices. Your only ally is a flashlight, which gives you limited light in the pitch black night. The outlines of the trees seem threatening and eerie shadows lurk around every corner.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you advance deeper into the forest, you keep encountering disturbing signs. Gruesome symbols are carved into the bark of the trees, and the remains of abandoned campfires bear witness to past events. Ominous sounds make you freeze while you try to orient yourself on your way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSuddenly you hear the fleeting flutter of wings and the shrill cawing of crows. You follow the sounds and discover a weathered map with the positions of the five crows marked on it. They are the key to solving the mystery of the forest and the only way to survive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour search for the crows will take you through deeper and deeper realms of horror. You will be pursued by eerie creatures that emerge from the shadows and seek your life. They are creatures that are alienated from human nature and strive only for darkness and fear. You must be skilled and sharpen your senses to escape them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe crows themselves are not easy to find. They are masters of camouflage and have hidden in the darkest and most inaccessible places in the forest. You'll have to solve puzzles, overcome traps and fight your way through dangerous environments to discover them. Each crow you find will bring you closer to the mystery of the forest and reveal another layer of terror.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2474140/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1709750146","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2474140/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1709750146","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2474140/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1709750146","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2474140/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1709750146","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to the sinister world of A Murder of Crows, a horror game that will take you to an eerie forest.
