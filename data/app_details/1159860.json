You will be swapping paint and speeding through laps on a selection of unique tracks packed with obstacles and hidden shortcuts. Use either two-handed melee weapons to whack other players or sneakily shoot down their karts, all while trying to cross the finish line in first place.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159860/extras/next_level_D.gif?t=1667500070\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Wide Range Of Control Options</h2>Enjoy a next-level racing experience with Super Immersive control. You can grab the wheel in one hand and a weapon in the other, or even wield two weapons at the same time! Steering Wheel Support steps up the immersion factor with force feedback, letting you feel every bump, turn, and obstacle. If your hand gets tired from smashing opponents we also have a simpler Rest Mode control option for casual play and a great way to play in tight space.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159860/extras/wide_range_gif_C.gif?t=1667500070\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Full hand Weapons &amp; Power-ups</h2>From machine guns to frying pans, Dash Dash World has an awesome selection of weapons that you can use to get ahead of the competition. But it is not so straightforward with counterplay, where you can blind your opponents with Face Blaster as well as their minions such as Angry Crimson and more. Nothing is certain until you reach that finish line.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159860/extras/full_hand_weapon_B.jpg?t=1667500070\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Step into the World Of Speed</h2>Racers can drift around tight corners and charge their nitro and boost chain to reach max speeds during those tight finish line sprints. Pro players can use drafting to increase their speed sticking closely behind your competitors, gaining a slipstream effect. Better yet, use your speed off big ramps to start gliding over those spectacular views and clench a victorious landing.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159860/extras/step_intotheworld_of_speed_gif_C.gif?t=1667500070\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Racing Modes For Everyone</h2>Dash Dash World is great for players of all skill levels. There is a great variety of modes to choose from, including casual matches, a pro challenge, boss fights, and online tournaments! If you want to take things a step further and prove that you own the road, tune-up your engine and turn on the Pro Racing mode. Every obstacle and shortcut will never feel so intimidatingly refreshing.<br><br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159860/extras/story.jpg?t=1667500070\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Thrilling Racing Journey</h2>Get your ride ready and go on an adventure in the single-player, open-ended Story mode. You can take on over 100 challenges from tons of cool characters, learning more about them along the way. Make no mistake about it, this storyline has more twists and turns than a Nolan movie! Complete this mode and you will turn into a Dash Dash pro in no time.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1159860/extras/thrilling_racing_journey_C.jpg?t=1667500070\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ambitious Online Experiences</h2>During our beta period, we hosted over 10,000 matches.
