The Celtic society, a complex tapestry of different religions, human cultures, and mortal and immortal races such as the Mourians, Werewolves, Goblins, and monsters threaten to tear at every seam. Will you support the immature, yet rightful, heir, or the pragmatic general in their bid for the throne? What alliances will you forge, what friendships will you foster, what romances will you pursue, and... what will you do when you are suddenly thrust into Medieval Spain?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EXPLORE TWO ERAS</h2>Things look pretty different in Galicia under Christianity than it did under Celtic rule. Magic is fading, religion is everywhere, and much has changed. Where are your immortal allies now, and what has become of the souls of your mortal friends?
