As all the Nancy Drew games, Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon is targeted to mystery fans ages 10 to adult. It is worth noting that this is the kind of game that can be particularly enjoyable to play with other people. You can have a wonderful time discovering the mystery with a friend or family member. Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon can be easily recommended to adventure and mystery fans.\u201d<br>Adventure Lantern<br><br>\u201cThese puzzles are varied, logical, and make sense in the train\u2019s historical context, and there is something simply enjoyable about investigating the different characters and piecing together clues to the mystery of both Lori Girard\u2019s disappearance and Jake\u2019s old mine. Although more could have been made to involve them in the investigation, the introduction of the Hardy Boys is also a nice reward for longtime Nancy Drew fans.\u201d<br>Adventure Gamers<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31810/ss_04ca9247b3f33d5a066baa36baf43bcd7aa58662.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734461898","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31810/ss_04ca9247b3f33d5a066baa36baf43bcd7aa58662.600x338.jpg?t=1734461898"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31810/ss_bd1036bc58eb1b0344078e8b76d2ad7da84c2638.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734461898","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31810/ss_bd1036bc58eb1b0344078e8b76d2ad7da84c2638.600x338.jpg?t=1734461898"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31810/ss_f268f32ade6c674e549d3f9054e5dc32d209d72b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734461898","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31810/ss_f268f32ade6c674e549d3f9054e5dc32d209d72b.600x338.jpg?t=1734461898"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31810/ss_0800836f156ba5b82100b5ea30f0860556278f5d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734461898","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31810/ss_0800836f156ba5b82100b5ea30f0860556278f5d.600x338.jpg?t=1734461898"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31810/ss_1a86083ace99fb4ba2e4adf351634606b69ddee4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734461898","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31810/ss_1a86083ace99fb4ba2e4adf351634606b69ddee4.600x338.jpg?t=1734461898"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31810/ss_92f6d7f08b7e6c0e9df0db8156226b07f065df44.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734461898","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31810/ss_92f6d7f08b7e6c0e9df0db8156226b07f065df44.600x338.jpg?t=1734461898"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31810/ss_29ef319fbb1ba739f9094ecc762fa03afb96aad9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734461898","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31810/ss_29ef319fbb1ba739f9094ecc762fa03afb96aad9.600x338.jpg?t=1734461898"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31810/ss_ce92b358cf79db753da590c37f3a3759faf1fb8d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734461898","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31810/ss_ce92b358cf79db753da590c37f3a3759faf1fb8d.600x338.jpg?t=1734461898"},{"id":8,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31810/ss_882c20bf865d7349192f0692fb4dfcb9d778f7e0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734461898","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31810/ss_882c20bf865d7349192f0692fb4dfcb9d778f7e0.600x338.jpg?t=1734461898"},{"id":9,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31810/ss_c91ddd195d88ec0f85ed339cc2e8bcdb6fed92cb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734461898","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31810/ss_c91ddd195d88ec0f85ed339cc2e8bcdb6fed92cb.600x338.jpg?t=1734461898"}],"short_description":"Catch this train \u2014 it\u2019s your ticket to solving a century-old mystery!","steam_appid":31810,"support_info":{"email":"techsupport@herinteractive.com","url":"https://www.herinteractive.com/support/contact-support/"},"supported_languages":"English","type":"game","website":"https://www.herinteractive.com/shop-games/nancy-drew-last-train-to-blue-moon-canyon/"}
