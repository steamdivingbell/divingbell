{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Class 33 \u2018Crompton\u2019 is a classic British Rail Southern Region diesel locomotive, and is ready to get to work for you in Train Simulator. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Class 33 first appeared in British Rail Green livery in 1960 and was deployed in the south east. The first British Rail locomotives to be fitted with a modern electric train heating system, the 33 quickly spread across the whole Southern Region and could occasionally be seen much further afield, mostly running passenger services but also turning its hand to freight operations. A total of 98 examples were built, fitted with 1,550-horsepower Sulzer engines, and they proved popular with crews. The \u2018Crompton\u2019 worked throughout the BR Blue and Network Southeast eras, and 40 survived in service up to the privatisation of the network and continued working for their new owners, EWS. These have now been retired from service, though a number survive in preservation today. With 7 authentic liveries and Sea Lion ballast hoppers, the Class 33 Add-On for Train Simulator is a classic for British Rail diesel fans.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Includes:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Class 33 diesel locomotive in 7 liveries: BR Green, BR Blue, BR \u2018Dutch\u2019 Grey, EWS Maroon, BR General Grey, Network Southeast, BR Sector Grey </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Sea Lion ballast hopper wagons</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p></li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/208298/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736266086","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/208298/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1736266086","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/208298/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736266086","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/208298/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736266086","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Classics Range</h1><p>The Classics Range features a selection of must-have products at value for money prices from the TS back catalogue.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Class 33 \u2018Crompton\u2019 is a classic British Rail Southern Region diesel locomotive, and is ready to get to work for you in Train Simulator. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Class 33 first appeared in British Rail Green livery in 1960 and was deployed in the south east.
