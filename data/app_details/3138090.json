{"about_the_game":"<strong>\u6771\u65b9\u8056\u6226\u5f71 (Touhou Seisenei)\uff5e Forlorn Souls of Wicked Past</strong> is a western-made fangame of the original Touhou Project series by Team Shanghai Alice. As with all mainline Touhou games, shoot away your worries with danmaku in a short but fast-paced STG-style adventure until the incident is resolved!!!<br><br><u><strong>Story</strong></u><br><br>One rainy night, it's discovered that several human souls have started showing up randomly around Gensokyo, appearing from seemingly nothing. While harmless at first, their presence continues to grow until their sheer volume becomes unbearable, causing destruction and mayhem in their wake.<br><br>The first contact with the souls was at the Myouren Temple, which sustained heavy damage. The temple's resident head priest, Byakuren Hijiri, reaches out to rally more support and defense, hoping to find the source of the souls and put an end to what appears to be yet another soul-related incident. Join the cause as Reimu Hakurei, Marisa Kirisame, and Ichirin Kumoi, put a stop to this madness! There's only one way to find out if these souls will be laid to rest before it's too late...<br><br><u><strong>Gameplay</strong></u><br><br>Mechanics reminiscent of UFO and WBaWC's token systems alongside EIoS's dye chaining and BDitB's extra stage blood gems take center stage in this game. You will quickly find out after encountering your first foes that some of them possess strange auras that contain some human souls. It looks like some sentient Yin-Yang orbs have captured them and are using them to attack you! Well, upon their defeat, you can capture them back. Each soul that was inside the aura will reward you with a spirit coin of the same color, consisting of Red, Green, Blue, and Rainbow. Collecting them clears away nearby bullets and gives some nice rewards:<br><br>Red -&gt; 1 life piece (1 full life = 60 pieces + 20 more for every life gained)<br>Green -&gt; 1 spell piece (1 full spell = 60 pieces)<br>Blue -&gt; 1 large point item<br>Rainbow -&gt; All of the above!<br><br>However, if you manage to collect 5 of the same color in a row, it will <i>quadruple</i> the resources you gained from those spirit coins, clear away all bullets, and grant 2 seconds of invincibility and a powerful damaging aura, so get matching!<br><br>Oh, and one more thing. If you attack Yin-Yang orbs while you yourself are <i>inside their aura</i>, your damage against them increases drastically, and upon their defeat they grant one extra reward matching the colors mentioned above. That means play aggressive, get up close and personal!!! Or wait for them to come to you...<br><br>Bosses also generously grant you spirit coins based on your performance in battle. Clearing an attack grants 1 rainbow spirit coin for each of the following conditions:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Do not lose a life (no miss) (spell cards only)</li><li>Do not use a spell (no bomb) (spell cards only)</li><li>Drop the boss' life to 0 while they were in the middle of charging up an attack (nonspells and spell cards)</li></ul><br>Meeting that last criteria also doubles spell card bonuses, so practice that timing!<br><br>There are still some more tricks to be aware of if you want to be a pro at this game, so be sure to check out the <strong>in-game tutorial!</strong><br><br><u><strong>Controls</strong></u><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Move (Left, Right, Up, Down) -&gt; Arrow Keys</li><li>Shoot / Confirm -&gt; Z</li><li>Spell / Back -&gt; X</li><li>Focus (Slow) / Skip Text -&gt; Left Shift</li><li>Skip All Text -&gt; Z + Left Shift</li><li>Pause -&gt; Esc</li><li>Toggle Full Screen -&gt; Alt + Enter</li></ul><br>All controls are remappable via the config.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3138090/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724337158","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3138090/page.bg.jpg?t=1724337158","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3138090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724337158","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3138090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724337158","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":3138390,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<strong>\u6771\u65b9\u8056\u6226\u5f71 (Touhou Seisenei)\uff5e Forlorn Souls of Wicked Past</strong> is a western-made fangame of the original Touhou Project series by Team Shanghai Alice.
