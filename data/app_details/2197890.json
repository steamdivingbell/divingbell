{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SUMMARY</h2>Paranormal Cleanup is a multiplayer horror game where up to 4 players take on the role of employees of a cleaning company tasked with cleaning up haunted houses. You must work together to complete your mission, all while avoiding the relentless pursuit of the ghosts who haunt the halls.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GAMEPLAY</h2>You are an employee of a cleaning company tasked with cleaning up various locations. But this is no ordinary clean-up job - the locations are haunted.<br><br>The task is pretty simple - all you have to do is dispose moldy pizzas, unclog some toilets and clean up some trash here and there. But beware, ghosts are lurking, and they're not happy about your presence. You'll need to be smart and stealthy as you clean up, as every action you take will increase the ghosts anger. Can you complete your cleaning missions, or will the ghosts get you?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EARLY ACCESS</h2>The game is\u00a0available in early access, meaning that it's not going to be completely finished yet and might contain bugs, but you'll still be able to play and enjoy the horror experience. As I continue to develop the game, I'll be adding more maps, enemies, and features. I want to shape this game together with the community to create a game full of mystery, suspense, and laughs.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">KEY FEATURES</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Up to 4 Player Online Co-op Multiplayer</strong><br>Survive together with your friends or struggle alone, if you have none<br></li><li><strong>Proximity Voice Chat</strong><br>Nothing better than hearing your &quot;friends&quot; scream in the distance<br></li><li><strong>Replayability</strong><br>Each Playthrough is different.
