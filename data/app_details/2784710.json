{"about_the_game":"Il\u00edada Espacial 2 is a Space Shooter with RPG elements, where you must defeat waves of enemies to advance in the adventure. In this game, you can't shoot like crazy, because your gun will overheat, paralysing your ship and leaving you at the mercy of enemies!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore each mission, you must go through a workshop where you must improve your ship by paying with the loot obtained from defeated enemies. Decide wisely if you want to improve your attack, the ship's resistance or learn new skills that will help you in your survival.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can hire a mercenary to help you if a mission is difficult for you, but be careful, because, apart from the fact that their help is not free, if they are killed, you will lose their help for the rest of the game!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn fact, this game is not going to be easy at all, but don't be sad if you lose! The game will save your records, and in your next game it will reward you with additional resources with which to finally throw the villains away.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story takes place on the planet Sivinina. There has been a civil war orchestrated by the evil Pimolot, who has not taken well having placed 2nd in the elections and has encouraged his forces to take up arms to take control of the planet by force.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Nebula Patrol has been contacted to help Sivinina's army defeat the coup plotters and rescue the legitimate government.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour mission will be to find and defeat Pimolot, liberating along the way the territories that have fallen under his iron fist.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can play with a keyboard or a controller. The game recognizes both Xbox, PlayStation and Nintendo Switch controllers.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Como regresar al colegio","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2784710/a89775bacd6dd5b4e99c723b20b386ce1bf6cd0a.jpg"},{"name":"La pr\u00e1ctica es mejor que la teor\u00eda","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2784710/41c777cf3edea84b13953d28aac81d34b3407ab7.jpg"},{"name":"Al final no eras tan in\u00fatil","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2784710/02013d3644e9a8169c8dfad865ad8649c5ba4b66.jpg"},{"name":"Topo infernal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2784710/f9045371dd10526ae3d2ceb9745cfafc623e78ee.jpg"},{"name":"\u00a1Extinguido de nuevo!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2784710/58e0f71ce70494ee1cb5fb6fef8a12c3f66cd318.jpg"},{"name":"Armamento alien\u00edgena","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2784710/46a1aa201d3b1f0720f6dc517cfb8b25ce5dfa9b.jpg"},{"name":"Un amigo fiel","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2784710/d37903be5b8164d96c0133c61cda2f4757df15db.jpg"},{"name":"Muro de las lamentaciones","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2784710/269c0b2efda741db60ea08b1c1acca6c5755ddf5.jpg"},{"name":"Kinkakuji Awasshu","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2784710/c97f29a70bb9062f40804eea38e7261429335b91.jpg"},{"name":"\u00a1Punto, set y partido!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2784710/f4e7f831b775bcdfe05d499494e13f8b7b982233.jpg"}],"total":24},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2784710/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729435764","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2784710/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1729435764","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2784710/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729435764","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2784710/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729435764","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Il\u00edada Espacial 2 is a Space Shooter with RPG elements, where you must defeat waves of enemies to advance in the adventure.
