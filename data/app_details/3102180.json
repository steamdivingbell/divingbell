{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">You will learn that the Earth sucks! </h2>Clear satellites and space junk from orbit by collecting, de-orbiting or tossing them into space.. This is a game about gravity and orbital dynamics that aims for casual, intuitive control rather than detailed physics.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Simulated Orbits - Satellites move in orbits and the challenge is to intercept them with your spacecraft and send them where they need to go.<br></li><li>Missions - A selection of mission types.

Balance your needs against your spaceship's mass.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Team</h2>This is a game made by a small, enthusiastic team of novice developers. Our aim was to make a game about orbital dynamics, but keeping the gameplay casual and accessible. The gameplay uses simple controls, relying on orbital dynamics to provide the challenge.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3102180/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732142611","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3102180/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1732142611","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3102180/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732142611","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3102180/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732142611","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">You will learn that the Earth sucks! </h2>Clear satellites and space junk from orbit by collecting, de-orbiting or tossing them into space..
