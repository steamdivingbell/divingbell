{"about_the_game":"Exodemon is a fast paced first person shooter inspired by the 90s FPS golden age. You must make your way through maze-like levels, destroying hordes of enemies with your monstrous abilities. Combining the destructive power of your symbiotic claws with a fast, sharp and fluid movement, you\u2019ll become an indestructible alien killing machine. <br> <br>In Exodemon you play as a scientist in the edge of the universe who was infected by an alien entity. The symbiotic force is trying to take control, but you may find a way to control the beast on the confederation laboratories. Resist the infection and blaze through various locations to reach the last escape pod before you lose what\u2019s left of your humanity.<br><br>Features<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>Fast Paced First Person Shooter</u><br>Tired of slug-like FPS protagonists? You are in the right place! Fast movement and sharp controls, no cover, no regenerating health and no reload time.<br></li><li><u>Old School Feel</u><br>Do you remember when games used to respect your intelligence? No hand holding in this game. If someone tries to hold your hand here, oh boy!
