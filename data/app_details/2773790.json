{"about_the_game":"Aqua Mundo is a waterpark tycoon that lets you create and decorate your own swimming paradise with pools, slides, and other attractions and amenities. You are free to design the layout and theming of every water slide, but there are also management challenges to running a waterpark. You get to choose how much each of these aspects influences your gameplay.<br><br>The game is heavily inspired by classic theme park games and brings a fresh take on the genre by focusing on waterparks, where your slides and pools are the main attractions. Aqua Mundo blends nostalgic elements with modern minimalist visuals.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2773790/extras/headers_0004_Design.png?t=1736289910\" /><br><br>Design pools by drawing their shape, and add items like obstacle courses and pool bars to complete the experience for your guests. Create the layout of lazy rivers and water slides and add theming to give your guests an immersive experience. Aqua Mundo has the tools to create the park you have always dreamed of.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2773790/extras/headers_0003_Manage.png?t=1736289910\" /><br><br>While the creative side of the game is its main attraction, it wouldn't be a tycoon game without management components. Design your own water pipe network with pumps and filtration systems that can be optimized for maximum efficiency. Make sure supplies for the food stalls keep coming in time. Keep your staff satisfied. Maintain attractions to minimize downtime. It's all part of the job!<br><br>Aside from a sandbox mode, Aqua Mundo features a career mode with scenarios, each with their own challenges and objectives to complete.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2773790/extras/headers_0002_Watch.png?t=1736289910\" /><br><br>Once opened to the public, excited guests will come in to see what your park is all about. Entertain thrillseekers with breathtaking drop slides and lively adventure rivers, and provide facilities for those who are out for a more relaxing day in the hot tub or lazy river.<br><br>Between designing pools and coming up with the most exciting slide designs, take a moment to people-watch. Guests have their own little stories to tell. You might even help a guest find the swimming goggles they lost in a pool by keeping an eye out!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2773790/extras/headers_0000_Transport.png?t=1736289910\" /><br><br>Your park guests need to be able to get to your park somehow!
