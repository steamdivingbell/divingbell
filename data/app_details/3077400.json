{"about_the_game":"Your former homeland has become an exile land for sealing monsters, but a new threat is emerging through the madness-inducing pollen. &quot;WhatRogue\uff1aExile Land&quot; is a game that combines roguelike, card construction, and tactical turn-based gameplay. In the game, you can continuously acquire new and interesting cards, offering a fresh experience each time. Moreover, with the tactical gameplay, you need to consider strategies in the spatial dimensions of the board, further enhancing the game's strategic depth. You can choose different initial heroes and companions, defeat various monsters and bosses, and unlock more exciting cards and possibilities after each adventure.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Expansive Maps and Rich Events</h2>The game currently features three adventure maps, and you will unlock the next map after defeating the final boss of each map.<br>Each map has over 10 different monsters, and defeating them will grant you rewards.<br>The maps are filled with diverse random events where you will encounter various NPCs. Get to know them and form connections!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Strategic Turn-Based Board Gameplay</h2>You will play as a hero and gain more companions throughout your challenges. Companion cards need to be placed next to the hero or other companions. The choice and placement of companions are crucial, and every turn requires thoughtful planning!<br>Additionally, heroes can equip gear and use spell cards to diversify your combat strategies!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Deep Card Construction Elements</h2>With over 70 class cards, many can create unique synergies with your existing cards, allowing you to build more powerful and interesting decks!<br>There are numerous treasure cards to discover, often possessing significant power, but they also hold another crucial value: crystals. Will you keep them or sell them? The choice is yours!<br>Relic cards are rarer than treasure cards and inherently valuable, triggering passively in battle. If you encounter a relic card, choose wisely!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Complete the Tutorial","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3077400/e2951d0ea67b1aa605b39fb6b2d727276261c7f7.jpg"},{"name":"Here Comes the Titan","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3077400/8f435fab729ac37404c52b94604a860ac135d040.jpg"},{"name":"I'm in a rush","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3077400/b821b2a8383582525dc166315beecd2fe3777f8f.jpg"},{"name":"It all counts","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3077400/abaf558551b1a0a72168ad5cfc9e4927cc3c1746.jpg"},{"name":"Extreme Cuts","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3077400/08e3858c5b7468bdf7692264f29468a81f9bdceb.jpg"},{"name":"Time to Lose Weight","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3077400/23a6c8f5147a6402427120334f8df060ce284bbe.jpg"},{"name":"Relax","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3077400/cdaffdcfee3e007973cf27065535abbe62f109dd.jpg"},{"name":"The ground is hot","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3077400/a1354c2eaa98f16275ca15bebb9b7ef69fbc7a98.jpg"},{"name":"We got this place booked today","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3077400/251943643276db3f5f21c868311e2878bcd8d262.jpg"},{"name":"Poverty makes me strong","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3077400/1aeb313847fa452df8a49a321057936069b712f4.jpg"}],"total":28},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3077400/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734084618","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3077400/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1734084618","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3077400/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734084618","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3077400/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734084618","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3128230,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Your former homeland has become an exile land for sealing monsters, but a new threat is emerging through the madness-inducing pollen. &quot;WhatRogue\uff1aExile Land&quot; is a game that combines roguelike, card construction, and tactical turn-based gameplay.
