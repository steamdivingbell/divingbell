Get enough food and other resources to run the village. Build monuments of various shapes from variouse stone types. Provide the villagers with clothing and tools made of flint, bone or bronze.<br>The game begins when the first shaman arrives on the hallowed land. Soon after, the first pilgrims will come. Expand your fame and resources for building other huts, altars and stone menhirs. If the villagers get angry or hungry, they will leave, so take care of their needs. Keep the villagers well fed, warm, relaxed and healthy. Produce jewelry and tools from a variety of materials and provide the villagers with clothing that keeps them warm.<br><br>Trade tin and copper and make tools and jewelry from stone or bronze. Send the villagers to hunting expeditions. Tame some animals. The Aurochses, predecessors of today's cows, can supply milk and food.
