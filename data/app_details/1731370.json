POW POW: Dye it Up! has some nerve to paint the school with fun. <strong>The game offers a complete paintball zone-turned college full of classrooms, hallways, offices, and much more</strong> with a large gymnasium where you can run, hide and barricade yourself in. There\u2019s also a lot of secrets to be found, and nooks and crannies to be explored. The whole school is at your disposal to play in one of four different game modes - It\u2019s not just <strong>Battle Royale</strong>.
