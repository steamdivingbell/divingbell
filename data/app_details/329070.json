Hecker has seen the game trigger strong emotional responses. I even felt it\u2026 guilt of all things. I\u2019ve killed thousands \u2014 millions? \u2014 of enemy characters and even some friendly characters in video games with none of the pangs of consequence. I shot one innocent partygoer in Spy Party after tracking them for a few minutes, after being sure they were Chris Hecker\u2019s avatar and up to no good, and then, as they lay dead on the floor I realized I was wrong. I felt bad.\u201d<br>Kotaku<br><br>\u201cSpyParty is like nothing else I\u2019ve ever played. \u2026 When the laser focuses on you, the tension is intense.
