All the items you see around you are 3D reconstructions of actual ancient furniture, pottery, and Kottabos targets from museums. This historical game is harder than it looks! <br><br>In ancient Greece Kottabos was a popular party game in which players threw the dregs from the bottom of their cup at targets. These included a disk on the top of a pole and cups floating in a bowl of water. They competed for adoration, praise, and respect of the other party-goers.<br><br>Prove your skill by throwing the dregs of wine from your cup at the metal disk on the pole in front of you, or fling your drops at the little cups floating in a bowl. If the disk or the cups go down, your luck goes up! A round of applause, an extra dessert, or the favor of Aphrodite herself will come to the winners.<br><br>Game Features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Physics-driven gameplay in VR.<br></li><li>Controller momentum and trigger button throws the dregs.<br></li><li>Aim at the different targets, and get higher scores based on strength of hit and placement on the target.<br></li><li>Three different levels of gameplay.<br></li><li>Tutorial level.<br></li><li>Track your high scores.<br></li><li>Educational!
