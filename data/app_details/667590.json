{"about_the_game":"Race and brawl against your friends in a Norwegian winter fjord landscape. The game has several tracks on road, ice and snow and up to four players can compete with gamepads, or two players can share a keyboard. Powerups include cannon, bomb and boost and each powerups requires skill. The game uses a unique camera to follow the action.  Players score points by driving away from opponents towards the next checkpoint, or by using powerups to destroy opponents. One track also has a ferry ride to cross the fjord and players have to battle it out in a small space, or fall in the water and lose points. The game is currently local multiplayer only, but single player modes will be included in the full version.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNotice to early access player:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-The latest build has several bug fixes and some physics tweaks to stabilize the cars and prevent bouncing and rolling.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/667590/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1515110416","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/667590/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1515110416","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/667590/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1515110416","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/667590/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1515110416","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Race and brawl against your friends in a Norwegian winter fjord landscape.
