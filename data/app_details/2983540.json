{"about_the_game":"Phantom Beast Solitaire is a casual puzzle card game. Each start will have a different beginning. You need to defeat monsters through the cooperation of game cards, beast cards, constellation cards, and magic cards to complete the level. If you fail to defeat the boss within a limited number of shots, it is considered a failure. There is no time limit set in the game, and you can carefully consider before making a shot decision. Based on the basic score of the card type played, you can accumulate the special effects of the phantom beast card, plus the bonus of the constellation card, and finally calculate the final damage of this shot. Reward coins after clearance, which can be consumed in the store. The store sells privilege cards, pet cards, magic cards, constellation cards, and enhanced game cards, as well as special card packs. Of course, the cards sold in each issue of the store are different. Only by seizing opportunities can we achieve ultimate victory. The card pack is also a one choice setting, allowing you to easily choose the card you need the most. Various different gameplay routines are worth exploring and contemplating. Even after completing the game perfectly, you can continue and fully enjoy the fun of challenging yourself in the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLevel and Tag System:<br />\r\nEach level has victory conditions, while the boss level has a more difficult random victory condition. Skipping levels in the first two levels can earn tags, while the boss level does not allow jumping levels. Tags can achieve some effects, so it is necessary to decide whether to skip levels or pass them normally.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhantom Beast Cards:<br />\r\nOne of the most important components of the game, the strategy and routines without the Phantom Beast Card are an empty shell, and the Phantom Beast Card is the soul of it. All gameplay strategies and routines will revolve around pet cards, with linkage effects between pet cards, pet cards and game cards, magic cards, constellation cards, and monster cards. These linkage effects form different gameplay directions one by one. The role of pet cards is not only to enrich gameplay, but also to further explore the depth of the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMagic and Magic Cards:<br />\r\nA one-time consumption card with special abilities, equivalent to a functional card in the game. They can enhance the basic value of game cards, transform game cards, and obtain more coins and so on. Magic cards have a stronger effect than magic cards, so it is also more difficult to obtain magic cards.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConstellation sign:<br />\r\nA one-time consumption card that increases the player's card type level. It can be purchased through the mall or obtained through pet card skills or magic cards.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRenovation sign:<br />\r\nCan modify existing cards, stamp and trim them to give them special abilities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStore:<br />\r\nAt the end of each round, you can enter the store system, where you can sell pet cards, privilege cards, and card packs. The store system is one of the variables in creating games. It can also determine the direction of the game's development and which strategy to use, but all of this is unknown.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2983540/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737960676","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2983540/page.bg.jpg?t=1737960676","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2983540/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737960676","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2983540/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737960676","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Phantom Beast Solitaire is a casual puzzle card game.
