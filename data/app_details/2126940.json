{"about_the_game":"BURGER IMPACT is a high-speed physics-based action game set in a future where fast food battles against enemy factions in outer space. Take control of Burger, who must journey and battle across the galaxy in order to rescue French Fries from a mysterious entity. Could this be a plot by the nefarious Potato Empire, or are there other forces at play? Built in Unreal Engine 5!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Burger's affinity with Space Ketchup has led to cursory control over Space &amp; Time, including the following abilities:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>CHARGE ATTACK (JET BOOST): Allows for high-speed zero-gravity travel, as well as for knocking back enemies and obstacles with a high-impact body slam.<br></li><li>BURGER TIME: The ability to slow down time to quickly aim or react in dangerous or time-limited situations.<br></li><li>ORBIT MODE: The ability to quickly gravitate to and orbit around a target. This not only functions as an aiming mode but also visualizes a series of causality lines from the target for the purpose of setting up chain combo attacks. And it may have other uses as well...<br></li><li>TARGET CHAIN: When orbiting a target in close range, Burger can temporarily link together a chain of enemies to knock into each other in succession. Within an active chain, trick shots will succeed with near-certainty. Each successful hit along the chain not only deals more damage but also recovers a portion of the Burger Time gauge.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A new type of 3D flying gameplay: Engage in the original \u201cspace-billiards realtime combat system\u201d and enjoy thrilling high-speed action! As Burger, fly freely at high-speed, orbit around objects, charge up, and launch objects to destroy stars, enemies, and other obstacles!<br></li><li>Original Control System: Simple controls with a variety of advanced techniques to discover! Mouse &amp; Keyboard input, Controller input, and the Steam Deck are supported.<br></li><li>Minimal Waiting Time: Extra attention has been put into minimizing waiting time to the maximum extent possible, such that the player is in control nearly 100% of the time. Every cutscene and sequence is skippable, with no lengthy unskippable transitions anywhere in the game.<br></li><li>Vegan Mode: This game is Vegan Friendly! With Vegan Mode enabled, you can be assured that no animal or seafood-based products are present in the game!!!</li></ul>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2126940?t=1705652438","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2126940/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1705652438","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2126940/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1705652438","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2126940/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1705652438","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"BURGER IMPACT is a high-speed physics-based action game set in a future where fast food battles against enemy factions in outer space.
