The King of Valusia sat upon his throne and ruled his peaceful valley and its honest citizens with a firm yet fair grip.<br><br>The future of Tarth was bright.<br><br>Until they came. And the light went out forever.</i><br><br>Evernight is a very different kind of dark fantasy setting. This fantasy grounds conversion of the 144-page hardback book provides a complete scripted campaign, from before the arrival of the mysterious and terrifying Masters to the epic and bloody finish.

Evernight contains new Edges &amp; Hindrances, spells, weapons, and magical items. The Game Master has a complete scene by scene campaign ready to run, the truth behind Tarth's murky past, and a host of new and mysterious monsters!<br><br>Released on July 27, 2008.
