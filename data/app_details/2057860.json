It traveled alone in this unfamiliar dimension, eager to find a way back. After a long cosmic era and space, the giant whale seems to have given up hope and began to float aimlessly in the long river of the universe, occasionally relying on swallowing some asteroids to maintain its own survival consumption. Until one journey, when he was devouring a metal planet, the special metal liquid overflowing from the planet could quickly invade the body of the giant whale, quickly corroding the time and space in its body, the giant whale struggled in pain, and its body lost.
