Your mission is to rescue your best friend who has been kidnapped by very hostile slimes who want to conquer the kingdom of Revenguard and take over the world. Rescuing your little dog won't be easy. Your best friend is being held in a castle that has already been taken over by the slimes. The Slime Lord is also hidden here. However, getting there can be challenging. Along the way, you'll have to solve various tasks, jump from tree to tree, climb mountains or crawl through creepy caves, and most importantly, avoid the slimes who will try to kill you as soon as they see you.
