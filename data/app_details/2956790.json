The initial creation of the world by itself is a real pleasure and each game brings a different map to the table.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe new players will enjoy the game for its \u201ceasy access\u201d aspect. Since all the actions you can do are displayed on the six cards of a player\u2019s deck, this makes the game really accessible right from the start.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe more exigent strategist players will love the game for its full control aspect and the fact that the learning curve seems to be a constant line of progression.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2956790/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714163970","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2956790/page.bg.jpg?t=1714163970","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2956790/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714163970","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2956790/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714163970","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Rise &amp; Fall is a full control strategic game.
