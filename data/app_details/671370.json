{"about_the_game":"Fly through fantastical forests in-time to the funky beat. Cruise round coral reefs to the sounds of chilled out tunes. Race past asteroid colonies powered by electronic music!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFlight of Light is a rhythm game that cuts its own path through exotic, otherworldly landscapes. Leave a trail of stars and stream of colours in your wake as you collect points and speed boosts by moving in-time to the music.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith an upbeat soundtrack that uniquely blends an eclectic mix of funk, EDM, vapourware and other genres. Play with up to 4 friends in local multiplayer across score and race modes, both cooperatively and competitively.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/671370/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1501800988","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/671370/page.bg.jpg?t=1501800988","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/671370/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1501800988","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/671370/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1501800988","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Fly through fantastical forests in-time to the funky beat.
