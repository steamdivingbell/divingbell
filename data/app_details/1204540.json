{"about_the_game":"\u200bPictassembler is an engineering puzzle game where you set up a production line of marbles and operator blocks to assemble pixel art images one block at a time. Each marble can be stuck to an anchor or an existing pixel block to create a new pixel block in a given location, and can also be shaded appropriately. The finished block shape needs to match the solution image to finish the level. The challenge comes in setting up the placement and timing of the marbles' paths to ensure that they land in the solution grid correctly.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"The Picture Assembler","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1204540/a91bbaacf3930cb89e74a40ebe8e0117c0747686.jpg"},{"name":"Company ink","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1204540/ac71af293cc8d58f025b91fa0366d74481349c46.jpg"},{"name":"One in a million shot, doc","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1204540/159ca4c416b8e7fab8fdb506523d7a50de30e41d.jpg"},{"name":"Nothing left on the table","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1204540/5f24854a3a522743c7fd7b888e00093d74bc8ee3.jpg"},{"name":"Fully equipped","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1204540/ae135a939efbe6ad8ec0e60675a51dd945148f01.jpg"},{"name":"The Master Assembler","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1204540/d80fdfdc218204da7116eae37e413b3a3850f64e.jpg"}],"total":6},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1204540/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1577193639","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1204540/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1577193639","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1204540/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1577193639","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1204540/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1577193639","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Pictassembler is out!</h1><p>The game is released now, and it's been a delight developing it. If you enjoy it, tell your friends! You can also reach me at @activeupgames on Twitter. I would love to see your puzzle solutions! There will be updates to the game as well. Planned updates include a custom level editor, more music, maybe more puzzles, cloud saves, maybe workshop support (if I can figure it out), and hopefully a gifmaker to help show off your solutions. It all depends on what people want to see.
