{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Overview</h2>Speedway Ringer is a top-down racer inspired by American stock car oval racing and the real-life challenges of Motorsports. Drivers will need a balance of aggression and patience to perfect their technique and succeed in a chaotic online multiplayer environment.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2270420/extras/steamstore.gif?t=1684428517\" /><br><br>Whether you're a seasoned racer or just a gamer looking for a new challenge, Speedway Ringer is a quick, fun way to race with your friends.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tracks</h2>Speedway Ringer features 7 short tracks, each with its own unique characteristics and challenges. The tracks are inspired by real-life American stock car racing circuits. Additional track types are currently in development. Drivers must tune their car to find the right balance of speed and control to achieve the best lap times. <br><br>In addition to the standard tracks, the game will also feature special event tracks throughout the year that provide unique challenges.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dynamic Track System</h2>Driving lines themselves affect the track grip, making every race a unique and challenging experience. As drivers take a line through the turns, they can affect the grip of the track in that area, creating a dynamic optimal line. This means that players must not only focus on their driving skills but also adapt to the changing conditions. This system is tuned to be extremely sensitive and adds to the chaos.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Paint Schemes</h2>Set your favorite paint scheme and race it online against your friends! For a limited time, join our Discord to submit your own scheme and have it added to the game!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Indie Developer</h2>Speedway Ringer was primarily developed by one person. Join our Discord to submit feedback and get help from the community. By supporting our first title, you're helping us improve our netcode, physics model, implementing AI, as well as creating the foundation for more racing games in the future!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2270420/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1684428517","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2270420/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1684428517","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2270420/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1684428517","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2270420/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1684428517","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Overview</h2>Speedway Ringer is a top-down racer inspired by American stock car oval racing and the real-life challenges of Motorsports.
