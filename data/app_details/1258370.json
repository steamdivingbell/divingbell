{"about_the_game":"<strong>Overview</strong><br><br>The Dark Empress is awaiting Zarya, anxious to destroy her and all the rebels! After taming Ribeus in DragonScales 5, Zarya will release the dragon's power to confront the Dark Empress, the merciless ruler of the Gravity Kingdom.

Each DragonScales game introduces puzzles and challenges not included in other entries of the series, and DragonScales 6 is no exception. The game comprises totally new challenges: collect keys to unlock doors, switch the board's gravity to solve puzzles, harness the new power-up system and destroy the Empress' minions! For the first time in DragonScales, Zarya will have to battle against a line-up of multiple enemies. DragonScales 6 concludes Zarya's story arc!
