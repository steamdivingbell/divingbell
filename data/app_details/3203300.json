{"about_the_game":"If you are tired of the normal everyday adult games with virtually the same stories and cliches- then I invite you to try something fresh, unique, and darker.  Like all Anaxverse games, this one revolves around corruption and transformation fetishes! Giggle Night: Trixie\u2019s Trial is essentially an adults-only sexual Visual Novel and Video Game.  Following the perspective of the brand-new A.C.E. Sidekick, Trixie Goodwin, a rich story unfolds before you.  It allows a choice between a Story Mode (avoiding all turn-based combat and resource management) for casual play, or a Game Mode for those that want to play the Superhero Missions as Trixie as you traverse supervillain lairs defeating their henchmen and gaining new moves.  GN:TT is canonical and chronologically 3rd in the Anaxverse series.  However, it is completely stand alone as well, and can be enjoyed just as much even without the other previous tales.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3203300/extras/AboutThisGameGN.png?t=1728702643\" /><br><br>You have a choice, like in all Anaxverse games.
