{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Infinium is an ambitious new open world to explore. You wake on an island nation gripped by war with no memory of who you are. Recollect your memories as you make friends and enemies, each choice shaping the narrative. Reap the rewards of an affluent nation as you work jobs, do quests, &amp; invest in real estate. Will you become a hero or a successful entrepreneur?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The lush and beautiful island of Infinium has seen kingdoms have rises and inevitably fell over the centuries. Today a relatively young race of beings, Man, claim the island for themselves. They sneer at those who came before and swiftly eradicate all in conquest. Decades of hostility towards the natural balance of life has led to the uprising of a new, angrier race; Kebari. Little is known of these sentient beings, however humans consider them to be the reincarnation of the ancestors they once dominated. Village elders often tell a tale of the Kebari manifesting from the sheer hatred of the forest. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2430020/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737063529","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2430020/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1737063529","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2430020/80eaaef904c1d34b188fe66924139d564226a9eb/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737063529","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2430020/80eaaef904c1d34b188fe66924139d564226a9eb/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737063529","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3279720,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Infinium is an ambitious new open world to explore.
