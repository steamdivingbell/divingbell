Work your way up from a starter unit to a penthouse as your Sims launch new metropolitan careers!<br><br><strong>Key features</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Explore the bustling city of San Myshuno</strong> \u2014 This densely populated city has enough unique neighborhoods to give your Sims plenty to explore. Get creative in the Arts Quarter, or sing your heart out at the Karaoke Bar in the Fashion District.
