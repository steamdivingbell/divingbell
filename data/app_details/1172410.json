After a weird malfunction his ship crash landed on an extrange place filled with hazards. It\u2019s your job to help him go through his perilous journey home.<br><br>It\u2019s ok if you\u2019re not an expert on platformers. We added a couple of features to let you enjoy the game either way. If you want the challenge, but are having trouble with your skills the Ghost Mode will be there for you. Being able to watch your best runs is a great well to polish your skills. Now, if you\u2019re just looking to enjoy the awesome artwork and soundtrack of the game without too much rage you can always try the easy mode.
