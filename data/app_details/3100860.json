{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Welcome to the enchanting world of <i>Anima Mundi</i>! This life simulation game invites you to build thriving ecosystems and bring planets to life. Populate your world with unique creatures and guide them through their journey of growth and evolution.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your goal is to cultivate a balanced ecosystem, nurturing each creature until they <strong>reach their final form</strong>. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Please note:</i> Anima Mundi is lovingly crafted by a solo developer, and it\u2019s still growing!

To achieve this, the player will need to use two complementary game modes, each designed in a minimalist way: <strong>Simulation Mode</strong> and <strong>Control Mode</strong>.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Simulation Mode </strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Simulation Mode </strong>allows you to populate the planet with animal, plant, or mineral species. These species directly affect planetary statistics such as humidity, light, gases, temperature, and more.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You will need to carefully balance your population to achieve the ideal ecosystem conducive to the survival of new species. Simulation Mode will also feature additional tools, such as &quot;Inspect,&quot; which provides essential information about a selected species. It will also be possible to examine deceased specimens to gather more information about a species' survival conditions. By opening the post-mortem examination device, the player can view a timeline showing various statistics (gas levels, humidity, etc.) from the 10 days prior to the creature's death.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Through the inspection panel, the player can take control of certain creatures to enter Survival Mode.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Control Mode</strong> </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Control Mode</strong> is triggered from <strong>Simulation Mode</strong> when a creature is inspected by the player, allowing control of species born from cocoons. These creatures have specific biological needs (light, temperature, etc.) that must be met by the ecosystem in which they reside. Additionally, they will require the player's intervention to ensure their survival, such as feeding, drinking, and eventually hunting.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Once the survival conditions are met, the young creature advances to adulthood and is considered discovered. If the player exits the simulation without fulfilling the growth conditions or if the allotted time runs out, the young creature will die.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Level completion</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The player's objective is to <strong>discover all the primary species on each planet.</strong> A planet corresponds to a level. Each <strong>planet is small and contains a limited number of species</strong>.  Player can choose to stay on one level and discover the secondary species before moving on to the next.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3100860/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733329726","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3100860/page.bg.jpg?t=1733329726","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3100860/d25feba5c6b7a390734c6638a6486e51c5e4bf42/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733329726","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3100860/d25feba5c6b7a390734c6638a6486e51c5e4bf42/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733329726","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Welcome to the enchanting world of <i>Anima Mundi</i>!
