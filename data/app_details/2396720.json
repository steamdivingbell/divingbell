{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Super Powers Companion: Tales of the Doom Guard</h2>  The Doom Guard is an organization you can drop into your campaign regardless of its style. They're an &quot;uber group&quot; that can call on your heroes (or villains!) to fight threats greater than any one super or group can handle--or quell lesser threats before they grow into something more significant. The Doom Guard tracks even lesser crimes, having learned the hard way such mischief is often the harbinger of greater schemes and catastrophes to come. The 'Tales of the Doom Guard ' adventures, as listed below: <br> Adventure 1, 'Pulp': <br> Talons of the Demon Bat  <br> Legacy City, 1937. The underworld thrives and LCPD faces threats far beyond any beat cop. Swarms of supernatural bats plague neighborhoods and things are getting worse. Can your pulp heroes find out who is behind this threat and stop them before the streets run red with blood? <br> Adventure 2, 'Street Fighters': <br> Bizzare Alliances  <br> An irradiated construction site, stolen plans from a high-tech lab, strange shipments at the port, and a heist at the museum. And a new villain, the Observer, interfering in strange ways. Can your street fighters stop the villains before these seemingly random events spell doom for your city? <br> Adventure 3, 'Four Color': <br> Strange Arcana  <br> Blackguard went missing in Legacy City over 72 hours ago. His last mission? Tracking down a strange cult and putting a stop to wherever they're doing. Can your four color heroes rescue their ally and stop a threat from beyond this world before it is too late? <br> Adventure 4, 'Heavy Hitters': <br> Apocalyptic Party Crashers  <br> When the Doom Guard's AI shares the inane ramblings of a conspiracy-theorist vlogger, the Doom Guard listens. The vlogger claims that Dark Star is going to collapse the Earth into a black hole for her boyfriend's birthday (also called the Black Hole). Tabloid drama or threat to life on earth; can your heavy-hitting heroes figure it out and stop the Earth's destruction? <br> Adventure 5, 'Cosmic Crusaders': <br> Deep Reckoning  <br> A massive shipping tanker filled with Z-Contaminant sunk in the Pacific Ocean, right over the Goliath Trench! The kaiju inhabiting the trench was mutated into an undead monstrosity known as Omega Goliath and is now on a path of destruction to Atlantis. If slain outright, Omega Goliath's undead form will infect all ocean life and cause the collapse of the Earth's biosphere. Can your cosmic crusaders save Goliath, Atlantis, and all life on Earth? Or will they have to choose? <br> To be used with the <br> Super Powers Companion \u00a0and the <br> Savage Worlds Adventure Edition \u00a0core rules.  &quot;","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396720/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1681824380","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396720/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1681824380","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396720/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1681824380","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396720/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1681824380","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Super Powers Companion: Tales of the Doom Guard</h2>  The Doom Guard is an organization you can drop into your campaign regardless of its style.
