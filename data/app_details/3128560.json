{"about_the_game":"In the new Spellarium, Eric must restore the fading sun and, with the help of the spirits of fire, water, earth, and air, bring the dying world back to life. In the new game, as always, we have made some changes. A new mechanic has been added - red coins that can be swapped with the regular tiles ( if it will result in a combo ). Changes have also been made to Mahjong, making it less clicky and significantly more thinky. All Mahjong levels can be completed, we have tested this multiple times, but some levels will require some brainpower. This won't cause delays; levels that cannot be completed right now, can be skipped and played later.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game includes:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n90 Match 3 levels and numerous bonus games: Solitaire, Mahjong, Spot the Difference, Jigsaw, as well as a city to build.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3128560?t=1723606452","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3128560?t=1723606452","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3128560/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1723606452","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3128560/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1723606452","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In the new Spellarium, Eric must restore the fading sun and, with the help of the spirits of fire, water, earth, and air, bring the dying world back to life.
