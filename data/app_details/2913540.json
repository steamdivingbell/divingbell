Here you'll follow a trio of unlikely companions from different corners of the solar system as they learn to overcome their differences and confront their own personal challenges. Through some unlucky mishaps, they've been left broke and owning a ruined spaceship reclamation center, Jupiter Junkworks. But if they put their skills together, maybe they can make something of it? You'll help to decide their future!<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2913540/extras/Steam_ArcadePuzzleAction.png?t=1730172771\" /><br>In the arcade puzzle segments you will crush, compress and manipulate blocks as you rush to achieve objectives in time! You'll need to balance and prioritize row clearing and color matching mechanics to win as you progress through increasingly harder contracts (missions). Lots of new challenges await as more unique objectives, mechanics and game modes are introduced! Jupiter Junkworks features a number of fun arcade puzzle mechanics that will have you constantly finding new ways to setup combos and reinventing your playstyle.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2913540/extras/Steam_-_JJ_Slam.gif?t=1730172771\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">COMPRESS!</h2>Slamming blocks is the core mechanic of Jupiter Junkwork's arcade puzzle segments. Slamming down a block will let you shear off parts of already placed blocks or compress gaps below others. This is key to the gameplay in Jupiter Junkworks and will be something you need to master to get far! It's also how you regenerate your powerups, so get slamming!<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2913540/extras/Steam_-_JJ_Collect.gif?t=1730172771\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">COLLECT!</h2>Match colored bits to collect them as resources and cause blocks to tumble down!
