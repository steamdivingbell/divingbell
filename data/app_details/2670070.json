{"about_the_game":"Prepare your heroes, it\u2019s time to face some horrific bosses with the Cursed Kingdoms Boss Pack! Michael Galefire is back with another static battler pack in his amazing painted style, this time focusing on hulking bosses to challenge your heroes. Battle an ax-wielding ogre with bonelike spikes stabbing up from his flesh and a shiny metal jaw attached to his head, or run from a demonic insect with its bloated body ready to explode in a burst of destructive energy!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n7 unique battlers are ready to turn any dungeon into a tomb for surprised adventurers. Challenge cyborg-like liches with decaying armor and twisted limbs in graveyards to free trapped souls and defeat a black shelled alien that evolved from lobsters to stop the ocean from destroying a tranquil beach town. Or leave those bosses to another set of adventurers and focus on the true evils of the land: the Cthulhu-inspired Enslaved Headhunter and Umbral Terror! Purple tentacles squirm beneath glowing green eyes of these deadly foes, with the headhunter\u2019s stained weapons ready to claim another trophy and the terror simply rising from the shadows to crush all who are foolish enough to challenge it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach battler comes in a high-res format so you can resize it to perfectly fit into your game, or leave it huge to strike fear into your tiny heroes!
