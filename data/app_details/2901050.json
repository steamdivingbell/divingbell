{"about_the_game":"The beloved &quot;Indie Pixelart Quirkbound-type RPG&quot; subgenre of games that you all know and love relentlessly breeds with old school first-person dungeon crawling to bring you- YES, you- an unforgettable journey to collect the six elemental crystals and thwart the most powerful squatter in the realm- Wizard Grup.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combat</h2>Show those losers who's in charge with fast-paced JRPG combat. Various QoL features like commands being mapped to directional keys and the option to speed up skill animations allow you to battle at the speed of thought. Hit action commands with proper timing to boost your damage, and fill up the gold Ultra meter to clobber your foes with deadly attacks.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Minigames</h2>Go fishing for your next meal, gamble your life away, or set a new high score in the arcade to learn how to use cheat codes in real life. Plenty of minigames are scattered throughout Easton Kingdom. Master them all to learn new abilities to use in combat, or earn money and items.<br><br>Side note: You will NOT- I repeat- WILL NOT have to play any minigames during combat, ever. If you know, you know.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Equipment....for your Equipment</h2>On top of a basic equipment system, Dragonpaw features what everybody (about 3 people) have been demanding for millennia- equipment FOR your equipment. Attach Keychains to give your equipment bonus attributes, stat multipliers, and even gain access to exclusive abilities that you can't learn from leveling up. The loud jangling of your keychains will intimidate your enemies to no end, so don't be surprised if you slip in a puddle of their pee or something.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Other things that are in Dragonpaw</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>An obese bird<br></li><li>A recipe for garlic bread<br></li><li>Punching an enemy in the chest so hard it's heart explodes<br></li><li>The biggest kidneystone in Wyoming, photographed<br></li><li>Insults<br></li><li>Grinsults<br></li><li>...and a darn tootin' good time!</li></ul><br><br>Join the Official Discord Server to follow along with the development of the full version of the game and cyberbully me into developing it even faster.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2901050?t=1733705124","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2901050?t=1733705124","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2901050/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733705124","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2901050/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733705124","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2905230,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"The beloved &quot;Indie Pixelart Quirkbound-type RPG&quot; subgenre of games that you all know and love relentlessly breeds with old school first-person dungeon crawling to bring you- YES, you- an unforgettable journey to collect the six elemental crystals and thwart the most powerful squatter in the realm- Wizard Grup.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combat</h2>Show those losers who's in charge with fast-paced JRPG combat.
