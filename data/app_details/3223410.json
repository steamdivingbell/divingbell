{"about_the_game":"Immerse yourself in the eerily beautiful world of Just a Lullaby, a video game that blends 2D pixel art with a surreal and thought-provoking narrative. Strategic resource management is crucial: every decision you make matters. The entire gameplay unfolds over the course of a single night, amidst an invasion of alien rats and a curse that has spawned many other monsters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this demo, you will guide Mel, the first brother, through an outdoor environment composed of areas such as the cemetery, the unnamed lands, the gazebo, the wild lands, and the garden. His power lies in the sticky mucus from his large nose, which can be strengthened by collecting tissues that you'll help him find. The first tissue will be given to him right away by the ghost girl, Missy, who just freed him from the cage hanging from a tree.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUpon entering the mirror, Mel will encounter the first Vendor, a rather brutal character who, in exchange for the black key needed to speak with the Falconer (whom you\u2019ll find by descending into ditches), will demand the three bags of coins held by the three monsters with green crowns. Once Mel obtains the black key, he\u2019ll be able to interact with a somewhat absent-minded Falconer, who in turn will ask him to collect three keys held by another set of monsters, each with a golden crown. These three keys will allow him to receive three upgrades (in this case, tissues), preparing him to enter the first dungeon. But you'll experience that in the full game...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the meantime, don\u2019t forget to collect the kite, Mac, as it always grants you an extra life. Lastly, eat, eat, eat the food you\u2019ll collect from killing rats, to restore your energy. You will encounter various types of monsters, and many more await you in the later levels of the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith an original soundtrack and an artistic direction deliberately designed to emphasize a style that is both dark and ironic, Just a Lullaby offers a unique and captivating blend of simplicity and depth, where victory and defeat are equally possible. Have fun!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3223410/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727364533","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3223410/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1727364533","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3223410/25da21488223e32f09639afd1610340ac6d7ffa4/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727364533","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3223410/25da21488223e32f09639afd1610340ac6d7ffa4/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727364533","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Immerse yourself in the eerily beautiful world of Just a Lullaby, a video game that blends 2D pixel art with a surreal and thought-provoking narrative.
