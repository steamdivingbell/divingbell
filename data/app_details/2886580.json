{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Welcome, one and all, to the most joyful, Toyful Wonderworld, where imagination shines as bright as the stars! Or at least, that's how it used to be. Due to something utterly unknown, all the staff of this magical place have disappeared and the complex has locked itself down. Meanwhile, the formerly pleasant Toyfriends within its walls have become violent and weird! Armed with your gun, you must explore Toyful Wonderworld and find out who or what is responsible for these strange events that triggered its lockdown.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You play as a government agent sent in to find out why Toyful Wonderworld was closed off from the outside world and to neutralize any threats encountered along the way. While you're initially armed with only a pistol, many more weapons can be found wielded by the Toyfriends that can be taken from them upon defeat. Your objective is to explore the numerous bizarre locations within the complex by unlocking security doors and shooting enemies, in order to access the Grand Factory at the center of Toyful Wonderworld. A helpful companion named Mister Phunkyfone will provide you with tips along the way, and you can also activate various computer systems around the facility that will yield information about the employees that worked here. Be careful though, as there may be some true horrors hidden deep within this cursed place...</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2886580/extras/finalTOYFULWONDERWORLD.png?t=1735931917\" />  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A special thanks to the talented artist David Venegas for illustrating the official artwork for Toyful Wonderworld above!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Developed in GameMaker Studio, this is my first game to be published on here and I'm very proud by what I've been able to create so far.
