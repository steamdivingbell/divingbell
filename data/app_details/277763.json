{"about_the_game":"The iconic Class 180 \u2018Adelante\u2019 speeds into Train Simulator in distinctive Grand Central Trains livery.<br><br>The five-car sets were built by Alstom at their Washwood Heath plant between 2000 and 2001 for First Great Western, who wanted to increase the frequency of their express services between London Paddington and South Wales, and became part of the Coradia 1000 family, alongside the popular Class 175.<br><br>Nicknamed \u2018Adelante\u2019 by First Group, the Class has had a chequered career, being late into service in the early 2000s and returns to their leasing company, Angel Trains, ahead of schedule in 2009.
