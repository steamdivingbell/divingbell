{"about_the_game":"<i>Labyrinthatunes</i> is the official soundtrack of the retro-futuristic puzzle adventure collectathon game, Labyrinthatory. The soundtrack features music for all 15 areas of the game, including puzzle theme versions; all menus; five national-culture-inspired tracks (including puzzle themes) for the dining room area; all Robot Rockers tracks; Atrium themes; end-of-game themes; and short themes that play throughout the game.<br><br>The soundtrack can be classified as &quot;easy listening&quot; as most of the themes are designed to accompany the player's exploration and puzzle solving. The music is great for studying, working, driving, and exercising.<br><br>The songs were scored and produced using FL Studio (including extensions and plug-ins), free-and-open source audio files, and Bosca Ceoil (for the arcade game themes). There are no high-quality audio files because the songs were composed to sound retro and synthesized, thus mitigating high-quality sound loss in the MP3 files.<br><br>We hope you enjoy <i>Labyrinthatunes</i> and the game the tracks are from, Labyrinthatory!<br><br>All music created by Tom Ballard and Erika Luke (with some help from Bach, Beethoven, Mussorgsky, Sousa, and Joplin, may they rest in peace).","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2656250/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1698708176","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2656250/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1698708176","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2656250/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1698708176","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2656250/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1698708176","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<i>Labyrinthatunes</i> is the official soundtrack of the retro-futuristic puzzle adventure collectathon game, Labyrinthatory.
