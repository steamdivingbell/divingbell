{"about_the_game":"This pack adds a Headquarters Company to your battle group with a selection of the following elements.  <br />\r\n1. The Commanding Officer (CO).  A colonel who commands the infantry regiment your battle group is based on.  Moving around in a jeep or an armored halftrack, the CO provides important command bonuses to your units when he is in command range of them.  The CO's command bonuses are applied to any unit in your entire battle group.<br />\r\n2. Regimental Headquarters (HQ).  A command element of the infantry regiment your battle group is based on.  Moving around in trucks or armored halftracks, the HQ improves the sustainment of units it is in contact with by increasing their ammunition resupply rate by 50%.  The HQ's command bonuses are applied to any unit in your entire battle group.<br />\r\n3. Signals sections.  Communications units equipped with long-range radios.  When any of your command elements is within range of one of those, its command range is doubled. There is no need to attach a signals section to one of your battalions for that battalion's commander to obtain this bonus. <br />\r\n4. Military Police (MP) platoons.  These units provide traffic control so any unit within their range will have its speed increased.  There is no need to attach an MP platoon to any of your battalions for their elements to get this movement bonus.<br />\r\n5. Military Intelligence (Int) sections.  Int elements help detect enemy units through the analysis of enemy radio traffic, prisoner interrogation, analysis of air and ground recon, or from reports from higher level Int elements.  This allows you to locate the enemy on the battlefield before your combat units make contact with him.  There are no range restrictions placed on the Int sections and they don't need to be attached to any battalion.<br />\r\n6. Corps artillery Liaison Officer (LO).  This LO can request heavy artillery fire from corps artillery batteries.  He will do so autonomously whenever he has eyes-on on the enemy so you need to keep him deployed forward in a position of observation.  Moving around in a jeep or an armored halftrack, he is highly mobile but, also, vulnerable to enemy fire.  <br />\r\n7. Air force Liaison Officer (LO).  This LO comes with ten air missions of each category (strike, recon, air cover).  He will request these air missions autonomously whenever he has eyes-on on the enemy for air recon or strike missions so you need to keep him deployed forward in a position of observation.  He will request air support whenever enemy aircraft appear on the battlefield whether or not he is in range of them.  Moving around in a jeep or an armored halftrack, he is highly mobile but, also, vulnerable to enemy fire.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn important feature added for use when an air or artillery LO is present is the No Fire Area (NFA).  Click on the Control Measures button at the bottom left to be able to create up to two NFAs.  These are used to designate locations where the LO can't call for fire or air strikes \u2013 set them up just before your units assault an enemy's location in order to prevent friendly fire.  Note that an ongoing fire mission/air strike will not end when an NFA is designated \u2013 rather, a new fire missions/air strikes will not be called there.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPurchasing.  You will receive a CO, an HQ, and random headquarters elements in single battles. In campaigns you will be able to upgrade or replace these between your campaign's operations.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2437200?t=1685538327","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2437200?t=1685538327","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2437200/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1685538327","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2437200/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1685538327","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This pack adds a Headquarters Company to your battle group with a selection of the following elements.  <br />\r\n1.
