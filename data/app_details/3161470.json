{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> </h2> Starfinder 2 RPG - Starfinder Playtest Society Scenario #1: Shards of the Glass Planet<br> <br> A Starfinder Second Edition Playtest adventure designed for 1st-level characters. <br> For millennia, Birnam's Bubble has been a planet untouched by outsiders, fully encapsulated in an impenetrable shield of unknown energy and protected by powerful automated defenses. Through this barrier, explorers and surveyors have glimpsed pristine settlements, verdant flora, and inexplicable magical emanations--yet no fauna or citizens populate the world's surface. <br> As in many other parts of the galaxy, the Drift Crisis changed everything. Now, the energy barrier surrounding Birnam's Bubble cracks like shattering glass, and shards of this solidified energy have begun to fall through the atmosphere to the planet's surface, causing significant destruction. Enter the breach and uncover the secrets of the lost civilizations of Birnam's Bubble before they're lost forever! <br> Welcome to the Starfinder Playtest! You can directly shape the future of the Starfinder Roleplaying Game by participating in a fun and rigorous playtest period using the Starfinder Playtest Rulebook and one of several playtest adventures--including Starfinder Playtest Scenarios! Each Starfinder Playtest Scenario is a short, single-session adventure designed to be played in 2-3 hours and written by a member of the Starfinder Team. <br> <br>  This product is not a PDF or accessible outside of Fantasy Grounds.
