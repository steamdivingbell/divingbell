{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">STORY</h2>A natural disaster hit us and brought humanity to the verge of extinction. Only a few survived because of &quot;Large Igneous Provinces&quot;, these are volcanoes that don't explode but huge cracks open in the Earth's crust and lava just starts bubbling out, oozing across the landscape, releasing tons of toxic gases.
