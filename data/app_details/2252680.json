That will allow us to start working on the seasonal events and a few other things.<br><br>Along with this system, Larry &amp; Barry will have the random stock that they promise in their event, and we will fine tune some vegetable stuff.<br><br>Finally, the main menu will show some of the tabs listed as &quot;coming soon&quot; and the expandable memory chip system will be added, to unlock new craftable recipes.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2252680/extras/02_0002_03.png?t=1734604029\" /><br><br>The third update will focus on house upgrades, which we will be able to do by talking to Grubert, the carpenter. And why do we want a bigger house if we can't decorate it? Well, don't worry, because together with the upgrade system, we will add the memory chips with indoor furniture.<br><br>In parallel, the tool upgrade systems, food recipes and of course, the ability to eat, and the weather (thanks to the previous update with the calendar) will be added.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2252680/extras/02_0009_04.png?t=1734604029\" /><br><br>This update will be a big one, because it will add the whole layer of social relationships with characters, events and dialogues depending on the level of friendship. Initially only the first events will be available with each NPC, and the rest will be added with each update.<br><br>Accompanying this system, another of the menu tabs will be unlocked, the messaging tab. Through which we will be able to send and receive emails with neighbors.<br><br>Alongside these systems, new furniture sets and story events will be added.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2252680/extras/02_0008_05.png?t=1734604029\" /><br><br>One of the important points of Farlands is &quot;peaceful&quot; combat, but that can't be done if there is only one enemy in the mines. In this update, new hostile mobs will be added and the second mine in Hafnir will be unlocked.<br><br>Additionally, new furniture, candidate and story events will be unlocked.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2252680/extras/02_0007_06.png?t=1734604029\" /><br><br>A new planet will be available! Vanadian, the desert planet, whose days last so long that depending on when you arrive, you will see a perpetual day or night.<br><br>Vanadian will come with new resources to collect, insects, fish and a merchant with his own stock of rarities.<br><br>Additionally, new events with neighbors, a new story event, and new furniture sets will be added.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2252680/extras/02_0006_07.png?t=1734604029\" /><br><br>If things go well up to this point, 0.7 will serve the team to clean up, fix and improve the systems that are already implemented, here we will use this update to iron out the rough edges and leave everything well rounded. But of course, it will also bring things for you:<br><br>As with every update, new events with neighbors, story events and furniture sets will be added.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2252680/extras/02_0005_08.png?t=1734604029\" /><br><br>And after polishing and cleaning, we return to the charge with new systems; the construction of stables and the space animal care system. After this update we will be able to build stables of different classes on the farm and adopt creatures that will give us resources with which to earn money.<br><br>Along with this, the same of the previous updates: New story events, with neighbors and furniture to go rounding out the experience.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2252680/extras/02_0004_09.png?t=1734604029\" /><br><br>And after all the progress that has been made in relationships with neighbors, the time has come for weddings. With a romanceable candidate with whom we have the relationship to the maximum, we will be able to get married and when we do it... things will happen.<br><br>Along with this, it will advance the story a bit more and some furniture and decorations will be added.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2252680/extras/02_0003_10.png?t=1734604029\" /><br><br>And finally we come to update 1.0, which will allow you to complete the game, although it will not be the end of the development, as there will still be pending things that will be added after this update.<br><br>Here what we will have is a new planet, Darmstad, with the third mine of the game and its own set of oxygen mechanics. At the same time, the story will progress to the endgame and Farlands can be completed (although not 100%).<br><br><strong>WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?</strong><br><br>After this, we have a lot of things left to do: Steam achievements, story events up to 100% completion of the ark, a whole planet!<br><br>All these things will be added throughout the updates when we make adjustments to the roadmap, or after completing it, closing the last stages of development and completing everything we have pending.<br><br>As I said at the beginning, this roadmap is tentative, it is only an approximation of what we will be doing, and because of the way we work, many systems will be moving from one side to another in order to have a smooth development, both for us and for you.<br><br>Still, I hope you will join us in this adventure, and play Farlands along with us with each update, to see how things are progressing, and how the game is completed around us.<br><br>Thank you very much!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2252680/extras/logo_description.png?t=1734604029\" /><br><br>Seeking a lifestyle change, you saw an offer you couldn\u2019t refuse: an entire planet going for a bargain price!
