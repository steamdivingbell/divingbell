{"about_the_game":"Have you been wanting to include a game section where your heroes shrink, but don\u2019t have giant plants to help sell the illusion? Do you want to make a cute fairy village where they all live in mushroom houses? Then check out Big Garden Tiles! This tile pack contains tilesets to help add even more nature and magic to your maps!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith flowers that tower over your heroes and acorns the size of their heads, it\u2019ll be obvious that they\u2019ve fallen down the rabbit hole into a new and magical world! Giant beds of roses and tulips along with house-sized mushrooms let you create amazing towns for fairies and garden gnomes, and the included interior sets offer up some perfect furniture to decorate their homes and create the forest home of their dreams for these magical creatures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd if your game doesn\u2019t include adventuring through overgrown parks? Then you could still make use of the normal-sized plants to make great gardens. Add some cheery daffodils to front yards, and show how lazy certain NPCs are by covering their lawns with dandelions!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdd some fun new tiny adventures to your game with Big Garden Tiles!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Big and small garden items<br />\r\n* Exterior and interior tiles and sprites<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTerms of Use:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* This pack is for use in RPG Maker Series or the engine of your choice.<br />\r\n* OK to be used in Commercial projects<br />\r\n* Contents can be edited<br />\r\n* OK for use in games with gore<br />\r\n* OK for use in adult-rated games","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1812310?t=1739470923","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1812310?t=1739470923","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1812310/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739470923","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1812310/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739470923","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Have you been wanting to include a game section where your heroes shrink, but don\u2019t have giant plants to help sell the illusion?
