{"about_the_game":"<strong>Arcade Attack Anthology</strong> is a 4-in-1 game collection featuring 4 old-school arcade games (just in case the name didn't make it obvious enough). You compete with everyone around the globe to put your name on top of the online leaderboards - I don't think I need to describe online highscores to you, tho, you know what this is.
