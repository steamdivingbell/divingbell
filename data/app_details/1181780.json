{"about_the_game":"Customization and diversity lie at the heart of ASCENDANTS Rising, a revolutionary, CO-OP Action-RPG where players team up, and battle their way across the Multiverse with Incarnates, powerful characters from across space and time. Whether you\u2019re playing as a Healer, Striker, or Protector, your unique Incarnate will be able to master countless combinations of abilities, as well as Artefacts: mighty weapons that can be infused and leveled up with an array of gems. With three game modes (Coliseum, Dungeons, &amp; Raids), randomly generated bosses, and a story stretching across numerous themed worlds ranging from Medieval Fantasy, Lovecraftian Horror, Sci-Fi, as well as Urban Fantasy, there is always something new for you and your friends to experience.
