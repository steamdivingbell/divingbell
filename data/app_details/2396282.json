{"about_the_game":"Piper Pawnee ag and utility airplanes have earned a reputation for friendly handling while being capable of everything from crop dusting to towing gliders, banners and beyond.  The Hangar 9\u00ae Pawnee Brave 20cc is a giant-scale ARF model of the larger, more powerful, and more capable Pawnee Brave variant.  It can be powered with an electric motor, glow, or gas engine to deliver a wide range of performance from scale-like to sport aerobatic flying capabilities.  Functional flaps improve slow-speed handling while also offering versatile takeoff and landing abilities.  LED landing lights and a clear canopy add to the scale look and flying experience, while tundra-style wheels/tires make it possible to fly from paved, dirt, gravel, and grass surfaces.  The factory-applied UltraCote\u00ae film and painted-fiberglass parts finish saves you time and looks great, plus the two-piece, plug-in wing makes it easy to transport and store.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2396282?t=1710365726","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2396282?t=1710365726","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396282/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1710365726","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396282/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1710365726","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Piper Pawnee ag and utility airplanes have earned a reputation for friendly handling while being capable of everything from crop dusting to towing gliders, banners and beyond.
