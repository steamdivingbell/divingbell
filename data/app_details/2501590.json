{"about_the_game":"Can you make it to the top of the Tower of Friendship? Run, jump, climb, fall all the way back down, and do it all again. Inspired by games like Only Up! and Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy, this hardcore platformer will test your abilities and your patience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStart at the bottom of the tower and slowly climb higher and higher. Run along easy paths, jump between spaced platforms, and even grab ledges and pull yourself up if a jump falls a little short. Beware though, there are no checkpoints, and falling off usually leads to falling all the way back down.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay by yourself or with up to 7 other friends! Be nice and lay down to extend platforms and make hard jumps easier for others, or push each other off when the falls are the highest. There is also a hide-and-seek mode, which allows you to better explore the environment and play various games with your friends.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere will also be rest stops along the way, with large, safe platforms you can relax on before continuing the climb up. Listen to some nice music, take in the scenery, or go grab a snack. Some of the rest stops will have minigames you can play with your friends, like sumo wrestling, ball pits, or parkour competitions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is not for everyone, if you get frustrated easily, or don't want to be stuck doing the same thing for a long time, this game is probably not for you. However, you will be able to save your progress when you quit the game, so you can pick back up where you left off for your next play session.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCan you successfully navigate to the top of the tower? Watch your step and make calculated decisions, or send it and brazenly climb. But whatever you do, never stop squeebing.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2501590/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1701296321","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2501590/page.bg.jpg?t=1701296321","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2501590/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1701296321","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2501590/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1701296321","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":2630070,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Can you make it to the top of the Tower of Friendship?
