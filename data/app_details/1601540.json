This elegant yet powerful tool is one of your best assets. Keep in mind that this insanely acrobatic save will set you back by 10% stamina.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1601540/extras/gif_save_butterfly.gif?t=1676858177\" /><br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Super Stacked Pads Power Slide</h2></strong><br>Yes! You read that right. You will be able to unlock this baby after a lot of work - it's worth it. If the puck gets to where you should be before you do, turn on the jets, stack them pads and fly to your destination before the opponent knows what happened. You'll be tired after that as your stamina will take a 25% hit.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1601540/extras/gif_save_stacked.jpg?t=1676858177\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1601540/extras/red_line3.png?t=1676858177\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1601540/extras/header2.png?t=1676858177\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1601540/extras/stamina-bar-anim.gif?t=1676858177\" /><br><br>Your <strong>stamina</strong> regenerates over time but you do have another weapon in your tool belt to help you out.
