{"about_the_game":"Jordan Jones, mild mannered engineer, was showcasing a nuclear reactor at an anime convention, when the worst of disasters struck. A magical substance known as contrivium was spilled onto his reactor model, causing the convention center to undergo a magical girl zombie apocalypse. Both merchandise and attendee alike have undergone startling transformations into malevolent magical girls. In the ensuing chaos, Jordan was bitten by a radioactive cosplayer and became the superheroine known as Lunar Heart Skydancer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlong with her friends, she now must defeat the evil sorcerer-of-culture, Victor Haqdev, who is using his foul chaos magics to force every animal, mineral, and vegetable into his harem of magical girls. Will Jordan and the other survivors escape this anime-convention-gone-wrong, or will she experience humiliating objectification?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPIF is a top-down shooter with a shmup soul. Dodge hundreds of bullets in 360 degree danmaku. You'll not only need reflexes, but clever wits to analyze the challenging spell card patterns. In retro fashion, the game has few features save one: save you the player as much time as possible and keep you engaged in the action, with perhaps a few minutes of indulgence into a very comedic plot.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"A Typical Survival Game Start","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2788070/8755a3b4149a11fe2ffff00ffd2399fe91d754db.jpg"},{"name":"Animism's Reductio ad Absurdum","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2788070/4c79ef199b3afcd949150bdd9c911aff541cf1de.jpg"},{"name":"Saw the Light","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2788070/d40b8738472a9189bfdf7ee9fac52c024332386c.jpg"},{"name":"It's For Tobacco Use Only, I Swear","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2788070/e4b183b7e088df428979c0a5c541adf49f7600b9.jpg"},{"name":"Tacticool Operator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2788070/4bf4f5c670874eca7045385fe432eb8079ba317c.jpg"},{"name":"Still a Better Ending than Most Anime","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2788070/5b6e67bb43ddb5a13964b660819244cd7a69fbd0.jpg"}],"total":6},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2788070/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1709682012","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2788070/page.bg.jpg?t=1709682012","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2788070/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1709682012","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2788070/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1709682012","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"This game is naughty enough that you'll not want to play it in front of your grandmother.
