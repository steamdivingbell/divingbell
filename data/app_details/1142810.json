{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A ball, two goals, and... toasters! Welcome to Toasterball.</h2><strong>Toasterball</strong> is a multiplayer <strong>physics-based sports game,</strong> quick to learn and perfect for good old game nights on a couch with friends (1-4 players local multiplayer). Because you are playing as toasters, you can naturally expect some chaotic physics, random situations, electrical hazard, and more burnt toasts than you can ever imagine. There is also a real learning curve, with pro moves and enough gameplay variants to keep on surprising you for hours.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1142810/extras/KeyVideo.gif?t=1714308692\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Easy to learn, hard to master</h2>The basics of Toasterball are very simple: just press one of the two buttons on your toaster for a short time, release it\u2026 and voil\u00e0! <strong>The longer you press, the higher your toast will fly.</strong> Each ejection also makes you jump, allowing you to hop around the field and push your opponent into tight situations. The more you play, the more pro moves you\u2019ll discover, from double-jumping to the deadly <strong>\u201cTURBOFLIP\u201d!</strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1142810/extras/moves.gif?t=1714308692\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unexpected variants</h2>After each goal, a <strong>random gameplay variant</strong> is selected. New ball physics, lava pits, portals, moving platforms or explosions\u2026 <strong>No two matches are the same!</strong> The game includes a total of 24 unique variants, not counting modifiers like the size of toasters or the number of toasts which can add even more possibilities.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1142810/extras/variants.gif?t=1714308692\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Iconic arenas</h2>Visit the 5 unique arenas from the game: the legendary <strong>Toasterball Arena,</strong> the mysterious jungles of the <strong>Panachado</strong> Forest, the historic <strong>Breadington Square</strong> street court, the majestic castle of the <strong>Tartembourg</strong> village and the warm beaches of <strong>Porto Rada.</strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1142810/extras/maps.gif?t=1714308692\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">AI toasters</h2>Meet <strong>Beep, Boop,</strong> and <strong>Bleep-Bloop,</strong> your new-generation AI toasters.
