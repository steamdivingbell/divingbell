{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Signal is a survival crafter like no other. Your desperate search to find a missing loved one has crash-landed you on a planet. You learn this planet has made false promises to many that have come here before you, resulting in indefinite entrapment and a life of servitude -- including yours. Explore an elaborate, everchanging world that reacts to your progression and choices. Scavenge, build, extract and survive your way through a complex, interconnected biome system as you reveal the true intentions of this sentient planet -- and why it has brought you here.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1830110/extras/CarTree__1_.gif?t=1734717818\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>SURVIVE AND EXPLORE</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">To survive and explore this strange planet, you\u2019ll need to scavenge resources, craft useful items and upgrade your gear.
