{"about_the_game":"Don't Feed The Slimes! is a platformer with physics where you play as hungry slimes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSlimes can deflate, to crawl through narrow obstacles, or try to jump over them, and even grab different objects and use them in their evil plans. They want to eat everything they see, if there is nothing left to eat, they move to other places and eat all the food there. Little by little the complexity of the levels will grow and slimes will meet more and more obstacles on their path.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWondering why you should not feed the Slimes?
