{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Overview</h2>This is a Third-person shooting indie game. Players will kill zombies, loot, complete quests, level up, and unlock new areas and AI teammates in a semi open map. The game includes day-night system, custom dressing, loot lost on death, and simple hivemind AI.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Background</h2>This game takes place in the near future world, where the player plays the role of a <strong>company</strong> employee whose consciousness has been uploaded to a prosthesis by the <strong>company</strong>. The main task is to find members of the recycle team who have lost contact at the 9212 E270 recycle point. A 3rd level bio infection source has been found at the recycle point, and the player needs to be aware of potential biological threats and maintain sufficient energy supply for the prosthesis.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2>This game contains some basic elements of a semi open world: day and night system, random loot/enemy spawning, custom dressing, etc. On this basis, the game map will generate one or more <strong>hivemind(s)</strong>, which will grow and produce <strong>chambers</strong>. <strong>Chambers</strong> help the <strong>hivemind</strong> grow and release spores, which significantly affect the movement of the prosthesis. The total energy of the <strong>hivemind</strong> is limited, and it relies on simple learning algorithms to decide whether to use energy to generate zombies or produce <strong>chambers</strong>. It is best for players not to let it grow.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2479820/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1687367963","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2479820/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1687367963","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2479820/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1687367963","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2479820/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1687367963","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Overview</h2>This is a Third-person shooting indie game.
