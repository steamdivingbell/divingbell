{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Dungeon Crawl Classics #82: Bride of the Black Manse</h2>  <br> A Level 3 Adventure for DCC RPG <br> <br> <br> <br> This updated 2nd printing includes all-new cover art by Stefan Poag, as well as a fresh editing pass and a brand-new backup adventure! &quot;Floating Oasis of the Ascended God&quot; by Stephen Newton, in which the player characters are sent to a floating island where they encounter bizarre underlings of an absent deity! <br> <br> <br> Centuries past, Lady Ilse ascended to scion of House Liis by trading the archdevil Mammon what he wanted most: her immortal soul - and a diabolical betrothal. The triumph proved hollow, for every year on the eve of her fell covenant, she was beset by visions of Mammon and her foul promise. Seeking to save herself, she was buried alive, swaddled in the holy symbols of a dozen divergent faiths. This desperate ploy held Mammon at bay for centuries...but a devil can afford to wait a very long time. <br> After hundreds of years, the last of the holy wards has fallen. The devil has come to collect his due. Tonight a storm crashes against the ancient manor house and forgotten spirits rise from the muck and mire. The fallen belfry tolls once more, announcing the hellish fete. As the adventurers arrive to explore the Black Manse, Mammon calls for his winsome bride. He will leave with a soul at the end of the night. The only question is: <br> Whose?  <br> <br> Bonus Adventure: This module also includes the bonus adventure <br> Floating Oasis of the Ascended God , by Stephen Newton! In this level 1 adventure, the player characters are sent to a floating island where they encounter bizarre underlings of an absent deity! &quot;","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3124990/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1723554140","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3124990/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1723554140","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3124990/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1723554140","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3124990/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1723554140","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Dungeon Crawl Classics #82: Bride of the Black Manse</h2>  <br> A Level 3 Adventure for DCC RPG <br> <br> <br> <br> This updated 2nd printing includes all-new cover art by Stefan Poag, as well as a fresh editing pass and a brand-new backup adventure! &quot;Floating Oasis of the Ascended God&quot; by Stephen Newton, in which the player characters are sent to a floating island where they encounter bizarre underlings of an absent deity! <br> <br> <br> Centuries past, Lady Ilse ascended to scion of House Liis by trading the archdevil Mammon what he wanted most: her immortal soul - and a diabolical betrothal.
