{"about_the_game":"Somewhere tiny, deep in the fractal foam, there is a strange and vivid world... a world with two dimensions, weird noises, and the all-consuming urge to gather more points. Welcome to Fractus! Blast your way through waves of organisms to release the portal to the next level, where you can do it all again! There is an infinite number of levels, but things get difficult quickly. How far can you get?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFractus is an abstract twin stick shooter for Windows and Linux. It is a unique visual experience and a challenging game. Most of the graphics are fractal objects that are procedurally generated on the GPU. It also features an odd medley of guitar-generated sound effects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRequires a twin stick controller, e.g. a USB Xbox controller or similar.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/656280/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1696880622","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/656280/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1696880622","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/656280/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1696880622","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/656280/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1696880622","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Somewhere tiny, deep in the fractal foam, there is a strange and vivid world... a world with two dimensions, weird noises, and the all-consuming urge to gather more points.
