{"about_the_game":"Send your heroes deep into hot and cold dungeons with the Summerwind Saga - Magma &amp; Frozen Caves pack! Elv Games is back with another tileset to expand their Summerwind Saga series, with all the tiles you could need to make icy caverns and lava-filled volcanic interiors. Create cool caves where snowy floors slowly give way to ice and blue-tinged walls where spikes of jagged ice burst up from the floor, or have brown stone slowly ooze magma the deeper your heroes go in the dungeon!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA2, 5 A5, and 13 B sheets can help you build mazes of caves for your heroes to explore. Send them to the frozen North where icy caves are filled with angled walls and slippery floor puzzles, and reward them with powerful crystals that can strengthen your party and treasure chests full of goodies at the end maze. Each tileset comes in two sizes so you can use them in MV/MZ or Ace without having to do any resizing yourself, or use them in your favorite engine. So if you\u2019ve been needing more variation in your cave dungeons, or just want to add some cool mines for your players to explore, check out the Summerwind Saga - Magma &amp; Frozen Caves!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures: <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMagma Caves tilesets<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Lava/Magma tiles<br />\r\n- Stone bridges and pillars<br />\r\n- Stone crystals<br />\r\n- Wooden boxes, desks, chairs<br />\r\n- Treasure chests<br />\r\n- Crystals<br />\r\n- Puzzle objects<br />\r\n- Lava walls, stones<br />\r\n- Multiple types of grounds, walls<br />\r\n- Walls and Ground (with and without lava)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrozen Caves tilesets<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Multiple ground and wall tiles<br />\r\n- Wood objects<br />\r\n- Stone objects<br />\r\n- Crystals<br />\r\n- Frozen water<br />\r\n- Boxes, Broken boxes<br />\r\n- Treasure chest<br />\r\n- Lots of props to create Frozen Caves!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3364280/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734025000","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3364280/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1734025000","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3364280/145a0c3ede9e67e52ae4e07ac4659c159498eb95/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734025000","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3364280/145a0c3ede9e67e52ae4e07ac4659c159498eb95/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734025000","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Send your heroes deep into hot and cold dungeons with the Summerwind Saga - Magma &amp; Frozen Caves pack!
