{"about_the_game":"Volume\u2019s original soundtrack is ambient and slightly melodic, juxtaposed by full, orchestral Hollywood action sound. Composed by David Housden (Thomas Was Alone), the soundtrack mixes the futuristic setting of Volume with its Robin Hood inspiration by utilizing period instruments. Volume\u2019s soundtrack includes the mandolin, a dulcimer, an Irish harp, an erhu\u2028 (a Chinese two-stringed bowed musical instrument).<br><br>Strings were recorded by Pete Whitfield; a musician, arranger and orchestrator whose CV includes work for One Direction, \u2028Foxes and Kanye West. Soprano Riva Taylor provides vocals with mixing and mastering Daniel James. <br><br>&quot;I hope it will keep the player on edge and keep the player\u2019s experience interesting because it\u2019s so different. I feel our ears are attracted to contrast in sound and that\u2019s something I\u2019ve experimented with a lot. Time will tell how it\u2019s received, but I\u2019m really happy with it now.&quot; - Housden<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Volume: Original Soundtrack</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>01.
