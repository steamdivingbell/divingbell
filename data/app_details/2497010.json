{"about_the_game":"In XXXX, there were multiple unknown spatial fluctuations on Earth, with strange beasts (some with strange abilities, codenamed EB) and unknown armies (mainly using mechs for combat, codenamed D&amp;D) appearing at the centers of multiple fluctuations. At the same time, there were strange changes in the local environment around the fluctuation space, and from then on, the Earth fell into a tripartite struggle. After a period of time, humans have initially mastered some of the techniques of D&amp;D for manufacturing mechs and training pilots. At the same time, due to the small number of D&amp;D, their power development is relatively slow, and most of the EB stay in place, which to some extent limits the development of D&amp;D, causing the three sides to temporarily maintain a balanced state.
