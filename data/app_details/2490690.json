{"about_the_game":"Action! Danger! Coins! What more could you want from a game?! Jump Tracks is a game all about timing and reflexes. Zoom off the tracks, clear each level, and try not to die along the way in this tiny and twitchy arcade tapper. It's harder than it looks! You'll need precision and laser focus to become a Jump Tracks pro... good luck!<br><br>Jump Tracks is pure skill based fun! Each level challenges you to collect all the coins by jumping at the right times. Sounds easy! But miss a jump and you'll be sent careening into a spike wall or off the level entirely. Deceptively simple yet hard to master, this is the perfect game for quick bursts of actiony goodness or pass-and-play fun with friends!<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 42 levels across 7 worlds.<br></li><li> One-button gameplay controls - fun for all ages!<br></li><li> Bonus level goals: number of jumps &amp; time.<br></li><li> Play with mouse, keyboard, or gamepad.<br></li><li> A simple, fun, and small game!
