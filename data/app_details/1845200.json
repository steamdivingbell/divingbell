Collect resources, build an island, move in guests and begin to craft household items? Sit down, and begin to relax with Pixacrea Island! As a new scientist you are tasked with helping in the discovery of a brand new island that has never been touched by mankind. Your goal is simple, collect as many Pixacrea from the island as you can for research, and begin to build the island to help aid you in the research. Choose your starting Pixacrea, and battle each Pixacrea you face to capture it's shard in the name of science, design parts of the island however you'd like, customize your character with unique skins to choose from, as well as craft, build, and buy items for your home! <br><br>We mentioned skins, and purchasable items, but there are ABSOLUTELY ZERO MTX in Pixacrea Island. None, Zip, Natta, every item, ever skin, every thing in the game will all be purchasable using in game currency, through achievements, quests, and crafting!
