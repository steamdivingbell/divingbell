{"about_the_game":"Christmas spirit during the zombie apocalypse: you could put on your Santa costume on Christmas Eve. But that's not all it's supposed to be. You roam through an abandoned shopping center in search of Christmas presents and a forgotten reindeer sleigh. When Christmas music lures zombies, you have to make momentous decisions.<br>You can expect seven endings, German voice-overs (with the original voices of the authors), and hand-drawn characters and backgrounds. A visual novel from the world of Zombie Zone Germany, a German literature and role-playing game series from Amr\u00fbn Publishing.<br>The Game is only available in German.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What is the Zombie Zone Germany franchise?</h2><br>Since 2015, Amr\u00fbn has been publishing the Zombie Zone Germany (ZZG) book series. Author Thorsten Exter developed the overarching scenario: in the spring of 2020, Germany will be hit by a zombie apocalypse.<br>In the meantime, the view into a near future has turned into a world in an alternative timeline, which has been fleshed out and interpreted in individual ways by around 45 authors so far. Together, they have created a diverse anthology series with plenty of local color, from the L\u00fcneburg Heath to Berlin. The book series currently comprises nine novellas, two anthologies and one novel. It will be continued on an ongoing basis.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The team behind Zombie Zone Germany - The Roleplaying Game</h2><br>Since 2021 we - some authors and a graphic designer - have been working on a roleplaying game (Pen &amp; Paper) adaptation of the book series. We want to make the world described in the books playable and experienceable according to your own ideas. To this end, we have created a rulebook and a few short adventures, which we will take to role-playing conventions.<br>After we published a boxed game book - a solo adventure - in spring, we would like to surprise you with another interactive solo adventure for Christmas. This time you could not only read it, but also play it.
