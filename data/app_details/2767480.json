{"about_the_game":"Alien Horizon is a sci-fi survival city builder set on an inhospitable alien planet.<br><br>Faced with imminent destruction of Earth, humanity pooled together their resources and sent sleeper ships to nearby potentially habitable planets. But this one turned out to be much less habitable than expected. Can you survive anyway?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">From one ship to a colony</h2>Build your colony around the sleeper ship, containing 1000 last survivors from Earth. Construct power sources, housing, infrastructure and factories to ensure comfort of your colonists and provide the colony with all the resources it needs. Manage bus lines, set laws and provide services, making sure your colonists are happy, healthy and productive. Each colonist is their own simulated individual.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">On your own</h2>Earth is dead, so it can't help you out here. If you didn't bring something with you, tough luck. Explore the landscape around you to find all the other ships from your fleet that carry supplies, and survey resource deposits to eventually produce your own.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Complex resource management</h2>Manage complex production chains to produce 86 different resources, each with a realistic recipe. Build logistics hubs and set up storages to make sure all of them get to where they need.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Preview alpha</h2>Even though this is a free preview, it's a full-fledged game of its own, with no time or content limitations. It is possible to achieve a self-sufficient colony. The proper game is still in development and will be released later. You can support its development by buying the Donation packs.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2767480/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1706634017","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2767480/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1706634017","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2767480/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1706634017","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2767480/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1706634017","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Alien Horizon is a sci-fi survival city builder set on an inhospitable alien planet.<br><br>Faced with imminent destruction of Earth, humanity pooled together their resources and sent sleeper ships to nearby potentially habitable planets.
