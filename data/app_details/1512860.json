Because of the number of playable classes available in the game, players each have their own unique team and experience in Pixelot. <br>- The game also features dungeons with sliding ice puzzles, mine cart riddles, and more. <br>- Pixelot is designed to be a game that is really easy to pick up and play whenever and where ever with features like auto save, party healing after each fight, and a quest log to remind you where you left off. <br>Pixelot is truly a love letter to classic rpgs, and the greatness that was the 90's and 2000's eras.<br><br>The story in Pixelot follows your custom character that is pulled into this world by the mysterious figure Astrum. After years of peace since the dark lord was sealed away by the 6 elemental crystals, his touch on the world is growing stronger each day. The player must venture out into this unknown world, making many allies, protecting villages from wolves and monsters, overthrowing corrupt leaders, and passing many trials of strength, patience and virtue.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build your army</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Make the story your own by Creating a custom character from 6 classes<br></li><li> 30+ unique recruitable characters and classes<br></li><li> Promote your characters to new classes at level 60</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1512860/extras/recruitKyle.gif?t=1703015451\" /> <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1512860/extras/promote.gif?t=1703015451\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Save the world</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Collect the 6 elemental crystals<br></li><li> 15 dungeons to explore<br></li><li> 500+ items, 250+ maps, and 200+ chests to collect</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1512860/extras/salamandro.gif?t=1703015451\" /> <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1512860/extras/icewalk2.gif?t=1703015451\" /> <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1512860/extras/chestOpen.gif?t=1703015451\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Continue the journey</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Infinite tower dungeon with 50 unique floors<br></li><li> 14 Boss challenge mode<br></li><li> Collect all 6 legendary weapons<br></li><li> Post-game labyrinth dungeon</li></ul><br>Music is developed by Kairi Sawler, Aaron Krogh, Nashlaga, Karstenholymoly, and Stefan Kartenberg.
