To open the portal, the player will have to find the key/keys. The player can roll around specific cube platforms, thus changing the orientation of the level. The player will come up again obstacles that can be quite puzzling. The complexity and level of puzzle solving required will gradually increase as the game progresses. Some areas of the level will not be reachable until skills are unlocked, which are unlocked by finding Atoms in the levels to purchase these upgrades. The player will be working against the clock at all times, 60 seconds for each level. However, the items on some levels can freeze time, flip time back, or make things harder.
