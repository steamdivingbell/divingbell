{"about_the_game":"<strong>Find out what happened</strong><br>On October 26, 2005, a strange call came to the police at night. In the application, the owner of the house said that some dark figure was watching him from the forest, and strange sounds were constantly heard in the house, as if someone or something was crawling along the walls. Police officer Harry Whippet went to this challenge. Nobody saw him again. Only a week later, footage from a police officer's body camera was found.<br><br><strong>Learn about Rutman.</strong><br>This is a monster that lives in the dense dark forests of a small town. Rootman tortures and kills everyone who wanders into his domain. The legend speaks of murders, cursed artifacts, and the supernatural behavior of trees. It is said that its roots go deep into the earth, and Rutman's body consists of twisted gnarled branches and roots. No one knows how old he is and where he came from, but the townspeople are still afraid of him. He has the ability to manipulate surrounding trees and plants, using them to trap his victims. It is said that, once in its grasp, the roots tightly wrap around the body, squeezing the life out of the victim. The town lives in fear of Rootman, never going too far into the forest for fear of encountering the monster. It is said that on quiet, moonless nights, Rootman's whisper can be heard through the trees, reminding the city of his omnipresent presence and of the danger lurking in the forest.<br><br><strong>Play with the body camera effect.</strong><br>Experience realistic camera shake, sound and visual effects. Feel the incredible effect of immersion and presence in the center of events.<br><br><strong>Feel the horror.</strong><br>In the game you will find a tense atmosphere and suspense. And sometimes you have to jump up and down in your chair.<br><br><strong>Try demo and add to wishlist!</strong><br>For now, you can play a short demo, or rather a prototype, that was created by me and my wife at Global Game Jam 2023. If you like the demo, we will make a full game out of it.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2316710/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730777207","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2316710/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1730777207","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2316710/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730777207","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2316710/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730777207","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2317750,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<strong>Find out what happened</strong><br>On October 26, 2005, a strange call came to the police at night.
