{"about_the_game":"&quot;Pathfinder RPG - Pathfinder Companion: Faiths and Philosophies<br> <br>  <br> There's more to faith than simply choosing a god.

Whether as a servant of a powerful deity, a devotee of a world-shaping philosophy, or a zealous atheist, it's time to claim the power of your convictions with this guide to devotion--religious or otherwise. <br> Beliefs are nothing without champions.
