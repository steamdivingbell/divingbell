All units can equip any of the 7 default weapon types, which include swords, axes, spears, bows, light tomes, dark tomes, and staves. They can also equip any of the 3 armor types to protect them from either magic damage, physical damage, or a bit of both. Drag and drop equipment in the pre-battle menu to change your units' equipment.<br><br>Want a unit to be a walking tank who hits like a truck? Equip them with a greataxe and heavy armor to maximize the rate at which their strength, HP, and defense grow as they level up.
