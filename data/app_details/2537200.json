{"about_the_game":"The Bomb Rush Cyberfunk Soundtrack is the compilation of all the wild and varied music found in Bomb Rush Cyberfunk in high quality WAV format. It's a journey through different genres and personal styles from all over the world. There is one thing they all have in common: they all represent a connection between tech (the cyber) and the streets (the funk).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe are proud to have Hideki Naganuma, Ethan Goldhammer, Leopard Davinci &amp; Louis 707, Proux, Olli and SKALP bring severely pumping funk to the table. Heavy beats are brought in through the likes of Bx'treme, kidkanevil, Charodey Jeddy and Legove. There's house with wev, Sebastian Knight and Color Plus. Artist like Reso and GRRL will fry your brain twice over (in the bad good way), but you'll be soothed back to health by CYBERMILK, Dom McLennon and Knxwledge. Of course you can't go wrong with Klaus Veen, 2 Mello and Swami Sound. Finishing you off with the really out there, otherworldly vibes, we have soia, Kilowatts and Doctor Lazer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsing his experience in dancing, the game director has personally picked most of all existing, danceable music by artists who have a strong voice and noticeable authorship. Artists in their own right, we are inviting you to look their names up on the web and give the rest of their catalogue a listen. That is to say the artists on this soundtrack can only truly be featured, not hired. For that reason, the majority of the revenue of this of this soundtrack will go to the artists.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2537200/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1692799015","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2537200/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1692799015","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2537200/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1692799015","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2537200/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1692799015","categories":[{"description":"Additional High-Quality Audio","id":50}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Bomb Rush Cyberfunk Soundtrack is the compilation of all the wild and varied music found in Bomb Rush Cyberfunk in high quality WAV format.
