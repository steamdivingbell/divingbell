{"about_the_game":"Six months ago, you died and were reborn. A vampire. A predator. Not a mere creature of the night, but one of its masters.

Vampires have finally been exposed, and though your existence is tolerated, your new thirst is not. You came to the one city willing to promise a fresh start, only to find suspicion and starvation waiting on its dark streets. But death could not hold you, and fear will not hold you back. When the sun goes down, outcasts *rise*.<br><br>It\u2019s time to seize the night by its throat.<br><br><strong>WELCOME TO NIGHTHAWKS</strong><br><br>Enter a twisted, darkly comic city where humans and vampires are struggling to live together. Take over a failing nightclub on the wrong side of the tracks, and turn it into your personal empire through seduction, intimidation, and careful use of secret supernatural Gifts. Befriend and recruit fellow outcasts, digging deep into their stories and harnessing their skills. Explore a fully voiced, lavishly written world of dark shadows and bright neon, where your every decision will push the world towards a bold united future, or forever destroy any hope for peaceful coexistence.<br><br><strong>FEATURES</strong><br>                                           <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Climb from rags to riches as a modern Vampire<br></li><li>Build your nightclub into a true nocturnal empire<br></li><li>Meet a cast of off-beat, fully voiced characters<br></li><li>Indulge your inhumanity\u2014 but be home before sunrise<br></li><li>Engage in strategic combat against humans and vampires alike</li></ul><br><strong>MEET THE TEAM</strong><br><br>Nighthawks is written and designed by Richard Cobbett (Sunless Sea/Sunless Skies) with art by Ben Chandler (Unavowed, Technobabylon, the Blackwell Series), and produced by Wadjet Eye Games.
