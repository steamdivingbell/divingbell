At midnight on a weekday, you find yourself working late alone in an eerily empty office. Suddenly the telephone rings. The game is short with only two chapters, while it tells a really creepy story. There are several unexpected twists during the game. You may reach different ends depending on your 'overtime performance'!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3126210/extras/Overtime_Pay-\u4e3b\u5ba3\u4f20\u56fe-616\u00d7353.jpg?t=1731655400\" /><br><br>As a diligent employee of the company, you need to be careful to follow the telephone's instructions to print documents and receive faxes. New instructions will be given as time passes. What started out as boring overtime is starting to get dangerously weird. Getting the job done is necessary for you to get your overtime pay, but don't forget that surviving is too\u2026<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Designer's Comment:</h2>Have you ever had the experience of working late into the night alone? Tired, exhausted, sleepy, but still have to repeat the most boring work in the world for that little overtime pay. The game may catch you on the overtime simulation, but when wired things happen one after the other, you might suspect it's just a nightmare you had while slumped over your workstation. The fun doesn't stop here: The game initially stemmed from a few tongue-in-cheek rants, but as the game developed I began to try to express something deeper in this horror game. Can't say much about spoilers, but I\u2019m truly looking forward to your comments about the ending :)<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3126210/extras/Overtime_Pay-3_-_616.png?t=1731655400\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 10 - 20 minutes of gameplay<br></li><li> A nightmarish inescapable horror experience<br></li><li> Creepy and thought-provoking endings</li></ul><br>This game is created by <i>@<u>Obazu</u></i> with YAHAHA Horror Game Kit and YAHAHA assists the creator with packaging and publishing the game based on their request.
