{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Amuse the Architect</h2>The eccentric Architect of a utopian future society has decided to build a skyward city out of hexagon-shaped blocks. Unfortunately, the Architect is a perfectionist, and his ever-changing mood constantly alters the ideal plan. As his apprentice, it's your responsibility to fulfill his ever-changing wishes for the perfect possible layout and to earn his approval!<br><br>Blobbton is a bright and colorful world of hexagon-based puzzles. With its casual yet challenging-to-master approach, players of all skill levels can enjoy quick and peaceful puzzle-solving sessions!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Dynamic puzzle tasks:</strong> Build hexagon-based city blocks to complete changing tasks on the game board. Put your pattern recognition skills to the test!<br></li><li><strong>Efficiency will be rewarded:</strong> Can you foresee the next moves? Strategize and optimize your actions to achieve the highest scores and earn the Architect's praise.<br></li><li><strong>Three game modes:</strong> Experience three different game modes, each presenting its unique set of challenges. There are satisfying puzzles to be solved for players of all skill levels.<br></li><li><strong>Short sessions:</strong> Solve puzzles casually at your convenience. Whether you have a few minutes or an hour, you may always dive into the world of Blobbton at your own pace.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Modes</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Spin It!:</strong> Someone has already placed buildings for the Architect, but unfortunately they are positioned horribly wrong. Here, your goal is to rotate building sets on the board to achieve the desired formation. Conquer levels of increasing difficulty and try to complete each level in the smallest amount of moves!<br></li><li><strong>Fit Them!:</strong> Your task is to arrange a fixed set of buildings according to the Architect's wishes. However, not all of the buildings are available to you at first! Completing the Architect's requests grants you access to additional buildings, and performing well might even earn you some helpful bonuses. Try to achieve the best possible score!<br></li><li><strong>Keep Up!:</strong> In this survival mode, the Architect presents constantly changing formations to you with a twist. The board will get smaller if you're unable to reuse existing buildings, making subsequent patterns increasingly challenging. Become an efficiency master to keep up with the Architect's wishes for as long as possible and reach for the high score!</li></ul><br>Blobbton is filled with challenges, creativity, and strategic thinking as you serve the Architect. Are you able to build the city of his dreams?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Team</h2>Blobbton was developed as a passion project by three Finnish individuals eager to explore their creativity through small indie games.
