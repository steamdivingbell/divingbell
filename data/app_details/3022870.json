I commissioned artists to create a fantasy world, and hide as many bunnies and carrots as they can inside it. Now it\u2019s your job to find them all! With 15 art pieces to choose from, and 1500+ bunnies and carrots, you will have a lot of searching to do.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Controls:</h2>Use your mouse to move around the image and zoom in / out. When you find a hidden object, click it and it will disappear. You can also use WASD to move and the arrow keys to zoom.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Difficulty:</h2>All levels start unlocked, your progress is saved as you play, and you have unlimited, unrestricted hints if you get stuck. Using hints will not ruin your score, or affect your ability to unlock achievements. Play at your own pace!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get immersed:</h2>Each painting has its own music to help you connect with the world, as you search for all the bunnies and carrots!.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Replayable</h2>You can restore a small number of bunnies and carrots back into a painting so you can find them again! It\u2019s much harder when there are only a few hidden objects left (especially randomly). You can also use up to 3 save slots so you can replay without progress loss. Alternatively, you can reset your progress for the entire game if you\u2019d like to start over.<br><br>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Perfect","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3022870/738c2ec8c37ed800324ebd8d4cde47640286a847.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Spaceship Cinema","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3022870/3577174a95ad47af9ee5b694410f2702622280e1.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Flags And Street Lights","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3022870/92086cf609205620f5a0263a1a87dc190d17bb41.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Happy Hairdressing","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3022870/0abb9ed058d5d8796989e4e5a24ff5cc28f81550.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Little City Festival Market","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3022870/a8c8a059d7e63b3a89c377915aa0b9a0a1cc4b4b.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Sunny Study Room","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3022870/d7dd83f3adc712f7f227bf70165a56e8798ab4d8.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Outdoor Table Service","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3022870/360970301eca8a6a8d32c3f885181064975e5c9d.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Nightmare Bedroom","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3022870/b13ea187416382042e67c85b3f1542aa50f33f35.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Volleyball Championship","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3022870/eeb0a479445868799e1dc88a203c07a2193def22.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Theatre Green Room","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3022870/ecd6a8d58c24ad7b0967c71700cef225031a4ba3.jpg"}],"total":16},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3022870/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1718974882","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3022870/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1718974882","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3022870/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718974882","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3022870/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718974882","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>You may also like</h1><p><br><br></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>A hidden object game where you must find all the bunnies and carrots to complete each level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2>\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f 15 Unique artworks<br>\u2753 1500+ Hidden objects total<br>\ud83d\udc07 750+ Bunnies<br>\ud83e\udd55 750+ Carrots<br>\ud83d\udca1 \u221e Unlimited hints if you get stuck<br>\u267b\ufe0f Restore a small number of bunnies / carrots to a painting so you can find them again! <br>\ud83c\udfb5 Music for each artwork (optional)<br>\ud83c\udfc6 Achievements<br>\u2328\ufe0f Use your keyboard to move / zoom in if you have no scroll wheel<br>\ud83d\udcbe 3x save slots<br>\ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f Reset progress entirely and play again<br>\ud83d\udd52 \u221e Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Context:</h2>The brief was simple.
