{"about_the_game":"A strange knight sat in front of a fire, darkness surrounding him. His sword stuck in the ground, covered in dried blood. He warns you against going any further, but the intrigue of what lies beyond far surpasses the instinct of self-preservation. <br><br>Play as a young thief and explore the dangerous ruins of a once-prosperous kingdom. Fight against hordes of terrifying monsters, make your way through challenging platforming sections, and discover the secret that lies at the very bottom of the ruins in this handcrafted experience.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2556930/extras/chrysolite_fight.gif?t=1729252932\" /><br><br>Chrysolite is a narrative-driven, pixel-art, 2D platformer with Soulslike inspirations<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Intriguing narrative</h2>There is more to these ruins than meets the eye.
