Over the following four-and-a-half decades, nearly 17,000 Geeps in 30 different models were built, and the line culminated with the GP60, which was produced from 1985 through 1994.

The most fundamental difference between the GP60 and its predecessors was the GP60\u2019s employment of EMD\u2019s 710-series 16-cylinder power plant which, at 3,800-horsepower, also made the GP60 the most powerful Geep ever constructed.
