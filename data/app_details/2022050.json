{"about_the_game":"A celebration of the progress of human civilization from its humble beginnings through thousands of years of technological advancement. <strong>Sapiens</strong> is the kind of project I had been always hoping that one day I could be a part of. When Dave kindly entrusted me with writing the music for his (at the time already 4-years-old !) passion project, I felt incredible excitement and, at the same time, a deep sense of responsibility to rise to the occasion and try to deliver to a level that was on par with the mind-boggling world he was building within this game. <br><br>Trying to capture that feeling of awe that the premise of <strong>Sapiens</strong> inspired in me was what led to the writing of the Main Theme, which I also tried to structure in a way that would reflect, in musical terms, the core idea of human progress that underpins the whole game. For the rest of the album, I sought to combine elements of traditional music from all around the world to create a common 'panhuman' musical identity, while trying to stay true to the improvisatory roots and communal performative nature of our shared musical history. <br><br>Finally, this soundtrack album would not be complete without Dave's original contributions to the musical world of <strong>Sapiens</strong>, composed by him before he kindly trusted me to take over the writing of the score, and which form an indispensable part of the identity of the game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2022050/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1656537578","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2022050/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1656537578","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2022050/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1656537578","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2022050/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1656537578","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A celebration of the progress of human civilization from its humble beginnings through thousands of years of technological advancement. <strong>Sapiens</strong> is the kind of project I had been always hoping that one day I could be a part of.
