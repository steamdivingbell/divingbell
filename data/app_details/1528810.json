{"about_the_game":"A community of Vupfox have fled their homeland to seek refuge across the perilous north sea. Only a few are fortunate to survive the journey and have crashed upon an unknown island. This fertile isle offers sanctuary, a chance to rebuild. But something is not right; any attempt to sail away results in crashing back upon the island. Ominously, along the backside in the cliffs, lies a narrow slot canyon. A menacing arch sits at the canyon\u2019s entrance. <br><br>In this city builder and tower defense strategy game, it is up to you to guide the few remaining survivors. Progress from just hoping to survive to ultimately overcoming the challenges with an efficient and prospering society. Design new settlements, task the colonists with jobs, manage resources, and architect a defense that can protect from whatever comes from beyond the gate.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BUILD YOUR COLONY</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1528810/extras/StoreDetailBuild.gif?t=1690988977\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Settle the islands</strong>: Build your way across 6 hand-crafted islands.<br></li><li><strong>Survive the environment</strong>: Each day, season, and generation faces tough challenges to overcome.<br></li><li><strong>Research</strong>: New buildings, resources, and citizen efficiencies will have to be researched in order to face the trials ahead. <br></li><li><strong>Construct a production machine</strong>: Balance building construction, jobs, research, resources, and citizen needs to create an effective society.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DEFEND YOUR COLONY</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1528810/extras/StoreDetailDefend.gif?t=1690988977\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Maze the invaders</strong>: The invading forces blindly seek their targets to destroy.
