{"about_the_game":"<strong>Galandrix</strong><br>Galandrix is a rogue like arcade game played from a top-down view and features both fast-paced action and real time strategic choices. Select your ship and blast off into the unknown against countless hordes of enemies. Collect components from destroyed ships or asteroids and barter with traders to improve your ships load-out. Add crew members after leveling up or upgrade your ship to add additional bays to increase your chances at survival. Push on through zones to take on unique enemies, bosses and strange anomalies and free your faction from the AI horde!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2920950/extras/Galandrix_SteamStore_gif_01.gif?t=1725369039\" /><br><br><strong>Factions and Ships</strong><br>Select from 3 factions and 3 unique ships from each, totaling 9 playable ships. Each ship has a unique active and passive ability that scales with their level.

Currency can be found off destroyed enemy ships or by mining asteroids. When you save enough, you can eventually upgrade your ship with it, gamble it away or purchase replacement parts.
