{"about_the_game":"Add some new female fighters to your party\u2019s roster with the RPG Character Pack 9! Gee-kun-soft\u2019s latest character pack is here with 16 new female characters who are ready to rumble! Add a powerful redheaded wizard to your party to help your sword-wielding main character defeat new enemies, or let your players choose to play as a spunky twin-tailed adventurer when they start the game! Form a team with a lavender-haired fox girl fighter, a young warrior elf who wields a huge ax, and a dress-wearing mage to take on the demon lord, and let the pack\u2019s other warriors and wizards act as NPCs who can teach your players new skills.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach character comes with a MZ-style sprite and sv battler that are ready for battle, along with downed sprites so you can portray them as sleeping or wounded after a surprise attack. 8 different emotions fill their facesets so you can show them smiling when given a gift or upset after an especially challenging fight. And not only that, but each emotion is also shown on 8 bust images just in case your game doesn\u2019t use smaller face images. But what if your game uses front-view enemies for battles and you want your players to battle the pink-haired archer after she reveals that she\u2019s working for the demon lord? Don\u2019t worry, since each character has 13 enemy images that include different emotions and recolors!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack also includes bonus high-res, full body art of each character so you can resize them to perfectly fit your game or appear in a codex so your players can read up on any characters that they\u2019re interested in.
