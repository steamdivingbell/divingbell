{"about_the_game":"As an avid Sudoku enthusiast, I could not find a satisfying Sudoku game on Steam, so I started learning the programming language, and based on my understanding of Sudoku and the experience of other games of the same type, I created a new Sudoku game - Meta Sudoku in a few weeks, whether you are a novice or an experienced Sudoku master, this game will meet your gaming needs.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1592480/extras/\u82f1\u8bed\u63d0\u793a.png?t=1733396830\" /><br><br><strong><i><u>Meta Sudoku is a minimalist puzzle game, your only goal is to fill in the nine numbers 1, 2, 3, and up to 9 in the spaces in a 9 X 9 square according to the numbers given by the system, so that each row, column, and every 3 X 3 palace contains the nine numbers 1~9, and there are no repetitions and omissions.</u></i></strong><br><br>The rules of the game are simple, but finding all the numbers that fit the rules can be challenging. Meta Sudoku is great for exercising your brain while relaxing at leisure, and it provides players with the most comfortable gaming experience.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1592480/extras/\u82f1\u8bed\u63d0\u793a2.png?t=1733396830\" /><br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">There are four modes of Meta Sudoku:</h2></strong><br><br><strong><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>1. Classic Mode: This mode contains six increasing difficulty levels, namely easy, medium, advanced, difficult, expert, master, and each difficulty level contains 40 levels.<br><br></li><li>2. Pack mode: This mode contains three increasing difficulty levels, namely Pack I., Pack II., and Pack III., each difficulty level contains 25 levels. Compared to the classic mode, the levels in this mode are more beautiful, and the distribution of the system numbers is like a mysterious geometric pattern.<br><br></li><li>3. Endless mode: This mode still contains six increasing difficulty levels, namely easy, medium, advanced, difficult, expert, master, each time you enter a new level, the system will carefully select a level that belongs to you.<br><br></li><li>4. Ultimate Mode: This mode contains only three levels. These levels are definitely a real test, they were designed by world-class masters themselves, and considering their difficulty, I designed them to the end. I strongly discourage challenging these levels at the beginning, you can try them again once you are familiar with the game mechanics.
