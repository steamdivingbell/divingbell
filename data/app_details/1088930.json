There are also pike, tench, bream and roach to target with 25 different trophy fish.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGillhams is a fishing paradise located in Krabi, Thailand. This holiday resort is on the bucket list of many anglers due to the exotic species from South America and Asia that swim in its rich waters.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite only 12 acres in size, there are 5 brand new species of fish - arapaima, siamese carp, redtail catfish, mekong and black pacu with each reaching staggering weights including Arapaima to over an incredible 560lbs!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1088930/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1570445597","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1088930/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1570445597","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1088930/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1570445597","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1088930/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1570445597","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Featuring two incredible venues \u2013 the historic Wraysbury 1 South Lake and the incredible Gillhams Fishing Resort. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWraysbury is one of the most historic carp fishing venues of all time and was occupied by arguably the most famous carp, Mary who has been recreated as well as other famous residents such as Mary\u2019s Mate and Cluster. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis stunning lake will present plenty of challenges with different features to explore, with around 500 carp (common, mirror and ghost) topped by Mary at 56lbs.
