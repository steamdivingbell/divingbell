{"about_the_game":"<strong>Katana X</strong> is a sword simulation action game designed specifically for VR utilizing tracked motion controls. It's a highly accessible game that is easy to get into and strangely addicting once you start. This game takes real physical skill of body control and hand\u2013eye coordination to get high scores. If you like motion gaming, swordplay, and having a serious workout session, this is the game for you.<br><br>Katana X was initially inspired by the famous mobile fruit slicing game, but we wanted to make a game that you can actually feel like you are wielding a sword and correctly physically interacting in the virtual world. Slice with the sharp edge of your sword, try for combo opportunities, and avoid hitting bombs to achieve the high score! With practice and the right technique, you might be surprised how high a score you can achieve.
