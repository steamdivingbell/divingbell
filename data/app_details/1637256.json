{"about_the_game":"Legendary diesel builder Electro-Motive in the early 1980s introduced a new line of diesel locomotives branded the \u201c60 Series,\u201d and with it came a new prime mover, EMD\u2019s two-stroke 710-series diesel power plant.<br><br>A keystone of the EMD 60 Series was the six-axle (C-C), 3,800-horsepower SD60, which utilized the 16-cylinder version of the 710G3 power plant. And now, in the flashy colors of railroad giant Canadian Pacific, the EMD SD60 takes to the rails in Train Simulator!<br><br>Successor to the 645-series powered SD50, the SD60 featured not only the EMD 710-series power plant but introduced a new control system managed by multiple micro-processors. Indeed, the SD60 is widely considered EMD\u2019s initial \u201cthird generation\u201d diesel locomotive.<br>In 1984, EMD first constructed four blue-and-white SD60 demonstrators and through 1991, eight railroads and a leasing company purchased a total of 537 standard-design SD60s. Among the buyers of the powerful SD60 was the Soo Line, which dressed its fleet of 58 units in a red, white, and black livery. The Soo Line was a long-time holding of giant Canadian Pacific and by the early 2000s CP had gained full ownership of Soo Line and consolidated the railroad into the 14,700-mile CP system. Accordingly, the Soo Line fleet of SD60s soon changed their colors to CP\u2019s attractive and brilliant red and white livery. Canadian Pacific\u2019s SD60s remain in service today (with some rebuilt to \u201c-3\u201d specifications) and can be regularly found working in both the United States and Canada.<br><br>The Canadian Pacific Electro-Motive SD60 for Train Simulator features realistic details, controls, and sounds.
