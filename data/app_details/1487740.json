This fearless soldier can fire a single rocket towards your target, causing a devastating area-of-effect explosion. It's perfect for obliterating obstacles that stand in your way or sending enemy units running for cover. But remember, like the grenadier, the damage is indiscriminate\u2014boom!<br><br>And let's not forget the newest addition to your arsenal, the <strong>Flamer</strong>! Brace yourself for some serious heat, as this unit unleashes a fiery column of flames upon its target. Once ignited, the target bursts into flames, causing ongoing damage for a limited time. But beware, the flames can spread, engulfing nearby units and obstacles. Fiery chaos awaits!<br><br>So gear up, commander, and choose your units wisely. Whether it's the versatile <strong>Rifleman</strong>, the rapid-firing <strong>Gunner</strong>, the explosive <strong>Grenadier</strong>, the mighty <strong>Rocketman</strong>, or the scorching <strong>Flamer</strong>, each unit brings its own unique firepower to the battlefield.
