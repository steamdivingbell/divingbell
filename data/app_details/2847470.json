{"about_the_game":"The game center revolves around the concept of Shouyuan, where cultivation is mainly aimed at extending the Shouyuan. Shouyuan mainly relies on cultivation to grow, and each realm (refining essence, condensing qi, building foundation, alchemy, elemental infant, Mahayana) has different Shouyuan values. Other factors that affect longevity include elixirs and injuries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is a strong sense of time in the game, with a time flow rate 60 times that of real time, and 24 minutes is equivalent to 1 day. Shouyuan has exhausted the game and can choose to continue using the original save for the second playthrough. There is a chance to inherit some of the props from the previous life. After exiting the game, time stops flowing and the herbs planted and grown in the wild also cease to grow. There is no offline AFK system. Game time is not related to real time, so modifying device time cannot accelerate game time. Players can accelerate the passage of time during &quot;cultivation,&quot; &quot;alchemy,&quot; and &quot;refining. Players keep choosing &quot;cultivation&quot;, and when their qualifications are low, they can end the game as quickly as possible - their lifespan is exhausted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery night at 12 o'clock, there will be a UI prompt to enter sleep below the base period. Long term lack of sleep below the base period will affect longevity. Practice can be used as a substitute for sleep during the period of pill completion or above.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main attributes of a character include Yin Yang, Five Elements, and ten spiritual roots, as well as corresponding ten spiritual powers. The spiritual root value is generated during character creation, with a range of 50-200, representing 0.5-2 times the attribute influence value. The spiritual root determines the efficiency of cultivating corresponding attribute skills, and cultivating skills can increase spiritual energy value. When the spiritual energy reaches a specific value, it can be redeemed and enter the next realm to increase lifespan. The spirit root is a hidden attribute and cannot be viewed without using specific props. Reiki only displays ten total values, and specific attributes cannot be viewed without using specific props.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe secondary attributes of characters include fortune value, moral value, and reputation value, which determine the direction of the plot and the development of the sect. In the case of large negative values, ordinary good deeds cannot increase moral values. Moral values determine the timeline of biweekly goals (people with high moral values are reincarnated faster). Moral values can increase the spiritual root of a biweekly eye when they are relatively positive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBased on the core concept, the main gameplay of the game consists of three core modules, namely combat, sect, and love.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe auxiliary modules of the game include spirit grass, alchemy, mining, refining equipment, and formation<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCombat: As the first core gameplay of the game, relying on the strategy system as the main means to open up the market. The character does not have an experience level upgrade system, and their attack and defense mainly rely on spells and spiritual weapons. When their spiritual energy is insufficient, they cannot activate spells and spiritual weapons. There will be convenient move buttons on the UI system, which can reduce the power of the move by half compared to the rubbing move. It can also be forcefully activated when the spiritual energy is insufficient, which will damage the longevity element.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSect: Players can join the system sect or create their own sect. When joining a sect, they rely on the reputation system to enhance their status within the sect. When creating a sect, they rely on the reputation system to attract disciples to join. Due to changes during development, the self created sect system is temporarily unable to go live<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLove: When the favorability value (influenced by morality and reputation) with an NPC reaches a certain level, one can marry an NPC of the opposite sex and become sworn with an NPC of the same sex.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLingcao: It can be found on outdoor maps or planted by oneself. Wood attribute spiritual energy affects planting efficiency.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlchemy: Using herbs as raw materials for alchemy, the purpose of spiritual pills is to heal wounds, restore spiritual energy, increase longevity, assist in battles, and promote the plot. The fire attribute spiritual energy affects the efficiency of alchemy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMining: Some maps will be generated using a random dungeon system, which generates random seed numbers each time a new save is opened. The refresh of spirit stones, spirit mines, and wild spirit grass will be determined by combining the lucky and moral values.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRefining tools: Using spirit minerals as raw materials for refining tools, the main purpose of spirit tools is for combat, with a few used to drive the plot. Metallic spiritual energy affects the efficiency of refining equipment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFormation: There is a specialized practice for formation in the technique. After mastering the formation, one can use spirit grass, spirit tools, and spirit stones to set up formations. There are three types of formations: Gathering Spirit Formation, Illusion Formation, and Symbol Formation. The Gathering Spirit Array is used on non combat maps to enhance the spiritual veins of one's own location, which is beneficial for the growth of spiritual grass planted by oneself and also for the alchemy efficiency of non portable alchemy furnaces. Phantom formation is used on battle maps to alter the offensive and defensive capabilities of both sides. The talisman array acts on spiritual weapons to enhance their offensive and defensive abilities. The soil attribute spiritual energy affects the efficiency of the formation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHealing: Healing is a very small module, not small enough to be a standalone module, because it directly affects the core design concept of the game's longevity element, so its usefulness is quite important. During battles, the protagonist will not have HP value. If attacked, the damage will be offset by defensive spirit tools, techniques, illusion arrays, and talisman arrays. The parts that cannot be offset will directly become damage value. The damage value can be eliminated by healing spirit pills and healing techniques within a certain period of time. The parts that are not eliminated within a certain period of time will be directly converted into the loss of life element value. The water attribute technique affects the efficiency of healing injuries.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2847470/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730962856","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2847470/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1730962856","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2847470/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730962856","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2847470/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730962856","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":51},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"The game center revolves around the concept of Shouyuan, where cultivation is mainly aimed at extending the Shouyuan.
