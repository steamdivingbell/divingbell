{"about_the_game":"Have you ever wondered if you could <i>win the lottery</i>?  Here's a chance to test that luck, without losing your shirt in the process.  Lotto Life is an authentic lottery simulator similar to state-run lotteries. <br><br>Welcome to Ys, a modern city under the auspices of Lotto Life Megacorporation.  Every day, in real time, a winning number is drawn for the in-game lottery.  Buy tickets, read the daily newspaper, go to work, and maybe win big!  Fail to pay the rent, though, and you're looking at a new life (or perma-death, if you like) in debtor's prison.<br><br>In line with simulating the wait-and-see experience of playing the lottery, this game plays out at a slow pace. Most days your session can take around 5 minutes to complete, and then real time must pass before more can be done.<br><br>Please note that this is a game, with no actual real-life cash payout in the event of picking a winning ticket.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1572850/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1634337491","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1572850/page.bg.jpg?t=1634337491","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1572850/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1634337491","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1572850/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1634337491","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Have you ever wondered if you could <i>win the lottery</i>?
