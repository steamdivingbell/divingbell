They are faster than OpenGL that X-Plane has used in the past. Overall, most users will see improved frame rates and reduced stutters when using Vulkan or Metal.<br><br>In X-Plane 11.50, there is a check-box in the graphics settings that enables Vulkan or Metal, and a restart of X-Plane is necessary for the change to take effect. If for some reason a user can\u2019t use Vulkan or Metal, OpenGL is still available by simply unchecking the box.<br><br>Numerous bug fixes, enhancements, and new airports are also included in this release.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong>The future of flight simulation is now.</strong><br>X-Plane 11 is the detailed, realistic, and modern simulator you\u2019ve been waiting for.<br><br><br><strong>New in X-Plane 11</strong><br>A completely redesigned, intuitive user interface that makes setting up and editing your flight a breeze.<br>Consistently usable 3-D cockpits and stunningly high-resolution exterior models for all included aircraft.<br>A new effects engine for lighting, sounds, and explosions.<br>Realistic avionics: all planes are IFR-ready right out of the gate.<br>Busy, \u201cliving\u201d airports with pushback tugs and roaming fuel trucks, able to service both your aircraft and the simulator\u2019s AI planes.<br>New buildings &amp; roads to better simulate European cities<br>\u2026and more!</strong>","developers":["Laminar Research"],"dlc":[582570,582571,582572,582573,582574,582575,582576,582577,582578,605780,614000,614001,614003,614004,614005,614006,614007,614008,614009,623611,623613,623619,623620,636131,636132,636133,636134,675340,675351,675354,675355,675356,675357,675358,675359,841160,841161,841162,841163,841164,841165,841166,841167,841168,841169,991060,854780,991061,991062,991063,991064,991065,991066,991067,991068,991069,1117060,1122200,1122201,1122202,1155240,1180410,1122203,1122204,1198410,1201430,1206800,1203350,1203540,1203541,1203542,1203543,1210820,1226500,1229170,1232050,1232540,1234780,1268270,1275360,1281570,1281571,1284720,1299200,1317260,1317280,1329590,1333610,1379950,1392610,1394530,1480750,1442500,1480751,1480760,1527860,1552850,1565160,1608480,1633870,1652350,1652351,1682390,1682510,1744980,1747810,1751370,1755000,1755001,1768690,1776630,1782530,1782531,1816660,1816661,1816662,1816663,1816664,1816665,1816666,1816667,1816668,1816669,1844350,1853530,1952480,1960120,1989890,2011850],"genres":[{"description":"Simulation","id":"28"}],"header_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/269950/header.jpg?t=1726471352","is_free":false,"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Varies, Ubuntu 16.04LTS tested<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i3, i5, or i7 CPU with 2 or more cores, or AMD equivalent<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 8 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> video card from NVIDIA or AMD w/512 MB VRAM with proprietary driver<br></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 20 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> Default<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> The disk requirements are based on how many world scenery areas are downloaded.
