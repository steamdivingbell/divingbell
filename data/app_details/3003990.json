Arriving in the Cradle you begin a long journey to the legendary Tower of the Philosophers. But all that remains of the great city are half-abandoned city ruins where strange things begin to happen. The few locals are hiding in their homes for fear of the wandering Ghosts. The Cradle is in decline and the town has become like a veritable labyrinth. An old map helps but it's not perfect. Many roads have come and gone since its creation, and you have to draw them yourself. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3003990/extras/features__1_.png?t=1716566514\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>A hand-crafted city</strong> with free exploration - from an abandoned cemetery to a maze of sewers.
