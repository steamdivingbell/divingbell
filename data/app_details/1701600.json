It has had the holy names of &quot;Taiyue&quot;, &quot;xuanyue&quot; and &quot;Da Yue&quot; since ancient times. It is also the human Taoist field of the Perfected Warrior emperor. It is known as an &quot;unparalleled scenic spot in ancient times and the first fairy mountain in the world&quot;. There are too many stories about the reputation of Wudang Mountain, but there is no doubt that Wudang Mountain and its Taoist culture constitute the most important chapter in Chinese traditional culture. Now, the immortal gate of Wudang, which has been hidden for many years in the immortal cultivation world, has finally unveiled its mystery.<br>On the East Sea, a lofty, hazy mountain of immortals suddenly appeared in the mortal world. Cultivators explored the place and found that it's a long-lost, boundless realm of immortals, and hidden within is a seclusive Taoist sect! The Taoist teachings of the sect are directly passed down from the Perfected Warrior. Its disciples have all mastered the essence of Tao and excel at expelling demons. The realm is known as the Wudang Mountains!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New Wudang Places</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Golden Peak<br></li><li>Reattainment Temple<br></li><li>Purple Cloud Palace<br></li><li>Southrock Palace</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1701600/extras/\u7d2b\u9704\u5bab.png?t=1727257040\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1701600/extras/\u5357\u5ca9\u5bab.png?t=1727257040\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Immortal land Scenery</h2>In the process of making these new scenes, we took the most famous scenic spots of Wudang Mountain as the prototype and re-engraved the beautiful fairyland scenery of Wudang Mountain into the game, such as the Golden Hall of Wudang Golden Peak, the sea of clouds, the Zigzag Yellow River wall of the Reattainment Temple, the cliffs of the Southrock Palace, dragon incense, the Bixi Memorial Stele of Zixiao palace, etc... the scenery in the game is not as good as that of Wudang fairyland, Players are also welcome to visit the holy land of Wudang and mark on your own!<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Golden Hall of the Golden Peak<br></li><li>The Sea Cloud of the Golden Peak<br></li><li>Zigzag Yellow River wall of the Reattainment Temple<br></li><li>Dragon Incense<br></li><li>Taoist Pagoda<br></li><li>Pinetree forest of the Purple Cloud Palace<br></li><li>Perfected Warrior Emperor Statue<br></li><li>Sacred Nimbus Plate</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1701600/extras/\u91d1\u9876\u4e91\u6d77.png?t=1727257040\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1701600/extras/\u6b66\u5f53\u91d1\u9876.jpg?t=1727257040\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New map adventures</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Dragon Incense Worship<br></li><li>Crown Princess Study Hall<br></li><li>Purple Cloud Palace<br></li><li>Purple Cloud Palace Destiny</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">21 New Wudang buildings</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Golden Hall<br></li><li>Dragon Incense<br></li><li>Perfected Warrior Emperor Statue<br></li><li>Bixi Memorial Stele<br></li><li>Incense Cauldron<br></li><li>Taoist Pagoda<br></li><li>Taichi Drum<br></li><li>Wudang Gate<br></li><li>Black Phoenix Screen<br></li><li>Wudang Banner<br></li><li>Dragon Censer<br></li><li>Trigrams Cushion<br></li><li>Gruidae Lantern<br></li><li>Sacred Nimbus Plate<br></li><li>Black Tortoise Lantern<br></li><li>Cloudpeak Tea Plant x 2<br></li><li>Wudang Pine Tree</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1701600/extras/\u8d51\u5c43.png?t=1727257040\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1701600/extras/\u7384\u9e3e\u5c4f\u98ce.png?t=1727257040\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1701600/extras/\u6b66\u5f53\u4ed9\u677e.png?t=1727257040\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New Walls: the Curved Walls</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Special curved walls in Wudang.
