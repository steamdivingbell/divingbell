Mostly, they are girls, but sometimes a boy-child will carry the spark, though weaker than their sister-kind. Training each of them is my sad calling, for mages come and go like the black days in this place. First, they learn the sister-words, the mage\u2019s tongue, the language of all things. Next we fashion them a gem, one that is theirs alone, a conduit for their nascent power. After this, Kadir takes them deep within the bowels of the cave, where they must find their way back with only their gem to protect them. Many find their way home, but we have lost many would-be mages in my years. A student\u2019s last task is to slay a beast, armed again only with their gem and their wits. The child is dropped down a shaft outside Chasmwalk, left alone with whatever miscreation we have snared from the void. Sometimes the creature is wounded, weak, but always they are hungry. A student that navigates this ordeal is named apprentice. After that, one need only survive long enough to earn the rank of mage.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1321770/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1593007849","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1321770/page.bg.jpg?t=1593007849","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1321770/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1593007849","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1321770/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1593007849","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>The Nameless ever encroach on the last bastion of Gravehold.
