{"about_the_game":"GravitreX started as a contender in the Swedish Game Awards Warm-up competition &quot;80's Warm-up&quot;, which had 80's as its theme. GravitreX won that competition, and was later ported to Android. After a few years on Android, it was then turned into an arcade cabinet. Two or three cabinets still exist today, in different barcades in the Phoenix Arizona region. It has now come time to complete the circle and port it back to PC and Steam.<br><br>This 2D physics simulation has you trying to land two ships on their respective platform.

It should send keypresses to tell the game the credits situation: '0' for No credits ('INSERT COIN' will be displayed), '8' for 1 credit ('Press 1P Start' will be displayed), or '9' for Multiple credits ('Press 1P or 2P Start' will be displayed). Also, Multiple Credits can be pressed again and again to play the coin inserted sound effect.</li></ul><br>In all coin modes except 'None', pressing 1P start ('1' on the keyboard, or Start on Controller 1) will start a 1P game and P1 then controls the game either from keyboard or controller 1. Pressing 2P Start will start a 2P game, with P2 controlling Ship 2 from P2 keyboard controls or controller 2. In the 'None' mode, pressing any input on any controller will start a game with P1 controlling the game from that controller, and the second controller to receive a button press will join as P2.<br><br>If you have a cabinet with default Mame key assignments, replace the &quot;KeyMap.cfg&quot; file with the &quot;KeyMap_MAME.cfg&quot; file. If you have different keys assigned, edit the file and adjust accordingly. Because many cabinets only have three buttons, in this config the stick is used for three of the buttons.

This way GravitreX can coexist with all your other arcade games!
