{"about_the_game":"Return to the intrigue of 'Mysteryville' in this amazing sequel ! <br />\r\nVariations on the Hidden Object theme that will be encountered in 'Mysteryville 2' include searching a dimmed room with a flashlight, finding objects based on their silhouettes, collecting pairs of items and comparing two versions of the room side-by-side to note the differences between them.<br />\r\nAnd of course you'll face the puzzles and different mini-games while going through main locations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJournalist Laura Winner just can't get enough of the odd little town of Mysteryville. After investigating the riddle of the missing cats in the first Mysteryville adventure, she returns for a visit and in spite of only wanting a relaxing vacation, finds herself sucked into another mystery. <br />\r\nLaura comes to Mysteryville on the invitation of old acquaintance Bill Witowsky. However, she arrives in the town to find Bill missing and an art and jewelry auction about to take place organized by the town's new priest. Could Bill's disappearance and this auction, which is totally out of character for a small town like Mysteryville, be somehow tied together? It's up to Laura to find out, with your help of course.<br />\r\nOver the course of the game you'll get to interact with several of the town's inhabitants, including some new faces and some who will be familiar from the first game but have assumed new responsibilities in the town.
