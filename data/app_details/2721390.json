{"about_the_game":"You are an Oathborne, one of the last guardians of the realm, sent to the world to defeat the darkness and restore the light in men.  Explore and unlock the overworld by delving deep into dungeons, hacking through hordes of enemies, completing puzzles, and destroying &quot;the monoliths&quot;.  The monoliths give the enemies in each region their power and keep what would be good men in bondage.  Destroying a monolith will open up more of the overworld for you to explore.  As you progress through the game, you will unlock new skills that you will be able to use in your adventure.  Choose from a greatsword wielding paladin, magic weaving mage, or an agile arrow slinging ranger.  Will you traverse a world devastated by the wicked one?  Will you survive long enough to destroy the monoliths?  The bigger question, will you restore the light in men?  For all is already written, it is but your destiny to fortify the vigor once lost in your fellow man.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Features</strong></h2></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Use a deep hack and slash combat system to mow down mobs of enemies</li> <li>Unlock skills and use weapon combos to defeat monolith bosses</li> <li>Roguelike elements with checkpoints to save your playthrough</li><li>Intuitive puzzles and dungeon traps to stagnate your progress</li><li>Choose from 3 classes with different weapons and skills</li></ul><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2721390/extras/pushGif2_H.264-ezgif.com-optimize.gif?t=1719419575\" />","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2721390?t=1719419575","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2721390?t=1719419575","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2721390/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1719419575","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2721390/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1719419575","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You are an Oathborne, one of the last guardians of the realm, sent to the world to defeat the darkness and restore the light in men.
