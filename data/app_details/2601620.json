{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>UNGATE</strong></h2>In this narative, first-person, survival horror game, the action is about a young man named Jason, who follows the steps of his friends to find them and to get them out of a mysterious cave that has its own ecosystem and is known by the locals of the West Village as the gate of hell. By doing so, he will find himself trapped into a dark place that is the home of the dark creatures and dark presences that will try to kill him and turn his soul into a servant of darkness. Along his way of gathering more clues, he will face constant horror scenes and unbearable tension, that are meant to block him from getting to the source of the evil and put an end to the nightmare.
