The rather brash script helps to increase the humorous appeal of the game, too. If it had more variation in moves across the different characters I\u2019d be more inclined to play it more often, but it\u2019s worth the low price of admission even if only to experience what it has to offer once.\u201d<br>In-Depth Review \u2013 <br><br>\u201cInstead of being a brawler, X-MiGuFighters: Stripper Anya 2 is a classic 1-on-1 fighting game.
