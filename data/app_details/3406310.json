{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When an army travels back in time to rule the world 1,000 years in advance, they get more than they bargained for from their primitive counterparts!

Combining world-dominating strategy with fully interactive battles, this game offers the best of both worlds. And just when you think it's over, history might just repeat itself!
