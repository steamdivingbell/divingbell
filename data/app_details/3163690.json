{"about_the_game":"Anomaly Corridor is a horror-themed walking simulator where the player memorizes a corridor in a spaceship during Section 0 and proceeds through the airlocks into new sections leading to an escape pod.  Creatures and other weird phenomena haunt the hallway with anomalies that you must look for with the help of your flashlight to discover any anomalies that have changed the corridor.  If an anomaly has been spotted, you must return to the airlock you came from to progress to the next section. Successfully make it to section 10 to board the last escape pod to survive. <br><br>Awakened from deep stasis, you find your crew dead and your ship in distress; you must get to the escape pod. To do so, you must navigate a seemingly endless corridor, uncovering eerie anomalies as you struggle to escape your doomed ship!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>How to Play</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Leave the crew quarters.<br></li><li>Study section 0 of the corridor system.<br></li><li>Look for anomalies in subsequent sections.<br></li><li>Use your flashlight to look in the darkest of corners.<br></li><li>Turn back immediately if anything is out of place.<br></li><li>Make it to section 10 to escape.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Expected Playtime</strong></h2>15-60 Minutes, more if you work to get all achievements.<br><br>For those who want to be a completionist, unlock all 5 Steam Achievements in the game.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Deathless Run","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3163690/1be42d8438b63f85dc879b27a1c7ee42a94a02d6.jpg"},{"name":"Seen It All","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3163690/da34ed6c208088ffe4011a9ea2796b4d377be9ef.jpg"},{"name":"Perfect Run","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3163690/cdb27808a84d6b00e25eb9fa613935bf149096b8.jpg"},{"name":"Perfect Game","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3163690/85af7eb710c4e2e47d9c9c14411e6e7438cd1b7a.jpg"},{"name":"Death Avoided","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3163690/889f6afc7e2688594adbf8d030bea80715b6721c.jpg"}],"total":5},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3163690/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728390860","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3163690/page.bg.jpg?t=1728390860","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3163690/bac3e11e1350625d6c338073d5a4d58c39818c19/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728390860","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3163690/bac3e11e1350625d6c338073d5a4d58c39818c19/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728390860","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Anomaly Corridor is a horror-themed walking simulator where the player memorizes a corridor in a spaceship during Section 0 and proceeds through the airlocks into new sections leading to an escape pod.
