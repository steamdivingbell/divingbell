{"about_the_game":"<i>Embark on a cosmic heist in this zero-gravity adventure! Maneuver the galaxy as a sentient robot armed with a magnet, jetpack, and gravity boots. Your mission? Infiltrate facilities, find parts, and return life to your friend - while running from a mysterious company intent on shutting you down.</i><br><br>Stellar Larceny is a zero-gravity puzzle-platformer where players take the role of Enness, a sentient robot under the control of the mysterious GAUSS Systems. After an unknown program frees them from GAUSS' influence, they must escape the facility and help save their friend from the brink of deactivation.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Six Degrees of Freedom</h2>In these zero-gravity environments, you must use all of the movement tools available to you to deftly navigate through each facility's security systems. Use your grappling hook to cross distances quickly, your gravity boots to walk on walls and ceilings, and your jetpack to make smaller rotations and adjustments.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Puzzle-Solving</h2>Use gears strewn about the facility to power on doors and deactivate traps, but take care! You might have to get creative to power on the devices in the right sequence.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2968870/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728675822","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2968870/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1728675822","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2968870/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728675822","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2968870/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728675822","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<i>Embark on a cosmic heist in this zero-gravity adventure!
