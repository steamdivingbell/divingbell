{"about_the_game":"You probably thought that Weird Science was your enemy. And yes, you were right, but you can always fight fire with fire, as the saying goes. Or, more fittingly, fight those artificial monsters with arcane machinery: engulf them with poisonous fumes, scorch them with tongues of flame or deploy mechanical allies and traps and let them do the rest. <br><br>Van Helsing: Arcane Mechanic DLC now allows you to play a totally different kind of monster hunter, a specialist class. The Arcane Mechanic is the master of weird devices, deadly gadgets and occult machineries. Monster hunting just got even more exiting with your customizable Chargerpack and the multi-functional Discharger in your hands. Forget the traditional weapons and prepare your custom-made mechanical wonders.
