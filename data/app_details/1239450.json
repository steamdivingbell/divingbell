Through precise use of propaganda, you will be able to cripple the loyalty of enemy cities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Battlesuits</h2>A T'au Battlesuit is an advanced powered combat exoskeleton that forms an integral part of the T'au Fire Caste's military forces. Customize them by mounting advanced support systems.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Drones and Markerlights</h2>Deploy many different designs of drones, miracles of T\u2019au technology, that provide offensive, defensive and tactical support.
