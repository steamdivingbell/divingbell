Every hero and every enemy is a spell caster type. Ready for something new?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Class and Path</h2>Combine a hero class with a path to create a cat hero that suits your play style. Do you like being in the middle of the action as a tank? Choose an Archdruid. Do you prefer using area of \u200b\u200beffect spells to defeat enemies from a distance? Dark Mage might be right up your alley.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dungeons Full of Loot</h2>Fight your way through procedurally generated dungeons and collect hundreds of items. There are normal, special and rare quality items with randomized affixes and over 150 different epic items waiting to be found.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1679590/extras/skills.gif?t=1726419170\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dark Campaign</h2>Play through a dark campaign as your follow the main story line. Want to take the time to finish optional quests? The villagers are generous with their worthwhile quest rewards.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Intermediate Realm</h2>Campaign finished, what now? The Intermediate Realm is a place full of challenge, rewards and secrets. Enjoy dozens of hours of late game dungeon grind with more and more loot.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cat and the Bat</h2>Select a bat Familiar to accompany your cat hero on their adventures.

You won't lose track, even when things get heated and dozens of magical orbs fly across the screen.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Up for a Challenge?</h2>For those of us looking for a challenge, ZpellCatz offers a variety of options. When creating your cat hero you can choose the 'Challenging' difficulty and / or pick one of the perma-death modes 'Hardcore' or 'Cat-core' (7 lives). Your hero has the strongest items possible and you don't know what else to do? There are Uber Bosses waiting for you in the Intermediate Realm... Good luck!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Guitar Soundtrack</h2>What's more fun than dungeon crawling?
