The keys needed to solve puzzles spawn in a controlled set of randomized locations. This is to ensure that items are continually difficult to find, but not so difficult that finding them is impossible (i.e., items that are required to beat the game do not spawn in the cornfield or other hard to reach areas). Additionally, upon completion, players are presented with a completion time that they can try to beat in their next playthrough.
