Players gather in the hall, where they are given random characters with their own needs that must be met in order to survive.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">2. The game begins in the largest room, where players are mixed and each is assigned a target. Each player sees only their target card.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">3. Players can communicate with each other using voice chat and spatial sound effects to persuade and lure their target.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">4. When a player kills their target, they take the target from the dead player. But they can only kill if they remain in the same room with their target, just the two of you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">5. When a player is caught, they become a ghost that wanders the map, watching live players and other ghosts, but cannot interact with them.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">6. When there are 2 players left and they become targets for each other, the game goes to the final stage.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Final part</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There are 2 portals, one has an exit, the other does not. The player with the most captured can choose which portal to enter, but he does not know which one leads where, because to him they look the same. The remaining player must convince to enter the wrong portal in order to survive, because he can see which one is correct. A tense mind game to understand whether to trust the enemy or not. Whoever chooses the right portal first wins.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3121440/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733749842","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3121440/page.bg.jpg?t=1733749842","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3121440/e17aff58e582b2eb840f6c696fecbc0e5cee2b2c/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733749842","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3121440/e17aff58e582b2eb840f6c696fecbc0e5cee2b2c/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733749842","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Overview</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the game &quot;Traitors' Territory&quot; you play the role of a character who is tasked with being the last one standing by catching all the other traitors.
