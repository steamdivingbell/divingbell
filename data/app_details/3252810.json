{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Bible soundtrack is comprised of pieces written and performed by both Kevin MacLeod and Scott Buckley.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The two artists created their works separately, and each of their tracks has been attributed to them individually.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can view who is responsible for which track in the File Name of each Track, as well as the Screenshot on the store page which lists the title of each track, and the composer.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The pieces within the soundtrack vary between those which are more appropriately themed for regions mentioned throughout the Old Testament, pieces which hearken to medieval church history, those which highlight the darker moments in scripture, and pieces which evoke the sweeping and powerful moments of Christ's love.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This soundtrack is a companion piece to the base game because the Steam Music player has built in functionality to move between tracks at the user's leisure, so they can choose the track(s) most fitting for the area of Scripture they are currently studying.\u00a0</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3252810/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728422675","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3252810/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1728422675","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3252810/e98df2d42e95ce4c844d19867ac8b93b541907b2/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728422675","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3252810/e98df2d42e95ce4c844d19867ac8b93b541907b2/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728422675","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p
