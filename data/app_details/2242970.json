The story begins with the Hiks, an alien race, invading Earth to capture human survivors as prisoners. The Hiks want to conquer the universe and for this, they have created a program: Project Tower. This program forces prisoners to fight their way up through various towers, so the Hiks can build up their army from the tries of the prisoners. You play as one of these inmates, with the sole chance of regaining your freedom being to reach the top of the tower.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2242970/extras/innovative.png?t=1737020763\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2242970/extras/GIF_02_min.gif?t=1737020763\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Be smarter than them.
