{"about_the_game":"A hidden object game where you must find all the bees to complete each level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2>\ud83d\udc1d 1000+ bees<br>\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f 10 unique artworks<br>\ud83d\udca1 \u221e Unlimited hints if you get stuck<br>\u267b\ufe0f Restore a small number of bees to a painting so you can find them again! <br>\ud83c\udf6f Additional bee related objects to find<br>\ud83c\udfb5 Music and ambiance for each artwork<br>\ud83c\udfc6 Achievements<br>\u2328\ufe0f Use your keyboard to move/zoom in if you have no scrollwheel<br>\ud83d\udcbe 3 save slots<br>\ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f Reset progress entirely and play again<br>\ud83d\udd52 Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Context:</h2>The brief was simple. I commissioned artists to create a fantasy world, and hide as many bees as they can inside it. Now it\u2019s your job to find them all! With 10 art pieces to choose from, and 1000+ bees, you will have a lot of searching to do.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Controls:</h2>Use your mouse to move around the image and zoom in / out. When you find a bee, click it and it will disappear. You can also use WASD to move and the arrow keys to zoom.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Difficulty:</h2>A full range of difficulty is included, but all levels start unlocked, your progress is saved as you play, and you can use hints if you get stuck.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get immersed:</h2>Each painting has its own music and ambiance to help you connect with the world, as you search for all the bees.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Replayable</h2>You can restore a small number of bees back into a painting so you can find them again! It\u2019s much harder when there are only a few bees left (especially randomly). You can also use up to 3 save slots so you can replay without progress loss. Alternatively, you can reset your progress for the entire game if you\u2019d like to start over.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Perfect","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2250060/10c3d1c007ef54db811ce47b2c2eb4edb0601031.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Graveyard","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2250060/aa6a7fe5a9d5e77dc00c27c0b973b7bff1319701.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Dragon Tree","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2250060/a303f2f1b4f7d62e935b3acbe3c5ca5e99dcad95.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Forgotten Stationery","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2250060/5baf92b4ade73594ae4f704b60e9d8b3494a8494.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Toystore","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2250060/824e05a310325b97b236d0a859ec737bed0ee1c8.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Thinking Mushrooms","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2250060/c517882045edc9705d2bd237e231073a815b5828.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Cafe Courtyard","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2250060/f7eeac30298ecc78766063d470a5000afb344206.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Helm Kingdom","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2250060/7f4ac409140238b7488b3f904b901bcccfd565ba.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Parking Lot","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2250060/306aaa78611f110dc1d58df30c0f955b1c6469d4.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Farming Day","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2250060/813755d65da7e8bf6a997b0a24acc68fa4fac4fe.jpg"}],"total":11},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2250060/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1739046510","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2250060/page.bg.jpg?t=1739046510","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2250060/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739046510","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2250060/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739046510","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A hidden object game where you must find all the bees to complete each level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2>\ud83d\udc1d 1000+ bees<br>\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f 10 unique artworks<br>\ud83d\udca1 \u221e Unlimited hints if you get stuck<br>\u267b\ufe0f Restore a small number of bees to a painting so you can find them again! <br>\ud83c\udf6f Additional bee related objects to find<br>\ud83c\udfb5 Music and ambiance for each artwork<br>\ud83c\udfc6 Achievements<br>\u2328\ufe0f Use your keyboard to move/zoom in if you have no scrollwheel<br>\ud83d\udcbe 3 save slots<br>\ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f Reset progress entirely and play again<br>\ud83d\udd52 Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Context:</h2>The brief was simple.
