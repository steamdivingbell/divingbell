{"about_the_game":"This chapter is narrated by Rin Kaenbyou, Satori Komeiji and Seija Kijin. Join them on a journey full of medical examinations, epidemiological investigations and revolutionary slogans!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Synopsis:</h2>Rin Kaenbyou's days in the Old Hell used to be filled with fun rides on her corpse-filled cart, but recently they are more and more often replaced by dull paperwork.

Rin's master isn't happy about it either, but the contract with Moriya Shrine can't be broken, and the construction work will be finished soon. However, the Palace of the Earth Spirits may not see the long-awaited peace, as there are rumors about a girl who can only turn things upside down but somehow managed to join the gang of the famous Yuugi Hoshiguma. Perhaps she is connected to the mysterious disease that has inexplicably mowed down all the animals in the Palace...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What's waiting for you:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Over 30 hours of exciting plot with lots of unexpected replay value!</strong> The FIRST DAY is currently available, and the full playthrough of it will take 2 hours.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Experience multiple stories on repeated playthroughs, with lots of choices that lead to completely different endings!</strong></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Explore the vastness of the world of Touhou Project!</strong> Travel to the various corners of Gensokyo, the Underworld, the Netherworld and Higan.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Plenty of story illustrations and detailed character sprites!</strong></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>A rich soundtrack full of variety!</strong></li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3095760/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734200224","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3095760/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1734200224","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3095760/7bfc38720ff8c15885c4e4f6aadb0ed6213872f7/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734200224","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3095760/7bfc38720ff8c15885c4e4f6aadb0ed6213872f7/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734200224","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This chapter is narrated by Rin Kaenbyou, Satori Komeiji and Seija Kijin.
