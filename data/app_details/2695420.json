{"about_the_game":"Mother Nature has decided to teach humans a lesson for mistreating her by leaving their rubbish in the smallest corners of nature. But the animals' benevolence sends them to meet Protecto, a giant who has been in hiding for hundreds of years, to ask him to defend humans. Even though he has a grudge against mankind, he is persuaded by his deep-sea friends and intends to use this opportunity to teach the worst polluters in history a lesson.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnter the adventure and set off to battle the natural elements unleashed across four environments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStart by manipulating wooden blocks to stop avalanches destroying mountain homes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThen take up the challenge and build marble barricades against the rockslides that crash into city buildings.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou'll also have to contend with burst dams, which will prompt you to strategically place brick blocks to prevent water from seeping into houses.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, irrigate the lava flows with obsidian blocks. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring each challenge, you take on the role of Protecto at the top of the screen, which you can move from left to right. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou have access to an inventory that offers you blocks of 4 different materials, adapted to each situation. These blocks of wood, marble, brick and obsidian come in different shapes, and it's up to you to decide which way and where to drop them. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBuild your barricades and when you think they'll be as effective as possible, trigger the disaster and admire the results of your work.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou won't always be able to save all the buildings on the first try.
