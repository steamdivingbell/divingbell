So I decided to realize my dreams in the virtual world.  I have developed two mobile game four year ago on app store.  I self-learn unity from 2015.  So I decide to use the unity to make a game.  In the game I can pursue the tornado.  In order to be as realistic, I review a large number of papers, watch a lot of tornado video on youtube.  I hope I can simulate the tornado and experience the excitement in the virtual world. From June 2017, I started to use the off-duty time to develop alone.  I make a sigle game in a few months.  The physical damage, movement and driving effects of different buildings, sundries, glass, animals and vehicles in the EF0-EF5 tornado are total simulated based on the Fujita series.  I play it in different scenes for a period.  And I thought why I am not share it with more people to experience it.  <br />\r\n Then I start develop multiplayer game using Unet.  And I did it.  But unfortunately,  when I complete the game two days latter, I received a Email from the unity.  The Email noted that it will not support Unet service next year.  I am almost crazy.  I pondered the difficult of continue with this project in about a month.  I decide to try again.  I look for alternatives.  I want to set up a server by myself.  I have set up a server many years ago.  But I don't know how to make the unity connect with a local server.  I want to use third part service.  I found the photon can support the unity easily.  I buy a template having photon and unity.  That's cost a lot of time.  <br />\r\nNow, I did it again.  I am very proud.  In this game, players need against a tornado.  I want to design that one player roles as tornado, the other players role as chaser.  The number of chaser not limit.  But it will not fun enough.  So I made it as an asymmetric confrontation game, 4V1. In the future, maybe I will design a map with more than 4 chasers, a map with more than one tornado.  Yes, I have designed a map with a lot of tornado last year, that's thrilling.  <br />\r\nI change the asymmetric confrontation game.  The game can be start, if the room not full.  The player only need to wait for 80 seconds  after the second player joined.  The tornado will dynamically drop to the corresponding level according the number of the chasers. <br />\r\nFinally, I added rankings, dressups, rewards.  <br />\r\nThe server is small, if entering the room is unsuccessful, it is full, please wait patiently for a while before entering.","achievements":{"total":0},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/909500/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1713702893","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/909500/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1713702893","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/909500/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1713702893","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/909500/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1713702893","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"One day in the future, a terrorist organization code-named Apocalypse hijacked a scientist from a climate laboratory to create countless weather controllers to create tornadoes around the world in an attempt to rule the world.<br />\r\nIn order to eliminate the threat of weather controllers, countries selected military elites to destroy weather controllers.
