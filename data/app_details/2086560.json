{"about_the_game":"This is an era of turmoil, and the rule of the Star League over the galaxy is on the verge of collapse. You have been tasked with defending a planet rich in resources by piloting a state-of-the-art experimental ship. As you engage in battle, you gradually uncover the complex web of interests behind the entire galaxy society, and you will also discover that your fate has long been ensnared by this giant net. Will you choose to struggle within the net or do your best to find opportunities to break free? Everything depends on your choice. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game includes two modes: &quot;Endless War&quot; and &quot;BOSS Rush&quot;. The demo version will include the first chapter of the &quot;Endless War&quot; mode.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRegardless of which game mode you choose, it will include over 7 factions of enemy forces, hundreds of standard types of enemies, and dozens of boss-level enemies. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nShip and weapon systems: There will be 16 different styles of primary weapons, 15 secondary weapons, 12 special weapons, 6 ultimate weapons, and 21 battle cores to choose from. You can mix and match to create a weapon ship combination that best suits your style. Of course, there are also numerous hidden weapons and items for you to discover.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShip system: There will be over 25 player ships, with different numbers of cabins and passive skills. You can further customize your ship combination by choosing your own weapon and passive skill combinations. You can choose to focus on defense, all-out attack, or rapid charging, and each ship will have its own unique native weapons, which can be reasonably combined with primary weapons to achieve different combat styles. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWeather and scene event system: Different weather conditions will realistically affect gameplay, such as increasing the damage of laser weapons in space and making it impossible for fire weapons to ignite enemies. When landing on a planet, if a sandstorm weather condition occurs, the damage of laser weapons will be greatly reduced, but lightning weapons may have good damage. Different scenes will also have different effects, such as encountering earthquakes underground, which may require you to avoid falling rocks, and flying in clouds may require you to avoid lightning. Of course, these scene elements will also affect enemies, so you're afraid of being struck by lightning, and enemies are afraid of being struck by lightning as well. Make good use of it. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nStory system: The endless mode will have a complex story network, and each of your choices will lead to different consequences. For example, enemies can cooperate with you, and friendly forces can turn against you. Choosing to help who, attack who will affect the direction of the story and also affect the strength of the equipment you obtain. For example, helping certain factions can allow you to obtain powerful battle devices, while helping other factions may be willing to fight alongside you in battle. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFriendship system: The endless mode will have a friend system, and friends will help you fight enemies and attract firepower. However, whether there are friends, who are friends, depends on your story choices. Make good choices, and they can effectively help you reduce the difficulty and intensity of combat. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n*Summary of the Endless War mode: This mode will provide you with an endless and exciting battle against enemies in a horizontal STG game, and your choices will have a real impact on the direction and ending of the game. Enemies can become allies because of your choices, and friendly forces can also become enemies because of your choices. Be careful in your choices, pay attention to the story, and hidden stories may be waiting for you to trigger in some secret corners. Hidden ships and weapons are also waiting for you to discover, and there is also a score and ranking system in this mode.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n*Summary of the BOSS RUSH mode: In this mode, a fixed number of bosses will engage in a round-robin battle. The core experience of this mode is to persist until the end in the face of limited resources and continuous high-intensity combat, and to challenge the shortest time to complete the game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2086560/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1693715745","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2086560/page.bg.jpg?t=1693715745","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2086560/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1693715745","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2086560/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1693715745","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This is an era of turmoil, and the rule of the Star League over the galaxy is on the verge of collapse.
