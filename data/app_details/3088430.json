Stratogun is a modern interpretation of the arcade classics of the 80's. It's easy to pick up, but very difficult to master. Shoot your way through of swarms of enemies, unlock weapons ships &amp; perks to increase your chances of survival. Can you conquer the coveted top spot in the leaderboard, or will you die trying?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3088430/extras/Store_text_CONSUMED.png?t=1736407765\" /><br><br>At it's core Stratogun is an ultra-fast space shooter with tight controls. The game also includes progression as after each run your score is converted to experience points which in turn unlock new gear. Every unlocked item will increase your chances of survival, but in the end it will all boil down to your skills and reaction time.
