Unleash devastating firepower from the Venerable Dreadnought, bolster your Strike Force with the fearsome Techmarine, and gain enormous rewards by taking on additional challenges from the bridge of the Baleful Edict.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EXPERIENCE NEW MISSIONS</h2>The Bloom has mutated. Overcome the rampaging Technophage Outbreak by aiding the Adeptus Mechanicus and halting the scourge. In these missions you\u2019ll unlock potent new tools, discover new ways to strategise, and battle terrifying new foes as you further your campaign across the stars.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">COMMAND THE DREADNOUGHT*</h2>Combat this new threat with the thunderous Dreadnought, a venerable combat walker of legend that can join as a fifth squad member in any Technophage Outbreak mission.
