{"about_the_game":"Welcome to Sealed, a horror game that will immerse you in a disturbing and mysterious experience. You will find yourself trapped in a haunted hospital, where every shadow and every whisper will remind you that you are not alone. The presence of a ghostly girl, whose story is intrinsically linked to the place, will relentlessly pursue you.<br><br><strong>Game Objective</strong><br>Your mission is to escape this terrifying hospital while unraveling the dark secrets that surround it. To achieve this, you must:<br><br><strong>Solve Puzzles:</strong> Find and solve various puzzles that block your way to freedom. These challenges will not only test your wits but also reveal crucial fragments of the hospital's history.<br><br><strong>Use Special Tools: </strong>Among the tools at your disposal, the ultraviolet flashlight will be your best ally. It will help you uncover hidden clues, messages written in invisible blood, and other chilling revelations that are not visible to the naked eye.<br><br><strong>Game Features</strong><br>Immersive Environment: Explore every corner of the hospital, from abandoned operating rooms to gloomy corridors. The atmosphere is designed to keep you on the edge of your seat with eerie sound effects and detailed graphics.<br><br><strong>Engaging Story: </strong>Discover why you are trapped in this cursed place and your connection to the ghost that haunts you. As you progress, you will find diaries, notes, and documents that will help you piece together this dark puzzle.<br><br><strong>Constant Tension: </strong>The ghostly girl will give you no respite. You will need to move stealthily, avoid her gaze, and find hiding spots while searching for an exit. Every decision counts, and every mistake could be fatal.<br><br><strong>Survival Challenges: </strong>Beyond the puzzles, you will need to manage your inventory and use tools strategically to survive. For example, the ultraviolet flashlight has limited batteries, and you will need to find recharges if you don\u2019t want to be left in the dark.<br><br><strong>Multiple Endings:</strong> The choices you make throughout the game will lead to different outcomes. Your decisions will shape the story and determine your fate. Will you uncover the truth and find a way to escape, or will you become another lost soul in the haunted hospital?<br><br><strong>Do You Dare to Play?</strong><br>Sealed is not just a game; it is a test of bravery. Face your fears, uncover the hospital's secrets, and find a way to escape before time runs out. Can you solve the mystery and survive the night?","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Note 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3039720/cbeb4257932309600aab653334086d7f2155e0ef.jpg"},{"name":"Note 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3039720/3b2970e489c65c3068be28d042465a2f75b650df.jpg"},{"name":"Note 3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3039720/0233dc0d25c21343516a9d12413e7df8afc513c4.jpg"},{"name":"Note 4","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3039720/5432520924e106adbb0d2a942311a3401555a075.jpg"},{"name":"Note 5","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3039720/854f970702bb1e8a8c686e9fe75495334d267dbf.jpg"},{"name":"Note 6","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3039720/0052c7df581458f57213dc7547eaab5f0e5caab9.jpg"},{"name":"Note 7","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3039720/473bd5ba18bb3b88da24373c422544076239ef3e.jpg"},{"name":"Note 8","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3039720/46aac4e9dcea47af7ec08fd312a6bbf3f8e0413a.jpg"},{"name":"Note 9","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3039720/20ee5e0a804890c7dfcab24fff1421571d80286e.jpg"},{"name":"Dark light","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3039720/d02be45f25a68d696f81b7368ab4d7c7aea31b1b.jpg"}],"total":15},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3039720/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1719067120","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3039720/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1719067120","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3039720/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1719067120","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3039720/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1719067120","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to Sealed, a horror game that will immerse you in a disturbing and mysterious experience.
