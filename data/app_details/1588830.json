{"about_the_game":"This is a premium consumable ship. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSan Pedro, San Pedro Apostol or most commonly known as Rayo<br />\r\nRayo Class - is a Second rate ship of the line, which participated in Trafalgar. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSan Pedro Ap\u00f3stol was built by Spanish shipbuilder Pedro de Torres in Havana, Cuba. A very robust tropical wood was used in construction of the ship. San Pedro Ap\u00f3stol was laid down in 1747 and launched in 1749 alongside her sister ship Fenix. In her early years, the ship was used to carry particularly important passengers from the European royal families. In the beginning of the nineteenth century San Pedro Ap\u00f3stol was sent to Cartagena Shipyard for complete refitting and later participated in the battle of Trafalgar.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbout premium consumable vessels.<br />\r\nPremium ships cannot be captured by players or traded. You can request this vessel from the admiralty once a day as long as you dont have the same vessel already in your docks. You will be able to request the frame and planking wood type when ordering a ship. Admiralty requests for this ship will be completed instantly. You must have an appropriate rank to sail it fully crewed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nImported DLC ships are perfect if you just want to jump into action quickly, ignoring hauling of resources, just buy guns, repairs and you are good to go. DLC will appear in your redeemable list after you dock to any port.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1588830/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736406724","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1588830/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1736406724","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1588830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736406724","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1588830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736406724","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This is a premium consumable ship. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSan Pedro, San Pedro Apostol or most commonly known as Rayo<br />\r\nRayo Class - is a Second rate ship of the line, which participated in Trafalgar. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSan Pedro Ap\u00f3stol was built by Spanish shipbuilder Pedro de Torres in Havana, Cuba.
