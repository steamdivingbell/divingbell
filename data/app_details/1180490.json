{"about_the_game":"There are two kinds of people in the world, those living on the right side of the law, and those living on the wrong. Tona Ramirez was the second kind from birth. When she buried her father in an unmarked grave on the border, she took her inheritance: his nickname and a story of a man robbed of fortune. The Rat seeks that fortune now, and that search is what brought her to Louisiana.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1180490/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728572449","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1180490/page.bg.jpg?t=1728572449","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1180490/6d4bfe46ce771e5e07e154db47538cfd15820392/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728572449","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1180490/6d4bfe46ce771e5e07e154db47538cfd15820392/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728572449","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"There are two kinds of people in the world, those living on the right side of the law, and those living on the wrong.
