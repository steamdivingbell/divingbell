{"about_the_game":"It\u2019s time to dust off your overalls and hitch on your toolbelt in Manic Mechanics \u2013 a chaotic couch co-op game where you and up to three fellow grease monkeys pay a visit to the car-obsessed Octane Isle. <br><br>Your mission? Work your way around the island\u2019s six neighbourhoods \u2013 from the rust buckets of Betty\u2019s Scrapyard to the spooky shores of Banshee Bay \u2013 challenging the Master Mechanics that rule each part of town.
