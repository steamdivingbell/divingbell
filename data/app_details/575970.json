Ancient warrior machines spawn from Golem Gates while an unseen force compels you to take up arms.

Collect cards (called Glyphs) containing your forces and powers. Strategically weave them into a deck to prepare for battle, then create them on the field to defeat your enemies in fast-paced and highly tactical battles with streamlined management to keep focus on the action. Play singleplayer or multiplayer in local matches with bots, online matches with other players, single and co-op Survival, solo challenge scenarios and a full single player campaign.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Dynamic Diversity:</strong> 100 Glyphs provide the options for your strategy: Units, buildings, traps, buffs, debuffs, and techs. Create your own unique battle plan and counter your opponents'. Randomized drawing puts a slightly different spin on every battle - eliminating monotonous build sequences, rewarding deckbuilding skill and strategic planning in equal measure.<br></li><li><strong>Streamlined Strategy:</strong> Build your forces and enhance them with Glyphs; no production or research buildings needed. Capture resources in King of the Hill style without dedicated gathering units. Keep your focus where it belongs: on the battle.<br></li><li><strong>Fight Where You Have Sight:</strong> Glyphs can be played almost anywhere you have an existing presence. Add more forces to a battle to turn the tide, transform a scouting party into an army, place emergency defenses to respond to the enemy, or hide an outpost in a direction the enemy doesn't expect. The choices are yours, but beware: the enemy will do the same and with the right Glyph your forces can be destroyed as fast as they were created.</li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Fell the Hordes","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/575970/1668f88bf20ad6c56af6477714d862418e0831ee.jpg"},{"name":"Play The Game, Again And Again","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/575970/e629b71227f98a3579a41f4ff8415bf1d370379c.jpg"},{"name":"If You Cast It, They Will Come","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/575970/42656ba93117b09bfb7b636773941a7724696623.jpg"},{"name":"A Case Of Mistaken Identities","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/575970/265ab16c71114181281a10310342579d99b9345f.jpg"},{"name":"Structurally Efficient","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/575970/5911d9d843e1d047191936089f38b3b61a9967bb.jpg"},{"name":"Creating A Weak Foundation","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/575970/d50216cc3a5df6000ea80ac0bc4e2ce3e4d93044.jpg"},{"name":"I'm Outta Here!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/575970/20d738b72efaf6e669e12648cff82363b0fa5624.jpg"},{"name":"I Can See Clearly Now, \"The Ash\" Is Gone","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/575970/a66b9cdbd1258fca1753ee428c8a861f72137b93.jpg"},{"name":"Fortified Defenses","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/575970/dce30f58b2b1eb9e25ed5ff7bb8c5c2305e8c72f.jpg"},{"name":"Reuse and Recycle","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/575970/28a777b3ea1fbbf489e7b8facbf4970f81b57020.jpg"}],"total":26},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/575970/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1667163249","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/575970/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1667163249","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/575970/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1667163249","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/575970/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1667163249","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"In a desolate land ravaged by ancient wars, you are the Harbinger, an outcast with the ability to manipulate and command nanites from \u2018The Ash\u2019\u2013 a leftover power manifesting itself in your barren world\u2019s atmosphere.
