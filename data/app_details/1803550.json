Each time you play, the world is completely unique. Like the pirates who drive past  your gun turrets, they never get old!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">7 Unique Factions</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Choose from 7 different factions, each with a different playstyle. Try a vehicle-focused faction that starts with cargo speeders to race your goods around. Or perhaps a maglev-heavy faction, with a focus on limitless spaghetti. Or try a faction that starts with rockets from the get go, that can deliver resources to and from space at ease!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Climate Dynamics</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Titan's unique atmosphere produces complex wind and weather patterns. As you smelt raw ores, your waste heat and pollution will also heavily affect the climate and wind.
