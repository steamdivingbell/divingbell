{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">High above, the Cube floats like a silent, mysterious presence, growing with each wish fulfilled. Deep underground, you have a factory at your disposal, equipped with advanced tools for manipulating basic colored cubes. These cubes can be combined, rotated, raised, and assembled in almost infinite ways, forming figures that must fulfill the increasingly complex wishes of the Cubies, the tiny inhabitants of this world. Your task begins simply: create a batch of blue cubes. However, demand quickly grows, and with it, the challenges. Soon, the Cubies will require thousands of specific colored figures and composite structures, forcing you to perfect the factory and discover new combinations of colors and shapes to fulfill their desires.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each figure delivered contributes to the expansion of the floating Cube, which remains incomplete but palpably close to an unknown purpose. The Factory, your essential tool, must evolve to become not just efficient, but a versatile and robust machine, able to adapt to ever more elaborate demands: figures that combine colors by precisely mixing basic cubes, or complex structures assembled in unique configurations.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Cubies' satisfaction and happiness fuel the Cube, but your true goal is not just to fulfill the wishes of these beings, but to unravel the enigma surrounding the Cube in the sky. What is this mysterious artifact, and why does its expansion depend on these wishes? Only those who manage to complete the Cube will understand the truth that lies within. Can you build a Factory skilled enough to make the mystery that hovers over you a reality?</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2816490/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732979221","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2816490/page.bg.jpg?t=1732979221","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2816490/1d6d6bfaffe4cd1996519d74dfacecee14baf231/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732979221","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2816490/1d6d6bfaffe4cd1996519d74dfacecee14baf231/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732979221","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"HDR available","id":61}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">High above, the Cube floats like a silent, mysterious presence, growing with each wish fulfilled.
