More Speed Options.<br>As we promised, we have added 4 more speed options: x4, x6, x8, x10. With those speed options, we expect you to play difficult levels much easier since you will be able to see the gaps between notes more clearly.<br>Plus, we have implemented memory function which will keep your speed setting in a next round.<br><br>2. Fever System<br>Also, we have added the fever feature that multiplies your score depending on your accuracy. It will be activated when you fulfill the fever gauge on the right in a designated time. The bonus will be increased from x2 to x2.5 and finally x3 by consecutive fever.<br><br>3. Auto Chart (Beta)<br>Enjoy your favorite songs on Into the Rhythm VR without complicated procedures! By putting your .mp3, .wav or .ogg files in the \u2018sounds\u2019 folder, the game will make a chart by itself. We are still improving the algorithms for better accuracy, and will let you know when it works. <br><br>4. Additional Song<br>New track \u2018Carol of the bells - Zero Cover\u2019 is added. Not like previous songs, we focused more on implementing drum patterns, especially in the hard level.  Please share your opinion about it.<br><br>5. Bug fix and optimization.<br>There are many fixes in this update, but below two are the most important parts.<br>a. Key sound issue: Each note in the original tracks will make a sound correctly when you hit it. <br>b. lighting Optimization: We have removed heavy graphic effects and resources, so the workload is significantly reduced(loading time and input latency is reduced as well).<br><br>There are more things coming for you, so stay tuned.<br>Oh, and we wish you a happy X-mas and a new year.<br><br>Thank you</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Into the Rhythm VR is a drumming experience brought to virtual reality.
