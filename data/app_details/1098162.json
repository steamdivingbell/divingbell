{"about_the_game":"The 4,000-horsepower SD70, the final locomotive to utilize Electro-Motive\u2019s long-standard \u201cSpartan Cab\u201d design, is ready for Train Simulator service dressed in Canadian National\u2019s flashy black, red, and white livery.<br><br>The EMD SD70 family of locomotives was introduced in 1992. Along with its hefty 4,000 horses derived from Electro-Motive\u2019s 16-cylinder 710G3B power plant, the SD70 was notable for its use of EMD\u2019s HTCR radial truck. By the time the SD70 series of locomotives was introduced, the \u201cNorth American\u201d cab design had become the standard for new locomotives (making the SD70M, in effect, the \u201cstandard\u201d model). Seemingly, EMD\u2019s angular Spartan Cab design, which dated back to the GP35 of 1963, had reached the end of the line. But such was not the case, as four railroads ordering the SD70 type choose to specify the Spartan Cab design and these units would thus carry the straight \u201cSD70\u201d designation. At final count, 122 Spartan Cab-equipped SD70s were constructed between 1993 and 1999.<br><br>Among the railroads buying the SD70 was the famed U. S. railroad Illinois Central, which purchased 40 units (IC road numbers 1000-1039) during the period 1995-1999. Originally dressed in IC\u2019s black and white livery, the SD70s became mainstays on the IC\u2019s Chicago-New Orleans main line.<br><br>The year 1999 also marked Illinois Central\u2019s integration into North American giant Canadian National, and soon the IC SD70s began appearing in CN\u2019s flashy livery with IC sub-lettering. Today, the majority of the SD70s purchased by Illinois Central continue to serve the CN and can be found operating throughout both the United States and Canada.<br><br>The Canadian National SD70, created by Dovetail Games third-party programme partner Travel by Train, is outfitted in CN\u2019s black, red, and white livery and is provided in standard and winter textures. The SD70 is an ideal addition to the Train Simulator stable and is appropriate for use on a number of North American Train simulator routes given that CN locomotives often serve in run-through service on other railroads. And the CN SD70 DLC includes a pair of scenarios for the Train Simulator Canadian National Peace River route (route available separately).<br><br>Climb into a classic EMD Spartan Cab and do some heavy hauling \u2013 with the Canadian National Electro-Motive 4,000-horsepower SD70 for Train Simulator!<br><br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2><br>Two career scenarios featuring the Canadian National EMD SD70 on the Canadian National Peace River route are included:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>[SD70] Lumber work<br></li><li>[SD70] Winter operations</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on the Steam Workshop online and in-game.
