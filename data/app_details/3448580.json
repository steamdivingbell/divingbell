{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is the official Fan Pack for Siren\u2019s Call: Escape Velocity!

It has some extra goodies that we developed over the course of the past year. The headliner is a <strong><i><u>massive</u></i></strong> digital art book featuring some developer insights and key pieces of art/concept art from the game. We also included Andi's personal fitness plan and Judith's cookbook so you can live the Siren's Call lifestyle. There's also a very nice live-wallpaper featuring Violet.<br><br>In addition to the new stuff, we've also added more wallpapers and music! Along with the 13 HQ wallpapers from the beta, we also have included 7 new HQ wallpapers featuring CGs from the final release.
