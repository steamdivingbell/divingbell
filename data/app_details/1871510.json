It all started out with a house I've seen and said to myself &quot; I kind of want to build this house and make a scary game out of it&quot;. So, I began putting a rough blueprint together, and began developing the house (With a few changes, here and there). To be honest, my vision for the game at the preliminary stages is extremely different from what the game is right now. For one, it was supposed to be sunny outside, and the entire house was supposed to be lightmapped with no plywood blocking off the windows. Unfortunately, I am horrible with lightmapping and every time I did something with lightmapping, things broke, or things just looked ugly altogether. It was a struggle, that's for sure. But as time went on, new ideas popped into my head, and I began to implement these new ideas into the game - ultimately forming what we have here, today.<br><br>I am also really pleased to finally offer multiple language support. Though, this is my first crack at it, so please be warned, grammar errors may exist :)<br><br>To this day, I believe within Skerry is my best and scariest game. If you decide to give the game a go, I hope you pop on some headphones, turn the lights off, and enjoy the ride. Please, whether you enjoyed or disliked the game, please leave a review, as all reviews truly help me gage where my games stand, in terms of popularity. Tell me what you like, what you disliked, and even what spooked you out! All your responses will be greatly appreciated.<br><br>As always, I want to thank you all for the support.
