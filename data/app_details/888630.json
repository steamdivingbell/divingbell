With an emphasis on culture and character, ANOTHER SIGHT focuses on the emotional development of the relationship between its two protagonists, Kit, a refreshingly intrepid teenager, and Hodge \u2013 a mysterious red-furred cat. They meet in the darkness of a London Underground construction site, after Kit loses her sight when the tunnel she had been exploring collapses. They team up for an adventure into the unexpected, with Hodge proving himself to be an indispensable companion, upon whom Kit will come to rely. Kit and Hodge explore a surreal fantasy world, both together and separately, each using their own unique talents to make their way through compelling environments, and to solve intriguing puzzles. Beneath London, in a world inspired by Neil Gaiman\u2019s urban fantasy, Neverwhere, Kit and Hodge encounter a hidden society made up of the world\u2019s greatest inventors and finest artistic minds, including Claude Monet, Nikola Tesla, Thomas Edison and other historical cultural icons.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/888630/extras/AS_store_pic2.png?t=1562745636\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Another Sight Gameplay Features:</h2><br><strong>AN EMOTIVE ADVENTURE</strong> \u2013 A story about a girl and her cat companion on a journey beyond sight and the real world.
