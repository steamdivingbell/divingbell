{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Brother Brother</h2>You awake in a small world, in the small house that you share with your brother. His bed is cold and empty, and there\u2019s no sign of his whereabouts. Something doesn\u2019t feel right. Explore the land and gear up, finding your brother is going to be no walk in the park.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Wishlist my upcoming game - Greenwood Falls!</h2><br><br>Brother Brother is a nostalgic journey through a small land. Venture out and enjoy all the small details about the game. The satisfying sound of slashing through grass, the scared frogs fleeing to the safety of the water, the small birds who fly away because they don't want to meet you. Find the hidden bosses of the Forest and gear up to rescue your brother!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What can you expect?</h2>Get ready to spend a few hours immersed in this tiny world. You'll explore caves, dungeons, defeat bosses, help people around town, and more. This pint sized action RPG is reminiscent of the classic console days, and weekends spent sitting on the floor in front of the big tube TV. The gameplay is simple, gather your gear and talk to the townsfolk to figure out where your brother is. Use your sword to hack away at enemies, and find upgrades - like the Fire Ring, and the Shield - to prepare yourself for what's to come.<br><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 8 Unique Bosses<br></li><li> 9 Unique enemies<br></li><li> Steam achievements<br></li><li> Lots of people and items to collect and interact with<br></li><li> Fishing!<br></li><li> Classic RPG Soundtrack and sounds<br></li><li> Optimized for QWERTY Keyboard or Gamepad</li></ul><br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1147850/extras/Explore.png?t=1726015170\" /> <br>Explore a small, vast land - with plenty of hidden places and enemies waiting for you.
