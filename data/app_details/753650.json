Levels are built in-house via a procedurally assisted level generation process and are <strong>delivered weekly via steam update</strong>, which means you won't be playing on the same stale level. Our level designers edit each level before it goes out and are constantly trying new concepts.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/753650/extras/titles_02_plan.png?t=1696532794\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/753650/extras/MAP.gif?t=1696532794\" /><br><strong>Teamwork starts with a goal. </strong>Discuss your strategy over voice chat, and use the <strong>planning phase</strong> to draw up a plan of attack.
