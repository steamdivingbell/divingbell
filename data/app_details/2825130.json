The control scheme of Shadowed is simple, but the resource management, build decisions, and brutal status effects are not. Shadowed aims to keep &quot;gotcha&quot; deaths to a minimum, and base its difficulty around strategy instead.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Exiled from the Japanese imperial city, your character is on a one-way trip to &quot;scout&quot; a demonic castle. The legendary demon Shuten-Doji surely must have died centuries ago, and yet somehow, the Ooe mountain once again runs red with blood. Go forth to the castle, and wash clean your dishonor with death.
