{"about_the_game":"This Is Not Chess is a turn-based tactics game where squads of goofy characters duke it out across colourful battlefields. <br><br>Rather than every unit on the team getting a chance to move and attack, you have a number of actions you can use across the whole team. Moving, transforming or deploying all cost actions, but techniques are different. Techniques don't activate immediately and cost nothing to prepare. Leave a unit alone and they'll focus on their technique, executing it on a later turn! Or if you can't wait, you can spend actions to make it happen sooner... <br><br>While the wizard is flinging spells and the swordsman slashes, the jester throws his custard pies and the robotic stalker waits for its chance to pounce!
