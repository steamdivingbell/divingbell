{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Why choose Football, Tactics &amp; Glory when there are other football managers?</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If you\u2019ve played traditional football managers, you\u2019re probably familiar with the following feelings:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Complex attributes</strong>: Footballers have many attributes, and you don\u2019t always understand which ones truly affect the match outcome. Often, the only strategy becomes buying high-level players instead of finding a footballer whose unique attribute perfectly suits your tactics.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Unclear results</strong>: You never really know why you win or lose. This forces players to search for &quot;winning&quot; formations on forums instead of analysing the opponent and consciously selecting footballers capable of exploiting their weaknesses.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Financial complexity</strong>: Club funds quickly disappear, and it\u2019s hard to understand how to manage finances and strategically plan expenditures.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Football, Tactics &amp; Glory is a <u>game about full control</u> and a complete understanding of what\u2019s happening on the pitch and in the club:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><u>Transparency of attributes</u>: You always know exactly how each footballer\u2019s attribute impacts the encounters, allowing you to customise formations for each opponent, defeating even stronger teams with the right player selection and tactical approach. This also makes transfers much more interesting and exciting.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><u>Control over tactics</u>: Feel like a real coach, making smart tactical decisions, not just changing formations hoping for luck.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><u>Control over luck</u>: Luck plays a big role, as in real football. But you can minimise its impact by understanding your players\u2019 abilities and building the team around your playstyle.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><u>Strategic financial planning</u>: The game\u2019s economy is designed so that you always feel in control of your finances. The game demonstrates the importance of strategies like &quot;developing&quot; footballers for sale and finding promising talents who will become your future stars.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><u>No micromanagement</u>:\u00a0This is a game about <u>strategic planning</u>, not micromanagement. Instead of wasting time on increasing an attribute by 0.01%, you make decisions that significantly affect the club\u2019s fate. Therefore, the game lacks the boring elements of football managers: endless spreadsheets, routine tasks, and unimportant mechanics.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><u>Great variety</u>:\u00a0FTG is so deep that even after hundreds of hours, you\u2019ll continue discovering new and interesting things. The game world develops uniquely each time, creating new challenges and exciting emergent stories. This makes each campaign different from the last one.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><u>The game values your time</u>:\u00a0You can complete one football season in a few real hours instead of days, as in other football managers. At the same time, each season is packed with events and interesting decisions.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><u>Comprehensive tutorial</u>:\u00a0The game explains all elements in detail. And if you still have questions, the active community will answer them on the forum or Discord. </p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Why does a football manager need a turn-based match mechanic?</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Good turn-based mechanics allow <u>complex systems to be simplified</u>, while retaining their essence and emotions. For example, XCOM perfectly conveys the feel of firefights with aliens, and Civilization \u2014 the development of a civilisation.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Our turn-based system uses key football concepts to make match outcomes and your tactical decisions clear and transparent. Once you understand how these mechanics work, you\u2019ll feel the emotions inherent in real football.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Additionally, the ability to take your time with each move allows for comfortable gameplay. Especially if you\u2019re over 40 and don\u2019t have the reaction speed you once had.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">So, is it a full-fledged football manager?</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Yes, it\u2019s a serious football manager that\u2019s easy to start playing due to its apparent simplicity, but hard to stop because of the depth of its features.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><u>Take your club to the top</u>: Start in the lower league and lead your club to the heights of world football.
