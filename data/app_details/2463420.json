The game, made by AgeofGames (known at the time as PMStudios Italia) should therefore be considered an Artifact, a piece of the Independent Videogame Archeology from the beginning of the millennium. The proprietary engine, developed by a single programmer, was imperfect back then, and likewise right now, as hardware configurations have swiftly evolved. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Players should also note that the game cannot be saved until the first level is completed.</strong> The first level takes between 15 to 45 minutes to complete, depending on skill and the amount of each player\u2019s interaction with the enemies in the map.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Some antivirus systems may also block the game altogether.

However, this doesn't mean we should think of it as a wasteland. For example, a couple of years ago, we spotted P.M.
