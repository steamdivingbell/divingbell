{"about_the_game":"In the kingdom of the Phantom Knights, the mysterious and magnificent star spiritual energy of nature gave birth to humans and green dwarves. At the beginning of the story, the two tribes also had close ties and affection. They each selected the most outstanding and powerful knights within their tribe, and worked together to explore this vast but perilous wilderness of another world, ultimately establishing the Star Dome Knight Kingdom. However, one day, many treasure chests fell from the sky, which was not a gift from heaven, but Pandora's magic box. After prying open the treasure chest, people were surprised to find many valuable and powerful equipment treasures inside. The seeds of greed gradually spread and sprouted, and many people of the Knight Kingdom violated their original creed of &quot;vowing to maintain the unity of the kingdom and world peace to the death.&quot;. In order to profit from the treasure chest, they plundered not only the chest but also their lives recklessly.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2799740/extras/01.gif?t=1709279836\" /><br>A young knight found an ancient prophecy parchment note in an inconspicuous wooden box next to the ruins of his ancestors.
