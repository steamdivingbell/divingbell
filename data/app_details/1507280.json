In the first phase five rows fall down on the playing field one after the other. You can move the stones within the row to the left and right. Once the row is down, the next row falls and so on. After five rows the second phase begins. In this phase you can move all the stones at the same time up, down, left or right. This way you can close gaps, change the position of the stones and combine them.
