{"about_the_game":"Gateworlds is a nomadic colony sim about exploring a wild frontier through mystical portals. Manage your settlement and lead expeditions to explore other lands, while defending your settlers from the many threats that abound in the strange and wonderful Gateworlds.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Lead your settlers</h2>Each settler is an individual with their own skills, traits, relationships, and desires. If you can keep them all happy, loyal, and injury-free, the group will thrive. That won't be easy, however: the Gateworlds are a challenging place to live.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2544730/extras/lead_your_settlers.gif?t=1731541217\" /></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore new worlds</h2>Travel through a mystical gate to procedurally-generated new worlds. Explore mountains and deserts, floodplains and mangroves... but keep an eye on the time, as the gate won't stay open forever. If it closes before all your settlers have returned, you'll have to choose which group to follow, and which to abandon to their fate. Maybe you'll find them again later. Maybe something else will find them first.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2544730/extras/ezgif.com-optimize.gif?t=1731541217\" /></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Manage your settlement</h2>No sprawling towns here! Periodic relocation makes most frontier settlements lean and functional. Sleeping quarters, workstations, and a defensive wall are the only necessities, though most settlers will appreciate any further comforts available. Grow crops, hunt game, and process the resources you need to craft and maintain everyone's equipment. It pays to be ready when the gate opens again.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2544730/extras/manage_your_settlement.gif?t=1731541217\" /></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Face hostile conditions and dangerous creatures</h2>Under your direction, your settlers will brave bitter cold and blistering heat, deal with wildfires and floods, and defend themselves and their supplies from terrifying predators and formidable herbivores.
