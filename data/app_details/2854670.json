The singing saw, with its ethereal tones akin to the theremin, presents a challenge unlike any other instrument. Its lack of traditional markers or keys demands precision and finesse from the performer, with every note subject to the subtle nuances of breath, posture, and movement. <br><br>Can you hold the note steady enough?

Yay! Instead, the game asks that you forget about points and envision the music as an experience; a performance in which you can relax and exercise your creativity in a safe space. To that end, the Singing Saw Simulator features several sections in which the player is encouraged to improvise across the 3+ octave range of the saw. If that sounds scary to non-musicians, then don\u2019t worry; it just means you can mess around.<br><br>And remember - if you can create a melody that sounds more pleasing to you than the written one, then please do so.

From classical elegance to jazz-infused rhythms, from pulsating house beats to twangy country vibes \u2013 each section showcases the singing saw as the star of the show. Get ready to rock out with a dedicated metal segment!
