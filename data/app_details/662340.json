Seriously, who\u2019s idea was that? But yanno, me and my core team of way-too-good-for-me devs have kept at this for so many years cause we deeply believe in it. We believe this game deserves to exist, its story deserves to be told, its world deserves to be explored, and we have worked tirelessly in service of that. From day one what we\u2019ve wanted was to make something you come back to a decade from now and think about. We hope that you get to know Aine and her world, and we hope through figuring this game out, you\u2019ll feel that you yourself are a part of this too. For as long as I\u2019ve lived I\u2019ve dreamed of making a world that people would want to explore filled with characters that they\u2019d get to know and feel for. Through its loooong development, however, I\u2019ve discovered a game is greater than its parts. Lemme tell you - it took us two Kickstarters to make this happen. We got our butt kicked hard repeatedly. But what brought us back up every time was the community, our humble Discord, our backers, our fan artists and speedrunners. This game is not just about Aine\u2019s journey, it\u2019s not just about yours either, what this game is about is the journey we all take together. That special connection people have when they join together to do the impossible, to slay that dragon, that\u2019s what this game\u2019s about. It took a gajillion hours of effort from way more people than just the core dev team to make this happen, and hopefully it shows. I hope Renaine is gonna be that kind of game that lasts, a true modern classic, and we\u2019d be honored if you\u2019d join us to its finish!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/662340/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1718220840","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/662340/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1718220840","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/662340/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718220840","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/662340/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718220840","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":1328250,"description":"Steam Summer Games Festival Demo"}],"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/662340/extras/SteamDOUBLEJUMP.gif?t=1718220840\" /><br><br>Hey boyo, Mr. Octopus here and you\u2019re in for a wild ride.
