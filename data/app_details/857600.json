A screen flickers to life and a strange, illusory story starts and enrapture you and your fellow captives. One and all hold on their breath\u2026 Suddenly, you find yourself in the middle of a city you seem to remember from your past. Something isn\u2019t right.

My friends would be there, but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily want them to watch me play. Just like I wouldn\u2019t want to stand there and watch them play. I hope we could feel the thrill and excitement in the game together, but the game has to be uber scary even though I play with my friends. Smacking zombies could be boring, so I would delight in suspenseful plots. I also love a game that leaves us some room to reflect and review.<br><br>Furthermore, I like to move around when I play a game. To me, a game has to be more than just mashing the mouse, opening the door, even watching an ad\u2026 I crave for fascinating upgrades and elements for collection in the game, but I do not necessarily want to pay extra for things all the time. I want to earn them. I hope this is a game that will continue on for a long time. I hope this is a game that can bring us lots of fun no matter when we play it.<br><br>It\u2019s a shame that I haven\u2019t found a game like that, so I hope for the time being, the Twisted World wouldn\u2019t happen to me, yet.
