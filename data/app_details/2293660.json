Not just the kind experienced by other people, but quite possibly your own. It\u2019s a subject that is incredibly difficult to both explain and wrap your head around, to the point where a lot of people don\u2019t even try. And that\u2019s to the world\u2019s detriment.\u201d<br>Destructoid - Zoey Handley<br><br>\u201cHe Fucked the Girl Out of Me makes me feel how small our words are. I tried to call the developer\u2019s experience \u2018painful\u2019 when I started writing this, but does that word even begin to contain what this experience wrought? Does \u2018Trauma\u2019? Trying to distill these intense feelings into words feels like it minimizes them. It cools them and makes them easier to handle. But you can sense the volatility these words contain. The immense darkness inside. My words don\u2019t feel like enough to express what this game made me feel.\u201d<br>DreadXP - Joel Couture<br><br>\u201cThis raw, harrowing and very rough to get through Game Boy game deals with the developer's experience as a transgender woman doing sex work.
