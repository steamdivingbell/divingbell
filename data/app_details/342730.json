{"about_the_game":"Every day in the world of Refactor thousands of puzzle pieces are created for the explicit purpose of playing \u201cThe Game\u201d. Requiring perfection, only perfect puzzle pieces are selected for use and those who are imperfect are shunned by society and decommissioned. Thrown into this hostile environment, it is up to a couple of misfits to find their place in this unbending society.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRefactor is a physics-based platformer taking elements from classic Metroidvanias. Placed in a world that is a puzzle itself, you can literally turn the world upside down by rearranging the map and building your own pathways through the game. Uncover secrets, acquire new abilities and upgrades, and discover where you fit in the world.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/342730/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733164507","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/342730/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1733164507","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/342730/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733164507","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/342730/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733164507","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Every day in the world of Refactor thousands of puzzle pieces are created for the explicit purpose of playing \u201cThe Game\u201d.
