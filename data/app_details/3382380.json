{"about_the_game":"This is a puzzle game crafted for those who love to think \u2013 one that respects your intelligence and treats your time as precious. Every puzzle is a fresh challenge, bringing its own unique idea to the table, free from filler or repetition. It\u2019s a game filled with creativity, where each board invites you to explore a new concept, ensuring no two challenges feel the same. Thought-provoking yet rewarding, it offers a deeply satisfying experience for those who relish a good mental workout.<br>Imagine the elegance of Sudoku but re-imagined \u2013 stripped of numbers, amplified in complexity, and alive with innovation.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">It is not The Witness</h2>My all-time favorite puzzle game is The Witness. Its brilliance lies in the incredible quality and variety of its puzzles \u2013 something I can only aspire to. The bar it sets is exceptionally high. Qoob takes inspiration from that masterpiece but approaches things differently. It\u2019s a simpler game, yet it borrows the idea of puzzles that look similar at first glance but evolve as you progress. The rules shift and grow, encouraging you to observe, learn, and adapt. While I\u2019ll never match the scope of The Witness, I hope Qoob offers a similarly rewarding sense of discovery and challenge.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3382380/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736929167","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3382380/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1736929167","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3382380/37d131a2e23b033c656e99045ddbd344309eef6f/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736929167","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3382380/37d131a2e23b033c656e99045ddbd344309eef6f/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736929167","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This is a puzzle game crafted for those who love to think \u2013 one that respects your intelligence and treats your time as precious.
