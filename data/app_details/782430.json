A vast galaxy to explore, all the way from Star Base to the legendary Xanadu with 46 levels throughout 11 systems, and colorful little stars derping all over the place. The game includes 30 items with a hundred different stat boosts to collect for your bubbly and swanky ships: Zippy, Skippy, and Bob. They're fancy and special, so they need their proper swag.<br><br>Zippy, Skippy, and Bob are not alone! They have the help of 7 rocket surgeon stars, supporting them along the way: Matchy Star, Spacey Galaxy, Speedy Sputnik, Doctor UFO, Guru Moon, and Pirate Planet. These familiar faces are from Matchy's Kooky Cookies and MatchyGotchy, and they are coming back to the rescue. <br><br>Help Matchy Star complete all these puzzle challenges and make it all the way to Xanadu, because last time he was there he forgot his wallet. It is time to get your Matchy on!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/782430/extras/MS_Steam_Ships.png?t=1592336838\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Meet The Ships</h2>To reach Xanadu, Matchy Star has taken up the help of his three most efficient ships: Zippy, Skippy and Bob. The three ships must meticulously follow their flight plan based on the available path, extending their range with the help of the stars they collect along the way. In order to move forward, you must match as many stars as possible in the ship's flight path. The faster you string gigantic matches together the better. <br><br><br>Zippy is the largest and slowest ship, but he makes up for it by baking the best cookies ever. Skippy is mid-sized and goes second, holding the record for eating the most cookies under a minute. Bob is the smallest and fastest, and for some unknown reason he likes burnt cookies. However quirky their relationship with cookies might be, they all agree in their love of wearing items that helps them improve their stats. Get yourself a crown, a monocle, a beard and a sword! Turn your ship into the most stylish cool kid in the galaxy.<br><br>You can collect special power ups too, which provide important help to your space exploring efficiency. The number of victory stars you collect throughout each level determines their power level including: gem score bonuses, speed regulation, fuel consumption and buffer alerts. Advanced levels can get a bit difficult, so items and power ups can make a difference. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/782430/extras/MS_Steam_Loot.png?t=1592336838\" /><br><br>If you enjoyed MatchyGotchy and Matchy's Kooky Cookies, then we invite you come along with Matchy Star once more into the game that gave birth to this new colorful world.<br><br>Matchy Star is an original game by Silverware Games bringing a world of cuteness, random silliness, and interactive fun.
