While there are tension-building sequences meant to be unnerving, the game does not depict excessive graphic violence or gore.\r\n\r\nThe storyline explores mature subject matter, including supernatural occurrences and disturbing situations. However, it does not contain any explicit sexual content. There are references to alcohol and drug use in certain contexts.\r\n\r\nPotentially unsettling topics such as death, mental instability, and psychological trauma are present, but they are portrayed respectfully without gratuitous detail. There may be some jump scares and creepy imagery/environments.\r\n\r\nOverall, the game maintains a suspenseful and eerie tone rather than relying on shocking visceral content. However, parental guidance is still recommended for younger audiences due to the game's mature thematic elements and unsettling horror overtones throughout the experience."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About the Game</h2>Abnormal1999:The Compass and the Sand is a challenging mystery puzzle game.
