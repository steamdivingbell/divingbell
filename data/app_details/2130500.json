{"about_the_game":"Under Observation is a first-person, single-player horror game developed by a group of students from Kajaani University of Applied Sciences. In-game you are a researcher working at a Bioweapons R&amp;D company, focusing on national security. You've been given a subject which you need to study and fill out a report on. Now the subject has escaped its containment and the facility is on lockdown. The only way out is to open the main blast door with a staff keycard but unluckily you lost yours and need to find it. The rogue subject is a dangerous entity so you need to dance a fine line between avoiding it and following its every action to gather intel. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nResearch focuses on the behavioral patterns of the subject. The aim is to figure out the subject's perks and abilities such as sight, hearing, and diet. As you gather intel the subject's main type becomes more evident. There is a total of 20 different subject types. When you are confident about the subject's type, the research is completed. Some perks are more subtle such as genetype, which gives out no visual clues. Instead, you need to take a sample off the subject and run that through various experiments. Some terrifying variations of the subject are also able to turn completely invisible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou have many gadgets at your disposal that are used in the experiments. These include things such as flashlights, dart guns, tablets, and photo cameras. Guard post has a CCTV monitoring station which you can use to locate the subject.
