{"about_the_game":"The game HRDINA is about a hero that goes from a game to the real world. <br />\r\nLevels are generated by analyzing music which is provided by Czech band Zrn\u00ed.<br />\r\nThe whole music album &quot;Hrdina po\u010d\u00edta\u010dov\u00fd hry jde do sv\u011bta&quot; (Hero of computer game goes to the world) is used to generate the level and set the mood of the game.<br />\r\nIt is a simple platformer, however the perspective of the view is changing and in some levels and each one adds some new concept or obstacle type to the game.<br />\r\nWhile progressing thru the levels you witness the struggle of the hero using contextual queues, like &quot;takable text&quot;, obstacles and sometimes heroes commentary.<br />\r\nFind out how does the heroes story ends and unlock music in the bonus menu using keys scatered in the level.<br />\r\nThe content of the game is specificaly tailored to the content of the music and it's lyrics.<br />\r\nEven though the lyrics are Czech, the main character speaks using comics like bubbles to explain the plot.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSteam achievements are also present ! so get colleting ;)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is translated to Slovak, Czech and English languages.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"How does the story end
