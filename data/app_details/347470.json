{"about_the_game":"Mayan Death Robots reinvents the artillery genre (think Worms) in a Mayan setting invaded by alien killing machines. Pick a robot from the roster and enter the arena to destroy your opponent's power core. Aim your weapon before the timer runs out, but don't be distracted by the pretty scenery: when the rockets start flying, you already need to plan your next move! Will you choose to move your robot to a better vantage point, or will you build defenses to keep your opponent from landing a killing blow?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Features:</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Patience is not a virtue</h2>You never have to wait for your next turn. Each player acts at the same time, so whenever you fire a shot, expect to have the favour returned. Think Worms, but everyone takes their turn at the same time!<br><br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Choose wisely</h2>Pick a robot with unique abilities and weapons form a roster of ten lethal killing machines. Nuke, zap, implode, incinerate and destroy the opposition with your favourite robot and fighting style!<br><br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Practice organized religion</h2>Your tribe of tiny Mayas thinks you are a god descended from heaven, so they worship you and aid you in battle. Give them something to really believe in and blow up the enemy robot and his tribe!<br><br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Muscle out the competition</h2>The actual Mayan gods don\u2019t take your blasphemy lightly and come to crash the party.
