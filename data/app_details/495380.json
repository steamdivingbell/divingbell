Do you have what it takes to go down in history?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Features:</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>New Ladder Mode:</strong> Democrat or Republican? Choose your side and take the nation by storm as you campaign against members of the opposite party to win the presidency. Don\u2019t let your victories go to your head, though - each new opponent will prove more difficult than the last. No one ever said winning the election would be easy!<br></li><li> <strong>New Historical Candidates:</strong> Race against several historical presidents of the past and claim your victory against them. Each candidate comes with a modern perspective on all of the hot current issues and is ready to fight for the 2016 presidency. Defeat each candidate to unlock them for general gameplay.<br></li><li> <strong>New Challenges:</strong> Elections are unpredictable, so each ladder-mode match includes a custom challenge. Things like dealing with high gas prices, the people\u2019s mistrust of politicians, impending war, and more will keep you on your toes as you try to make your opponent\u2019s campaign points a forgotten memory.</li></ul>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/495380?t=1578339763","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/495380/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1578339763","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/495380/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1578339763","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/495380/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1578339763","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Battle for your spot in the White House against some of the most famous (and infamous!) presidents in American history.
