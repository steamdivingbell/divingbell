The monsters are dead set on bringing you back. Maybe more, but you cannot remember anything that happens once blacked out by them. Others are trying to contact you, but can you really trust them? The abyss shifts like the sea, but there is only one thing you remember. There is an outside, freedom. The portals. The portals are the key. Find the portals, and reclaim your freedom.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Navigate through a dark, evil abyss where your sight is severely restricted. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Rely on sound to guide your way and detect lurking beasts.
