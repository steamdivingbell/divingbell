An evil aura had consumed and poisoned the Sarook King's soul, and the corruption swayed him to unleash an army of monsters upon his own kingdom.<br><br>The young boy and his friend prevailed over the curse that threatened to engulf Sarook Kingdom. Several years after the king was saved, a war broke out between all of the kingdoms in the world. The Wolf-Blood Prince held the great Sarook King's castle hostage while he executed his evil plan for dominance.<br><br>In a final battle against the bloodthirsty beast, the true prince appeared and destroyed the threat, restoring peace to the world. Thousands of years passed after the downfall of the beast, and a boy from the future began receiving flashbacks from the distant past.<br><br>This young boy from the future was taken on a journey through time to help protect the kingdom of Sarook once more. He ultimately faced off against his worst nightmare: himself. An epic battle raged to seal the fate of the world once more.<br><br>Years after that fateful battle, the Royal Guard was summoned to the castle. No one could have ever imagined what was to come. A quest to save Sarook Kingdom from the domination of the Ancient Dragon Calamity resulted in a victory, leading the kingdom to a period of short-lived peace.<br><br>But someone still lives, someone who was a part of this story before. They would cast the darkest shadow that the kingdom would ever have to face.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Premise :</h2>Approximately 1 year after Edrian and Eserod destroyed the calamitous king of the underground, Edrian reality is broken by the action of his so-called dead father. The kingdom he once knew is gone and everyone with it as no memory of this distant reality. With only him, recalling his former reality, Edrian will have to find a way to get back what may be lost forever.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Game :</h2>This game is a turn-based JRPG made with the RPG Developer BAKIN engine.  It is the direct sequel to Adventure Field\u2122 4... In this game you will have to find items that will help you solve puzzles and fight your way trough dungeons and powerful enemies to save your lost reality. Between the fighting and the exploration, you will be able to cook, grow some vegetables, discover hidden mysteries hidden behind the night and day system made especially for this game, try to find what people need to finish side quests and find many collectibles...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Use Items to Solve Puzzles :</h2>In Adventure Field\u2122 5, you'll find items like bombs, a bow and much more, just like in zelda style games. Unlike other Adventure Field games, these elements will be used in real time on the screen to help solve these riddles.
