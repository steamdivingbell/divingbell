No trip over the seas is safe and every voyage could be your last. Or... You could find riches, power, and become legend! <br><br>Welcome to the dangerous waters of Tattered Sails, an open world piracy survival MMO set during the early 18th century. Here you have a choice; will your story see you rise as a hero of the guard or a dread captain of ruthless pirates? <br><br>Explore a world full of resources, sailing from one island to the next, gathering all that you need to build your own haven. Whether a simple home or an outpost, you can let creativity lead you. <br><br>Weigh anchor, loose the sails, and set out from your berth with a cargo hold full of goods you've crafted to make your fortune or... Load your ship with cannonballs and gunpowder, ready to hoist the colors and take down those merchant ships! The choices you make and the transactions you conduct matter with an economy that is driven entirely by player actions. Will the world see glorious riches or will it all crumble only to become a ghost story? <br><br>Join your friends, create a pirate crew or a company of guards, and let history remember you all as legends.
