Purposefully, all bugs, glitches, and movement exploits are left in (excluding where game-breaking or just unfun). Breaking games, abusing console commands, exploiting glitches, and finding unintended ways to play is what got me interested in development. These bugs and jankiness are a huge part of what I love about these B-grade platformers, so I've decided to leave them mostly untouched in this game.<br><br>With almost no invisible walls, you're free to go pretty much anywhere. Want to build up an absurd amount of speed and blast across the map at Mach 10? Feel like bouncing your way to a seemingly unreachable spot? You can do all of those things and probably just about anything else. I'm working on this project because I love these kinds of games, at their worst and their best, and polishing away all of the rough edges would totally remove both the charm it has and the excitement I feel for it. This is a love letter to the games I grew up on, and I want to totally embrace the era this game is a product of, rather than pretend like it's something it's not.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1924900/extras/happyjankgif.gif?t=1721980627\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1924900/extras/happyworlds.gif?t=1721980627\" /><br>Complete missions and rescue frogs in a handful of enchanting, creative, magical realms!

From the first few minutes of digging through the beta footage, design documents, and barely functional demo disc, I fell in love immediately. With his permission and a formal okay from the original developers, I gathered as much info on the game as possible and was graciously given permission to bring the game to PC and finally allow it to see the light of day. A huge fan of early 2000s platformers (especially of the lower budget variety), I've taken it upon myself to give this long-lost game the release it deserves, and I hope you guys end up loving it as much as I do.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1924900/extras/HappyDemoDiscImg.png?t=1721980627\" /><br><br><u><strong><i>DISCLAIMER: Various portions of this game's backstory may or may not be works of fiction.
