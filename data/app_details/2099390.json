Your goal is to figure out which symbol belongs in each space of a grid in the fewest moves possible, but you can approach this goal in many different ways. You might, for example, guess only one symbol at a time. This will give you clear feedback about each guess, but might be slower than making several guesses at once. You might focus on a single type of symbol (such as Sun) or try to clear several at once. There are a number of advanced strategies to discover and master as you experiment with the best ways to solve different puzzles.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2099390/extras/Symbol_Strip_1.png?t=1682293119\" /><br><br>The modifier levels will force you to develop new strategies or refine ones you have already discovered. For example, in &quot;Stacking&quot; you may only make guesses on the bottom row at first. This means you need to find ways to quickly gain information with small, localized guesses. By contrast, &quot;One-by-one&quot; only allows you to make guesses with a single symbol until you have found all of it's locations in the grid. This modifier requires gaining information about a wide area quickly, but restricts your ability to gather information about multiple symbols at once.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Rippling the Surface","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2099390/095a91ef3c5198e07c764a377e6cadcd39f152ae.jpg"},{"name":"A Traveller Rests","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2099390/ea76099ae19d878cf0a86a442796a86ee3abb0d0.jpg"},{"name":"Watery Depths","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2099390/1ffa1608a69bd9bd3ea5222d80f3f888f9f7f261.jpg"},{"name":"Beneath a Broad Oak","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2099390/55396b8b10d1cf7666091b0eff19e3e37c8b9593.jpg"},{"name":"One Traveller's Milestone","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2099390/c4430c99c02c2558d1f086150077f3395ef0a9b4.jpg"},{"name":"A Feathered Sentry","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2099390/83a0a0bcce4f3f0c9ce3c6c86fab003581981bb3.jpg"},{"name":"The Glint of Steel","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2099390/a85db0ed946bae49475590ce45dce47d048909c3.jpg"},{"name":"Flying Through the Underbrush","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2099390/eb3baf1bdd61fa43f0a8fb8b01bad4e9ed0d30f6.jpg"},{"name":"Spiralling into Eternity","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2099390/2c78fba4ce06a1ee4609a288d4d4f3b1650a0371.jpg"},{"name":"A Gossamer Snare","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2099390/8d970be2708d740b257164004e288a7409edd264.jpg"}],"total":17},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2099390?t=1682293119","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2099390/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1682293119","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2099390/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1682293119","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2099390/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1682293119","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A game of signs and symbols where you must use your wits and luck to deduce a shadowy omen.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2099390/extras/Second_GIF.gif?t=1682293119\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Randomly generated puzzles that use a different list of clues each time.<br></li><li> A relaxing and cerebral atmosphere, rich with themes of nature and the occult.<br></li><li> A campaign mode, where new modes and modifiers are unlocked as you progress.<br></li><li> Optional, high-pressure speed puzzles, where you must solve an omen with a time limit.<br></li><li> Additional hand-crafted puzzles.<br></li><li> Daily puzzles.
