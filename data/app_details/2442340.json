{"about_the_game":"Welcome to the World of Auto Racing! WAR is a collectible card game that we digitized to help grow the community! WAR pits you head to head with an opponent in a street race. You get to choose your starting car and deck and can install stat boosting mods, utilize your driver trait, take control of the race, and sabotage your opponent. Your cars power and handling will ultimately determine how well it does on the course, which is controlled by the racers. A lot of power isn't going to help you much on the corners but on those straightaways you will blow by your opponents! Players take turns playing cards back and forth, and at the end of the round everyone gains progress towards the finish line. First racer to reach 100 is the winner! As with real racing its often won or lost in the garage where you can customize your deck to your play style. Make sure to include lots of long straights and a turbocharger mod if you play with a lot of power! A lot of mods stack throughout the race, meaning in order to play a Stage II mod, you will need the corresponding Stage I installed first! Keep in mind you can only play one of each card type; Mod, Course, Condition, Team, Trait and as many control cards as you want per round. Well, what are you waiting for, tires aren't getting any warmer!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442340/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724713779","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442340/page.bg.jpg?t=1724713779","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442340/19380ce000f730f9dd952e22360cbfb0365fa432/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724713779","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442340/19380ce000f730f9dd952e22360cbfb0365fa432/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724713779","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to the World of Auto Racing!
