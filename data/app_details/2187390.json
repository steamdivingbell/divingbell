{"about_the_game":"In &quot;Conqueror of the Seas,&quot; you'll become a captain navigating through treacherous waters with a variety of weapons at your disposal. Choose your ship, customize it with upgrades and armaments, and team up with friends to conquer ancient cities like Constantinople. It's time to rewrite history during the clash of medieval empires!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2187390/extras/ezgif_600_Lean_fast_1.25.gif?t=1723455396\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Your Kingdom:</strong></h2>Choose wisely, as every decision you make will have consequences in &quot;Conqueror of the Seas&quot;. Your allegiance to a medieval empire will grant your captain unique abilities for navigation, offense or defense. Join the warfare between the Ottoman and Byzantine Empire and support your chosen side with your own flag on the disputed waters.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Ships:</strong></h2>Another important factor is your ship selection, as it will be the backbone of your fighting profile on the waves. Square rigged ships offer speed downwind, while lateen sails give unparalleled speed when sailing upwind. You can customize your vessel with fittings and use your captain abilities to maximize your firepower, defense, and agility. Continuously adapt your ship to the ever-changing conditions of the naval war to find the best possible combination for victory.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Navigation:</strong></h2>Optimize your ship for a specific sailing profile, but beware of the wind direction! High firepower and defence ships are tough but slow, while lighter ships offer speed and agility to sneak in and out of harbors.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Naval Warfare:</strong></h2>In &quot;Conqueror of the Seas,&quot; use your ship and its armaments to outmaneuver and defeat enemies in a realistic simulation. Employ deadly broadside cannons, fire arrows, Greek fire, and barrel bombs to inflict devastating damage. Whether on the offensive or defensive, you can choose to de-mast or de-crew enemy ships, which can be a high-risk, high-reward strategy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Conquest:</strong></h2>Fight for the domination of historical Constantinople with recreated maps. Choose your allegiance and engage in naval battles with enemy ships. Utilize tactics such as looting, trading, and attacking on sight to gain an advantage. Conquer outposts and develop them into resource-producing fortified harbors to support your nation's war efforts.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Progression:</strong></h2>As you defeat your enemies and capture outposts, you'll gain experience and reputation, which will unlock special abilities and skills. Your victories on the seas will determine your local reputation and global rating, making you a renowned captain in &quot;Conqueror of the Seas&quot;.<br><br><br>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2187390/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1723455396","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2187390/page.bg.jpg?t=1723455396","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2187390/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1723455396","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2187390/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1723455396","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Stats","id":15}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In &quot;Conqueror of the Seas,&quot; you'll become a captain navigating through treacherous waters with a variety of weapons at your disposal.
