Built to counter the American F-15 Eagle, the Flanker is a twin-engine, supersonic, highly maneuverable air superiority fighter. The Flanker is equally capable of engaging targets well beyond visual range as it is in a dogfight given its amazing slow speed and high angle attack maneuverability. Using its radar and stealthy infrared search and track system, the Flanker can employ a wide array of radar and infrared guided missiles. The Flanker also includes a helmet-mounted sight that allows you to simply look at a target to lock it up! In addition to its powerful air-to-air capabilities, the Flanker can also be armed with bombs and unguided rockets to fulfil a secondary ground attack role.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/316963/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727036841","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/316963/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1727036841","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/316963/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727036841","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/316963/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727036841","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"VR Support","id":31},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong><u>This campaign requires DCS World along with either DCS Flaming Cliffs 3 or Su-27 for DCS World.</u></strong><br><br>\u201cSu-27 - The Ultimate Argument\u201d is the storyline campaign for a Russian Air Force pilot flying the Su-27 fighter aircraft in the Digital Combat Simulator.
