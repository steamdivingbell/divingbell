Do you want critically fumbled spells to tangle casters in ectoplasmic slime? Or do you think throwing the pin instead of the grenade is hilarious? When you roll a 1 on an attack, simply draw a card and apply one of four different effects based on attack type. These cards are designed to work with the Starfinder Roleplaying Game and can be used by players and GMs alike.
