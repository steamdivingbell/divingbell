Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBinding Arbitration<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved through binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") and, where appropriate, the AAA\u2019s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (\"AAA Consumer Rules\"), both of which are available at the AAA website: www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in New York, New York. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in New York, New York, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) is excluded from these Terms of Use. IN ANY CASE AGAINST US, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE. A JURY WILL NOT BE THE FACT FINDER IN ANY DISPUTE.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Services be commenced more than one (1) years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable, and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, AND IN ANY CASE AGAINST US IN COURT, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRestrictions<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures and you may not join with any other person to bring a collective or class arbitration or suit of any type; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons and are not permitted to serve in a representative capacity in any such suit or arbitration.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCORRECTIONS<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere may be information on the Services that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions, including descriptions, pricing, availability, and various other information.
