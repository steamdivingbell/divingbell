Just start this game before you study, work or even sleep, and enjoy the atmospheric background music. <br>And when you come back, reward yourself with an addition to your virtual toy collection.

Very useful!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE STORY</h2>The game does not have the usual story, but each toy, each series, everything tells its own little story. <br>You can meet more than 500 original toys from more than 100 different series. Just imagine what kind of story you can discover by collecting them all!<br>If it is not enough for you, then try to collect all the toys released in one year, and then the game protagonist will share with you his memories related to this year. Perhaps this will help you remember about <u>your</u> impressions from that year.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> THANKS </h2>I am very happy to have your attention, and I would be very grateful if you could share your suggestions and comments in the reviews so that I can make this game an even more comfortable place for all of us.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1487000/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1690305994","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1487000/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1690305994","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1487000/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1690305994","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1487000/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1690305994","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1487000/extras/thestory.png?t=1690305994\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">IN MY OWN WORDS</h2>I spend a lot of time working, and the best background music for me are sounds of nature or lofi beats.
