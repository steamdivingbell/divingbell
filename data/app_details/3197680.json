{"about_the_game":"Warplock began as a small personal project in my first year at college. Over my time as a student I continued working on it and devoting more and more time to it. With the help of my girlfriend, I have been able to create the game that it is now. Warplock is a top-down action roleplaying game. The goal? To beat each biome. Along the way you will find various upgrades and items you can pick up. You will cast spells and destroy monsters who pray on your demise. When all is said and done, you return back to your home base to restore your health and magic and place the necessary upgrades before returning back to the wilderness. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe at Quackpot Studios hope that you enjoy. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n-quack quack.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3197680?t=1725649528","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3197680?t=1725649528","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3197680/5647f5f01615af9493abe52e3647dc1f5ca3da89/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725649528","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3197680/5647f5f01615af9493abe52e3647dc1f5ca3da89/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725649528","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Warplock began as a small personal project in my first year at college.
