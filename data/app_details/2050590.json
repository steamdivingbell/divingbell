{"about_the_game":"Once again, you hear whispers in your dreams. The slimy voice, like that of an inorganic substance, chants a long series of obscure syllables.

Offer tribute to that great being and wish him to break free from his prison and let chaos come again!<br><br>Fhtagn Simulator is a Roguelike card game inspired by deck-building games such as Luck be a Landlord, Slay the Spire, and Monster Train. If you don't collect enough spirit within the time limit, you will face punishment from the ancient gods resulting in game failure. <br><br>The world of Cthulhu is chaotic and disorderly, so cards always enter the roulette in a chaotic order, and each round may produce a different result. Except praying, there is one way to fight against Chaos, and that is to manage the card slots on the roulette. With a little change, you can maximize value of your cards.<br><br>During the course of the game you will experience various events, as well as obtain various cards, powerful mythical monsters, humble human sacrifices,  evil spells and so on.
