{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2><br>In a magical land lives a group of friends-wizards Gribski, Daria and Ned. All their lives they competed with another wizard Donovan and his team and were irreconcilable rivals with them. One day, Gribski found out that Donovan had performed a great feat, which was even written about in the newspaper. Now friends need to perform two feats to prove that they are better. This is not an easy task, and they had to call for help their classmate Macita, who has been living in a dungeon for a long time, is engaged in dark magic, dreams of taking over the world and does not communicate with anyone.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What kind of game is this</h2><br>This is a dynamic action game with a side view, where you have to navigate through various locations and fight huge crowds of enemies. Use magic, shoot, hit, push, blow up, jump, fly.<br><br>You have to control the wizard. You can choose from several characters.
