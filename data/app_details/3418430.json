{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">10 Seconds is a game that hinges on its innovative design . You are trapped in a failed time loop experiment, where you have 10 seconds to scramble for supplies and safety before a monster is released to hunt you down. Crawl through vents, scour walls, find tools and twist valves. Doing everything you can to escape being eaten alive. When you die, you wake up back at the start. Though you may notice that not everything has gone back to normal. Perhaps the experiment was not perfected before things went awry? This game is designed to be completed in one sitting, only taking about 30 minutes for a single run, so there is no save feature. Make use of the physics system that allows you to pick up and throw items. It may be more useful than you think!</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3418430/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738242591","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3418430/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1738242591","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3418430/5df14d729e26e44a8918debb2818606fdc5eda4b/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738242591","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3418430/5df14d729e26e44a8918debb2818606fdc5eda4b/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738242591","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"There's a gun and some skeletons, and when you die it sounds squishy and gross."},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">10 Seconds is a game that hinges on its innovative design .
