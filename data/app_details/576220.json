{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>What's Down in Those Mines; It Ain't of This World!</strong></h2><br><i>A strange craft fallen from the stars, long the home of a tribe of monstrous mutants worshiping the long-forgotten technology in its ruined bowels, has birthed a new and fearsome scourge. Alien prisoners once bound in its holds have escaped from the derelict, bringing terror and death to a poor mining town while a lone android marshal wanders the wasteland seeking these escaped interplanetary convicts. The heroes find themselves stalked in turn by an unearthly abomination in a twisting catacomb of mines and must dare the precarious ruins of the dangling spacecraft embedded in the cliffs if they are to stop the conquering forerunners of an ancient empire buried centuries ago from rising again to pick up where they left off... with world domination!</i><br><br>Scorpions of Perdition is a Pathfinder Roleplaying Game adventure for 8th to 9th-level characters by Alex Riggs and Nicolas Logue that blends pulp action and tense horror with a dash of sci-fi elements throughout.
