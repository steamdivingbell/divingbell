{"about_the_game":"Holy Stick! is a party game, and action shooter for up to 8 players where you use powerful weapons to shred the limbs of your enemies! There are different weapons, maps, customisation options and a Craziness System. On top of that - no health bars! Brace yourself, limbs will fly!<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Dynamic Body Damage</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/821840/extras/animated-header_damage.gif?t=1703844424\" /> Forget about health bars, in this game you have to take good care of your body! Getting a bullet in the knee might result in losing an entire leg, which will slow you down. Having your hands chopped off will make you unable to use weapons - you'll have to kick your way out of a fight, so that you can heal and quickly get back to action!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Customization</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/821840/extras/animated-header_customization.gif?t=1703844424\" /> Give your stickman a unique personality, by using a wide selection of costumes and voices. We've got everything - knights, pirates, soldiers, ninjas, Italian chefs, French musicians... Or would you like an American special forces commando, who runs around with a giant donut sledgehammer and shouts &quot;Bon voyage!&quot; while pounding his enemies into the ground?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Loads Of Content</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/821840/extras/animated-header_content.gif?t=1703844424\" /> It will take a long time, before you experience everything we've packed into Holy Stick! We've got a huge arsenal of firearms and melee weapons to chop up your enemies, a wide variety of gamemodes to choose from, multiple beautiful maps, and a mysterious Craziness System, which changes the game's rules from time to time. You know, lower the gravity a bit, force everyone to jump, turn the entire game upside down or have everybody using shotguns with explosive ammo... just to keep things spicy!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Hand-drawn Artstyle</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/821840/extras/animated-header_artstyle.gif?t=1703844424\" /> Do you remember that time at primary school, when you used to draw simple characters and scenes on the back of your notebook?

Would you like to sit back on a couch with a couple of friends and play a casual match? Splitscreen for up to 4 players is the right choice! Do you prefer online multiplayer and don't mind playing with strangers? We got you covered! Or maybe you'd like a hybrid setting, like 4 vs 4 match with two machines, joined into one game over the internet? We can handle that too! The only thing we don't have right now is a single player mode.</ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Too Late.
