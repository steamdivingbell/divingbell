{"about_the_game":"The Moon is shattered. Broken. Lost in the vast space above planet Earth. What was once a beacon of hope in the sky has now left survivors to deal with a new, catastrophic void in \u201cShattered Hope\u201d, the new Expansion for Surviving the Aftermath. Use the Moon\u2019s fragments to your advantage and make sure to keep your hopes up (literally!) to survive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Face the Moonfall and use it to your advantage with the new Building Boost mechanic</h2>The Moon is shattered in the sky and its fragments are crushing down on Earth leaving behind them devastation -  but also moon rock deposits. You can refine lunar fragments and obtain lunar dust which will be used to increase the production of your buildings for a limited time. This new building boost mechanic is called overtime.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Keep your hopes up, and feast! </h2>Hope is a new global value that decreases over time and when catastrophes happen in the game. If kept too low for too long, it will trigger a new condition called anguish that, if left untreated, may turn your colonists hostile. So, keep your hope as high as possible by holding feasts at the new colony square building!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New production chain: take care of your colonists!</h2>When colonists experience anguish, you can help them by building a trauma center where they will heal. They will recover faster thanks to a brand new medicine called antistress. To make it, you\u2019ll have to grow raw resources on the mushroom farm, then refine them into the actual medicine in the med hut building.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2146190/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1700121928","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2146190/page.bg.jpg?t=1700121928","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2146190/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1700121928","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2146190/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1700121928","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Moon is shattered.
