Choose a car in the garage. The more gun slots on the machine, the more weapons you can pick up and use at the same time in battle. A lot of weapons do not happen, but even better if they are already installed in the garage. You have more chances to win if you choose machines with installed tools in the garage: MARS, school bus, hammer, WarTruck or BEAR !!!<br><br>2. Break into the big map with other players. Here, every man for himself!<br>\u00a0- first task: find the weapon on the map, which is highlighted by the icon. When driving a weapon, it will automatically fall into the machine\u2019s gun slot.
