There's a lot of mechanics here and the manipulation never feels like it's about tricking someone into sex...Really well done. Fantastic story. Great game design. This is really high up on my list of favorite games. It's probably in the top 25...way better than I thought it was going to be.\u201d<br>Gayme Boys Podcast on Spotify, Episode 31 - Be Gay, Do War Crimes<br><br>\u201c...the artwork is absolutely gorgeous and really captures the super hero aesthetic with a yaoi touch wonderfully, though with the super hero genre already being made up of tight bodies and even tighter costumes the mix of heroes and yaoi is a match made in heaven. I myself being a fujoshi of particular tastes especially enjoyed the character of Lascivion which brought to life many fantasy I have had in the past about a particular Marvel symbiote and the naughty moments with this character were some of my favourite in the game as was the surprise mini game in his route.\u201d<br>Yaoi Playground<br><br>\u201cAn aspect of the game which turned out to be a particular treat is the references to superhero and queer culture which is prevalent through the demo. It almost makes Mister Versatile feel like an ode to the gay geek sub-culture of the community at times.\u201d<br>Magnus Alexander, Magnus
