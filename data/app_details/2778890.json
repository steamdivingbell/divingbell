{"about_the_game":"Orbx proudly presents the DCS: Kola map, which covers northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Russian Murmansk Oblast and parts of the Karelia region. The map also includes large areas of the Barents Sea and Norwegian Sea to the north and west, ideal for aircraft carrier operations. The Orbx DCS: Kola map is represented in its current-day state, with some allowance for late-Cold War military features and functionality.<br><br>The Kola map spans about 1,400 km east-west by 1,000 km north-south, with more than 575,000 sq km of land and a total coverage area of ~1,350,000 sq km. Its southern boundary roughly aligns with 65 degrees latitude, meaning most of the map area falls within the Arctic Circle. The Kola map covers various natural landscapes, from the dramatic fjords and island chains to vast forested areas with myriad lakes and wetlands, to rugged mountains, to the Arctic tundra. Cities, towns, mines, ports, and infrastructure corridors, all have unique characteristics determined by their location and cultural association.<br><br>The area\u2019s geopolitical significance stems from its largely ice-free Arctic ports, rich natural resources, important military installations and training areas, and past and present East-West tensions, the latter of which have significantly increased by the recent accessions of Sweden and Finland to NATO and Russian military operations.<br><br>The Russian portion of the map is home to its Northern Fleet and includes the mostly ice-free ports of Murmansk, Severomorsk, and the strategically important submarine bases of Polyarny. Also in this area are the important Russian air bases of Olenegorsk, Monchegorsk, Severomorsk, and others. The narrow land corridor from the Kola Peninsula towards the Baltic region has evolved into dense clusters of military airfields and installations, and has been listed as having the highest concentration of nuclear weapons, reactors, and facilities in Russia. This area, along with parts of central Finland adjacent to its border with Russia, is the focus of the early-access release.<br><br>The included regions of Norway, Sweden, and Finland also feature critical airbases, army bases, weapon and fuel storage depots, and training areas. Notable airports include Rovaniemi and Kemi-Tornio in Finland, Kiruna and Vidsel in Sweden, and Bodo, Andoya, and Lakselv in Norway.
