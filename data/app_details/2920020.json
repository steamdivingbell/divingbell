{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2920020/extras/Crystal_Guardian.png?t=1713789396\" /><br><br>The Crystal Guardian game is a tower defense game based on strategic elements of time management and tower placement according to the locations of different biomes. Every night at 00:00, different enemies emerge from different biomes and attempt to destroy the crystal. You must strategically place towers that will inflict more damage to the creature of that biome, as different enemies come from different biomes. However, remember that the difficulty of the game is not only the enemies but also finding solutions to hunger and thirst. To do this, you must explore and gather resources during safe hours in the daytime. Each biome has different resources. The game starts over when the crystal is destroyed or when you die, so try to learn from your previous games and survive until the 100th day. Good luck, guardians, in your mission!<br><br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2920020/extras/Key_Features.png?t=1713789396\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Strategic tower defense gameplay based on time management and biome-specific enemy encounters.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Dynamic enemy waves spawning from different biomes every night at 00:00, posing a threat to the crystal.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Placement of towers tailored to deal maximum damage to creatures from specific biomes.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Survival elements including managing hunger and thirst, requiring resource gathering during safe daylight hours.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Diverse biomes offering different types of resources.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Permadeath mechanic where the game restarts upon crystal destruction or player death, encouraging learning from past experiences to survive up to the 100th day.</li></ul><br><br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2920020/extras/Tower_Placement.png?t=1713789396\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2920020/extras/sample.gif?t=1713789396\" /><br><br>Each biome has its own unique enemies, and the towers capable of damaging these enemies vary.
