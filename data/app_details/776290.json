{"about_the_game":"Feel the road, feel the freedom. It's hard to resist the 2000hp. You will become weak. You will scream. Steer with the help of the touch controller your motorcycle. If no touch is available, you can also use a gamepad or keyboard. With touch it\u00b4s more realistic. After a few seconds you feel like on the Road 66 with a bunch of crazy drivers. Unfortunately, the cars have the negative characteristic very easy to explode. But they are very environmentally friendly. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTest first your driving skills by completing the driving school.
