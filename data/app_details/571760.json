{"about_the_game":"Chaos Dwarfs are the twisted descendants of Dwarf explorers who have been terribly affected by the forces of Chaos, turning them into evil, self-centered creatures. In one way they haven\u2019t changed at all, they still love playing Blood Bowl! They are joined by the legendary star-player Zzharg Madeye.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Chaos Dwarfs are defence-oriented team, benefiting from the great velocity of their bull centaur retrievers and from a very powerful front line that can endure (and apply) a lot of pressure. Also, one of their strongest characteristics is that powerful players, like bull centaurs, unlock their powerful skills very quickly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main weakness of the Chaos Dwarfs stands in their poor ball-handling skills. Indeed, due to their tiny size and low agility, they have to rely on hobgoblins in order to push the game forward. Hobgoblins are quite agile, but are also very prone to getting crushed by any opponent.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/571760/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1640279360","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/571760/page.bg.jpg?t=1640279360","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/571760/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1640279360","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/571760/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1640279360","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Chaos Dwarfs are the twisted descendants of Dwarf explorers who have been terribly affected by the forces of Chaos, turning them into evil, self-centered creatures.
