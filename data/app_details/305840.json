There are two playable prototypes up, but <strong>we don't recommend buying the game at this stage.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What happened here?</h2>Game design is tough and after 4 long years working on this thing we burntout and ran out of funds, the path forward for us wasn't clear at the time and so the game sat abandoned for 3 years.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What can I expect?</h2><br>Not your average RTS that's for sure, we're going for something a little more freeform. We're now our third iteration perfecting our vision of the 'Fleet Warfare RTS.'<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">But what does this actually mean?</h2><br>It means that in this Early Access project we don\u2019t have all the answers upfront and so what you see here will change. The ship designs and graphic effects are all solid, but the execution will vary in the finished game.<br><br>In 3.0 we\u2019re adding free-roaming multiplayer; the chance for hundreds of Players to work competitively or cooperatively towards common goals.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">So what\u2019s on sale now?</h2><br>The screenshots and video you\u2019re seeing are from 2.0, owners have access to this on Steam. 1.0 is also available to play as a bonus (if you switch builds in the games properties,) and you\u2019ll also have access to 3.0 when it replaces this title on Steam.<br><br><strong>Support us in our journey by adding us to your wishlist!</strong></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Construct your fleet ship-by-ship by foraging in asteroid clusters and nebulas for resources and completing missions.
