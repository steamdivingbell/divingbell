{"about_the_game":"Strategize, build, and manage your resources as you experience first-hand what it takes to create a successful settlement prior to your launch to Mars. Configure your colony around challenging terrain, construct your base, and use specialized tools to terraform Earth to your needs. Prove that you are capable of taking your mission interplanetary.
