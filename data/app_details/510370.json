Through this tear, you have re-emerged confused, hungry, and ready to reclaim your place in the world.  <br><br>The denizens of our world have no hope of standing against you alone once you are at full power.  But, you start out with little gold and power, so a barrage of arrows can quickly end you in the beginning.  Use your devastating abilities to destroy their dwellings and collect their gold to increase your power.<br><br>The goals are mostly centered around causing mass destruction and mayhem in the human world.  It is a game about playing as a truly terrifying dragon, not lumbering reptiles with wings and one slow/avoidable attack.  You will have several abilities with augmentation and/or utility to add along the way.
