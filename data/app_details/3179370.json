{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3179370/extras/wishlistnow.jpg?t=1729106687\" /><br><br>Guide your civilization to epic victory in Ephemeris, the upcoming turn-based space war strategy game with RTS style combat. Ephemeris draws inspiration from some of the genre\u2019s classics like Master of Orion and Homeworld, and brings them together with some unique and new features, like physics-based combat and a randomly generated tech tree. The strategy side has been streamlined to minimise the need for micromanaging the details. Explore the huge galaxy and spread your civilization onto the planets \u2013 before anyone else does. Unlock new technologies, design your own spaceships and use diplomacy to reach your goals. If the peaceful approach fails, show them what your spaceships are made of and unleash your fleets upon the enemies! Ephemeris offers a unique and highly replayable gaming experience. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3179370/extras/GIF_combat.gif?t=1729106687\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unique space combat</h2>The space combat in Ephemeris is in real time and fully three-dimensional. Huge size differences between the smallest fighters and the biggest battleships as well as the physically simulated movement give the combat a very distinct and cool look. Ships are designed by using parts unlocked from the technology tree. Choose hulls, shields, power sources, drives and weapons with different mounting types to design the ships your civilization needs.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3179370/extras/GIF_empire-management.gif?t=1729106687\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Streamlined empire management</h2>The turn-based strategy layer is designed to be fast paced but still have depth. With lots of automatic optimisation, you only have to worry about the most important parts of empire management. This keeps the game manageable even in the late stages and allows you to enjoy one playthrough from start to finish.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3179370/extras/GIF_tech-tree_ship.gif?t=1729106687\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Randomly generated tech tree</h2>The tech tree for one playthrough is randomly generated and common for all civilizations \u2013 players get to explore the hidden tech just like they explore the galaxy map. Players have to be ready for different approaches in galaxy exploration as well as in combat. This means that there is a lot of variation in the progression of the game between each playthrough, as you cannot always rely on your favourite strategy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Labour of love</h2>Ephemeris is a passion project started by a solo developer.
