{"about_the_game":"Tens of thousands of children die every day worldwide; when 6 year old Helena was hit by a city bus in the streets of Lima, she should have been one of them. She was in fact pronounced dead on the operating table, but suddenly sprang back to life exactly three minutes later. She spoke adamantly of visions of heaven and claimed that God had sent her back for a purpose beyond her understanding. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYears later, she stumbled upon an ancient cache of Templar arms and armor. With a determination bordering on fanaticism, she trained herself in the use of it. After a year of solitary prayer, It was time for her to fulfill her purpose: to purge the world of evil.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn some realities of the Multiverse, Fanatic joined the costumed Sentinels of the world and became a Prime Warden. In this disparate reality, she seeks out and destroys evil within the darkest dungeons!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis DLC includes the Fanatic hero card for One Deck Dungeon.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/860981/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1530024456","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/860981/page.bg.jpg?t=1530024456","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/860981/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1530024456","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/860981/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1530024456","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Tens of thousands of children die every day worldwide; when 6 year old Helena was hit by a city bus in the streets of Lima, she should have been one of them.
