{"about_the_game":"The earth is contaminated, there are hardly any people left alive. Human pride reaches its climax with the use of AI to generate a wormhole to another planet. During the opening, energy from another three-dimensional reality leaks into our atmosphere. Humanity falls in just 30 days due to the radiation of said energy, and those who do not die, mutate into wild beasts without reason.Only a few with specific genetics manage to resist the radiation.
