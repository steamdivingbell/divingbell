The story begins in Lost Islands, a place made up of floating islands, created after a catastrophic event that altered the planet's gravity and left the sky perpetually dark. You live in this world as a young person dreaming of exploring these mysterious islands, driven by a desire to prove yourself to your family.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game follows your entire life. From the innocence and curiosity of childhood, through the challenges and responsibilities of adulthood, to the dilemmas and reflections of old age. Each phase brings new obstacles and choices that impact the protagonist and those around them. However, throughout your journey, one constant presence accompanies you: Death. At first, it seems harmless, almost like a distant shadow, but its presence grows until you must face it head-on.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">&quot;Exista!&quot; is not just an adventure game. It is an experience about understanding the value of time, confronting your fears, and leaving a legacy in a world perpetually teetering on the edge of the unknown.
