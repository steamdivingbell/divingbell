From a third-person perspective, players battle ghouls and boss characters in frenetic combat.

Battles are highlighted by frequent blood-splatter effects, cries of pain, realistic gunfire, and explosions. One ghoul is depicted wearing lingerie with deep cleavage, and is described as the \u201cNutcracker, due to her strange appetite for men's testicles.\u201d The word \u201ca*shole\u201d appears in the dialogue."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Purchase TOKYO GHOUL:re [CALL to EXIST] and get the Kaneki Costume + Bonus Mask Set DLC as a bonus.<br><br>It may not be stylish, but...
