A casual game with exploration, collectibles and hunting.<br><br>A game created by two friends, inspired by games like Shelter with a goal to achieve our first game release. This game is about a life of an animal that is not often shown in games too often. A lizard, a mix of several inspirations from various species, mainly a monitor lizard.

The bird is a danger to you and you are food to it, the rock next to you talon marked. You reach the cave, the bird hisses and flies away. In the cave, you stay, soundless and motionless. The night turns to a day, you leave, yearning for food yourself. Once outside, with the illusion of safety, the vulture has played a trick. It waited too. A chase resumed, only one direction valid, away. Too slow, too close, yet far enough. Bird strike makes you get air, and fall, into the canyon.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Raise your children</h2><br>Lay eggs and start your own family, have them follow you everywhere, and guide them to food, and away from danger as they grow and help secure their future in the most vulnerable part of their life.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hunt and eat</h2><br>Look for prey, and hunt it down. One moment prey is everywhere and food is plentiful, another moment prey is nowhere, and your kids are starving.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Evolve</h2><br>You cannot escape the canyon, but maybe your children can. Hunt your prey to gain evolution points, and raise your children to change yourself and your family. Be faster, be stronger, run longer, stop surviving, and start to thrive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dangers</h2>You are not an apex predator. There are other predators, not just prey. The vultures will happily see your children as food if you give them a chance to. Avoid predators for you are no match for them.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1855110/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1648051335","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1855110/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1648051335","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1855110/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1648051335","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1855110/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1648051335","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You are a lizard, trapped in a canyon.
