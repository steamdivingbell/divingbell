{"about_the_game":"Become the greatest mining tycoon of all time. An explosive combination of mining sim and city builder. Your dream of building your own thriving town starts with few explosive charges and a yellow truck. As you mine the landscape and the money starts to roll in you'll be able to expand and manage your business empire, buying buildings, shops and facilities. Soon people will be rushing to set up camp in your fledgling town. Then the real challenge begins...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn in depth array of tools, graphs and stats are available for you to maximize your town planning strategy. Keeping the townsfolk of your western town happy is essential, happy citizens spend in your shops and build ever larger and grander houses turning your once small town into huge metropolis.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDirt, crime, illness and power outages are just some of the problems you'll encounter as your town grows forcing you to make tough decisions. Bulldozing settlements to build a prison is sometimes for the greater good. As space becomes a premium, using explosives to deforest the landscape just makes good business sense. With procedurally generated landscapes, loads of mining upgrades, buildings and the gold market to negotiate every game of Boomtown is a unique test of your strategic management skills.    <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTest your skills over 5 varied scenarios each one requiring a different approach to maximise your population and each with a unique set of rewards and complexities that need to be mastered for you to become a true mogul.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Fill Truck with Ore","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/536750/56f434ecf8330d311ab640a0dc6e9558867d5a48.jpg"},{"name":"Destroy 10 Trees","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/536750/b3dc6af94230e6a3f4bccf2912bbdc49b079b648.jpg"},{"name":"Collect 5 Tons of Ore","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/536750/6633570e7f455c8b5d8110138357fadf2d5519be.jpg"},{"name":"Reach 100 Population","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/536750/6310578952aee40173b974ecf2fe3b87d51c6551.jpg"},{"name":"Reach 1000 Population","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/536750/641c9a8d57b300284e4486e78f498cd1d868c8e3.jpg"},{"name":"Reach 2000 Population","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/536750/f5b72380178ea73ce680a9cf376a1c9bd39c4b12.jpg"},{"name":"Add 10 Population In One Day","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/536750/b0c1e12c9ff9062c535441d8aa0808f698bd15e7.jpg"},{"name":"Add 50 Population In One Day","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/536750/43bc622946d891e2e687d155cff0f9b8be83619c.jpg"},{"name":"Add 100 Population In One Day","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/536750/570edc7c518143904d0f9388ed1154c34fbfa593.jpg"},{"name":"Mine 100kg Of Gold","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/536750/bdf228629565e08bea539065887f7d92b1fe399d.jpg"}],"total":25},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/536750/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1739452401","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/536750/page.bg.jpg?t=1739452401","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/536750/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739452401","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/536750/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739452401","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>WISHLIST DREAMOUT</h1><p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/536750/extras/Promo_gif_Dreamout.gif?t=1739452401\" /></p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Become the greatest mining tycoon of all time.
