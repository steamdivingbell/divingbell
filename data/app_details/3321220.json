{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0 \u00a0You wake up in the nurse's office and soon realize you\u2019re trapped in this unsettling place. The terrifying ghosts of old teachers follow you, trying to keep you here, determined to prevent your escape. Yet, strangely, you have a chance: you\u2019ve been given three lives, as if something is holding them back from a final decision. Perhaps it's an act of mercy due to your young age, or maybe a ritual requires them to relent. It doesn\u2019t matter, for their leniency ends here \u2014 one misstep, and they\u2019re ready to complete their mission, leaving no chance of escape.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0 \u00a0In these locked corridors, there\u2019s only one path to freedom. You must help these spirits find peace, so they can return to their world. In return, they\u2019ve promised to give you an essential part of the entrance door, opening the way out. But to complete the ritual, you\u2019ll need to carefully search the school, collect items, and avoid mistakes, as each error could cost you one of your lives.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0 \u00a0The ghosts can\u2019t see you, but they can feel your presence \u2014 even through walls at times. Their perception of space differs from a human's, and you\u2019ll notice it in their behavior and shifting colors. So, if you see a ghost, it doesn\u2019t mean they see you. This might seem reassuring, but remember: they can sense your movement at any moment!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0 \u00a0The emergency lighting casts a faint glow that barely reaches each corner, and much of the school is underpowered. You\u2019ll need to find resistors and repair the electrical panel to bring the equipment to life. This will allow you to power up an old printer, which will print out piano sheet music and instructions for the ritual. Whether you escape this school or remain here \u2014 among the ghosts \u2014 FOREVER depends on you!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Good luck :)</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3321220/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735909924","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3321220/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1735909924","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3321220/fd3541b8c71a22815ec4bf86960cbf86c3d9c318/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735909924","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3321220/fd3541b8c71a22815ec4bf86960cbf86c3d9c318/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735909924","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0 \u00a0You wake up in the nurse's office and soon realize you\u2019re trapped in this unsettling place.
