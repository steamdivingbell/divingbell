{"about_the_game":"The universe is at war, and you're just a bastard. What choice will you make: Survive through the cracks and survive, or be invincible and kill the Quartet? Can you still hold on to your heart?<br><br>This is a sea-watching type game that simulates an absurd and realistic universe in which everything is controlled by AI, and the player is just an observer. In the game, the player can move the field of view, zoom and rotate the screen, adjust the speed of the passage of time, and view the detailed information of the object, but cannot make changes to the progress of the game.<br><br>There are six factions in the universe: the Galactic Commune, the Guardian Council, the Xinghai Group, the Second Empire, the General Alliance, and the Hyperspace Zombies. They are at war. Each faction uses energy to build buildings: docks, turrets, reactors, and command centers. Docks can spawn ships, turrets can fire cannonballs, reactors can create energy, and command centers can expand territory.<br><br>There is a character system in the game. Each building and ship has a corresponding position: a shipbuilder in the dock, a gunner in a turret, a generator in a reactor, and a general in the command center. As buildings or ships are created and destroyed, people are promoted, demoted, and even killed. At the end of the game, the experiences of the 5 most prolific characters will be compiled into a celebrity resume.<br><br>At the start of the game, a Travelling Bastard with a neutral faction will spawn, and it will not attempt to attack anything.
