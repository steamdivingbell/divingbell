{"about_the_game":"This is an indie game centered around Traditional Chinese Martial Arts (TCMA).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCurrently, the game is being developed solely by a programmer. The development progress has reached a milestone with the completion of the entire game framework, encompassing menus, UI, automatic save features, an achievement system, an interactive framework, and a foundational action system. The highlight of this version revolves around an extensive skill system, which is the primary showcase and gameplay focus.The combat system is not yet completed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe skill system boasts over 150 fundamental movements drawn from Traditional Chinese Martial Arts, allowing players to freely mix and match these actions to create their own unique combinations. Theoretically, the number of possible combinations exceeds 10 billion, offering endless possibilities for players to express themselves.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are no skill books in this game; instead, all skills are acquired from the AI characters encountered throughout the game. Each AI character possesses a randomly configured set of skills. Players can interact with any AI character to learn their skills, and in future versions, AI characters may also learn from players' skills, albeit with the possibility of refusal unless the player offers something they desire.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMoreover, every AI character in the game periodically demonstrates their acquired martial arts moves. Players can pause to observe and decide whether to learn a particular move, adding an element of discovery and personalization to the learning process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the game, at its surface, may seem like a mere showcase of martial arts skills, its true value transcends the game itself. It serves as a window into the profoundness and richness of Traditional Chinese Martial Arts culture. Players can not only appreciate but also learn each move within the game, as every action is based on practices by martial arts enthusiasts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChinese martial arts do not advocate violence but have evolved into a widely accessible fitness activity and competitive sport. In China, people of all ages, from three-year-olds to octogenarians, engage in martial arts for physical exercise.
