Powerful trading guilds have long established and vigorously defended trade-routes. Only now, after countless years of lawlessness, \u201cThe Admiralty\u201d are strengthening their grasp on this dangerous new world. After spending all of your life savings, you purchase a meager vessel and set sail to this new world. Which discoveries, alliances, and treasures await you is your choice, captain.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><strong>Naval Combat:</strong> Fight off thieving pirates, or sink a trade vessel for their cargo.
