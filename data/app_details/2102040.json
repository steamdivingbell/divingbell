{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><i>&quot;There is a saying that when you depart from this world, the dog who went ahead will warmly welcome you.&quot;</i></strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Bong-gu the Welsh Corgi was once an abandoned dog. Judging by his docked tail, someone had once cared for him, but for some reason, he became unwanted. As an 8-year-old senior dog with various illnesses, it was hard for him to find a new family. Trapped in a cage at an animal shelter, each day passed gloomily for Bong-gu. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Then one day, a miracle happened. Bong-gu met a new family. The man who took Bong-gu had a somewhat scruffy appearance and seemed slightly awkward, but Bong-gu loved his scent. From that day on, Bong-gu lived out his remaining days just like any other dog would: playing tug-of-war, running around, eating, and sleeping. In the end, he crossed the rainbow bridge, having lived out a simple yet joyful life.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2102040/extras/Puppy01.gif?t=1736162503\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Sniff sniff\u2026 this scent\u2026</i> One day in dog heaven, Bong-gu wakes from his nap to a very familiar scent. <i>Sniff sniff\u2026 it's dad!.</i> Though faint, surely it is dad's scent he has been waiting for.
