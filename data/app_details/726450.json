{"about_the_game":"In Hero's Descent, each area you visit has a strict time limit. To make matters worse, a variety of aggressive and devious monsters stand between you and the exit.

Decide quickly and carefully, every second counts in Hero's Descent, as the clock never stops ticking!<br><br>Fortunately for you, a number of battle-hardened heroes are available and anxious for the opportunity to enter the dungeon. Each hero has unique abilities, strength, and growth potential. Learn them well, push them to their limits, and you just might be able to survive!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">KEY FEATURES</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong> Three unique characters!</strong><br>Each character has its own unique set of abilities and playstyle.
