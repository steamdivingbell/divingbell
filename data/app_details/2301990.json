{"about_the_game":"Rally31 is a small open-world racing game with 12 unique and experimental vehicles. The vehicles are physics-based with each one having a different setup to the suspension system. This adds variety to the difficulty level and driving experience of each machine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe vehicles use a cell shader inspired by the anime Wangan Midnight and the rest of the environment is done in a cartoon style.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe level is a chain of islands that are built on a base that is 6 km long and 3 km wide. Each island is fully explorable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can buy more cars and access your inventory at the player\u2019s house. You can earn money to buy cars by finishing stages. You can get a reward bonus by beating your best time or for completing a stage with a car that is difficult to drive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll the controls are listed in the pause menu that is accessed with the escape key.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can open and close the map with the \u201cM\u201d key.
