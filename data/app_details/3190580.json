You will face the challenge of countless deaths, utilize the power of the card system, and fight fiercely against various dream gods and grotesque enemies in a world full of dark fantasy. Each piece of Divine Jade Leaf Paper is a lost memory waiting for you to piece together and uncover the secrets of the Bronze Queen. In this otherworld where East meets West, only the bravest adventurers can break the nightmare and bring back hope. Are you, ready to meet the call of destiny?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3190580/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730037073","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3190580/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1730037073","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3190580/5d463832a696814bf20cb4f06ad676c3896afccf/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730037073","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3190580/5d463832a696814bf20cb4f06ad676c3896afccf/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730037073","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3293910,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Step into the world of Dream Slayer, a discrete land cursed and broken by the Dream Gods, and follow the lead of Erin the Dreamless on her journey to find the fragments of the Dream Interpretation Code in the chaos of intertwined dreams and reality.
