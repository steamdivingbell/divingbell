{"about_the_game":"This demo is designed to give you a taste of what a typical day on the job is like. You'll have a chance to go through a single shift on the job, working your way through 7 passengers and their accompanying luggage. Can you stay focused? Or will you black out on the job? Give it a shot and find out if you've got what it takes, your first day is free during recruiting season! We'll really take anyone we can get...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis demo stocks you up with a top of the line Bagotron luggage scanner, a full sized passenger scanner, a hand held Objectofinder (to help locate contraband on passengers), and a reversible double sided switch-face dual usage stamp. You'll have less than a minute per passenger to locate and eradicate all contraband on their person and in their bags. The timer decreases with each passenger, but don't worry, you'll get the hang of it. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd that's it! Get out there and keep the skies safe, agent! And remember, stay frisky.","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/805250/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1520525806","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/805250/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1520525806","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Captions available","id":13}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This demo is designed to give you a taste of what a typical day on the job is like.
