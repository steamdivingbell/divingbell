It combines the hack-n-slash action of Sotidrokhima with the calculative strategy gameplay of The Finnish War. The story centers around the Finnish national epic <i>Kalevala</i>, and connects its events to modern day, as well as with characters from the Finnish War and Sotidrokhima.<br>The game can however be enjoyed by anyone, even those new to the two preceding titles - or Finnish mythology.<br>Finlandsaga is well self-aware of its odd premise, and takes it all the way.
