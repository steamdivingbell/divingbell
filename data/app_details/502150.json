{"about_the_game":"Interstellar Logistics Inc. is a gravity based Sci-fi Action Puzzle game. Each level has multiple ways to reach the end point. Along with the goal of reaching the end point there are six tracking satellites in every level. To fully complete the levels you must hit all the satellites. The challenge comes from finding the path that the container must travel to hit all satellites and reach the end point. If the container is destroyed all progress is reset and you must try again.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Master of The Logistics Cannon!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/502150/10713e5cee742f4c263ac4e93207648e188c46fb.jpg"},{"name":"Moving right along","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/502150/ade5f4504ab8d9a8cbfae09dd602a9a8874af098.jpg"},{"name":"Novice destroyer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/502150/9b0ab5ff36aaab1a6e390766768252b68170c9b8.jpg"},{"name":"Employee of the nanosecond","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/502150/3d0996d68a7f528845a0ec86dc22528c8bea222a.jpg"},{"name":"Baldly Go where no completionist has gone before","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/502150/fb420a1576d24d80e9f3f6c2a7329581d459bb7e.jpg"},{"name":"Back from the outer rim","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/502150/f9842eab2cc1bd257b5ea5b1ecea8cbf4fcf4508.jpg"},{"name":"Kou Makuahine","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/502150/921b746772dc0450dc1c9f5f948205ae7c5f7dbb.jpg"},{"name":"We will not feed our employees!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/502150/fddfd35f02d7f38be653e8829156538f7d193d18.jpg"},{"name":"The Great Destroyer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/502150/192101f910024b36f25aa42cc87568cdd4cd8f3a.jpg"}],"total":9},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/502150/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734917161","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/502150/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1734917161","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/502150/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734917161","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/502150/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734917161","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Interstellar Logistics Inc. is a gravity based Sci-fi Action Puzzle game.
