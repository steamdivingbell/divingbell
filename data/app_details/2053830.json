{"about_the_game":"Adding voices to your game can add a lot of depth to the emotions expressed, but hiring a full cast for every character can quickly add up by a lot. But if you still want that little extra, the NPC female villagers pack is just for you! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack gives you a variety of expressive voiced sounds designed to give a little voice to each of your characters. Have the scared villager actually scream when the orcs attack or have the little girl make a sound of joy when she greets you. Sprinkling over your dialogue to express various emotions and situations can give your female NPCs so much more character!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach of the twelve unique characters comes with the same set of ten expressive sounds. From greeting to laughing to joy to surprise to fear, a full range of emotions is here! And the characters themselves also cover a broad roster of personalities and ages, from an eccentric old lady type to a mischievous girl!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Over 100 different sayings<br />\r\n* ogg and m4a file formats included<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTerms of Use:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* This pack is for use in RPG Maker Series or the engine of your choice.<br />\r\n* OK to be used in Commercial projects<br />\r\n* Contents can be edited<br />\r\n* OK for use in games with gore<br />\r\n* OK for use in adult-rated games","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2053830/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1681270099","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2053830/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1681270099","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2053830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1681270099","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2053830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1681270099","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Adding voices to your game can add a lot of depth to the emotions expressed, but hiring a full cast for every character can quickly add up by a lot.
