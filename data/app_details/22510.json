League of Heroes is the first expansion for this online fantasy cardgame, and it features three new mage classes which can be used in online play, the arena (a new single player mode), or in the original campaign. The Sorcerer has no creatures at all in his card mix - but a potent array of spells. The Beastmaster has no spells, but creatures which, when in play, have a special activated ability. The Demonologist has creatures which change into a new form when they die. Each provide new challenges and powers to explore.<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe expansion was co-designed by Magic: The Gathering\u2019s Richard Garfield and Alexey Stankevich, creator of Astral Tournament and Astral Masters.
