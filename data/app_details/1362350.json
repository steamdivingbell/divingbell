{"about_the_game":"Empis is a turn-based strategy game that focuses on short and sweet multiplayer matches. Choose from individual factions each with their own unique units and upgrades, unlock technology, and build sprawling cities with buildings and fortifications.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Micro 4x</strong></h2>Empis is 4X distilled to its base processes and streamlined for quick matches so that you can get in and out as quickly as you'd like. Unlike large and lumbering 4X games that can go on for ages, Empis delivers fast paced and tactical gameplay to keep you engaged only for as long as you'd like it to.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1362350/extras/humans_inline_height_168.gif?t=1624564043\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Chess-like combat turns.</strong></h2>Empis avoids problems often plaguing multiplayer turn-based games.
