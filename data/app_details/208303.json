{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The East Coast Main Line is familiar to millions of British travellers as the main connection from London to Edinburgh, and now you can travel back to the 1970s and drive along some of the fastest stretches of this important railway line. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The route of the ECML was originally constructed in the 19th Century by the North British, North Eastern and Great Northern Railway companies individually. York eventually became the headquarters for the entire line, its impressive station and enormous 295-lever signal box (the largest manual signal box in Britain) imprinting the city in history as one of the country\u2019s most important railway centres. The world speed record for steam locomotives was set on the line at Stoke Bank back in 1938, and in the late 20th Century much of the ECML was relayed for modern high speed running, beginning with the fearsome Deltic locomotives and continuing with the ubiquitous HST sets which still operate today. The East Coast Main Line for Train Simulator recreates the fast, open stretch from Newcastle to York as it appeared in the late 1970s, and includes a selection of British Rail diesel locomotives with rolling stock and plenty of scenarios to test your driving skills. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">East Coast Main Line from Newcastle to York via Durham and Darlington</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Class 55 \u2018Deltic\u2019 diesel locomotive in BR Blue and BR Green liveries</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Class 47 diesel locomotive in BR Blue livery</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Class 43 HST high speed train in BR Blue/Grey</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Please note: if you have already purchased RailWorks or Train Simulator 2012, you already have this route and its contents. </strong></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/208303/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736257769","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/208303/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1736257769","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/208303/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736257769","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/208303/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736257769","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Classics Range</h1><p>The Classics Range features a selection of must-have products at value for money prices from the TS back catalogue.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The East Coast Main Line is familiar to millions of British travellers as the main connection from London to Edinburgh, and now you can travel back to the 1970s and drive along some of the fastest stretches of this important railway line. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The route of the ECML was originally constructed in the 19th Century by the North British, North Eastern and Great Northern Railway companies individually.
