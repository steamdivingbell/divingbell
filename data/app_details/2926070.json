{"about_the_game":"Welcome to the Afterlife, where salvation comes with a scorecard. In Fairway to Hell, you find yourself in the most unexpected predicament\u2014dead, in hell, and holding a golf club. The devil himself has thrown down a challenge: win a tournament against hell\u2019s finest golfers, and you earn your way back to the land of the living. But in this underworld, golf isn\u2019t just a game; it\u2019s a trial by fire... and comedy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA Hellish Course Like No Other: Explore and conquer multiple golf courses designed by the underworld\u2019s twisted minds. Each course is a unique blend of horror and hilarity, featuring obstacles ranging from lava lakes to haunted windmills.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaster the Mini-Games: When you're not swinging your way through demonic fairways, the clubhouse awaits with its own set of challenges. Hone your precision and party skills with mini-games like darts and beer pong, each with a hellish twist.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrepare in a Week of Wonders: You have one week to prepare for the ultimate tournament. Use your time wisely to practice, explore hell\u2019s nooks and crannies, and interact with its bizarre inhabitants. Your choices affect your readiness for the final match.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMeet the Underworld\u2019s Eccentrics: From doomed souls to demonic caddies, the characters you meet offer advice, challenges, and entertainment. Forge alliances or rivalries, and uncover the stories of those trapped in the afterlife.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVR Immersion: Experience the afterlife like never before in VR. Feel the swing of your club, the tension of the tournament, and the thrill of mini-games, all from a first-person perspective that brings hell\u2019s absurdity to life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGolfing with Shadows is more than just a game; it's a journey through laughter, terror, and the bizarre. Can you beat the devil at his own game, or will you find yourself permanently teeing off in the underworld? Grab your clubs, steady your nerves, and dive into a comedy/horcery/sports adventure that you won\u2019t find anywhere else.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrepare for the most unconventional round of golf you've ever played. Welcome to hell; we hope you like the greens.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2926070/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1715081271","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2926070/page.bg.jpg?t=1715081271","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2926070/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1715081271","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2926070/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1715081271","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to the Afterlife, where salvation comes with a scorecard.
