Consider it as a free bonus version for your Steam install.  Except you're under no obligation to buy the game on Steam to get access.</p><br><h1>Controller Update</h1><p>Space Trail Fireworks was originally designed for touch or mouse-based input.  Controller support is limited.  <br><br>How do controllers work with Space Trail Fireworks?<br><br>1) On Steamdeck, right joystick will move the mouse and right trigger can be used to 'tap on trail head' to start a game.<br>1b) Once started, left joystick gives precision 8-way movement and right joystick gives accelerated 8-way movement.<br>1c) Holding Right trigger during game counts for tracking your distance (for achievements/stats)<br>2) On title screen, the Left, Right and Top buttons (on PSx controllers that is Square, Circle and Triangle) will open the Workshop, Stats, and Mode menus respectively.  These buttons are <u>not</u> currently working on steamdeck*.<br>3) Bottom (X button) button is used to confirm/click on menu items<br><br>*For steamdeck owners, this really only matters if you are touch-screen phobic or if it has broken and you don't use your deck with a docking station mouse.  You can still use the steamdeck pads to move the pointer to the corners and the trigger button to open the menus.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Space Trail Fireworks</h2>-----------------------<br><br>Space Trail Fireworks is a fun arcade-like, snake-like game that is easy to learn.  <br><br>The basic premise is to bring your trail into contact with a matching colored circle.
