{"about_the_game":"&quot;Eastern Heroes&quot; is a work that restores the original intention of martial arts, abandoning all redundant and complicated content, and abandoning the flashy and unrealistic appearance. Everything is transformed into the most authentic experience of cultivating the flavor of martial arts through writing.<br />\r\nNote: This game has in store purchases, but the game will not force players to make in store purchases due to any gameplay barriers. The game has been adjusted and tested by us for a long time, adhering to the original intention of not forgetting the original intention. It is a game that can still be played smoothly without the need for internal purchases, and it will also provide quick experiences such as various one click functions. But all in-game items can be obtained in the game, and in-game purchases are a channel for very few bosses who support domestic independent developers with real money and silver. We hope everyone can understand and provide feedback on the game experience at any time. Our original intention is still to always work hard for martial arts fans and create their favorite large-scale multiplayer online text-based martial arts games.<br />\r\nIn the game, players take on the role of a creator who leads the entire sect, possesses various divine skills, and recruits talented martial arts talents in the martial arts world. They cultivate their disciples and lead them through various levels in the martial arts world, guarding Xiangyang to resist foreign invasion; You can also invite martial arts heroes to form the Xiaren Alliance, besiege the old nest of the Demon Cult, punish evil and eliminate bandits and demons; You can also participate in various martial arts debates and ultimately stand at the top of the martial arts world, walking alone in the martial arts world!<br />\r\nThere are over 200 martial artists available for recruitment in the game, each with their own unique talents, abilities, and fate. Upon successful recruitment, they become disciples of their sect. There is a distinction between disciples themselves and their souls. Disciples are various characters who can directly go to battle; Soul is the soul of a disciple, and collecting a certain amount can be used to recruit disciples.<br />\r\nActivities such as searching for heroes, martial arts, daily login rewards, opening treasure chests, disciples making wishes, and drawing disciples to send souls all have the opportunity to obtain disciple souls. Collecting a sufficient number of souls can recruit the disciple. Recruiting disciples of three qualities, A, B, and C, requires a certain number of souls. A few disciples can only obtain it by participating in activities.<br />\r\nPlayers can gain disciple experience by participating in martial arts discussions, observing the Double Ninth Festival relics, and upgrading through guidance and guidance. Transmission of skills can transfer the experience of one disciple to another disciple. When passing martial arts, it is necessary to use the Nine Transformations Scattering Pill, which can restore 100% of the disciple's experience and other resources.<br />\r\nIf the disciple's own soul is collected more, they can be allowed to break through, which can increase their potential points and further cultivate and improve their attributes. Players can also use cultivation pills to cultivate their disciples and improve their attribute effects.<br />\r\nThe combat effectiveness level of a disciple is influenced by various attributes. Players can enhance their disciple's attribute effects by raising their level, wearing equipment, and breaking through their disciples.<br />\r\nWeapons and equipment<br />\r\nEquipment can enhance the attack, defense, and health attributes of disciples, giving them stronger combat power. In the game, equipment is divided into three types: weapons, armor, and accessories. Each disciple can only equip one piece of equipment of the same type. The quality of equipment is the same as that of disciples, and it is also divided into A, B, and C, with colors of purple, blue, green, and white respectively. The higher the quality, the higher the basic attributes, and the improved attributes after strengthening should also be much higher.<br />\r\nPlayers have a certain chance to obtain equipment through the boss elite monsters in the martial arts world, and the quality of the equipment will also improve as the difficulty of the boss increases. Players also have a chance to obtain equipment by opening gold, silver, copper treasure boxes, and wooden boxes. Daily login rewards have the opportunity to obtain equipment, and visiting the Immortal Sister has the opportunity to obtain accessories. Participate in the Zhenlong Chess game to collect treasures and have the opportunity to obtain level B and level A equipment.<br />\r\nEquipment development<br />\r\nPlayers can open the equipment interface and click the &quot;build&quot; button to enter the build interface. Creating can elevate equipment levels, and the higher the level of equipment, the more silver it will cost.<br />\r\nCreate critical strikes that can increase equipment by multiple levels at once. The specific range of critical strike increases can be discovered within the game. The maximum level of equipment that can be crafted is three times the level of the sect. If there is a critical strike during the last crafting, the level of the equipment that can be crafted can exceed three times the level of the sect. However, if the leader's level has not been improved, crafting cannot continue. Upgrading the sect level can elevate equipment to a higher level.<br />\r\nEquipment refining<br />\r\nAfter reaching level 18, players can activate the &quot;Equipment Refinement&quot; function. By refining and upgrading, their equipment can become more powerful. Only equipment above level B can be refined.<br />\r\nPlayers enter the equipment interface, select a piece of equipment, click the &quot;Refining&quot; button, open the Refining interface, click on Refining Materials. Different levels of materials will have different experience points. When the experience points are sufficient, the &quot;Refining&quot; button will light up, and click on Refining to upgrade the equipment.<br />\r\nEquipment can be refined up to level 9, and higher level equipment requires more and more refined materials. Refined equipment will have attribute improvements, and successful refinement can reveal changes in equipment attributes. Equipment that has been refined and upgraded will be more affected by the level of crafting.<br />\r\nEquipment melting<br />\r\nMaster level 1 is activated, melting equipment can obtain recast materials. In the equipment interface, you can see the smelting and recasting buttons. Melt the refined equipment and return 80% of the refined materials, prioritizing the return of high-level materials and supplementing low-level materials. Melt the recast equipment and return 70% of the recast material. The smelting effect of different equipment varies. Smelting equipment can obtain silver, refining iron, forging intent steel, and golden stepping stones.<br />\r\nEquipment recasting<br />\r\nWhen the level of the leader reaches level 6, the recasting function is activated, and only A and B equipment can be recast. There are three types of recasting, which require the consumption of refined iron, forged steel, and quenched gold. recasting can randomly give equipment and add a certain percentage of the original attribute. The original attributes refer to the attributes of equipment that have been crafted and refined.<br />\r\nThe final attribute of recasting is to multiply the recast attributes of each level. Equipment that has not been recast can only be refined before forging, and can only be refined after forging.<br />\r\nFirst click on the shape training button, then the button will change to recast, and the amount of materials consumed will be displayed below. Click on recast to complete one recast. The operation of forging and quenching is similar.<br />\r\nWhen the next level of recasting is not carried out, the same recasting method can be continued to be used for recasting, refreshing attributes; If you want to refresh the previous level's recast attributes, the current level and higher-level recast attributes will be cleared, and you need to operate with caution. For example, if you are not satisfied with the attributes of practicing shape, you can click on practicing shape again to recast the attributes, but the forging intent and quenching precision attributes will be cleared.<br />\r\ncurrency<br />\r\nThere are three types of currency in the game: ingots, gold leaves, and silver. Each currency has a different purpose and its acquisition method. Among them, ingots can be used to search for customers, purchase various items in the mall, reset the number of dungeons, etc. Players can obtain them through recharge methods, sign in rewards, daily tasks, achievement tasks, and other means. The function of Golden Leaf is basically equivalent to that of a ingot, and it is preferred to use Golden Leaf by default when making purchases (it is not supported to choose the currency type for consumption).<br />\r\nPlayers can consume silver to build equipment, search for customers, and obtain some silver rewards through exploring dragon veins, blood battles, adventure missions, and other means.<br />\r\nOther consumables<br />\r\nThe consumables in the game include flower chicken, palm door stickers, silver keys, copper keys, etc. These consumables can be used to increase stamina, increase sword discussions, open treasure pots, etc. They can all be stacked in the backpack. When players consume these consumables, the stacking quantity will decrease. Players can obtain various consumables through various daily activities, tasks, and mall purchases.<br />\r\nThe above only introduces a small part of the many gameplay in the game. As for the entire gameplay of the game, players need to enter the game and explore it......","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2342250/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1707213570","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2342250/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1707213570","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2342250/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1707213570","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2342250/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1707213570","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;Eastern Heroes&quot; is a work that restores the original intention of martial arts, abandoning all redundant and complicated content, and abandoning the flashy and unrealistic appearance.
