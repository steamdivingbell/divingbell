{"about_the_game":"**Classic Mystery + Serial Killer + Completely Free-form Text Adventure**<br />\r\nCatch the killer... or cooperate to stop time?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n---<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a detective game where you play as a middle-aged inspector searching for a terrifying serial killer in an isolated village. However, as a player, if you uncover the killer's motives, you might find yourself considering whether to cooperate with them to achieve their goal of &quot;killing time.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the game, you can make all sorts of outlandish choices. For example, during a crucial moment of chasing a wild dog, you could suddenly make the inspector shout, &quot;I'm coming for you!&quot; Or, you might completely neglect your duties, spending time at the tavern chatting with the barmaid until a romance blossoms. You could even be killed by the serial killer right at the beginning due to a careless mistake...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe NPCs in the game have their own lives. If you find out that an NPC typically wakes up at 9 AM, you can enter their room before that time to gather hidden information. You might also learn from another NPC that this person only sleeps in when they're drunk, so you could steal their bottle to make them wake up early. Of course, key details about the NPCs' habits will be gradually uncovered as you explore.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the path to catching the killer, anything could happen, including slipping in the bathroom and dying...<br />\r\n<br />\r\n---<br />\r\n<br />\r\n**Summer of 1989 in Nevada**  <br />\r\nI chased a suspicious Ford all the way to Cycleton, until the heavy rain trapped me in this place.
