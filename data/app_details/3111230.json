{"about_the_game":"<strong>A Light Jog</strong> is a casual runner game that ends once the player hits a hazard. It is an endless runner that tracks how long you the player last in seconds. <br><br>With 4 different locations and music going to mediocre at best (featuring a volume slider), the player has multiple places to travel through and a music system that would play a random track for each place. Each area has at least one exclusive track while other tracks would be featured in another or all other locations.<br><br>There are eleven different hazards players must avoid on their jog as the game progresses. Some hazards would be exclusive to certain areas while others may be seen in other areas or all areas, similar to the music tracks. <br><br>Consistency is kind of boring as players won't travel to the same order of places, face the same kind of hazard pattern, or hear the same kind of tracks in each run. Music tracks are randomly picked through a small selection as the level starts and some unique hazards may appear during sometime later in the run.<br><br><i>Jump, slide, and take your time.</i>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3111230/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724971097","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3111230/page.bg.jpg?t=1724971097","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3111230/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724971097","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3111230/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724971097","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>A Light Jog</strong> is a casual runner game that ends once the player hits a hazard.
