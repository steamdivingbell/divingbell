The first teleporters have been constructed, and then, a bit later, an experimental hyperspace engine for an insterstellar spacecraft. However it is one of a kind, due to extreme shortage of crysterite. Thorough search for the precious mineral is immediately initiated.

Most likely you also have to find the spaceship - a fortified citadel - and try to reestablish the uplink. You don your favourite armour, take your trusty army knife, and bravely step into the teleporter with the desire for glorious adventures.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Sources of Inspiration</h2>We do love classic old-school 3D-shooters from late 1990s and early 2000s. The development of <strong>Perilous Warp</strong> was inspired by such masterpieces as Quake II, Half-Life, Unreal, Doom III, and certainly the brilliant game Chasm: The Rift.
