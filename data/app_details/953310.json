{"about_the_game":"Suits of Fate is a dynamic fighting game made in 2D art in which you control the guests of a costume party.<br />\r\nA mysterious entity grants powers to some chosen ones, imprisoning them in a magic barrier.

This bar is also important for various actions such as canceling defense and allowing cancellations that extend combos. The most efficient way to fill it is to hit normal attacks on the opponent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the character loses his life energy, his barbell gains benefits. Among these advantages are a lower expense of winning for supers and cancellations between powers, thus allowing larger combos.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLAST FORCES MODE<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Bar of Ghana still has a surprise factor.<br />\r\nIf the character is not defeated with a Super, then this bar can assume the role of life. this represents the character fighting to the last forces.<br />\r\n\u00a0<br />\r\nIn this case, the Bar maintains both functions, both Ghana and Life characteristics, giving the player more opportunity to win, but costing each error.<br />\r\n\u00a0<br />\r\nEach character has a unique style of play and a wide variety of combinations to explore.
