You'll even be able to play as her cute dog, Spirit!<br><br>This demo features an early build of a level called &quot;Azure Aqueduct&quot;. You'll be able to play as both Vivid and Spirit freely, where as in the full game, only Vivid is available for this level due to story reasons. You'll only have the base weapons and Power Pins for the demo. Vivid has the Crimson Blade, Golden Bow, and Azure Ax. Spirit meanwhile has the Fire Blitz, Electric Clone, and Arctic Whirlwind.<br><br>If you hold the ATTACK button, you can charge attacks!
