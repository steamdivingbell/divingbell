class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Gameplay</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The gameplay loop of the game looks like this:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Plant</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Plant seeds in the soil so that crops can grow from them</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> <strong>Grow</strong></p><p

Features</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Customizable enemy path.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Bugs do not follow prepared paths. <br>Everyone has their own AI and they constantly analyze the situation and choose to move in a certain direction. <br>Ultimately, all bugs move towards the player or towards the core, but there are baits. <br>With their help, you can direct enemies in some direction or lure them into deadly zones.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Well-developed nutrient mechanics</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Simply planting the seeds and waiting is not enough for growing good plants. <br>The game has a nutrient exchange system.<br>For example, potatoes secrete the nutrient &quot;Potatium&quot;, which in large quantities slows down the growth of potatoes. <br>Thus, after some time, they will need to be moved to another soil or other vegetables planted in order to restore the nutrient balance.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Tower Defense + Farming</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game is a unique combination of Tower Defense and Farming genres. <br>During the day you tend to your garden.<br>Plant seeds, grow plants and care for them.<br>At night, bugs attack and the game turns into Tower Defense. <br>Mutated plants act as \u201ctowers\u201d \u200b\u200band protect you from enemies.</p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Piu
