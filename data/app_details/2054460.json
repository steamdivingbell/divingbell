Genitalia is not rendered on yourself, but character designs later on in the game should be assumed to be partially or fully nude, or sometimes gory and offensive. The \"life simulation\" gameplay means you can poop and pee, smear poop everywhere if you so desire, eat and puke, give and receive violence.\r\n\r\nYou can willingly kill yourself in many ways. This is presented in a somewhat humorous manner (e.g. sticking a fork in an electrical outlet).\r\n\r\nSome will find the game scary, as the use of atmosphere may lead to tense situation.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely a 17+ game. Young kids should not play this."},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Alone on Halloween?
