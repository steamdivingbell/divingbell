{"about_the_game":"You are just a slime. The weakest of the monsters. But when a dragon moves in on a nearby mountain, it causes a ripple effect as strong monster flee from it and into your village's territory. You have been chosen as the one who will go confront the dragon in order to save your home! The journey to reach the dragon will be long and perilous, after all, the monsters get stronger the closer they are to the dragon. Can you even survive the journey, let alone remove the dragon?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut, you aren't the only species of monster that is suffering from the dragon's appearance. Perhaps you will find unlikely allies in the other monster races? However, the oldest slime also have a different proposition for you. Which path will you chose?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJourney through forests, caves, and over mountains as you grow stronger by fighting feral monsters as you attempt to reach the dragon! Talk to and help sentient monsters with quests, level up and get stronger, and perhaps you will be able to remove the dragon!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is your classic 2D RPG where you can level up to gain skill points and allocate them as you like. There are two paths to take while playing that you can choose from that will give you two different playstyles to choose from and while playing your choices will effect what happens to the monsters in it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdditionally, there is a Random Encounter System with slides you can use to change your experience. You can choose to have no random encounters or always have random encounters if you want to grind experience. You can decide the length of time between encounters and the maximum number of monsters that can be in each encounter.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2518590/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1693363105","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2518590/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1693363105","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2518590/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1693363105","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2518590/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1693363105","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You are just a slime.
