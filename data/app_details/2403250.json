{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2403250/extras/gif5.gif?t=1720642530\" /><br><br>Armor Attack kicks off an all-out sci-fi ground warfare using all possible variations of battle technologies including robots, tanks, wheeled machines, and hovers mounted with deadly weapons, all of which can be combined in a very tactical way. It features 5v5 intense but slow-paced gameplay in an evolving realistic environment where you can build your winning strategy at any range, with any unit class, and with any weapon.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>TAILOR YOUR BATTLE MACHINES FOR SPECIFIC COMBAT OBJECTIVES</strong></h2>You create a drop team of big sci-fi battle machines, each having its pros and cons in controls, positioning, speed, and mobility. And each machine has a tactical ability to change the battle course. Cut escape routes with AOE deadly zones, set your own obstacles and block the enemy in the narrow corridors, make yourself invisible for a hunt, and observe targets from the top of the buildings. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2403250/extras/gif3.gif?t=1720642530\" /><br><br>Weapons in Armor Attack are crafted to support a tactical variety of vehicle classes and benefit from the environment landscape, obstacles on a map, and the use of your own abilities. A combination of vehicle types, abilities, and weapon builds gives you ever-evolving ways to plan, attack, and defuse every situation.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>EVERY MAP BRINGS ITS OWN GAME CHANGING MECHANICS</strong></h2>Jump right in the middle of intense combat or trick the opponent using flanks, moving platforms, or high ground. But never forget about game-changing mechanics happening in every battle. Be it an ever-changing map layout, a strategically important vantage point, or a huge AI-controlled boss, it has the potential to turn the tides of war.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2403250/extras/gif4.gif?t=1720642530\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>GAIN CONTROL OVER WHAT'S LEFT ON EARTH</strong></h2>In Armor Attack, the future of society lies in the hands of three opposing factions who are fighting to gain control over what\u2019s left on Earth after decades of war and social upheaval. Bastion, protecting the Old World, Hermits who want to evolve life on Earth and establish a new order of things, and the Empyreals who decided to build a new hub for the people outside of their home planet. Each faction has its own playstyle and unique visual design to give players a choice of how to fit their tactical and shooting skills into the actual gameplay.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2403250/extras/gif2.gif?t=1720642530\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2403250/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1720642530","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2403250/page.bg.jpg?t=1720642530","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2403250/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1720642530","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2403250/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1720642530","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2403250/extras/gif5.gif?t=1720642530\" /><br><br>Armor Attack kicks off an all-out sci-fi ground warfare using all possible variations of battle technologies including robots, tanks, wheeled machines, and hovers mounted with deadly weapons, all of which can be combined in a very tactical way.
