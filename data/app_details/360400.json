{"about_the_game":"<strong>Lead survivors out of many complex mazes while quarantining or curing the infected.

But they will kill any character. Beware.<br>The <strong>white</strong> characters are scientists, and they can cure zombies back into civilians. <br>There are buttons at the top of the screen which let you end the game, or reset the current level.

They will also change direction if they run into a wall, or another unit.<br> <br>2) Scientists have a range of about 1 &amp; 1/2 halls. When you see a scientist move, the effected zombie has about 3 seconds until they are cured into a civilian unit.<br><br>3) Some army personnel can kill, with 1 shot. But most of the time it takes ~5 shots to kill.<br><br>4) Isolating individual units quickly, and reserving them for later can help with the pace of the game. Level 5 is a real test of this tactic. <br><br>5) There are wooden barricades on certain levels which only the zombies can attack and destroy.<br><br><br><u>Controls:</u><br><br>Click on the walls to create a safe or unsafe path for the characters.<br>Use the AWSD keys to move the camera around the level.<br>The mouse wheel to move the view up and down.<br>Every level has an optional camera view, and a level code.<br>Clicking on the change camera button will swap to an alternate camera view.
