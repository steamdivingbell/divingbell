{"about_the_game":"The Golden Age of Piracy, a time when legends are made or torn down. No trip over the seas is safe and every voyage could be your last. Or... You could find riches, power, and become legend! <br><br>Welcome to the dangerous waters of Tattered Sails, an open world piracy survival MMO set during the early 18th century. Here you have a choice; will your story see you rise as a hero of the guard or a dread captain of ruthless pirates? <br><br>Explore a world full of resources, sailing from one island to the next, gathering all that you need to build your own haven. Whether a simple home or an outpost, you can let creativity lead you. <br><br>Weigh anchor, loose the sails, and set out from your berth with a cargo hold full of goods you've crafted to make your fortune or... Load your ship with cannonballs and gunpowder, ready to hoist the colors and take down those merchant ships! The choices you make and the transactions you conduct matter with an economy that is driven entirely by player actions. Will the world see glorious riches or will it all crumble only to become a ghost story? <br><br>Join your friends, create a pirate crew or a company of guards, and let history remember you all as legends. Leave nothing but the Tattered Sails of enemies in your wake!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><strong>Crafting</strong>: Tattered Sails allows players to achieve prominence not through combat, but by mastering crafting, enabling them to ascend to the top by creating essential and valuable items.<br><br><strong>Open-World Exploration</strong>: Travel from island to island scavenging for the right materials or trading with the locals to secure the resources you need.<br><br><strong>Reputation</strong>: Your choices affect how the surroundings in the world perceives you. If you are a ruthless murderer you won\u2019t be allowed into certain towns. If you are a protector of the people, you will be rewarded with access to certain goods.<br><br><strong>Sailing</strong>: Sailing is the main mode of transportation. You\u2019ll be able to sail a ship on your own but later down the road, you\u2019ll need more than just yourself unless you are a skilled sailor.<br><br><strong>Conquest</strong>: Capture islands for certain buffs for you and your crew. Will expand further on a later road map post.<br><br><strong>Become a legend</strong>: Leave your mark on the world by being either a ruthless pirate or a guard.<br><br><strong>Regular Updates</strong>: Continuous updates to further add more content based on player feedback while also fixing bugs.<br><br><br> I am a solo developer and I do hire out with a small budget to help with elements of the game.
