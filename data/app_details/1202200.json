Is she the last of her kind? The other parasaurolophus are missing, and it's up to you and Lucky to uncover their whereabouts. Explore Paleo Pines, a charming island filled with friendly townsfolk and hidden corners. Build a new home, make friends, and unravel the island's lost history.

Paleo Pines is a place where you can express your individuality and creativity; no two ranches are the same! Build square pens, or not (although the locals might have something to say about that!).

Furthermore, customize your character as you like with a variety of features, curate a colorful collection of clothing\u2014with different items to be found in each area\u2014and change your style using the wardrobe!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1202200/extras/Untitled_design__11_.gif?t=1727904994\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1202200/extras/Banner_3_sm.png?t=1727904994\" /><br><br>The island of Paleo Pines is a dino lover\u2019s dream! A collection of cheeky dinosaurs roam the wild areas waiting to become your friends, as well as ranch helpers. Coax them near by mimicking their calls with your flute, then seal the deal with a tasty treat and trustworthy nose boop! Gain their trust by creating cozy pens and learning what keeps them happy. Dinos move around and some are harder to find than others, or may appear only under special conditions, so new discoveries await you as you explore the island. As your ranch grows, you\u2019ll soon have a dino haven for all your new friends. Check out the Dino Journal to learn all about the creatures that roam the island.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1202200/extras/Paleo_Pines_Screenshots_Steam_Description__1_.gif?t=1727904994\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1202200/extras/Banner_4_sm.png?t=1727904994\" /><br><br>Farm to your heart\u2019s content, growing crops all year round with (and for) your dino besties! Start out planting and watering by hand, but earn your new friends\u2019 trust and they\u2019ll help you deliver a roarsome harvest that you can trade with the townsfolk. As your ranch grows, you\u2019ll learn that each dino has a special farming skill to help you with your tasks. With a bit of love, care, and attention to detail, such as matching soil and season, you can grow the highest quality produce in all of Paleo Pines. Soon you and your dino ranch hands will be the talk of the market!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1202200/extras/Untitled_design__13_.gif?t=1727904994\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1202200/extras/Banner_5_sm.png?t=1727904994\" /><br><br>There's plenty to explore out in the wilds of Paleo Pines, from the flowery fields of Veridian Valley to the high canyons of Ariacotta. Make the most of each day by venturing throughout the lush landscapes across the island, each with their own charm, collectable items, and dinos to discover. Take a leisurely stroll through green meadows, foraging for wild crops as you go, or hop on your trusty dino mount on a hunt for hidden corners. Pause to watch wild dinosaurs playfully interact with each other, right before your very eyes. You'll never run out of things to find or dinosaurs to befriend!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1202200/extras/Untitled_design__14_.gif?t=1727904994\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1202200/extras/Banner_6_sm.png?t=1727904994\" /><br><br>A quirky (but friendly!) array of townsfolk on the island can\u2019t wait to meet you and help you on your quest. Granny might have a stubborn side, but get to know her and she\u2019s an ol\u2019 softie. Building friendships within the community is just as important as building friendships with your dinosaurs. As you ride dinos, farm, and explore, you will come across new characters, each with their own story, items or knowledge to share, and gossip to exchange. Help them out day or night by completing quests, opening up new areas, and visiting the stores and community hubs. And who knows\u2014they may even gift you something to spruce up your ranch!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1202200/extras/Paleo_Pines_Screenshots_Steam_Description.gif?t=1727904994\" /><br><br>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"They Won't Bite","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1202200/57f16bb96e1b0c08a38aaee4f2b493b9e80916ce.jpg"},{"name":"Saddle Up","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1202200/97c882fb88e792650feae9c14d3fb4aa8aedf77a.jpg"},{"name":"Run Forest Run!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1202200/9316e516cec7412d5c4e37483223df20ba7c5d36.jpg"},{"name":"Diamond In The Rough","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1202200/ddb1149f93d5c72d4e02d69b6b35d706e5bc91fe.jpg"},{"name":"Happy Go Lucky!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1202200/24a31083585d734aabc0b643e344a8cf4a44422e.jpg"},{"name":"Teamwork Makes The Dream Work","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1202200/4e1ff5728af0ca2845d94a0af111d53098b4811d.jpg"},{"name":"A Hobby A Day Keeps Bongo Away","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1202200/8544655f4dd50d8199d83e14d44ec668ba42f395.jpg"},{"name":"A Perfect Paleontologist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1202200/bb4c0d1c3440e077c4180183d4c5f614904c19fb.jpg"},{"name":"But Is It Art?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1202200/257ea3d1a411f90c49af7e48d5b073d1ec2b79ea.jpg"},{"name":"Matters Of The Art","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1202200/d22b037c255a10a3f8919742691c669f163087a0.jpg"}],"total":46},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1202200/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727904994","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1202200/page.bg.jpg?t=1727904994","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1202200/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727904994","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1202200/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727904994","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":2296430,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1202200/extras/PP-SteamDescriptions-1.png?t=1727904994\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1202200/extras/PP-SteamDescriptions-2.png?t=1727904994\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1202200/extras/PP-SteamDescriptions-3.png?t=1727904994\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1202200/extras/PP-SteamDescriptions-4.png?t=1727904994\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1202200/extras/PP-SteamDescriptions-5.png?t=1727904994\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1202200/extras/PP-SteamDescriptions-6.png?t=1727904994\" /><br><br>Welcome to Paleo Pines, a charming island known for its friendly dinosaurs, quirky townsfolk, and mysterious past.
