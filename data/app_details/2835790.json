{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Welcome To Cynderfall</h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2835790/extras/town.gif?t=1721481712\" /><br><br>Cynderfall Cycle is a small, isometric, 3d roguelite game.<br><br>You are an adventurer who has answered a call to the town of Cynderfall to investigate the tower.<br><br>The townsfolk don't know it's purpose or why it's there.<br><br>As you progress through the tower, you'll level up to gain access to combo skills, as well as finding currency to spend on upgrading your strength further.<br><br>Additionally, you'll have a chance of finding Recordium books that provide you with the story of the tower, and discover the secrets behind it's creation.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Stances</h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2835790/extras/stances.gif?t=1721481712\" /><br><br>You have access to both Melee and Magic stances, which you can quickly and seamlessly change on the fly with a click of the button.<br><br>Both stances provide unique skills.<br><br>In Melee stance you can block and parry, as well as use strong melee combos to defeat enemies close to you.<br><br>In Mage stance you gain mobility with a teleport skill, as well as ranged magic abilities to take down those enemies in the distance.<br><br>You can switch at any time to allow you to deal with any situation.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Progression</h2><br>As you progress through the tower, you'll gain XP which provides you level ups. As you level up, your base stats increase, and every 2 levels, you'll gain access to a new combo skill in either Melee or Magic stance.<br><br>Your XP and Level is always kept, regardless if you fall in the tower.<br><br>Additionally, you'll find chests that reward you with tokens. Use these tokens at the Blacksmith, Apothecary or Arcanum to increase the modifiers of your stats:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> HP<br></li><li> HP Restore<br></li><li> Melee Damage<br></li><li> Melee Attack Speed<br></li><li> Melee Reach<br></li><li> Magic Damage<br></li><li> Magic Projectile Speed<br></li><li> Dash Distance</li></ul><br>You are free to upgrade these stats whenever you are in town. Providing you with the means to customise your leveling experience and increasing your strength.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Tower</h2><br>The Tower contains semi procedural level generation. You will need to fight your way through the level, collect tokens and find the exit. At the exit, you can choose to either return to town or continue climbing the tower, which will increase your token rewards, but provide a more challenging experience. The further you climb, the more powerful enemies become!<br><br>Be weary of climbing the tower unprepared, because if you fall, you will lose all the tokens you have gathered.<br><br>The 6th level of the tower is a much larger dungeon which is hand crafted. Containing multiple objectives to complete and finally a boss to defeat. Defeating the boss will unlock the final chapter in the Recordium.<br><br>You will not have your hand held through this experience, the level will contain everything you need to figure out what you need to do!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Built with Unreal Engine 5</h2><br>The game is specifically designed to use low poly assets to provide an accessible experience. Performance of the game has been taken into consideration. Aiming for 60FPS at 1080p on lower end machines (please review the minimum requirements!), the game utilises upscaling technologies provided by Unreal Engine (TSR is enabled by default). For midrange to higher end machines, the game runs exceptionally well.<br><br>Additionally, extensive in-game settings are provided to customise your experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Completion Time</h2><br>The game is designed to be run infinitely. But our estimate to complete the story and boss is around 3-5 hours depending on the mastery of the combo skills.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Wait... the game is free?</h2><br>Yes! The game is completely free. Not &quot;free to play&quot;, but actually free. There are no microtransactions, no dlc, or anything like that. You are free to download and play the game whenever you want.<br><br>This is my first game project. I wanted to share this work with you - the Steam Community.
