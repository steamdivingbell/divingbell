{"about_the_game":"This is the third puzzle box in the puzzle collection based on our favorite classical painter Thomas Cole* and his wonderful series <strong>The Voyage of Life</strong>. In the third painting, <strong>Manhood</strong>, confidently assuming control of his destiny and oblivious to the dangers that await him, the voyager boldly strives to reach an aerial castle, emblematic of the daydreams of youth and its aspirations for glory and fame. As the traveler approaches his goal, the ever more turbulent stream deviates from its course and relentlessly carries him toward the next picture in the series, where nature's fury, evil demons, and self-doubt will threaten his very existence. Only prayer, Cole suggests, can save the voyager from a dark and tragic fate.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Content Details</h2>Contains <i>one</i> new puzzle box for Masters of Puzzle. The UHD image captures the original painting in great detail which in turn allows for very detailed and diverse puzzle tiles. The large sky and the several very similar rock formations in the image will make this puzzle a very challenging experience for many puzzle builders, but there are also some very distinct and detailed areas that can help along with the initial layout.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/900102/extras/public_domain_icon_sm.png?t=1572987424\" /> * <i>Note: The painting used in this DLC is in the public domain in its country of origin and other countries and areas where the copyright term is the author's life plus 100 years or less.</i>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/900102/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1572987424","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/900102/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1572987424","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/900102/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1572987424","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/900102/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1572987424","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This is the third puzzle box in the puzzle collection based on our favorite classical painter Thomas Cole* and his wonderful series <strong>The Voyage of Life</strong>.
