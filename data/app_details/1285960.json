Unashamedly retro in every aspect, if you want amazing visuals then look elsewhere, but if you want a simple, challenging game that's randomised every time you play it, you might just find this to be your cup of tea.<br><br>**NOW ALSO INCLUDES TURN-BASED MODE**<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br>- 20 levels<br>- 5 game speeds<br>- (Challenge Mode (play through all levels in a single session)<br>- Boss levels (every 5th level in Challenge Mode)<br>- Player can be set to always moving to massively increased challenge!<br>- High score table<br>- Change your background colour to mimic the awful colour schemes of ancient consoles!<br>- Make the game easier with Teleports, Bombs and Obstacles - but be aware that these will affect your score...","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"10K","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1285960/1b021a8d76e015751348d10b6cc752700cc66092.jpg"},{"name":"20K","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1285960/2b47524a9b57f0c95ad8a56244596ddecc918b7e.jpg"},{"name":"30K","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1285960/ca062e9c4303f04adf2cf528d05f6b401b6b894a.jpg"},{"name":"40K","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1285960/609f441993cad38708900c09fd76e067b39db4fc.jpg"},{"name":"50K","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1285960/d7e4dc4314e235e1f09f545d525e3ad65d715c25.jpg"},{"name":"60K","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1285960/da74ce425c0b9aa330e1bae5578754292ba95607.jpg"},{"name":"1M","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1285960/9dc6648b3bebc0cf35312e7d5464785dc7bf03b6.jpg"},{"name":"2M","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1285960/fce23005cce3abe501eb1a5297f986b0a3c69b13.jpg"},{"name":"3M","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1285960/ebe68ebdee1ef5938ae028b399d405f79c0c5867.jpg"},{"name":"4M","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1285960/75e329123bde5b92ba514171d5bf89d4c11547ac.jpg"}],"total":21},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1285960/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1646075908","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1285960/page.bg.jpg?t=1646075908","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1285960/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1646075908","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1285960/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1646075908","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Ancient Art of Staying Alive is a highly customisable tea-break arcade game in which you play Hubert McCubert, a small blue cube looking for a quiet life who for some reason (*bonus feature* - make up your own reason!) attracts the attention of the evil Crimson Cube Posse.
