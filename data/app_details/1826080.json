Players focus on strategy and the details of the game are automated on their behalf.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Intro</h2>&quot;Galactic Defense: Automation&quot; is a Placement, Automated Battle, Real-Time Strategy game. Players can place construction plans, observe automated construction, automated battles, and unlock new technologies.
