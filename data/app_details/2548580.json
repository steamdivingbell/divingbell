{"about_the_game":"In a quiet little town, there lived an unassuming character named Blorp. He was just an average guy, spending his days working hard and dreaming of a better life. Every evening, after finishing his mundane job, Blorp would kick off his worn-out boots, settle down on his comfy couch, and watch the news while eagerly waiting for the weekly lotto draw.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLittle did he know that his life was about to take an extraordinary turn. One fateful evening, as Blorp watched the lotto draw, he couldn't believe his eyes when the numbers on the screen matched the ones on his ticket. He had won the Mega Jackpot, an unimaginable sum that promised to change his life forever.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, Blorp's elation was short-lived as, in that very moment, a strange noise echoed from the sky outside. Before he could grasp the situation, he found himself sucked up into a blinding beam of light, transporting him to an otherworldly space vessel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Vahluna Corporation, a mysterious and powerful alien organization, was behind this abduction. Blorp, now trapped within the alien spaceship, realized that he wasn't the only human on board. It appeared that the Vahluna Corporation had abducted other innocent beings from various planets across the universe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith newfound courage and determination, Blorp knew that he had to find a way to escape and expose the truth about these malevolent aliens to the world. As he explored the vast spacecraft, he discovered that he had two choices: confront the alien invaders head-on, but risk dwindling ammo and their sharpshooting abilities, or take the stealthy path, sneaking around, and seeking hidden vents and passageways to outmaneuver his enemies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThroughout his daring journey, Blorp would encounter different types of aliens, each with unique abilities and behaviors. He would have to use his wits, cunning, and the resources he finds along the way to outsmart these extraterrestrial adversaries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe spacecraft itself would be a labyrinth of advanced technology, filled with mysterious rooms, high-tech gadgets, and secrets waiting to be uncovered. As Blorp delves deeper into the alien vessel, he begins to uncover the sinister motives behind the Vahluna Corporation's actions and their plans for Earth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe fate of not only Blorp but also the entire human race now lies in his hands. Will he successfully locate the escape pods and make it back to Earth to warn everyone about the impending alien threat? Or will he succumb to the challenges and malevolence of the Vahluna Corporation, becoming just another forgotten captive on their ship?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEmbark on this thrilling sci-fi adventure with Blorp, as players must make strategic choices, solve puzzles, and outmaneuver the alien enemies to secure a path to freedom and save humanity from the looming extraterrestrial peril.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2548580/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1696596289","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2548580/page.bg.jpg?t=1696596289","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2548580/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1696596289","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2548580/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1696596289","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In a quiet little town, there lived an unassuming character named Blorp.
