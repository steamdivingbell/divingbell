{"about_the_game":"Welcome to <strong>Work Beasts</strong>! In this game, you'll step into the shoes of a entrepreneur tasked with running a business. But here's the twist: you won't be managing just any regular workforce. No, you'll be harnessing the unique talents of mystical creatures like humans, goblins, and fairies to propel your business to success!<br><br>At the start of the game, you'll choose your business contract. Whether it's programming, editing or making art, each contract comes with its own set of challenges and opportunities, so choose wisely! Humans are reliable and skilled workers, capable of tackling a variety of tasks with precision and expertise, and it is not much difficult to manage their needs. Goblins, on the other hand, may be a bit mischievous and difficult to manage, but they possess unique abilities that can't be matched. Each race has unique characteristics and you will need to mix them in order to achieve the greatest productivity.<br><br>Managing these mystical creatures isn't just about putting them to work \u2013 it's also about keeping them happy and motivated, after all if you had to work 24 hours a day you too would have a burnout. The giant human, for example, works better if you give him a beer. Goblins, meanwhile, work better if you don't push them outside of their comfort zones, so give them medieval equipments and they will be grateful for not having to learn all this new technology.<br><br>As you navigate the ups and downs of running your business, you'll encounter all sorts of obstacles, from taxes to magical occurences. But fear not! With the right combination of strategy, teamwork, and a lots of luck, you'll overcome any challenge that comes your way.<br><br>So gather your work beasts, roll up your sleeves, and get ready to embark on the road to success!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2950590/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714200692","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2950590/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1714200692","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2950590/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714200692","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2950590/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714200692","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to <strong>Work Beasts</strong>!
