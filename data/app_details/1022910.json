{"about_the_game":"What good is business if you\u2019re not willing to expand? The smallest of Jupiter\u2019s Galilean moons, Europa presents new challenges - and new opportunities! - for brave space entrepreneurs. Until now, there hasn\u2019t been any colony or business trade on the mostly frozen moon, but you\u2019re here to change that. Establish a colony, provide valuable life support, overcome the cracked landscape, and build your business in a place where no one thought it was possible. <br><br>With brand new scenarios, locations, buildings, resources, and more, The Europa Wager is a must-have addition for your Offworld Trading Company experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Core Features</h2><strong>New location - Europa</strong><br>Explore the smallest of Jupiter\u2019s Galilean moons where numerous cracks in the surface and methane geysers make building and sustaining structures more than a little difficult.<br><br><strong>New resources and structures</strong><br>Made of silicate rock and possessing a water-ice crust, Europa\u2019s atmosphere is thin but comprised mostly of oxygen, which makes it the next natural step for space-bound entrepreneurs. Methane geysers are abundant on Europa, and the new Methane Extractor structure will allow you to harness the gas\u2019 energy and transform it into power. Additionally, the new Gas and Hydrothermal Plants work hard to process resources in order to make you a profit. The Hydrothermal Plant works similarly to the Geothermal Plant, but produces more power and a small amount of water. Meanwhile, the Gas Plant converts fuel into power, which is particularly helpful when you find yourself with an abundance.  <br><br><strong>New Scenarios</strong><br>Everyone said you\u2019re crazy and that it can\u2019t be done, yet here you are: Europa. Fight through the frozen elements and help brave colonists found their colony and establish important resource lines.
