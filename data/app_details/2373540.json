{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">&quot;Your memory is failing you again? I will indulge you just this once...&quot;</h2><br>It is the Year 500. Chaos fell upon the world ten years ago when an unknown and mysterious celestial body arrived and began orbiting Earth. Given the name &quot;The Witness&quot; by the natives of the Runic Empire, the celestial body eerily leered down at the people of the world as its energy gifted people with magical powers beyond their wildest dreams.<br><br>Ranging from control over the elements like Earth and Fire, to more sophisticated powers like control over animal life and even the gift of healing, humanity found plenty of uses for the newly-found powers they had been bestowed. The gifts people received were named \u201cBursts\u201d after their ability to burst through the limitations of what humanity once thought was possible, and those capable of using them were named \u201cBreakers\u201d. Humanity appeared to be entering a Golden Age of power\u2026but their prosperity was short-lived. Soon, those who relished themselves too extensively in the Witness\u2019 gifts found themselves corrupted, their mental sanity breaking down as the Burst magic running through their veins malformed their minds and bodies. These lost souls were referred to as the Broken, and they ranged from mindless zombies to intelligent monsters. <br><br>Among them was King Runic, the most powerful wizard to ever live. When the witness appeared, he used the chaos to consolidate his power and take over. His presence as the king allowed him to maintain control over his many conquered nations. Among his many loyal men, three soldiers were brought together by the sheer gravity of his power. These soldiers served as extensions of his power and were used to conquer and control the region. When King Runic eventually passed, a void of strength was created; one that could only be filled with more strength. Over the years, factions were formed around two of the pillars while the 3rd disappeared completely.
