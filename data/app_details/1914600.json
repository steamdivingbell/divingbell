{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Rail Fights</i> is a multiplayer shooter for 1-8 players that adds a competitive edge to the simplicity of old-school arcade games.

Only practice could make Rail Fighters overcome this challenge.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Capture Your Launcher</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Change your tank\u2019s firepower by hitting and capturing launcher tokens that appear in the arena. Different launchers, such as cannons, rockets, lasers, and grenade launchers, come with varying shooting speeds, cooldown times, and destructive power, requiring different strategies. The better the launcher, the scarcer it is, so try to be the first to capture one.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Bumper Compression</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If other tanks are pushing you around by force, just hold for a bit for your tank\u2019s bumpers to get compressed enough and kick them away from you; The tanks will be stalled for a short period after getting kicked.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1914600/extras/gif-4.gif?t=1739400211\" /></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1914600/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1739400211","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1914600/page.bg.jpg?t=1739400211","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1914600/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739400211","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1914600/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739400211","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":3212620,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Rail Fights</i> is a multiplayer shooter for 1-8 players that adds a competitive edge to the simplicity of old-school arcade games.
