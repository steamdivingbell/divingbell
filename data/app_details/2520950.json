In the space of a moving hour, Bernard touches on the Nuremberg Laws, antisemitism in fairy tales and anti-Jewish propaganda. He shows how the Holocaust was, pace Whoopi Goldberg, a \u201crace-based\u201d genocide and how quickly France went from embracing Jews to sending them to their deaths.\u201d<br>The Times<br><br>\u201cMr. Bernard\u2019s approach could even be used to deepen people\u2019s understanding of other genocides. The game arrives at an urgent moment. The Anti-Defamation League, an advocacy group, reports that anti-Semitism has reached a record-high in America. Elsewhere, memories of Nazi horrors are waning as elderly survivors die.
