{"about_the_game":"When her prince goes missing and her \u201chappily ever after\u201d starts to curdle, the princess Yasmina takes matters into her own hands. YAZ is an action-packed rogue \u201cultra-light\u201d that sees you hack and slash your way through deadly handmaidens, assassins, demons, and djinns as you escape from your father\u2019s palace and confront the dark and powerful forces at work in the kingdom\u2026<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe demo includes Yaz's first level and introduces the main characters, story, and gameplay mechanics. Weapon and ability upgrades are available (though limited), as are three difficulty modes (Casual, Yaz, and Infernal). It is unlikely that progress will carry over from the demo to the full game when it is released. Two characters in the demo (Basira and the Sultan) are fully voice-acted; others are currently TTS though we intend to change this as we finalize the script and get closer to Yaz's full release.","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2571320/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1693144013","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2571320/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1693144013","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,3,4,5],"notes":"We like to say that if you'd given Russ Meyer a  copy of Unreal instead of a camera he might've made Yaz instead of Faster, Pussycat Kill Kill. Thank god that didn't happen. Visually, Yaz features fantasy violence, pervasive absurdly skimpy garments,  and some nudity in the royal baths..\r\n\r\nThe opening cinematic contains still images of sexual activity (no genitals). Sexual acts and and suggestive poses are depicted in the environment art throughout the game. There are plenty of mature themes throughout the game but very little profanity.\r\n\r\nWe would observe that while there is explicit material, the game is more NC-17 than XXX. There is no \"long duration\" or animated sexual content. There is no visible penetration or genitalia. There is not now- nor  shall there ever be- an \"18+ patch\"."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"When her prince goes missing and her \u201chappily ever after\u201d starts to curdle, the princess Yasmina takes matters into her own hands.
