{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2189200/extras/titre_BUILD.png?t=1702474483\" /><br><strong>Space Savior Special </strong>is a <i>Shoot 'em up</i> (<i>STG or Shmup</i>) game for PC Steam. Inspired by classic Arcades and 16bit consoles, in a time when things were simpler and nicer. Year 2988. Finally, with the creation of the Hyperdrives, humanity opens the doors to the stars. Space travel becomes reality and human life spreads across the galaxy. But we ended up encountering a race-destroying way of life. The Naggal are series without individual consciousness and act like space locusts. They attack planets and species like viruses and after consuming everything they go to the next one. Defeat is certain, but as a last act of despair they send ships from all nations to break the blockade and try to detonate an experimental bomb in the center of enemy forces. The player controls the Barracuda Ship and together with the Temporal Bomb the player sets off on a one-way mission.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2189200/extras/titre_BUILD_features.png?t=1702474483\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Arcade-style vertical PC shmup perfect for newbies to the genre</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Game with 2D pixel-art handmade art based on 16 bit consoles</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Choose from 3 weapon styles based on how you play, each having a unique type of special bomb</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>5 stages with cut-scenes and a surprising ending</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Over 60 unique enemies and striking bosses</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2189200/extras/titre_BUILD_opcionais.png?t=1702474483\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Generic keyboard and joystick support and xbox controller</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Steam achievements</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Arts used in development</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>3 difficulty settings</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Possible free future DLC</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Subtitles in various languages</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2189200/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1702474483","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2189200/page.bg.jpg?t=1702474483","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2189200/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1702474483","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2189200/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1702474483","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Captions available","id":13}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":2209460,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2189200/extras/titre_BUILD.png?t=1702474483\" /><br><strong>Space Savior Special </strong>is a <i>Shoot 'em up</i> (<i>STG or Shmup</i>) game for PC Steam.
