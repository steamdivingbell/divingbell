{"about_the_game":"Mike Patey's undeniable passion, exceptional drive, and work ethic (Back to Work\u2122) have led to him designing and building some of the most unique and incredible aircraft \u2013 while his infectious enthusiasm has inspired thousands of people to enjoy RC and full-scale aviation along the way! Starting with a Wilga 2000 and replacing its Lycoming O-540 piston engine with a Pratt &amp; Whitney PT6A-28 turboprop boasting about twice the power at half the weight, then many additional modifications later, Mike proudly unveiled his \u201cultimate bush plane.\u201d It could go to the same places as a Carbon Cub but climb twice as fast, reach altitudes up to 28,000 feet, and cruise cross-country at 180 MPH while carrying four people plus gear. Changes from the Wilga were so extensive that the FAA approved Mike's redesign as an experimental exhibition aircraft. The E-flite DRACO 2.0m was equally unique and astounding, and since its release, it's become one of the best-selling RC aircraft ever! But many pilots have asked for a smaller version that's more convenient, easier to fly, and most importantly\u2013is more affordable too. The Micro DRACO 800mm delivers in every way to offer the most practical and fun-to-fly replica for intermediate to experienced pilots yet!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759440/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724890769","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759440/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1724890769","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759440/bd58bc530bfb5cf1146cb758f2efd2eba4531d44/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724890769","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759440/bd58bc530bfb5cf1146cb758f2efd2eba4531d44/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724890769","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Mike Patey's undeniable passion, exceptional drive, and work ethic (Back to Work\u2122) have led to him designing and building some of the most unique and incredible aircraft \u2013 while his infectious enthusiasm has inspired thousands of people to enjoy RC and full-scale aviation along the way!
