Wars have been fought, towns have been captured or razed, yet no cause of the attacks could be found as the population suffered and dwindled. Desperate, the King set bounties to find answers and commissioned groups of mercenaries to find the cause and stop the chaos. Though many groups have ventured forth, the few surviving soldiers have returned with mad tales of living shadows and animated corpses.<br><br>Was it some Necromancer or Dark God that defeated your party? Lucky to find yourselves awaken, your group now appears to be trapped in an unknown dungeon.
