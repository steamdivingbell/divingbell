{"about_the_game":"This free DLC created for the Unturned crossover event in Dying Light contains a unique outfit and blueprints for three completely new \u201clow-poly\u201d weapons modeled after Unturned items (Rake, Machete, and Hockey Stick). The weapons are almost indestructible, consume little stamina and can be crafted without any base weapon, which makes them a perfect fit for a starting player or a reliable backup gear for a seasoned Survivor. Their damage scales to player level, while high critical hit chances make combat extremely satisfying.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1272090/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1657117788","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1272090/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1657117788","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1272090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1657117788","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1272090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1657117788","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Valve Anti-Cheat enabled","id":8},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"This free DLC created for the Unturned crossover event in Dying Light contains a unique outfit and blueprints for three completely new \u201clow-poly\u201d weapons modeled after Unturned items (Rake, Machete, and Hockey Stick).
