Cards from one faction strengthen each other, but cards from other factions supplement their weak spots.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Leaders</h2>Each game you will choose the leader of the faction for which you will play. Every leader has his own abilities and talents. One strategy or another is good for each of them. Choose who you will be, how you will play and win.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cyberpsychosis</h2>Cyberpsychosis will add you destructive power, but it will come at a cost.
