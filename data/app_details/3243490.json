{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is a 2D cartoon-style adventure game with a medieval fantasy theme, independently developed by two dads. Players will take on the role of a commander, recruiting unique heroes from the tavern at the camp, and leading them to brave the dark Goblin Continent. They will defeat bosses, earn high rewards, and further enhance their own strength! After undergoing various trials, players will gradually grow to become the ruler of this world\u2014provided they survive!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Various weapons and equipment come with different skills, and when worn by heroes, they will produce special effects. Of course, you can also sell unwanted equipment to merchants for more gold! Each time a boss is defeated, you will receive corresponding rewards, and the higher the level of the defeated boss, the richer the rewards!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Heroes have only one life! They cannot be resurrected. After dying, their ashes can be brought back to the camp by other surviving teammates to exchange for heroic souls, allowing you to recruit new heroes to fill the vacancies. If all heroes are defeated, the adventure ends in failure! Remember, if you can't win, retreat! Don't be overconfident; go back to the camp to strengthen your abilities before fighting again!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The training ground at the camp can enhance heroes' strength, and you can choose different growth paths based on your preferred playstyle!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The blacksmith shop can identify and recycle the weapons and equipment you bring back. Depending on their quality, different attributes will be identified. Only identified weapons can be equipped by heroes! If identified as trash, you can sell them directly for gold!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The outdoor map features randomly generated terrain. Players need to explore and find the entrance to the next layer. Every ten layers, a boss will appear; defeating it will unlock the next chapter of the map, which also consists of ten layers. Different chapters have different themes (forest, cave, lava, etc.) and correspond to different types of monsters.
