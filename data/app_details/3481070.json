I want to make a simple linear game with low repetition. I am an individual developer and wanted to create less repetitive content, so I integrated the different levels I had developed into this game. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">I still have many ideas that I want to implement in the game, so I may update this game with more levels in the future, but please forgive me for not guaranteeing this. There are only 5 levels that can be played now. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">I will listen to player feedback to make some adjustments to the developed content. For example, current feedback from social accounts shows that players prefer\u00a0 jet levels.
