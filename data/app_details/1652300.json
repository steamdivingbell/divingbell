{"about_the_game":"Mousey Mick is a 2D Platformer developed by Jackrifleman. In Mousey Mick, you run, jump, wall-jump, dodge and dash your way through wormhole doors. These doors allow people to travel to other nearby worlds within seconds. Each world introduces new challenges in one way or another; Whether it be precision jumps, or disgruntled knights of the Mayonnaise Kingdom. You may wonder why Mousey Mick is putting himself through such danger; the answer? Groceries. Mousey Mick is just trying to get some groceries, but he has a pretty lengthy commute seeing as the nearest thrift store is about 10 worlds away.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Barbeled Benefactor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1652300/1bcec5a6d83e437261a5c6dd00b45f8a8396c28b.jpg"},{"name":"Hell Hath No Fury Like a Catfish Scorned","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1652300/f4b7e6511164b0aa1bafdcdd6775d3d3ee3458d8.jpg"},{"name":"Telefragged","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1652300/766cb1147bbd630c1758cdf103e0485ef3322cf1.jpg"},{"name":"Abyssal!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1652300/8098fe8b5a0408f60eaf50385fbbaa09a3302a3b.jpg"},{"name":"In The Clouds","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1652300/5f3a5210cd809286d9061d5993543375d3215709.jpg"},{"name":"Chaos Landscaping","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1652300/b1779fe67590134de1bf0ba09aea294ef18acb8e.jpg"},{"name":"Bright and Early","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1652300/76fe1694d5df9e73e6a78aa91e28140eb7215237.jpg"},{"name":"Wall-jump World","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1652300/7c19122c8e88c80e7bdf217d778b58f7cc4bacc6.jpg"},{"name":"Fast-fall Extreme","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1652300/79dbecf228bcbc3bcb11da409f8f3920e5103500.jpg"},{"name":"This World's Meta","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1652300/8b818e33c39e23a3d0345ff981e64a2835f2c80d.jpg"}],"total":27},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1652300/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1662510245","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1652300/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1662510245","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1652300/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1662510245","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1652300/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1662510245","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Mousey Mick is a 2D Platformer developed by Jackrifleman.
