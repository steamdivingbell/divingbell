The main weapon is a bow, and can also launch kick attacks. Player need to adopt different combat strategies based on different NPCs and the features of the scene. The game encourages players to attack and is worth repeatedly challenging.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Game features:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">1) High difficulty, requires one life to complete.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">2) A female character who is both powerful and weak requires superb combat skills.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">3) NPC with a deadly Strike.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">4) Three types of random weather: clear, thunderstorm and snowstorm, with a mysterious atmosphere.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">5) Continuous sense of oppression.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">6) It is necessary to observe and utilize the characteristics of NPCs to counter them.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Gameplay Mechanics</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Let me explain the gameplay mechanics to everyone. The game isn't just about simple &quot;pew pew pew&quot; actions, let me break it down.</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The main offensive methods for the female protagonist are shooting arrows and flying kick attacks. There's no blocking, but you can dodge.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Attacking the enemy's weak points can quickly build up your firepower. Once activated, shooting arrows can unleash powerful moves, or flying kicks can also trigger powerful attacks that cause wide-area damage. If you unleash a powerful arrow shot, it can penetrate several NPCs.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Different enemies have different characteristics and weaknesses. For example, the &quot;Haha Monster&quot; is difficult to engage in close combat and will self-destruct. The best way to deal with it is to shoot it with an arrow when it charges for a death rush, causing it to stun and then self-destruct, which will damage both enemies and allies. You can use this mechanic and the terrain to inflict large-scale damage on NPCs.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Dark Night Warrior is fully armored with a shield and can dodge your arrows, making it a tough opponent. However, it is vulnerable to flying kick attacks. If you kick it from the side or behind, it will take significant damage, and you can regain health and increase your firepower. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If you can kill two or more Haha Monsters simultaneously, you can also regain health.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The &quot;Big Gulu&quot; NPC is tough and hard to stagger. You need to hit its head, which is small and difficult to aim at. However, it is also vulnerable to flying kick attacks, though this is risky. A safer strategy is to wait for it to attack, then perform a flying kick and quickly retreat. The Big Gulu can kill you instantly with a ground slam. A safer approach is to shoot arrows from a distance; for the Fire Big Gulu, about three arrows should be enough to take it down.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The NPC designs are focused with strong strengths and obvious weaknesses. You'll need to observe and discover these through gameplay.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The player's health regeneration isn't based on picking up health packs. Instead, you regain health by continuously fighting and finding ways to inflict large-scale damage on enemies or by aggressively attacking the boss's weak points\u2014high risk, high reward.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">I'm currently working on more NPCs and scenes, hoping to create unique and interesting gameplay. Everyone's suggestions are very important, and I greatly appreciate all the feedback.

Then things got a bit out of hand, so I decided to just go ahead and make a full-fledged game. I will continue to add more content and use more paid assets in the future. Starting production in November 2024, it was completed single-handedly in just a few months.
