{"about_the_game":"Haven &amp; Hearth is a MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game) set in a fictional world loosely inspired by Slavic and Germanic myth and legend. The game sets itself apart from other games in the genre in its aim to provide players with an interactive, affectable and mutable game world, which can be permanently and fundamentally changed and affected through actions undertaken by the players. Our fundamental goal with Haven &amp; Hearth is to create a game in which player choices have permanent and/or lasting effects and, thus, providing said players with a meaningful and fun gaming experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Skills &amp; Attributes</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Develop your character to unlock new <strong>Skills</strong>, <strong>Abilities</strong>, and <strong>Credos</strong>.<br></li><li> Devour sumptuous feasts of food and drink to increase your <strong>Strength</strong>, <strong>Intelligence</strong>, <strong>Agility</strong> and other base <strong>Attributes</strong>.<br></li><li> Study sundry <strong>Curiosities</strong> of nature and artifice to gain <strong>Learning Points</strong> to increase your <strong>Farming</strong>, <strong>Masonry</strong>, <strong>Exploration</strong> and other <strong>Abilities</strong>.<br></li><li> Experience oddities and obscure situations to gain experience points and cast or incant the spells and charms of <strong>Hearth Magic</strong>.<br></li><li> <strong>Discover materials</strong> previously unknown to you to unlock new recipes for <strong>Crafting</strong> &amp; <strong>Building</strong>.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hunting &amp; Gathering</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Slay vicious beasts of nature, flay their hides and tan for leather.<br></li><li> Make sausages of Boar, and smoke Sea Gull Meat. <strong>Feasting</strong> and a varied diet is important to all <strong>Hearthlings</strong>.<br></li><li> <strong>Forage</strong> rare flowers to <strong>Study</strong>, or bind them into bouquets for additional <strong>Learning Points</strong>.<br></li><li> Traverse the vast- and wilderness of <strong>Haven &amp; Hearth's</strong> procedurally generated world and gather rare Herbs, Mushrooms and Flowes.<br></li><li> Pick wild seeds to grow into domestic crops for <strong>Farming</strong>, such as Grapes, Wheat, Carrots or Peas.<br></li><li> Tame wild animals to raise <strong>Livestock</strong> like Cows, Pigs, Goats or Reindeer.

Mean words can be spoken, and evil deeds undertaken.\r\n- Player-versus-Player combat is free, mostly open, and cannot be opted-out of.\r\n- Free building and landscaping by players allows for artistic expressions in many of its potential forms.
