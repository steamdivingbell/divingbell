{"about_the_game":"It\u2018s almost midnight again, what's left on today's to-do list? Reply to Client 1's message, finish and send the adjustments requested by Client 2, remind Client 3 about the payment, submit an entry for the competition, help a friend with a new piece by drafting a brief background melody \u2014 just postpone that for another day. Hmm... need to buy medicine, take medicine, fix the plumbing, get the train ticket refunded, water the mint... Buying medicine involves filling out forms and making calls, such a hassle, and the pharmacy is closed now anyway, let's deal with it later... A leaky pipe isn't a big problem anyway... Hmm, my stomach hurts a bit, seems like I haven't eaten dinner yet, no wait, I skipped lunch too, but I had a whole bottle of sugary soda \u2014 should be ok I guess. How much money is left in my account?... Oh god, when will all this end?... At least the ceramic pot holding the mint is cute, the rustling sound it makes when getting touched under the moonlight delivers a sense of life, as if something in the world will persist forever...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a puzzle-solving game involving countdowns and tasks. The game attempts to discuss how people balance the &quot;constrained, fleeting life&quot; with the &quot;grand, eternal humanistic ideals.&quot; The main character of the game is a young musical artist named Daan van Leeuwen. Players need to complete tasks to maintain the character's vital signs while simultaneously searching for clues of puzzles to complete different artistic creations following the character's inspirations before the countdown ends. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne gameplay session will be no more than 15 minutes. If you are experiencing any form of financial hardship, feel free to return for a refund before the trial period ends.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWarning! This game involves mental health issues, and the main character has suicidal tendencies. Please approach with caution. If you feel uncomfortable at any point, please pause the game immediately and seek help.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2954660?t=1715616158","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2954660/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1715616158","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2954660/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1715616158","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2954660/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1715616158","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"It\u2018s almost midnight again, what's left on today's to-do list?
