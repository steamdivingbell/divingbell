Who tends to think about the little things a bit too much. Others consider him a gentle soul, while he would consider himself quite different. He'd describe himself as timid, though people see him always throwing himself into situations to please others. Being a known fellow around town, his goal was always to spread his musical tone. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If people aren't aware of him, they'd only question his appearance. Always keeping his guitar around, and a spare notepad. Never leaving home without it. Those were his two best friends, if anything. <i>Guitary &amp; Notepaddy.</i> He tends to write down a lot of things that inspire him, such as dumb lines in conversations that might seem <strong>deep.</strong> In reality, they only seem good in song form. He knows what hits, kind of. Later down the line, he catches up with an old friend. Only having a deep change in his personality. Only getting him deeper into the abyss.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>get it?</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What's The Features?</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A rich story, with an open world to explore.
