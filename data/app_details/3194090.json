{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Following a global event known as <strong>The Blackout</strong>, zones of paranormal activity called <strong>Breaches</strong> have started to appear increasingly around the globe, manifesting anomalies that bend the rules of reality and perception.

You are a member of an official team of investigators, tasked with suppressing the emerging phenomena within the Breaches. Your mission is to analyze and contain anomalies to identify the Entity that sustains the Breach in order to contain the phenomenon.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Equipped with devices designed to detect and measure the paranormal, you must methodically explore the environment and analyze the anomalies to gather enough data. Success hinges on your ability to interpret findings, remain in contact with your team, and navigate areas where rules fluctuate, causing reality to behave improbably.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each mission pushes you deeper into the unknown, where following protocol and maintaining coherence are your only tools to hold the line against the looming dark.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Gameplay</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Setup:</strong> Begin by exploring the map and preparing your equipment for the challenges ahead.
