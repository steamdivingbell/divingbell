{"about_the_game":"<strong>Explore an open world filled with wild slime monsters. Battle slimes to capture their DNA in cubes, use them for crafting along your adventure. Return home and expand your farm. Plant crops and earn precious gold. Meet the locals and befriend them, giving gifts to earn their love. This is Suramon.</strong><br><br>This genre-blending game puts a focus on capturing Slime Cubes, rather than the monsters themselves in typical monster capture games. After inheriting a farm from your uncle and moving to a mysterious valley, the player discovers a world that is filled with colorful slime creatures called Suramon. These creatures roam free and play a part in the day-to-day life in this world. Players will run their farm and try to make a living while exploring the region and fighting the 100 different breeds of slime monsters that wander the land. Each slain Suramon drops a Suramon Cube: a highly sought after element. Each Cube is made up of the organic slime material for each slime, and will differ in color and style to the creature it comes from.<br><br>Once the player becomes a Suramon Scout, they will be tasked with collecting the different Cubes for a research lab so they can be used for further scientific discoveries. They will also be tasked with filling their SuraDex: an encyclopedia of all the Suramon that call the region home. Players will quickly learn of a mysterious and shadowy organization called Fuchsia Corp. An organization that wants to capture all of the Suramon for themselves, and use them for devastating purposes. Can the player stop them before it's too late?<br><br>Explore a vibrant world filled with colorful slime creatures and colorful villagers who want to get to know you. Battle the Suramon slime monsters and collect Cubes. Grow your farm and renovate your farmhouse. Befriend and gift the local villagers to grow your friendship with them. Fall in love with different romance options and get married. And don't forget to eat and drink to survive!
