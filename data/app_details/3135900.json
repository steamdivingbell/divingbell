{"about_the_game":"Dawn of Survivors is an action shooting game that combines a meat pigeon with 100 waves of monsters, and the player is required to make the character stronger by killing the monsters and picking up gold coins over and over again. Break through the monsters' heavy siege.<br />\r\nThe only thing a player can do in the game is to fight with all his power, to maximize his survival time until he faces inevitable death. Gold coins and props were collected for each round of the battle and were used to purchase fortification to assist the next survivor.<br />\r\nThe current version only offers Elena as a playable character, and in the future we will add more heroes, each with different initial attributes and skills, and players can use gold coins to unlock them.<br />\r\nIn addition, we plan to introduce property points and gifted point systems in future releases, and even consider the addition of survival building elements. Stay tuned for more of the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDeveloper's Message:<br />\r\nThis is my 13th game. It's really not easy to come up these years. All kinds of parents have short-term, internal and external problems.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince I started developing games myself, I have also died socially. Basically, there will be no colleagues or new friends at the next building in a month. It's even hard to meet different people again. My time seems to have stopped there, and it is a pity. But I had my wife and son, who were with me, the only one I could speak. But the child is too young to speak, haha.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI often wonder if it would be good if I gave up on a stand-alone game that I've been doing for so long and chose to continue working in the business?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFind a good job in the factory, get a good salary, don't think of all kinds of trouble, go along with everyone. Every day, you have a firm heart. Wouldn't it be more beautiful if there was a company that was blind and asked me to be an executive? Hahaha. I can leave all my disliked work behind to my colleagues, and I can do so all day long, all day long, all day long, all day long, all day long, all day long.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, in reality, such things will not happen, I such as an elderly road independent developer, estimated to be not well adapted to the work of the enterprise.
