The puzzles are better, the concept is better, and the historical piece of the puzzle is intriguing, as well.\u201d<br>Just Adventure<br><br>\u201cDeception Island to me has it all: a wide range of game environments, a host of credible characters, well-crafted graphics and ambiance, and a great plot that weaves the curiosities of the past with the present day mysteries into one entertaining package. Then they threw in some diverting side events just for fun. Toss it all together and you have one charming game, sure to give adventure players their money\u2019s worth and more. So without any reservations, I highly recommend this game.\u201d<br>GameBoomers<br><br>\u201cIn short, there is much to recommend Nancy Drew: Danger on Deception Island. Unless you\u2019re already something of a nautical buff, you\u2019ll learn a lot about sailing and whales.
