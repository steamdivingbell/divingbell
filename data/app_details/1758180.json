{"about_the_game":"Another boring game! We are excited to present the next entry into the Most Boring Series!  Do you miss life pre covid? The fantastic yet boring 9-5 of our existence?

Enjoy the new normal with covid where you will wonder if things will ever get back to normal.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"BEGIN","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1758180/e68876e93cb71227c65dfebb31dfa71e1e913a32.jpg"},{"name":"Peek a Boo","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1758180/e68876e93cb71227c65dfebb31dfa71e1e913a32.jpg"},{"name":"Get to the three.
