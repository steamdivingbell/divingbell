Discovering their grandfather and all other adults missing, Mei and her younger brother ZK are about to experience a summer vacation like no other. Together with Fibo, their grandfather\u2019s dog, they must repel the invaders by using special water guns and make their way across the island to find help.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3091520/extras/page_titles_shot.png?t=1736267959\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3091520/extras/page_shot.gif?t=1736267959\" /><br>Players can shoot freely in 8 directions. Holding down the shot button locks the direction while moving. The water gun shots lose damage over distance, though. So getting close to enemies does more damage.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3091520/extras/page_titles_pulse.png?t=1736267959\" /><br>Hitting enemies with water builds up the pulse bar. Enemies also drop energy orbs when destroyed. Collect them to fill the pulse bar faster and get one pulse stock for each full bar (up to three).<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3091520/extras/page_pulse_wave.gif?t=1736267959\" /><br>Tapping the pulse button releases a pulse wave that slows down enemy projectiles inside it. Enemies in the pulse wave take double damage as well. There is a cooldown before the next pulse can be used. Each wave uses one pulse stock.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3091520/extras/page_pulse_shot.gif?t=1736267959\" /><br>Holding down the pulse button charges a strong pulse shot instead. The pulse shot does more damage, can cancel enemy shots, and can destroy things the normal shots cannot. Each pulse shot also uses one pulse stock, but the cooldown is much faster than the pulse wave\u2019s.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3091520/extras/page_titles_scoring.png?t=1736267959\" /><br>Scoring in Yellow Trouble is very simple. When the pulse stock reaches the maximum of three, scoring mode is activated and all orbs collected get converted to a score bonus instead of filling the pulse bar. Higher scores get more extends. Basically, score potential increases with less use of the pulse. Players have to find the right balance on this difficulty scale and adjust their strategy according to skill level.<br><br>Knowing how to utilize these systems is the key to victory!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3091520/extras/page_select.jpg?t=1736267959\" /><br>Choose from Mei, ZK, or Fibo, each with different shot types, speed, and pulse shots.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3091520/extras/page_titles_modes.png?t=1736267959\" /><br>Choose from two different main game modes: Arcade or Quest.<br>Arcade Mode - Aim for a one credit clear and/or high score in 8 auto scrolling stages (+2 secret stages) that feature branching paths and endings.
