{"about_the_game":"<strong>Dave's Fun Algebra Class: Remastered</strong> is a strategy-based indie game inspired by Baldi's Basics, featuring chaotic and intense gameplay mixed with an old-school psychedelic artstyle. Meet Dave, a math teacher in a motorized wheelchair. You need to grab your friend's art contest drawings, but Dave wants to do some math with you! Solve some math with Dave and get all of your friend's missing papers. Make sure you don't make mistakes, Dave doesn't like mistakes.<br><br>If you do happen to make a mistake, don't worry! There are many different kinds of items lying around the school that you can use to your advantage. Dave knows what you're doing though and just to make it even, he's brought his friends to help him out. Can you get all 8 missing papers (and solve some math here and there) and escape?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Hey there! Welcome to my school!</strong></h2>Return to Dave's school in this brand new version of Dave's Fun Algebra Class! Solve math problems, navigate the halls, and uncover the secrets of Dave's school. It contains everything from the original mod, but with a brand new coat of paint! Many new features have been added to the game, and many features from the original have been brought back and improved upon. Some of these features include gameplay improvements, visual improvements, and more!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>New ways to twist up the game!</strong></h2>Dave's Fun Algebra Class: Remastered brings new ways to change up the game! If you think you have the hang of the normal game, try out &quot;Hard Mode&quot; where the math is harder and the characters are faster! If you're feeling wacky, try out Modified mode, which contains a selection of modifiers that change up the game in different ways when activated. There are also some secret gamemodes you can discover by doing certain things in the game!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Successful Escape","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2570390/086f1bca76bb5625657d4049602843c1f2266fe1.jpg"},{"name":"His Defeat","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2570390/df50498dfc880a111ec42779c3d8a6c394d755c0.jpg"},{"name":"The World is Against You","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2570390/1fc7a29d0365d1172330400c97a3584f57b61dc3.jpg"},{"name":"Escaping with Style","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2570390/a8d5648feb6d3da7478993bebf8c24822adf2888.jpg"},{"name":"Unruly","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2570390/277ad33aa6636f226d913a67df09c7be93998703.jpg"},{"name":"Tough Challenger","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2570390/1180bb57378384196ff39ee1be098fcd45676594.jpg"},{"name":"Certified Algebra Expert","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2570390/52af94e9f8b5de3eb182f0a854f6e15f4db5f13e.jpg"},{"name":"Escaping with Even More Style","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2570390/f7eaa197900672c8a685165a57fce711e2eff379.jpg"},{"name":"Close and Personal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2570390/ee489c5a5bcb0b0329b5830d37ef817301a2e69a.jpg"},{"name":"Prepared for Class","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2570390/5c9cf7841f0a12037c8fb00593b037e1dea418f7.jpg"}],"total":16},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2570390/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736999460","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2570390/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1736999460","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2570390/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736999460","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2570390/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736999460","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>Dave's Fun Algebra Class: Remastered</strong> is a strategy-based indie game inspired by Baldi's Basics, featuring chaotic and intense gameplay mixed with an old-school psychedelic artstyle.
