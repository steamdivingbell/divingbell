You take on a role of one of 200 Minor Lords or Kings from the time period. Be a minor noble in Ottomans court, an earl in Ireland, or Emperor of Byzantium, and rewrite history by fighting to preserve your empire, and prevent the spread of the Black Death across Europe.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You bear the burden of leadership, and must decide how to keep your people safe.
