{"about_the_game":"The War of the Lance is over, but Evil is a BAD loser... With the Dragonarmies defeated and the lands to the east reconquered, the forces of good have withdrawn and settled down to a well-earned rest. Evil forces, however, never rest and have been quietly plotting a cataclysmic return to power! Their goal: nothing short of establishing the Dark Queen, Takhisis, as undisputed ruler of Krynn! Guide your party of characters through a dark web of intrigue and combat, where dragons, draconians and other unspeakable monstrosities dwell. Go with a brave heart - for you and your heroic adventurers are all that stand in the way of evil tyranny.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1904620/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1648566405","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1904620/page.bg.jpg?t=1648566405","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1904620/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1648566405","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1904620/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1648566405","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The War of the Lance is over, but Evil is a BAD loser...
