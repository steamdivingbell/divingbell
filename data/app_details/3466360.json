Players engage in non-stop zombie combat using various firearms and weapons, with enemies exploding into exaggerated displays of blood, guts, and gore upon defeat. While the art style is colorful and cartoonish, the action remains intense, with graphic blood effects and dismemberment.\r\n\r\nThe game also includes references to steroid use as part of its gameplay or story elements.\r\n\r\nThere are no depictions of sexual acts, sexual assault, non-consensual behavior, drug or alcohol abuse (aside from steroids), or self-harm. However, due to the violent and mature themes, it may not be suitable for younger audiences or those sensitive to graphic content, even in a stylized, cartoon format."},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3466360/extras/mainban.gif?t=1738989791\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Demo Version</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Zombies are everywhere!</i> Arcade-inspired shooter, where relentless waves of undead creeps shamble, sprint, and swarm at you in a cramped room!
