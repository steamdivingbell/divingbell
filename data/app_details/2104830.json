{"about_the_game":"<i>The kingdom of Union Port long ago built a large stone wall circling the kingdom, but the wall wasn't built to keep out invaders. It was built to seal off the center of the kingdom. Anyone that knows why it was built isn't revealing any secrets. This includes the kingdom's new rulers, the Lin family.</i><br><br>The Greencastle Expansion turns the Kingdom of Union Port into a new adventuring zone similar to Swampstone. With new quests, new characters, plenty of new magic weapons and armor, and a challenging dungeon once you advance far enough in the quests. <br><br>After downloading the expansion pack, rebuild the game world to add the new content. When building the world,  a line of text will say that an expansion pack was installed. The Union Port quests begin after completing Anda's Swampstone quests.  For anyone not wanting to repeat the Swampstone quests, use this claim code:<br><br>-ClaimCode Greencastle<br><br>The code is case sensitive so type carefully and make sure you have room in your inventory. Internet connection is required when using a claim code.<br><br>This code will give you the Seal of Hospitality. The seal will allow you to start the Union Port quests without completing the Swampstone quests.  Once you have the seal, use a traveling post to travel to Union Port and talk to Sir Adkins. He will be standing at the Traveling Post.<br><br><strong>Instructions for adding Greencastle Expansion to a Stand-Alone Server: </strong><br><br>Requires server version 1.88 or higher.  To add the expansion to your server, just copy the 0.DarkDIREExpansion file from the DarkDIRE installation directory to your document folder.
