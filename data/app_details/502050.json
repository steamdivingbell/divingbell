{"about_the_game":"A magician has stored a rabbit in his enchanted top hat.  Inside the hat is a pocket dimension, seemingly as big as a tower, which he uses to store his stage props and more.  But the rabbit can smell a bag of carrots outside... help the rabbit hop out, for freedom and carrots!  Use your mouse to determine the rabbit's jump angle and strength: it's simple to learn, difficult to master.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHopping Up for It is a type of game that may be familiar to some: You only go up, while getting over obstacles until you reach the top.  But this game would be nearly impossible for most players if not for its ability to save and load any time (and even then, it's quite the challenge)!  Only a true king or queen of jumping may ever make it out without using saves-- though the game will recognize it if you do.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere will be obstacles and tricky platforms such as giant dice, bouncy balloons, sliding cards, flipping coins, teleporting wands, swinging pendants and more.  Can you escape the hat?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/502050/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1712431049","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/502050/page.bg.jpg?t=1712431049","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/502050/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1712431049","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/502050/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1712431049","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A magician has stored a rabbit in his enchanted top hat.
