You can find it here: <br><br>Star Matter is a single-player, 2D, tile based, spaceship physics RPG, where you pilot a ship that you are able to customize and configure to suit the current task, your playstyle, or what remains of the ship. Using your design and piloting ability, you will explore what remains of humanity after the collapse of Earth to an unknown alien threat. What path will humanity carve into the far future, if any?<br><br><strong>Ship Creation</strong><br>Your ship is the only thing standing between you and a neuro-clone into a new body, making it pretty important. As such, you are able to use the resources gathered from fair or foul means to improve existing ship designs or generate new ones, as you unlock additional ship components.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1439900/extras/Builder.gif?t=1626513235\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1439900/extras/Designer.gif?t=1626513235\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1439900/extras/Fleet.gif?t=1626513235\" /><br><br><strong>Dynamic AI</strong><br>The AI in Star Matter utilizes ships as well, and they are bound by the same restrictions as the player.

The player may be able to leverage these abilities to gain an advantage in a bad situation. These abilities currently include creating a gravity well and assuming control of an enemy ship.
