Training your own talent can be a great way to bring exciting new workers to the ring and have an established relationship with workers regardless of whether they're signed with you or not.<br><br>Storylines are arguably the most important thing when it comes to entertainment in wrestling. As your company progresses, you will be able to either outsource a writer for one-off storylines, or even hire your own writers to passively write and unlock potential storylines. Rivalries need to be intense in order to work, so with that in mind, rivalry storylines need to maintain intensity in order to progress. Whilst a good rivalry can really set apart a promotion from their competition, a failed rivalry can really leave a bad reaction when it comes to the fans.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2177050/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1679475474","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2177050/page.bg.jpg?t=1679475474","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2177050/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1679475474","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2177050/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1679475474","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Combat Sports related violence that may result in blood.
