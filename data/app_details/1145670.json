{"about_the_game":"The Seven is a simplistic indie platformer that is designed to push the player to the limits. You, the player, are tasked with completing the seven trials, all with varying level designs and challenges within them. With no saves and a very simplistic design, The Seven focuses on the player's skill and nothing more. Traps, enemies, and the level layouts will try to kill you at every opportunity they get. With the odds stacked heavily against you, will you prevail?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1145670/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1568201385","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1145670/page.bg.jpg?t=1568201385","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1145670/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1568201385","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1145670/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1568201385","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Seven is a simplistic indie platformer that is designed to push the player to the limits.
