You are lost. And you're not sure what's happening.<br><br>Alone, lost, and surrounded by darkness. Every creak and muffled scream hints at the horrors lurking ahead. During an urban exploration gone wrong, you fall into a hidden hole and wake up in a strange, decrepit school. The path to escape is long and treacherous, winding through an eerie swimming pool, a maze-like labyrinth, and a foreboding forest. Your voice is your only lifeline in this immersive survival horror game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay Overview</h2>In &quot;Echoes,&quot; players must use their voice to interact with the environment, illuminate the darkness, and solve puzzles. Shouting creates temporary visual &quot;echoes&quot; to reveal pathways, hidden doors, and lurking enemies. But sound is a double-edged sword, as making noise may attract monsters roaming the corridors, labyrinths, and forests. Armed with limited supplies and no save points, players must find keys to unlock doors, avoid terrifying creatures, and escape the maze before the horrors consume them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>    Voice-Based Interaction: Speak to open doors, reveal paths, and solve puzzles.
