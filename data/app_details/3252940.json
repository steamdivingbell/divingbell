{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Step into the crumbling remains of TradieCraft in tool trials, a rogue-lite platformer that fuses fitness with fast-paced gameplay. You play as a former apprentice, summoned back to the abandoned TradieCraft headquarters by an old, quirky robot named TR-Dee. TradieCraft, once a powerhouse of secret technologies, has been closed for years. But now, a rival company has kidnapped Smart Alex\u2014a robot with access to vital trade secrets\u2014and it's up to you to stop them before they uncover everything.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The deserted building is a maze of forgotten corridors, faded memories of innovation, and old tools. Each room holds physical and mental challenges that test your endurance, reflexes, and problem-solving skills. The eerie silence and abandoned environment create a haunting atmosphere as you navigate obstacle courses designed to push your limits.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There are no NPCs here to help you. Only TR-Dee, left plugged in for years, remembers you from your apprenticeship days and offers cryptic guidance. Your goal is simple but daunting: navigate the building, overcome the challenges, and find Smart Alex before it's too late.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With each run through the building, you'll gather clues, unlock abilities, and improve your fitness in real life as you push yourself to outpace traps and obstacles. The faster you complete the levels, the greater the rewards\u2014gold and glory for those quick enough to master the platforming elements.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3252940/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738123805","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3252940/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1738123805","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3252940/43bbd0d0edd5278b2319273acac39b7518450e91/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738123805","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3252940/43bbd0d0edd5278b2319273acac39b7518450e91/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738123805","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Supported","id":53},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Step into the crumbling remains of TradieCraft in tool trials, a rogue-lite platformer that fuses fitness with fast-paced gameplay.
