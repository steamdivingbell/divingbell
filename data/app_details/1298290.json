{"about_the_game":"<strong>Shikon-X Astro Defense Fortress</strong> is a mix between a graphic adventure game and all the classic arcade shoot 'em ups you love from the 80s and 90s.<br>You play as Major Daaia, the only pilot in the federation who can handle <strong>Shikon-X</strong> \u2014a ship with advanced defense capabilities which can also transform into attack mode when needed!<br><br>Earth scientists have mastered the secrets of space energy gathering, and collected vast amounts of energy into what they call &quot;<strong>Life Capsules</strong>&quot; that form floating clusters orbiting the planet. <br><br>The world has been at peace for decades, but a small guerrilla from planet Rolar has been destroying our <strong>Life Capsules</strong>, and your mission is to defend our energy source from those terrorists!<br><br><strong>Shikon-X</strong>'s story unfolds in different ways. The game starts as a graphic adventure where you can chat with your fellow soldiers and solve puzzles to advance the plot. You'll move into an arcade phase that starts similar to <i>Breakout/Arkanoid</i>, bouncing attacks with your ship's body in defense mode, and that'll quickly turn into a shoot 'em up section like <i>Galaga/Space Invaders</i> with wall to wall arcade action. During those arcade sections the story will keep unfolding, so keep your eye into <strong>Shikon-X</strong>'s communication screens to get all the scoop!<br><br>Back in the mothership you'll be able to continue the story, and even play other mini-games like the <strong>Bounty Hunter Baby from Space Pinball</strong> and other games to be added later!<br><br>Every chapter will add more mini-games and more story beats, and they'll all be added to the main game \u2014no DLC or extra things to buy!<br><br>This free demo will only let you play Chapter 1 and the pinball mini game, enjoy!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1298290/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1661522700","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1298290/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1661522700","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1298290/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1661522700","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1298290/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1661522700","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>Shikon-X Astro Defense Fortress</strong> is a mix between a graphic adventure game and all the classic arcade shoot 'em ups you love from the 80s and 90s.<br>You play as Major Daaia, the only pilot in the federation who can handle <strong>Shikon-X</strong> \u2014a ship with advanced defense capabilities which can also transform into attack mode when needed!<br><br>Earth scientists have mastered the secrets of space energy gathering, and collected vast amounts of energy into what they call &quot;<strong>Life Capsules</strong>&quot; that form floating clusters orbiting the planet. <br><br>The world has been at peace for decades, but a small guerrilla from planet Rolar has been destroying our <strong>Life Capsules</strong>, and your mission is to defend our energy source from those terrorists!<br><br><strong>Shikon-X</strong>'s story unfolds in different ways.
