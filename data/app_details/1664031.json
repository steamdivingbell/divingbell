Heavily influenced by the Gypsy scene, Django Reinhardt and the sophisticated orchestrations of 1940s jazz, Caravan Palace fuses this with elements of future bass, trap, deep house and African house.  Their resulting sound is a blend of past and future that is \u201cjoyfully nostalgic\u201d.  Be sure to put on your dancing shoes for some of their best known, high energy hits such as \u201cLone Digger\u201d and \u201cRock it For Me\u201d, hugely influential for the electro-swing genre which they helped define, and finish the night with the dreamy, optimistic pop chaser of \u201cMiracle\u201d.<br><br>Also included in this pack is another unique Synth Riders Experience, and this time we\u2019re taking you on a trip to Caravan Palace\u2019s \u201cWonderland\u201d!
