{"about_the_game":"Development of the Fw-190 D-9 started in 1942 as a high-altitude interceptor to counter the Allied air threat on the Western front. The \u2018Dora\u2019 as it was known, included many cutting-edge technologies of the time. Its elongated nose housed the high-altitude liquid cooled Jumo 213\u0410-1 engine equipped with MW-50 water-methanol injection system that enabled it to develop power up to 2100 HP. The armament consisted of two 13mm MG131 machine guns in the nose and two 20mm MG 151/20 cannons in the wing root. It started to appear above the front lines during Autumn 1944 and although it got a cold initial reception from the German pilots, it later earned their trust and is considered to be the best German piston-powered fighter of the late war period. The Dora would often be used to protect Me-262 jets during their vulnerable landing phase. Allied pilots would try to down the hapless jets as they were low on fuel and trying to land.<br><br>In addition to Quick Mission Builder and Multiplayer modes, you can fly it in Career mode during <strong>Battle of Bodenplatte</strong> timeframe.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1198461/extras/190d9.png?t=1734533752\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Default armament: two 20mm guns &quot;MG 151/20&quot;, 250 rounds, 700 rounds per minute, and two 13mm machine guns &quot;MG 131&quot;, 475 rounds, 900 rounds per minute.<br></li><li>Length: 10.2 m<br></li><li>Wingspan: 10.51 m<br></li><li>Wing surface: 18.3 m\u00b2</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Modifications</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Two WGr.21 rockets in jettisonable launchers (258 kg weight increase with launchers, 58 kph speed loss, 12 kph speed loss after launch, 1 kph speed loss after jettison)<br></li><li>Bubble Canopy (3 kg weight increase, minor speed loss)<br></li><li>EZ42 Gyro Gunsight (3 kg weight increase)<br></li><li>26 x 55 mm High Explosive unguided rockets R4M (107 kg weight increase with racks, 24 kph speed loss, 14 kph speed loss after launch)<br></li><li>4 x 66 kg fragmentation bombs SD 70 (324 kg weight increase with holders, 61 kph speed loss, 13 kph speed loss after drop)<br></li><li>249 kg General Purpose Bomb SC 250 (279 kg weight increase with holders, 31 kph speed loss, 6 kph speed loss after drop)<br></li><li>500 kg General Purpose Bomb SC 500 (530 kg weight increase with holders, 35 kph speed loss, 6 kph speed loss after drop)</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Skins</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Standard pattern.<br></li><li>Lt.

The airplane is equipped with bendable trim tabs that can be set pre-flight by ground personnel.<br></li><li>The aircraft has a manually controlled horizontal stabilizer which is electrically-actuated. It should be set to +1.5\u00b0 before takeoff and landing. Also, it may be used to trim the flight stick during the flight. In a deep dive, the stabilizer should be set so that the pilot must push the flight stick forward to maintain the dive angle.<br></li><li>The aircraft has electrically-actuated landing flaps with three fixed positions: retracted, takeoff (13\u00b0) and landing (58\u00b0). Flaps control buttons are located on the left panel near the throttle. The flap angle may be checked by indicators on the left and right wing outside the cockpit.<br></li><li>The aircraft has a tailwheel lock system that locks the tail wheel if the flight-stick is pulled backward. The tailwheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance, before takeoff and after touchdown upon landing.<br></li><li>The aircraft has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls.
