{"about_the_game":"<strong>About Dice</strong><br><br>Real name Hans Insel, Dice eschews the typical weapons of choice for a ping pong paddle that he wields with uncanny force. He appears distant at times, but can be intensely concentrated whenever he feels the need.

Now, the Sewage Facility doesn't just contain simple waste water. Full of unspeakable toxins and experimental bacteria, Dice soon lost consciousness. Some time passed and in a stroke of luck, Latch detected his lifeless body on his Robo-Sub's sonar. While in Latch's care, Dice bandaged his own diseased skin and quickly fled into the darkness as if possessed by some primal instinct. He was spotted destroying his long time rival Doombox in a match not long after.<br><br><strong>Contents</strong><br><br>- The Late Stage Illmatic colorway. An ancient Egyptian inspired design with a streetwear twist, blue skin and gold accents.<br>- The Lethal Infection colorway. The alternate 'cursed' version with maroon bandages, and even more gold.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1244880/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1601629576","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1244880/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1601629576","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1244880/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1601629576","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1244880/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1601629576","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>About Dice</strong><br><br>Real name Hans Insel, Dice eschews the typical weapons of choice for a ping pong paddle that he wields with uncanny force.
