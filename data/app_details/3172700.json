Depending on the stats given to them they'll each have unique choices in dialogue with NPCs and amongst each other as they bond over the course of the journey. You're assigned a pack-boro for your mission, who can carry a boat as well as extra items you pick up along the way, and together you all can hike and portage around the Invimona rivers and sea. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Visit towns for clues and to stock your party with unique items. As a guard you will be asked for assistance as you meet various farmers, scribes, artisans and even Gadaars among the holds. In the five years since the island was settled, grave robbers have flocked to Invimona like vultures, and ensuring they find their way to Exile Island is a constant battle.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There is no auto-compass or quest logs for you in Banquet for Fools, though many quests and requests are given to you in scrolls.

Guards and merchants follow patrols and sleep schedules, so keeping tabs on your surroundings and waiting for the changing of the guard is a ripe opportunity.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Committing crimes will accrue a price on your head, and the Vollings of the villages will treat you accordingly.

Stuck on an island with Padurii children hiding in every tree and low on explosive elyxirs? Having a field kit in your inventory allows a party to re-supply while away from shops during hikes across the island. The field kit allows you to assemble ammunition for three types of categories: arrows, darts, and elyxirs.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Arrows come from finding wood pieces and various types of arrow heads from wildlife, poisonous darts are crafted from noxious and volatile foliage in crevices, and you can convert amphoras of alcohol from healing items into explosive elyxirs with various added effects.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Guard Duties</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3172700/extras/Chatting_fellow_Guards.gif?t=1736351595\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Pavura requests that instead of being executed, criminals be shipped off to a husk of a rock just north of his garrison which the locals call Exile Island. The local ghost population is haunting enough, and the ethereal grave keepers of the Carrion god would want nothing more than to add to this assembly.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can choose on the fly if your party is attacking to kill or stun, the consequence of which is yours to decide. Killing hostile combatants is less risky, but they could be resurrected into ghosts if a keeper is near. Stunning will knock out your enemy for 24 hours, and if that enemy is a bandit or grave robber, you can report them for coins in your purse, though Exile Island will get more populated with each turn-in. Stunned criminals will only stay stunned for so long, and you\u2019ll need to reach a local fort or village to tell another guard to send a wagon and pick up your purse.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The list of criminal acts is something worth keeping in mind before exacting justice, and your characters need to bear witness, otherwise unless your characters have proof of the crime they\u2019ll be the ones committing it when assaulting.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Farmsteads and holdings from various other Houses from Minorev have settled the island under the Pavura's governance, and will have various problems that they wish someone would help them deal with. As a guard you\u2019ll find quests and duties within to attend to. Your relationship with towns is unique to each, and if the reeve commends you it could come with fine rewards. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combat</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Banquet for Fools features pausable real-time combat. When your action bar fills, you can pause the game by opening your combat dome, and choose an action and/or target within the dome. Play as one companion at a time, but switch between them at will. The others will press on with whatever tactics you've given to them in your formation menu.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If enemy combatants are too heavily defended, use a critical attack to weaken that enemy for follow up attacks for your companions, or add your attack rolls together when you unlock Rally attacks during combat to strike simultaneously!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game is being created by two people.

Ruleset numbers and item numbers will certainly change over time as we fine tune everything. Due to the unique nature of creating custom spells, if spell effects have major changes you won\u2019t be able to make a similar spell again, but your existing custom spells will still be able to be used throughout your session.
