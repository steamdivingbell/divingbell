{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>ANTD\u00a0</strong>is a tower defense game where you\u2019ll defend your picnic set against waves of relentless ants. Unlike most games in the genre, <strong>ANTD</strong> stands out by having no predefined routes. Instead, players must create their own intricate layers of defense to guide enemies strategically.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your arsenal includes plastic cups with straws that shoot seeds as towers, and walls made of various types of bread. The ultimate prize for the ants is your cake, and it\u2019s up to you to protect it at all costs. You can even use small candies as bait to distract the ants and buy yourself some time.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each session offers small upgrades to help you survive additional waves, and achievements unlock cosmetics to customize your picnic set. <br><br><strong>Get to know a few of the mechanics below:</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Ants:</strong> These pesky enemies are determined to raid your picnic set! They\u2019ll follow the shortest path to the cake unless distracted by baits or blocked entirely. If their path is fully obstructed, they\u2019ll relentlessly destroy anything in their way to forge a new route.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Towers:</strong> Your primary defense against the ants. Towers shoot seeds and can be upgraded to use different types of seeds with unique properties. For example, strawberry seeds are small and fast, while watermelon seeds are large and can hit multiple ants at once.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Walls:</strong> Use various types of bread to build walls. Walls are ideal for constructing paths because they\u2019re cheaper and sturdier than towers, providing strategic options to funnel the ants.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Baits:</strong> Ants can\u2019t resist sweet treats like cherries, sugar cubes, or even &quot;buti\u00e1&quot; (a small, sweet orange fruit native to South America). When ants pass near these baits, they\u2019ll stop to eat before continuing their march toward the cake.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Nests:</strong> These spawn the ants and can multiply after each wave. Be careful not to let the nests overwhelm you, but remember that more nests mean more resources to collect. Find a balance between destroying nests with your towers and leaving enough to farm resources by defeating their troops.</p></li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3373970/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734027028","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3373970/page.bg.jpg?t=1734027028","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3373970/d86667cff8b6a9da9169a081328d1427a434567e/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734027028","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3373970/d86667cff8b6a9da9169a081328d1427a434567e/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734027028","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>ANTD\u00a0</strong>is a tower defense game where you\u2019ll defend your picnic set against waves of relentless ants.
