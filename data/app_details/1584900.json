{"about_the_game":"Become the greatest of the goblin merchants in a magical market beneath Victorian London that trades in memories, wishes, secrets, and more. Will you line your pockets, defend the Queen, or plot to put a puppet on the Throne?<br><br><i>Faerie\u2019s Bargain: The Price of Business </i>is a 291,000-word interactive fantasy novel by Trip Galey where your choices control the story. It\u2019s entirely text-based\u2014without graphics or sound effects\u2014and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.<br><br>You are a merchant of the Untermarkt, the goblin market that has existed beneath London since High Queen Elizabeth first forged the Treaty with Titania, Queen of Faery. You are skilled in dealing in all manner of impossibilities: new faces and voices, silks spun of starlight, bottled time, twists of fate, and other stranger things. Devote yourself to growing your wealth, or use it for political, social, and magical advantage. If a rival merchant threatens you, fight back with wits and wisdom, or ruthless, underhanded tricks. It\u2019s all in a day\u2019s work.<br><br>When a mysterious business opportunity takes you by surprise, you have the chance to deal in something new: political intrigue! High Queen Victoria sits upon the Throne, but there are many who would prefer to rule in her place. Do you defend the status quo or use your newfound wealth to fund a little revolution? Your fellow merchants certainly won\u2019t allow an opportunity for profit to slip away. Do you undercut their efforts at the Merchant Conclave, or ignore all the politicking in favor of growing your wealth?
