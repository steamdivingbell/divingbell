Survive in an unforgiving open world, where every building is accessible. Forge a deadly team with friends and claim what's not yours. Take your loot to your safe bunker to craft better gear.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ENGAGE MASSES OF PLAYERS AND ZOMBIES</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2082980/extras/MMORPG_with_Zombies.jpg?t=1733922114\" /><br>Join forces with other survivors to keep the zombies at bay and take on mutated bosses in a sprawling open world. Beware of other players eager to relieve you of your hard-earned loot on your way to safety. Form a guild and defend strategically important nodes on the map to amass rare resources much faster. Survive in a living world full of the undead!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WIELD FIREARMS AND MELEE WEAPONS</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2082980/extras/Gunplay.jpg?t=1733922114\" /><br>Unlike in your typical MMORPG, waving a wand does nothing for you in Persist Online. Instead you can choose from a variety of firearms. As much fun as blasting away is, be aware that zombies and mutants are drawn to loud noise. So, swinging a humble frying pan, could result in you being less dead. Which is a good thing in a zombie apocalypse.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EXPERIENCE A TRUE HARDCORE GAME</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2082980/extras/HardcoreGame.jpg?t=1733922114\" /><br>The company behind Persist Online runs one of the longest surviving MMORPGs ever, the 1997-released Tibia, of course their new survival MMORPG is a tough old-school experience.

Or you could craft a shotgun from scratch and continuously improve it until you're wielding the best freaking shotgun in the game. To obtain the necessary resources, you naturally have to fight your way through hordes of zombies again.

Investing all your hard-earned points into the fishing skill tree not only lets you fish more efficiently, your fishing net can also paralyze your enemies, giving the hammer-swinging player killer on your team the perfect opportunity to strike. It's like shooting fish in a barrel!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PERSIST IN A DYNAMIC OPEN WORLD</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2082980/extras/OpenWorld.png?t=1733922114\" /><br>Explore an open world that's not only big, but big on details. Every building can be entered - but might become a deadly trap. As the post-apocalypse isn't all sunny days, there's a dynamic weather system as well as an impactful day and night cycle. Nothing is stopping you from riding into the sunset - except for everything in the world that wants to kill you.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2082980/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733922114","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2082980/page.bg.jpg?t=1733922114","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2082980/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733922114","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2082980/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733922114","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>JOIN OUR DISCORD!</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2082980/extras/discord.jpg?t=1733922114\" /></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SOME SURVIVE.
