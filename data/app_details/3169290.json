{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3169290/extras/TopOfDescription.png?t=1727175625\" /><br>Prepare your hair to attack, smack and knock back anyone who dares oppose you in Beardbarians! Pick from a colourful cast of characters and stunning stages to duke it out with friends or CPUs in the 2-4 player battle mode, or work together to protect your gem from the greedy goblins by upgrading your abilities along the way in the tower defence mode!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Beards</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3169290/extras/beards.gif?t=1727175625\" /><br>Each character can use their beard to <strong>attack</strong>, <strong>block</strong> and <strong>grab</strong>. Attacks can be aimed in any direction and charged for extra power. Blocking can be used to mitigate any damage, but block too much and it'll destroy your beard, leaving you defenceless for a few seconds. Grabbing (while having less range than attacking) can also be aimed in any direction and ignores blocking from opponents. Grabbing onto them will let you carry them around and throw them away. This combat system works like <strong>rock paper scissors</strong> where grab beats block, block beats attack and attack beats grab. <strong>Beard-based combat</strong> will grow on you, we promise! Additionally, you can fight alongside an ally in <strong>team battles</strong>, so maybe get your friend who\u2019s a little too good at fighting games to carry you to victory!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Abilities</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3169290/extras/abilities.gif?t=1727175625\" /><br>Outside of beard shenanigans, every character can perform your typical <strong>run</strong>, <strong>jump</strong> and <strong>double jump</strong>, but can also <strong>dash</strong>, <strong>wall jump</strong>, and use 6 <strong>character-specific abilities</strong>! These are the key to defeating your opponents, and looking awesome while doing so.<br>Each character has 6 abilities:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Neutral Ability</strong> (not holding a direction)<br></li><li><strong>Side Ability</strong> (holding left or right)<br></li><li><strong>Up Ability</strong> (holding up)<br></li><li><strong>Down Ability</strong> (holding down)<br></li><li><strong>Block Ability</strong> (whilst blocking)<br></li><li><strong>Recovery Ability</strong> (different button)</li></ul><br>The <strong>block ability</strong> is a primarily defensive move, and the <strong>recovery ability</strong> is designed for height and distance, perfect to get yourself back on solid ground! Don\u2019t worry if this all seems overwhelming as there is a <strong>replayable tutorial</strong> to show you the ropes, featuring our favourite teacher, Dummy! Every character\u2019s moveset is <strong>uniquely crafted</strong>, so you\u2019ll want to learn how they all work to stay on top!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Characters</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3169290/extras/Dave.gif?t=1727175625\" /><br><strong>Dave</strong> has a very simple life, he fights for money to fund his gardening hobby. The food he grows enables him to be a vegetarian that eats meat. He loves his pet rock. Dave is a jack-of-all-trades with no glaring strengths or weaknesses who primarily attacks with his shield.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3169290/extras/Transister.gif?t=1727175625\" /><br>With a hobby for the classic arcade machines (Pac-dude and atmosphere invaders), <strong>Transister</strong> often needs to repair the frail wiring. During a fix, a minor shock from an arcade machine caused her to be given the ability to conduct electricity and use it to attack people. Transister gets value from her extensive combos and lightning-fast mobility, but is very light and short-ranged.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3169290/extras/Stache.gif?t=1727175625\" /><br>A true veteran of the ring, <strong>The Moustached Muscle</strong> is the most famous fighter in the country and a champion for many years. He can struggle to get close to his opponents, but the moment he does, they won\u2019t make it out without at least a couple of bruises, especially if he manages to grab and throw them!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3169290/extras/Carla.gif?t=1727175625\" /><br><strong>Carla</strong> liked to go camping, now with her skills honed in from years of hunting lunch from other people's tents, she is very good at hitting a stationary target. What about a moving target you ask? Well they never did that in practice. Carla does best at medium to long ranges, depending on how good her accuracy is, being able to keep opponents at bay with her quick projectiles, though she might have to get up close and personal to score the kill.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3169290/extras/Goaty.gif?t=1727175625\" /><br><strong>Goaty</strong> is quite simple, she is a goat. Probably has underlying anger issues but still a goat. She\u2019s also a speed-demon on the battlefield with devastatingly powerful attacks. However, she will have to recharge her stamina if she goes too crazy.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3169290/extras/Alakaspam.gif?t=1727175625\" /><br>After years of studying magic, <strong>Alakaspam</strong> has perfected one spell, FIREBALL. A true universal spell. Thief? FIREBALL. Family gathering? FIREBALL. Taxes? FIREBALL. Sure it\u2019s not perfect but no-one is brave enough to complain. Speaking of, FIREBALLS are the key to winning with this character, alongside his other projectiles. Creating a barrage of spells for your opponent to avoid will destroy them, granted you actually hit them.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3169290/extras/Brawny.gif?t=1727175625\" /><br><strong>Captain Brawnybeard</strong> is a traditional pirate; he has a boat despite not being able to pilot it. He has some help from his lover and the old owner of the ship - <strong>Shavey Jones</strong> - who still occupies the cabin as a ghost. Teamwork makes the dream work as the optimal way to play this character is to control space with a collection of treacherous traps and powerful, but risky, bursts of speed.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3169290/extras/Trim.gif?t=1727175625\" /><br>An unknown being, similar to an eldritch horror, has changed their form to participate in their favourite competitive sport. To make it fair, <strong>Trim Reaper</strong> has taken on this persona and will still use some of their weaker godly powers to best their foes. Using a combination of their trusty scythe and unearthly powers, swat opponents away with their superb range.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3169290/extras/Kami.gif?t=1727175625\" /><br><strong>Kami</strong>\u2019s wealthy parents always wanted to give him what he wanted, so when he asked for his first set of gear, they had to give in. Until he lost his first match, Kami had never been told &quot;no&quot; or denied anything so he was understandably rageful. His entire game plan revolves around deception. Sneak up on your opponent, approach from different angles and mix up your timing in order to start powerful combos.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3169290/extras/Beardhoven.gif?t=1727175625\" /><br>When <strong>Beardhoven</strong> began his career as a songwriter, he discovered that his songs could attack anyone who hears them, he thought that the cause could be... the songs were awful. He soon realised that his songs were in fact masterpieces when his mum reassured him over the phone, no-one knows what his dad was laughing at while this was happening. Beardhoven\u2019s musical projectiles are tricky as he has the ability to manipulate their speed by adjusting his tempo and smacking them with his lute. Overwhelming opponents with this sheer versatility is the key to victory, and more than makes up for his sluggish mobility.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3169290/extras/Stalagmight.gif?t=1727175625\" /><br>Once a meteorite, <strong>Stalagmight</strong> is now a &quot;normal&quot; rock that somehow fights better than a slightly larger rock! Being a rock naturally comes with limitations, namely being slow and almost helpless when there\u2019s no ground to support, but to compensate is VERY heavy and can\u2026 manipulate giant meteors and cause global earthquakes? Should this be allowed?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Stages</h2>What\u2019s a beard-based-battle without an epic location to sell the intensity? Run around a <strong>variety of stages</strong> to initiate or avoid conflict, or if you\u2019re lucky, pick up an item to give yourself a boost (don\u2019t worry, they can be turned off, for all of those more serious matches to take place).<br>From <strong>wrestling arenas</strong>...<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3169290/extras/wrestling_arena.gif?t=1727175625\" /><br>...to <strong>outer space</strong>...<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3169290/extras/outer_space.gif?t=1727175625\" /><br>...and even a <strong>giant arcade cabinet</strong>!<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3169290/extras/arcade_cabinet.gif?t=1727175625\" /><br>Every fight will feel just as fresh and exciting as the last! For the more serious players in the crowd, don\u2019t fret! We have 5 <strong>basic layouts</strong> to allow for unimpeded tests of skill.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3169290/extras/basicstages.png?t=1727175625\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Protect the Gem</h2>Tired of fighting each other? In the <strong>\u201cProtect the gem\u201d</strong> mode you can face off against waves of goblins alone or with a friend. Unlock <strong>upgrades</strong> as you go to increase your strength or alter the battlefield to your advantage, but watch out, goblins get upgrades too, and they don\u2019t play it fair! Rise to the top of the ranks on the <strong>global leaderboard</strong>, how long can you hold out?<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3169290/extras/PTG.gif?t=1727175625\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Online</h2>Play matches <strong>online</strong> with Quickplay or private lobbies, letting you play with people <strong>around the world</strong> or have a <strong>private match</strong> with your friends! <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3169290/extras/online.gif?t=1727175625\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Beard Charms</h2>Spice up your fashionable facial hair with some stylish beard charms, unlocked via <strong>in-game achievements</strong>.
