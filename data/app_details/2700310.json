This EULA may not be modified except in writing, signed by both parties. If a court of competent jurisdiction declares any provision of this EULA to be void or unenforceable, then such provision will be interpreted, construed or reformed to the extent reasonably required to render it valid, enforceable and consistent with the original intent underlying such provision, and such invalidity or unenforceability will not affect any other provision of this EULA. The English language version of this EULA will control its interpretation.<br />\r\n10.\tGENERAL STUFF. Your local law may give you rights that this EULA cannot change; if so, this EULA applies as far as the law allows. We may change this EULA from time to time, if we have reason to, such as changes to our games, our practices, or our legal obligation. But those changes will be effective only to the extent that they can legally apply. In that case we'll inform you of the change before it takes effect, either by posting a notice on our website or by other reasonable means. We're not going to be unfair about this though - but sometimes the law changes or someone does something that affects other users of the game and we therefore need to put a lid on it. If you come to us with a suggestion for Anti-Extinction, that suggestion is made for free and we have no obligation to accept or consider it. This means we can use or not use your suggestion in any way we want and we don't have to pay you for it. If you think you have a suggestion that we would be willing to pay you for, please do not tell us your suggestion unless you have first told us you want to be paid and we have responded in writing by asking you to submit the suggestion. If you want to notify us that you believe someone is infringing your intellectual property on our Services, please submit your notice here. If appropriate, we may terminate the accounts of users who are repeat infringers. We reserve the right to take down any content in our discretion.<br />\r\n11.\tOUR VALUES. The spirit of inclusion lives in our values, which are key to sustaining a vibrant and welcoming community. Anti-Extinction is for everyone. Diversity powers our community. Playing with others should be safe and inclusive. Hate has no place here. Anti-Extinction is available in countries all over the world, and it\u2019s important that our platform feels safe and inclusive for people of all backgrounds. Every player in the Anti-Extinction community deserves a place to be their authentic selves and to build, craft, create, and express themselves in an environment that is inclusive to all. We aspire to be a community where Anti-Extinction can be enjoyed by all. The Anti-Extinction community is yours but it\u2019s everyone else\u2019s too. When you express your opinions, please do so politely and respectfully. Don\u2019t blow up like a creeper! To keep the Anti-Extinction community welcoming and inclusive for everyone, we have a zero-tolerance policy towards hate speech, terrorist or violent extremist content, bullying, harassment, sexual solicitation, fraud, or threats against others. The modifications, custom skins (textures), structures, in-game assets, and other content you create in Anti-Extinction can be a great way to showcase what\u2019s meaningful to you and express your creativity. Whether you're building intricate bases, crafting unique weapons, customizing characters, or designing complex automation systems, ensure that all content adheres to community standards. Content that portrays hate, extreme bias, or encourages illegal activity is strictly prohibited. The world of Anti-Extinction is built by players, for players. Whether you\u2019re constructing advanced facilities, strategizing with your team in combat missions, or exploring new territories, player safety is a priority for FURR-TEC STUDIOS to ensure everyone feels secure and supported while contributing in their own way. We reserve the right to suspend or permanently ban anyone who violates these Community Standards or this EULA. To learn more about our moderation policies, how to report a player, and how to appeal an active enforcement action on your account, please visit our website.<br />\r\n12.\tWHAT YOU CAN AND CAN\u2019T DO WITH ANTI-EXTINCTION SOFTWARE AND CONTENT. When you buy our games, that means you can download, install, and play them. However, you must not distribute anything we've made unless we specifically agree to it. By \"distribute anything we've made\" what we mean is:<br />\r\n\u2022\tGive copies of our game software or content to anyone else;<br />\r\n\u2022\tMake commercial use of anything we've made;<br />\r\n\u2022\tTry to make money from anything we've made; or<br />\r\n\u2022\tLet other people get access to anything we've made in a way that is unfair or unreasonable.<br />\r\nAnd so that we are crystal clear, \"the game\" or \"what we have made\" includes, but is not limited to, the Services, plus any other games we might publish in the future. It also includes updates, patches, downloadable or Marketplace content, add-ons, or modified versions of a game, part of those things, merchandise, audio-visual content, or anything else we've made. Otherwise, we are quite relaxed about what you do - in fact, we really encourage you to do cool stuff - but just don't do those things that we say you can't. We\u2019ve put together detailed Anti-Extinction Usage Guidelines as to how you can or cannot do things using what we\u2019ve made, including screenshots and recorded videos of our games. These Anti-Extinction Usage Guidelines are extra permissions that we give to the community to encourage creativity and community, but we reserve the right to change them or withdraw permissions, especially if we see people exploiting or abusing these permissions. The Anti-Extinction Usage Guidelines often change, and we have the right to withdraw the permissions given in them at any time without notice.<br />\r\n13.\tUSING MODS. If you've bought Anti-Extinction, you may play around with it and modify it by adding modifications, tools, or plugins, which we will refer to collectively as \"Mods.\" By \"Mods,\" we mean something original that you or someone else created that doesn't contain a substantial part of our copyrightable code or content. When you combine your Mod with Anti-Extinction, we will call that combination a \"Modded Version\" of the game. We have the final say on what constitutes a Mod and what doesn't. You may not distribute any Modded Versions of our game or software, and we\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\u2019t use Mods for griefing. Basically, Mods are okay to distribute; hacked versions or Modded Versions of the game client or server software are not okay to distribute. Any Mods you create for Anti-Extinction from scratch belong to you (including pre-run Mods and in-memory Mods) and you can do whatever you want with them, as long as you don't sell them for money or try to make money from them and so long as you don\u2019t distribute Modded Versions of the game. Remember that a Mod means something that is your original work and that does not contain a substantial part of our code or content. You only own what you created; you do not own our code or content. When we update our games, some changes might not work well with other software, such as Mods. This is unfortunate, but it is something we don\u2019t take responsibility for. If that is the case, try running an older version.<br />\r\n14.\tHARDWARE DISCLAIMER<br />\r\n14.1 No Responsibility for Hardware Damages. FURR-TEC STUDIOS LLC. (hereinafter \"FURR-TEC STUDIOS\") SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY HARDWARE-RELATED DAMAGES THAT MAY ARISE FROM THE USE OF THE GAME, \"ANTI-EXTINCTION.\" THIS INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES CAUSED BY PRE-EXISTING HARDWARE ISSUES, MANUFACTURING DEFECTS, USER-INSTALLED HARDWARE, INADEQUATE COOLING, OR POOR AIRFLOW.<br />\r\n14.2 Pre-Existing Conditions. USERS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ISSUES SUCH AS MANUFACTURING DEFECTS, HARDWARE INSTALLED BY USERS, AND IMPROPER SYSTEM MAINTENANCE OR SETUP ARE NOT CAUSED BY THE GAME OR FURR-TEC STUDIOS. USERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THEIR SYSTEMS MEET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS AND MAINTAINING PROPER HARDWARE CONDITIONS.<br />\r\n14.3 Self-Assembled and Prebuilt Systems. WHETHER YOUR COMPUTER WAS SELF-ASSEMBLED OR ASSEMBLED BY A THIRD-PARTY COMPANY (PREBUILT), FURR-TEC STUDIOS IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY HARDWARE FAILURES OR DAMAGES THAT OCCUR DURING OR AS A RESULT OF PLAYING THE GAME.<br />\r\n14.4 Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL FURR-TEC STUDIOS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, OR DAMAGE TO HARDWARE, EVEN IF FURR-TEC STUDIOS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br />\r\n14.5 User Responsibility. USERS AGREE TO OPERATE AND MAINTAIN THEIR HARDWARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH MANUFACTURER GUIDELINES AND INDUSTRY STANDARDS. FURR-TEC STUDIOS RECOMMENDS REGULAR SYSTEM MAINTENANCE, INCLUDING CLEANING AND COOLING MONITORING, TO PREVENT OVERHEATING AND HARDWARE FAILURE.<br />\r\n14.6 No Warranty. FURR-TEC STUDIOS DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE GAME WILL BE FREE FROM ERRORS OR INTERRUPTIONS, OR THAT IT WILL BE COMPATIBLE WITH ALL HARDWARE CONFIGURATIONS. USERS ASSUME ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INSTALLATION AND USE OF THE GAME ON THEIR HARDWARE.<br />\r\n15.\tIn order to ensure the integrity of our games, we need all game downloads and updates to come from a source that we authorize. It's also important for us that third-party tools/services don't seem \"official\" as we can't guarantee their quality. It's part of the responsibility we have to the customers of Anti-Extinction. Make sure that you read through our Anti-Extinction Usage Guidelines too, as we may take down Mods or other software that violate our Anti-Extinction Usage Guidelines.<br />\r\n16.\tCONTENT Your content remains your content, and that applies to Anti-Extinction. We don't own the original stuff that you create. We will, however, own things that are copies (or substantial copies) or derivatives of our property and creations - but if you create original things, they aren't ours. So, as an example:<br />\r\n\u2022\tA single Anti-Extinction block (including its textures and its \u201clook and feel\u201d) - we own that;<br />\r\n\u2022\tYour creation of a Gothic Cathedral with a rollercoaster running through it - we don't own that.<br />\r\n17.\tGOVERNING LAW AND VENUE.
