This can usually be resolved by enabling VSync or adjusting other graphics settings in the game.<br></li><li> A few competitive games, such as Valorant, may block mouse and keyboard emulation from GameVRoom, but most games allow it. Some games that block mouse and keyboard may support gamepad emulation instead.<br></li><li> When hosting a multiplayer game, other players may hear their own voice getting streamed back to them along with the rest of the audio coming from the host.<br></li><li> Using Grip on the Valve Index controllers is very sensitive by default.
