{"about_the_game":"Dark Dragonkin is a RPG adventure in which the player alternates control a party of  characters, guiding each of them one at a time (though control may be swapped from character to character at any point) to the portal to exit the level.  Every level is designed such that each party member must contribute unique skills to help the party through to the portal. All three characters must reach the exit portal to complete the level. Each party member has hit points which they can lose by getting hurt by enemies or obstacles in the dungeon. Should any party member run out of hit points, they die; game-play will then continue with any remaining members, if the member can not be resurrected, the level will have to be restarted and try again.

By far the most durable.  She has more health and takes less damage than the others.  When using her shield she becomes nearly invincible.   When charging forward she can stun enemies and move heavy objects.<br></li><li><strong>Dante</strong>: He is melee DPS.  He can dispatch most enemies when he can attack from behind.  Stealth is his ally.  He also specializes in jumping great distances to avoid obstacles and get in the right position for the kill.<br></li><li><strong>Nova:</strong> He is a ranged caster.  He can dispatch many foes with a fireball at range.  He also can dispel magical wards as they descend into the depths of the dungeon.<br></li><li><strong>Evelina:</strong> No party is complete without a healer.
