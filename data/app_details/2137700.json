{"about_the_game":"The most ambitious I'm on Observation Duty game yet with six unique levels. Gameplay is familiar to those who have played the previous games. As an employee of a mysterious organization your job is to monitor live surveillance camera footage and spot anomalies. Anomalies range from furniture moving to otherwordly intrduers. File a report by clicking on the anomaly OR by choosing the right location and type of the anomaly from a menu to fix it. Anomalies appear at random so you never knows what is going to happen next. Too many active and unreported anomalies means death. Goal is to survive the entire night (from 00:00 to 06:00 in game time). You will need sharp eyes and good memory. The game contains psychological horror that mainly comes from making you paranoid about what has changed. The game is part of a series of popular &quot;spot the difference&quot; -type of horror games.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Classified","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2137700/5d0934ad5231d8949d38dcebd5a551e4e2f41506.jpg"},{"name":"No Diving Allowed","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2137700/e3406d78812de34a4bf8769b33fb2ebec618d833.jpg"},{"name":"Outpatient Treatment","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2137700/413f0991a4ee83353c3d4f947d7cf0c6e1cad531.jpg"},{"name":"Graduation Day","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2137700/5bea6847a5887b4966c167498f77b7f5e8408d39.jpg"},{"name":"Midnight Sun","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2137700/8b1708332786c60768364684ae97ad1dea429861.jpg"},{"name":"All Aboard!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2137700/31026b8abfa8ece48a5996ab98086acc995be50a.jpg"},{"name":"Checkout Time","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2137700/3c8cc049b86502e61fdedf0f2506c72bb52ae2b9.jpg"},{"name":"Oh, How You Have Grown!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2137700/0d6001cfbca48fc1cab585df74bfef1ce50656e9.jpg"},{"name":"You'll Learn","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2137700/7efa24850accf627b3d38a065835da7d16ff4779.jpg"},{"name":"This Might Hurt... a Lot","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2137700/c509e515e60406cfe0834e7353069153b47d7fbd.jpg"}],"total":26},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2137700?t=1729974232","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2137700/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1729974232","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2137700/a6c9ee490efa9827826d23bc47e6936f705720d3/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729974232","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2137700/a6c9ee490efa9827826d23bc47e6936f705720d3/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729974232","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"The game contains scary monsters and some corpses as well as some violence and blood.
