{"about_the_game":"Vicky Schmidt is an energetic dork who's always ready to help other people. <br />\r\nBrian Yu is... just Brian -- and we love him because of it! Such a chill dude.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou've probably known them for a long time, but only as avatars for players to control. <br />\r\nAnd yet... they're their own people too. They're fully fleshed-out characters with their own fears and dreams. <br />\r\nHaven't you ever wondered what they think and feel when they're not just playable characters? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis DLC turns the tables and brings these two beloved characters on as hitchhikers you can pick up during your road trip.<br />\r\nThanks to their conversations, road events, endings, and deep conversations, you might get to REALLY know them in whole new depths. <br />\r\nAlso... this DLC includes a brand new song.
