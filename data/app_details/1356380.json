{"about_the_game":"&quot;Swing! Swing as if your life depended on it! Or at least your score.&quot;<br><i>Some wise man, or something</i><br><br>One pendulum. One map. One goal. Nothing else should be needed to get you excited. ALTERNATIV Is there anything else you need to get excited? <br>In Pendelum, you cannot move on your own. Only gravity and external influences such as trampolines and fans can help you achieve your goal. Sometimes you\u2019ll need patience, sometimes you\u2019ll need concentration, and sometimes it\u2019s just trial and error - a new challenge is always just around the corner. But they all have one thing in common - at some point you\u2019ll reach your goal. Guaranteed. Probably. Maybe.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Goal</h2>Well, reach the goal! This green, glowing box somewhere on the map. That's it! Sounds easy, doesn't it?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Mechanics</h2>The basics are quite simple: Once your pendulum is released from its cage it's up to physics. Your only help is that you can fix both ends of your pendulum in any place at any time and independently of each other, so that only the other end can swing freely. You may - no - have to use this advantage to maneuver your pendulum through the world. Whether you\u2019re navigating, interacting or simply swinging around \u2013 this game will make you swing into action. <i>(ha - get it? Swing! Hahaha)</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Elements</h2>There are various interactive elements within the puzzles that will add a lot to your frustration:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Buttons</strong> and <strong>Laser Barriers</strong> trigger events.

We present: The <strong>Level Editor</strong>! <i>(editor... editor... tor... tor...)</i><br>Basically, you only need a spawn point and a goal surrounded by a bit of map to create a playable level.
