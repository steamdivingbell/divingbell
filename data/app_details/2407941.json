It was their first winter and their first memory, ending with the warm, feral breath of a young, hungry wolf. But the wolf took pity on the meager snack and brought it home to raise. <br><br>Pups shared their warmth eagerly, and elders shared their food generously.

Desperate and feral, they tore open the throat of the first creature they found and feasted ravenously.

The wolf-man ran fast on the strength of a hearty meal. <br><br>Weakened in heart but strong in flesh, the wolf-man retreated to the mountains, still hounded on all sides by their old, unyielding family.

And so it was that Iron Bark descended from the mountaintop, belly full and skin warmed by furs they did not have on the ascent.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2407941/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728556763","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2407941/page.bg.jpg?t=1728556763","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2407941/8c54bb819fc4d05863735a6e0f9eb6a4a5519277/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728556763","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2407941/8c54bb819fc4d05863735a6e0f9eb6a4a5519277/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728556763","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Remote Play on Tablet","id":42},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"DLC weapons"},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"This DLC contains one Hunter, two Weapons, and one Tool:<br><br>- Iron Bark (Hunter)<br>- Bonecutter (Rival 78)<br>- Hunter's Guide (LeMat)<br>- Traitor's Tooth (Knuckle Knife)<br><br><br><u><strong>Iron Bark</strong></u>\u00a0<br><br>Orphaned by winter, Iron Bark was raised by wolves as one of their own.
