{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Gods have fallen, Gyldenmist spreads.</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the wake of an epic war between gods and outer gods, all deities have fallen. Their blood has turned into the Gyldenmist, a corrosive force that sweeps across the land, warping the souls of the living and driving them to madness and monstrous mutations. Amidst the Gyldenmist, a few esilient humans cling to their sanity, seeking refuge in the last remnants of civilization. Yet, hope endures. From the shadows steps Dew, a mysterious girl with the power to resurrect fallen heroes and grant them immortal bodies. These reborn champions, known as Gylden Hunters, follow Dew into the heart of peril, battling Gyldenized creatures and harvesting Gyldenblod. Their mission is to mend the shattered Web of Fate and rekindle a spark of hope in a world on the brink of oblivion.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3282300/extras/01\u8bf8\u795e\u9668\u843d.gif?t=1732288579\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Swords and Sorcery, Action Combat</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Immerse yourself in dynamic third-person action where skillful aiming takes center stage.
