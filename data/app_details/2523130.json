Khorikos\u2019 primary focus is early sacred and new music which, coincidentally, melded perfectly with the philosophy behind Cantata. The group recorded a vocal arrangement of \u201cProphet\u2019s Organ\u201d by Galambos which then boomeranged back to me and led to the arrangement of a new work \u201cProphet\u2019s Lament\u201d.
