Rumbora Party Games lays it all on the line with their new title Tinker Racers, a top-down racer with an elimination edge. This proposition certainly keeps players on their toes, especially when threats stand in the way between you and victory. The AI is balanced just right, without coming across as brain dead or overly cheap. The environment can often be a bigger obstacle than the rival racers, but familiarity and memorization help a great deal \u2013 just like the best arcade racers on the market. Tinker Racers pint-sized racers put the pressure on with its elimination-based gameplay. Though this title favors crazy drifting over tight controls, those who can get a grip on its mechanics will have fun trouncing the competition.\u201d<br>75 \u2013 Gamers Heroes<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1234620/ss_99bf4cb117dc838815872330cb12ccac2aa6b0ba.1920x1080.jpg?t=1722524340","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1234620/ss_99bf4cb117dc838815872330cb12ccac2aa6b0ba.600x338.jpg?t=1722524340"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1234620/ss_0fcada36a89fa3124aa8f0aaa1de303d48a21ad7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1722524340","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1234620/ss_0fcada36a89fa3124aa8f0aaa1de303d48a21ad7.600x338.jpg?t=1722524340"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1234620/ss_06c26f5c0826520c816e57445ae6fc78b1974a7c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1722524340","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1234620/ss_06c26f5c0826520c816e57445ae6fc78b1974a7c.600x338.jpg?t=1722524340"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1234620/ss_0f52884ce5d386e5086903e8f9f71f4d4e5b8f71.1920x1080.jpg?t=1722524340","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1234620/ss_0f52884ce5d386e5086903e8f9f71f4d4e5b8f71.600x338.jpg?t=1722524340"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1234620/ss_3255c78c14c6ea73243eb6f18828947a915ad2bb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1722524340","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1234620/ss_3255c78c14c6ea73243eb6f18828947a915ad2bb.600x338.jpg?t=1722524340"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1234620/ss_1d572487d7e57c09d9d1929bf1275c034bc6ea84.1920x1080.jpg?t=1722524340","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1234620/ss_1d572487d7e57c09d9d1929bf1275c034bc6ea84.600x338.jpg?t=1722524340"}],"short_description":"Tinker Racers is a Survival Racing Party Game.
