{"about_the_game":"The relaxing, folksy music of Cozy Grove was created by cousins Jeremy Thal and Gideon Crevoshay. Gideon and Jeremy are the founding members of the post-americana band Briars of North America, and have spent many years working together leading the collaborative international music exchange OneBeat. Gideon, a vocalist, keyboard player, and composer, is currently a member of the renowned Meredith Monk Ensemble and performs with Bread and Puppet Theater. Jeremy, a french horn player, producer and multi-instrumentalist, was a touring member of Neutral Milk Hotel and the National. Gideon and Jeremy both find inspiration in music ranging from traditional to experimental, and from the sounds of the natural world. The first three (launch) tracks of the Cozy Grove soundtrack were also co-produced and mixed by Devin Greenwood at Honey Jar Studios in Brooklyn, NY.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1669810/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1666990994","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1669810/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1666990994","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1669810/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1666990994","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1669810/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1666990994","categories":[{"description":"Additional High-Quality Audio","id":50}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The relaxing, folksy music of Cozy Grove was created by cousins Jeremy Thal and Gideon Crevoshay.
