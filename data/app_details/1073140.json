{"about_the_game":"This is a game where strategic decision making can turn the tide from victory to defeat. You will  build your army, order movements, and execute attacks.

While controlling more territories will generate more resources, you may find yourself stretched too thin.

Each unit gains an advantage against specific units and has weaknesses against others. This means unit combinations play a critical role in the outcome of battles.
