So, I felt like I needed to include a construction area in the game. The new level of the game let's you explore a half-built floor of the office building, hunting targets around exposed beams, piles of bricks, and gapped scaffolding.\r\n-Collectibles: Flair\r\n      This game is very, very heavily inspired by Office Space and old stories from ANMA. I needed to do something with flair because that scene is too good to leave out, but too out of context to build into any gameplay. So, there are now 13(?) pieces of flair scattered throughout the game. If you see something, shoot something.\r\n-Mini Games: Shooting Gallery\r\n      I revamped the Warehouse for another mini-game, this time a shooting range. There are barriers set up with boxes, targets that flip up and down, all the good stuff. Test your speed and accuracy at the shooting range.\r\n\r\nFixes:\r\n-Doors are now more responsive, you can read about their history here.\r\n-Music is a hell of a lot lower. I watched some people stream my game and realized not everyone wants an office-based rave.\r\n\r\nThanks for playing.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Kill time at your call center night shift by shooting targets with a stapler, kicking doors, breaking photocopiers, popping balloons, guzzling coffee, stealing moon shoes, kicking your coworker's computers off a desk, and generally wrecking up the place.\r\n\r\nThe game is simple, get to the exit and shoot as many targets as possible on your way.
