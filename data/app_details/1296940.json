A turn has five phases:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> <strong>Charge</strong>: Launch your units in a thundering cavalcade towards the enemy. With this, bring your close-combat specialists in range, and prepare to punch through the enemy lines ! But beware, charges don't always succeed, sometimes the enemy is further away from anticipated, and standing alone in the middle of the no-man's land can leave your units at the mercy of enemy gunlines, or devastating counter-charges.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Movement</strong>: Place carefully your units like pawns on a chessboard, navigating terrain, enemy units, line of fire, spell range and so on... Plan your future charges and try to seize objectives with the tools your army bring to the field !<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1296940/extras/mvt.gif?t=1727947699\" /></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Magic</strong>: Let your magicians express their potential, and use their magic to turn the tides ! But be careful, as the enemy can try to damper your rituals...</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Shooting</strong>: Let the guns speak! after having placed your units, it's time to display the might of your technology ! or your numbers...

Now that your units are engaged in melee, true combat starts. After copious amounts of stomping around, and desperate attempts at keeping the line, what will the outcome be? Will your units stand firm against their foes ? will they run like cowards? Or, if the combat turns into your favour, will you be able to run down fleeing foes? Will your carefully crafted plan be thwarted in an instant? or Will a struck of luck give you a small hope for a distant victory ?
