Can you make enough words in time? Can you solve anagrams in the bonus rounds?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPaper Jam! puts you inside a bookshop, meeting a diverse range of customers in either a career mode - where you get to uncover the story of the robots - or in a quick game mode where you can climb your way up the global leaderboards.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you love word games, Paper Jam! may be a game you'll love to play as much as we loved making it!
