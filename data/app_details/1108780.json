{"about_the_game":"Save Ireland in THE PIRATE QUEEN! The Pirate Queen is an action slasher from Cyberfox Studios.

You will struggle to carve out a place to survive and thrive in an Ireland packed with feuding clans, and fight to unite Ireland against the threat of the British Empire. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PIRATE QUEEN features tons of different enemies and bosses that will require strategy and speed to beat, cutscenes giving you a taste of pirate life, and an endless mode to let you really push your sword fighting to the limit!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI created THE PIRATE QUEEN after being inspired and excited by Grace\u2019s tale.
