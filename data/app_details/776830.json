If you're reading this and trying to determine if it's worth spending a mere $.99 on, just get it for chrissakes. Chances are, you'll never forget it for the rest of your life.

Thank you. Thank you.\u201d<br>U.S.A Appstore User review 1<br><br>\u201cThis visual novel tries to move your heart by taking a cliche about never giving up and turning it into something more, something that pierces your heart.\u201d<br>U.S.A Appstore User review 2<br><br>\u201cA very touching visual novel.
