{"about_the_game":"&quot; <br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> <br>  D&amp;D Classics: X3 Curse of Xanathon (Basic)  </h2>   <br>  Something is rotten in Rhoona? When the grotesque god Cretia casts his ugly shadow over the town, strange things start happening. First, Duke Stephen vanishes. Then bizarre proclamations begin coming out the Ducal Palace - dwarves are outlawed, taxes must be paid in beer, horses must be ridden backwards. Soon the entire town is in an uproar, and a dwarven army is marching on Rhoona. This is the situation when you and your party of valiant adventurers arrive in the suffering town. There you find any number of oddities: <br> <ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li> A ragged beggar who prowls the streets offering cryptic advice; <br> </li><li> A mysterious black-garbed cleric planning treachery; <br> </li><li> A trusted soldier plotting his master's overthrow; and <br> </li><li> A sinister jewel casting its evil emanations over the town.  </li></ul>  You and your party are Rhoona's only hope. Only you can unravel the dark mystery that plagues the town and save Rhoona from the Curse of Xanathon.
