{"about_the_game":"Minikle\u2019s newest background pack focuses on forests and forest ruins that are perfect for creating a dungeon atmosphere outdoors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack is made up of 78 amazing images to help your players really imagine that they\u2019re deep in the woods or stumbling across a long-forgotten ruin. The backgrounds also come with a few variations to cover different weather patterns and times of day. Turn normally peaceful woods into a creepy dungeon by using the foggy night version, or show just how bad an idea it was to steal the temple\u2019s jewel but turning the sky an angry red that dyes all the plantlife purple.
