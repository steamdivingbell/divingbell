{"about_the_game":"Eighty 81 class locomotives were built by Clyde Engineering, Kelso between September 1982 and February 1986, to replace 1950s vintage 42 and 44 class locomotives as well as provide additional capacity. The first 42 were based at Broadmeadow Locomotive Depot to operate Hunter Valley coal trains, while the remaining 38 were mostly employed on the Main South line between Sydney and Albury, hauling both passenger and freight trains. The final 15 were equipped with V/Line radios and, from July 1986, operated through to Melbourne. The 81 class was an evolution of the Australian National AL class, and the V/Line G class and Australian National BL class were, in turn, developed from the 81 class.<br><br>In 1991, a further four units were built at Kelso, using many components from spares held. Following the delivery of the 90 class in 1994, the Broadmeadow-based units were released to replace older locomotives on other freight duties.
