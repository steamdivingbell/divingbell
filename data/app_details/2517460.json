On the way there, you will need to explore and traverse the island that is ahead of you. You will have to find new origami figurines, that you can shapeshift into and use their abilities in the level. While linear gameplay lasts about <strong>30 minutes</strong>, embark on a sweet and short journey to rescue your lost friend.
