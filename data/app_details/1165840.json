Brian tried very hard to find some trace of his father's disappearance in his life, but without success until one day, an unknown man kidnapped Brian and imprisoned him in his father's cabin deep in the woods in a barely accessible terrain. Brian's father used this cabin as a secret workshop in which he worked on all those things that required high secrecy.

He also doesn't remember how he found himself in the cabin. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1165840/extras/4-600x338.jpg?t=1735199255\" /><br><br>He didn`t know that the cabin was owned by his father.
