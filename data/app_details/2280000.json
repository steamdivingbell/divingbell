{"about_the_game":"This software is an educational demonstration of Natural Language Processing (NLP), an AI technology, as applied to the adventure game \u201cThe Portopia Serial Murder Case\u201d (created by Yuji Horii and first published in Japan in 1983). At the time of the game\u2019s original release, most adventure games were played using a \u201ccommand input\u201d system, where the player was asked to type in text to decide the actions of their character. Free text input systems like these allowed players to feel a great deal of freedom. However, they did come with one common source of frustration: players knowing what action they wanted to perform but being unable to do so because they could not find the right wording. This problem was caused by the limitations of PC performance and NLP technology of the time.<br>40 years have passed since then, and PC performance has drastically improved, as have the capabilities of NLP technology. Using \u201cThe Portopia Serial Murder Case\u201d as a test case, we\u2019d like to show you the capabilities of modern NLP and the impact it can have on adventure games, as well as deepen your understanding of NLP technologies.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h2>Natural Language Processing is a technology that allows computers to glean meaning from natural language\u2014the kind of language that we use in daily communication. Deep learning conducted on a large set of text data makes it possible for the system to understand complex text input (NLU) and to generate responses comparable to those written by human beings (NLG).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Natural Language Understanding (NLU)</h2>In order to interact with computers using natural language, the computer needs to understand what its human partner is trying to tell it, regardless of the wording they choose. Natural Language Understanding is an area of NLP research that aims to make computers correctly understand natural language, where the meaning can often be ambiguous. In this tech preview, NLU is used to help the junior detective understand the player's instructions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Speech To Text (STT) </h2>Speech-to-Text, or Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), makes it possible to convert voice input to written text. Using this technology, players can give instructions using their own voices rather than a keyboard. Please note that <u>a CUDA-capable GPU and a large amount of VRAM</u> are required for a satisfactory experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Natural Language Generation (NLG)</h2>Automatically generating natural text is one of the most important research topics in the NLP field. For example, research is underway on AI engines that can answer questions in place of human operators, as well as AI-powered chatbots, both of which are expected to have a wide variety of applications in the real world. This tech preview originally included a function based on Natural Language Generation technology, where the system would generate natural replies to questions that did not have a pre-written response. However, the NLG function is omitted in this release because there remains a risk of the AI generating unethical replies. We thank you for your understanding. We will consider reintroducing this function as soon as our research succeeds in creating an environment in which players can enjoy the experience with peace of mind.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Partners in Crime-Fighting","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2280000/0bdc82a63fed95fe9b2cdab4539581d711f65ac5.jpg"},{"name":"The Secretary Didn't Do It","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2280000/c7a73246eee110a1093c89fe26f3b6d13ce922c4.jpg"},{"name":"The Guard Didn't Do It","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2280000/92d2edcac81b07774a4b65b7ddd313b136ef84ba.jpg"},{"name":"The Daughter Didn't Do It","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2280000/4195f1dc70b8da8b031b4cefdb8563f817957719.jpg"},{"name":"Just Say No","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2280000/473eb526ece68a76158a066f09152b5b75dd9c21.jpg"},{"name":"The Stripper Didn't Do It","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2280000/c07ef55b95bbfda5efa48751267f63830d5d7f72.jpg"},{"name":"First Victim","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2280000/169525076352f181b60c60a4c919f83843785642.jpg"},{"name":"Second Victim","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2280000/6b8d92a4b210769829992692393318d16a4a1868.jpg"},{"name":"Third Victim","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2280000/7ea0ca7a641a0874d3f10ed2ae542532152da012.jpg"},{"name":"Good Cop, Bad Cop","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2280000/b3626504c1dd4bda648e0cbbe40dba97462b44f6.jpg"}],"total":13},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2280000/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1682262089","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2280000/page.bg.jpg?t=1682262089","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2280000/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1682262089","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2280000/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1682262089","categories":[{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"Please be aware that in this tech preview, the player will take on the role of a detective solving a string of murders, during the course of which they may encounter: illustrations depicting dead bodies (blacked out), of bloodshed (bloody noses), and of a man with a naked torso, as well as descriptions of violence, and of a drug deal."},"detailed_description":"This software is an educational demonstration of Natural Language Processing (NLP), an AI technology, as applied to the adventure game \u201cThe Portopia Serial Murder Case\u201d (created by Yuji Horii and first published in Japan in 1983).
