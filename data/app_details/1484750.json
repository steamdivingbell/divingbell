{"about_the_game":"Game Escape from the maze, a game about how a person can pass through rooms, each time solving new problems. With each level, the maze becomes a little more difficult. The casual game is aimed at making a person in a calm atmosphere have fun and relax a little.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a small indie game. At the moment, the game has 12 levels, and it is designed for 30-40 minutes of calm, relaxed passage. I plan to add several new levels every month. Increasing the total playing time to several hours. The style of play is casual. This game will appeal to those who want to spend an hour in a quiet, calm environment.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1484750/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1668021971","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1484750/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1668021971","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1484750/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1668021971","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1484750/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1668021971","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Stop sales</h1><p>Hello everyone, unfortunately due to the situation in Russia, I can not continue the development of this game.
