{"about_the_game":"Over Tooned - An anime flavored GenX styled arcade racing game. The game is designed to be jump and go. There are no tutorials and no vehicles you have to unlock. Now with 66 vehicles with more on the way soon. Each vehicle has 104 different colors that you can freely choose from. We are starting with 40 race tracks (more to be added in future updates) and 10 explore tracks (Again more to be added in the future updates). All tracks and explore modes are randomly selected.<br><br>Just for fun we have include an Emoji System.<br><br>There are 4 Modes : <strong>1:)</strong> Fully Automatic (This mode makes only the computer controlled cars and you can watch the races with an cool racing camera system we developed) <strong>2:)</strong> Random Car (in this mode a race a random car in a random color against 9 computer controlled cars) <strong>3:)</strong> Selected Car (in this mode you select a car in the garage and color it however you want and that is the car you race with against 9 computer controlled cars) <strong>4:)</strong> Explore Mode (these modes you use the selected car or if have not selected a car you will use the default first car in its default color to run around and explore some outdoor environments and cities that we created to let you have some fun just driving around - this has no GUI (Graphical User Interface) so you can take screenshots of either the scenery or cool stunts you preform. The settings menu will tell you how to return to the main menu depending on what control set you choose). <br><br>The game controls are defaulted to the keyboard, please see the settings menu to see the supported controller options (ones that we have tested and know work) other controllers may be supported but have not been tested.<br><br>This game defaults to it's autonomous mode. This means the game's main menu starts with a 1 minute timer - if there has been no user input then it will randomly choose a race track and choose 10 computer controlled cars to race themselves. Once the race is over then the game will return to the main menu and start the timer over again. We do have a unique racing camera system setup that should allow you to enjoy the races even if you don't play.<br><br>Our computer controlled cars have a great many random variables. One such variable is their intelligence which is rolled at the beginning of every race. The computer controlled cars intellect controls how well they steer, how well the brake and how well the read curves and corners. Sometimes you will race really smart ones and sometimes you will wonder how they qualified to race in the first place. There is usually a good mix with the intellects on the track. There are 1100 racers. Each car is driven by 20-22 computer controlled races. When one of the computer controlled racers wins a race you will see a card pop up showing you who just won. The computer controlled races have a wide range of ethnic backgrounds, lifestyles, and looks.<br><br>There are three (3) distinct Racing Modes: Racing modes are default to Standard and are reset every time the game launches.<br><br><strong>Cheesy Mode</strong>:<br>*Computer controlled cars have less intellect.<br>*Computer controlled cars have less control.<br>*Computer controlled have less acceleration.<br>*Though easier than Standard Mode you are not guaranteed to win.<br><br><strong>Standard Mode</strong>:<br>*Computer controlled cars default configuration.<br>*Computer controlled cars have good intellect range.<br>*Computer controlled cars have good control.<br>*Computer controlled have good acceleration.<br><br><strong>Psycho  Mode</strong>:<br>*Computer controlled cars have more intellect.<br>*Computer controlled cars have more control.<br>*Computer controlled have more acceleration.<br>*For advanced drivers<br>*Intentionally difficult.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3174170?t=1726544198","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3174170/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1726544198","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3174170/a9853cda3a0ed915f1ce2b7186bcfcae2d757e8b/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726544198","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3174170/a9853cda3a0ed915f1ce2b7186bcfcae2d757e8b/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726544198","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Over Tooned - An anime flavored GenX styled arcade racing game.
