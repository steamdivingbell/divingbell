{"about_the_game":"You are dropped into a white void to scrap together a small space vessel. From there you are flung through the gates, a network of tunnels through space that skip you from one danger to the next. How long can you survive? Keep your ship in one piece, if you can, or watch it split under the torrent of fire from wandering mechanoid ships to then limp away and rebuild. A roped together series of engines, shields and various parts just about keep you alive and on the edge of collapse.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Quiet Void is a space based survival game. Featuring an endless procedural world and a whole array of ship modules that can be connected together to create the ship you desire, fuel it through solar, bio-fuel or reactors and put together a cockpit to run it all from. A whole array of tools are at your disposal, GravGuns, TryQuarters and Blasters. Lootable stations and ships provide you parts and 3D printing will fill the gaps. Your shields and turrets might just keep you alive, provided you can keep the lights on...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Quiet Void ultimately is a free form game where your fate and heading are your own.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1452890/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1628839268","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1452890/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1628839268","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1452890/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1628839268","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1452890/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1628839268","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You are dropped into a white void to scrap together a small space vessel.
