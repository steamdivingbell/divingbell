{"about_the_game":"&quot;Heroes Strategy\u00b7KARDS&quot; is a TCG card game with a relaxed competitive Hearthstone gameplay set in the Three Kingdoms. Players can summon hundreds of heroes of the Three Kingdoms to form troops to repel the enemy. The heroes mentioned here are cards in general games. During the game, players should adjust their card-playing strategy at all times according to the opponent's actual card-playing situation. Since the operation of playing and placing cards in the game needs to be done manually by the player, coupled with the interface similar to the poker table, it makes people feel like they are really playing cards.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Battle interface</h2></strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2350030/extras/1.png?t=1704466322\" /><br>In the battle of the game, players need to arrange and deploy their own combat strategies according to the situation of the opponent's cards, and the most important thing is to have a general understanding of the skills attached to each card in their hands.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Entering skills</h2></strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2350030/extras/2.png?t=1704466322\" /><br>Some cards have a sweeping effect that can deal physical damage to multiple cards of the enemy at once, while some cards have a meat shield attribute that can resist damage from enemy cards for their own heroes, and some can even deal with these damages rebound etc. And the effect of these cards will affect the balance of your victory in every battle.
