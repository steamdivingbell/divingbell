{"about_the_game":"MonsterTamer is an RPG in which you will tame beasts called &quot;Tamons&quot;. My goal is to add a more dynamic touch to the 2005-2010s Monster Taming genre, as I have always felt like this is what it needs the most. <br><br>You will fight wild creatures directly into the overworld. Defeat and tame them to become the most powerful tamer known in the land of Honnis. Grind to the top of the ladder and learn about the mysteries of this world. Build the perfect team and go on an adventure to discover Tamons that most consider to be myths and legends.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Features:</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Top Down World:</strong> Explore the world of Honnis through a top down perspective.
