Outmaneuver them, exploit their weaknesses and use your arcane powers to turn your minions\u2019 strikes into critical hits - or at least keep them alive till tomorrow!<br><br><br>Get creative with a wide arsenal of magical mayhem. Make two units swap positions, raise a skeletal sidekick, persuade an enemy to switch sides or turn them into a walking bonfire with a sizzling fireball!<br><br>Thought you were done? Not so fast!
