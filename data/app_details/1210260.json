Since then and for the twenty following years many worlds, until then inaccessible, have been visited by exploration teams under the control of the UN. They brought back knowledge and technology. Visited planets have been classed into three categories: Earths, similar to our world in many aspects; peaceful Paradises; and the dangerous Purgatories where violence and evil reign.<br />\r\nBut, like every door, interdimensional portals work both ways and Purgatories inhabitants began to take interest in it. One world known as \u201cAlcion\u201d saw in the portal an occasion to expand its power, not only on Earth, but also on the many planets now connected to our world. UN security team managed to contain the Alcion threat thanks to its tactics and brutal firepower. So much so that it was soon known to the media and the general public as the \u201cOverKill Unit\u201d.<br />\r\nLess than a month after the victory other purgatory worlds began attacking portals and it\u2019s now up to the OverKill Unit to protect Earths and peaceful paradises.<br />\r\nAs a member of the OverKill Unit you are to be sent to worlds where lifeforms and universal laws are very different from what you have experienced so far. Your only mission is to protect each world\u2019s portal against the assault of its residents until the command center brings you home and deactivates it. If you fail, the command center will fall in the hands of hostile creatures which could then ravage your home, and many more.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"First blood !","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1210260/9fec3bffcda7886cc99aadb6a55c431f187d3fb9.jpg"},{"name":"Multi-kill !","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1210260/b1fbcd1b07ec60a82ecf05dbd3b3c2e3655e7844.jpg"},{"name":"Killing spree !","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1210260/f00feb998573f4039b17cfbcf627b2d8944cbf0d.jpg"},{"name":"Do you need a hand ?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1210260/9d03033f88edf8a73361f4ca006e88e4479e2d4d.jpg"},{"name":"Welcome !","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1210260/92963655a401a8a5159d28fb2a1456cbe98f071f.jpg"},{"name":"The naked gun","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1210260/1ebe42d9bce06a92d1e4232a0b2bf3ad727ca596.jpg"},{"name":"OLD SCHOOL","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1210260/88f9e7442971c2271824544247e3e9a265cdc962.jpg"},{"name":"Build up !","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1210260/9c3a2e45f4f118161f0309b805b49af441e8a949.jpg"},{"name":"Mega-kill !","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1210260/404b7154c80946386656504a25db50d6dbcfa32a.jpg"},{"name":"The Cave Boss","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1210260/3c1b805dab3dd1be92c8c43d0f07cf3cd30d012e.jpg"}],"total":13},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1210260?t=1632822928","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1210260/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1632822928","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1210260/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1632822928","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1210260/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1632822928","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"This game has blood, violence and scary monsters."},"detailed_description":"&quot;Purgatory Overkill&quot; mixes a shooter and a tower-defense in a VR environnement.<br />\r\nPlay as a member of the elite group &quot;OverKill Unit&quot; and shoot your way into hordes of enemies, from tiny skeletons to gigantic demons, to protect interdimensional portals which are at the same time you way home and a way for the monsters to invade your world !<br />\r\nYou can count on your military arsenal to fight, be it loads of different weapons or automatic turrets that you can build around the map to avoid getting overwhelmed.
