It\u2019s a solid game effort by Her Interactive and those who might have been passing on the Nancy Drew series might just want to give this one a try. In my opinion, The White Wolf of Icicle Creek is an excellent step in the right direction.\u201d<br />\r\nJust Adventure<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cSuitable for all ages, the game also contains some educational tidbits on wildlife and brain-teasing puzzles that may make it a good choice for children and families, though prospective buyers may want to note that there are some characters that fall into possibly offensive racial stereotypes. In any case, though, it\u2019s a decent adventure game, and fans of the series will probably find it worthwhile to take a look.\u201d<br />\r\nGame Chronicles<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cAt the end of the day, Nancy Drew: The White Wolf of Icicle Creek is everything we have come to expect from this series of games. It has nicely enmeshed puzzles peppered throughout the game, a number of quirky characters to interact with and a solidly written dialogue.\u201d<br />\r\nAdventure Gamers<br />\r\n","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31930/0000008324.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734468527","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31930/0000008324.600x338.jpg?t=1734468527"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31930/0000008325.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734468527","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31930/0000008325.600x338.jpg?t=1734468527"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31930/0000008326.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734468527","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31930/0000008326.600x338.jpg?t=1734468527"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31930/0000008327.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734468527","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31930/0000008327.600x338.jpg?t=1734468527"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31930/0000008328.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734468527","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31930/0000008328.600x338.jpg?t=1734468527"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31930/0000008329.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734468527","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31930/0000008329.600x338.jpg?t=1734468527"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31930/0000008330.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734468527","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31930/0000008330.600x338.jpg?t=1734468527"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31930/0000008331.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734468527","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31930/0000008331.600x338.jpg?t=1734468527"},{"id":8,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31930/0000008332.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734468527","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31930/0000008332.600x338.jpg?t=1734468527"},{"id":9,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31930/0000008333.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734468527","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31930/0000008333.600x338.jpg?t=1734468527"},{"id":10,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31930/0000008334.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734468527","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31930/0000008334.600x338.jpg?t=1734468527"}],"short_description":"Follow a Trail to Hidden Secrets and Sabotage!","steam_appid":31930,"support_info":{"email":"techsupport@herinteractive.com","url":"https://www.herinteractive.com/support/contact-support/"},"supported_languages":"English","type":"game","website":"https://www.herinteractive.com/shop-games/nancy-drew-the-white-wolf-of-icicle-creek/"}
