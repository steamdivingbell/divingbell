{"about_the_game":"It\u2019s been over 100 years since the end of WWI, a conflict that shaped the modern world and killed tens of millions of people. It was an era that saw a new invention, the airplane, become a weapon of war. It also saw devastation like never before all along the vast Western Front in France. Trench warfare, artillery barrages, machine guns nests, and poison gas made ground combat an ugly, nasty affair. But above the brutal meatgrinder there was a ballet of winged machines made largely of canvas and wood, piloted by knights for a new age, who dueled to the death in a most personal way. Flying Circus: Volume II recreates the WWI aerial battlefield on your PC and expands upon the work of Flying Circus: Volume I with a more diverse plane-set. It includes the Western Front map map and a Pilot Career mode.<br><br>Flying Circus: Volume II continues our long tradition of bringing WWI aerial warfare to your computer with an explosive plane-set that includes not only fighters, but bombers and recon aircraft, resulting in a more diverse range of missions available to the user. When combined with the existing plane-set from FC1 most of the aircraft that saw combat from 1917 to the end of the war in 1918 are represented.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2366320/extras/SAMOLETI.png?t=1734534543\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Realistic Environment and Physics</h2>Flying Circus, just as in all our Great Battles titles, features a realistically modeled combat and flight environment with an advanced physics engine. Aircraft have realistic aerodynamics and are modeled to fly like their real-life counterparts. A <strong>detailed damage model</strong> along with beautiful cockpits and <strong>physiological modelling of pilot's fatigue accumulation after active maneuvering in a dogfight</strong> complete the picture. Real pilots tell us that the feeling of flight in the Great Battles series is amazingly accurate.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Several Ways to Play</h2>You can choose several ways to play Battle of Normandy in either single-player or multiplayer modes. Just like all of our other Great Battles titles, Flying Circus takes full advantage of our mission design logic and multiplayer capabilities of the IL-2 Sturmovik simulation engine.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Quick Mission Builder</h2>If you just want to jump into the cockpit and start shooting, we have several dogfights, duels and free flights available in the Quick Mission Builder (QMB). These quick missions are a great way to hone your flying and aerial combat skills before you tackle objective-based single-player missions or intense multiplayer missions. And if you own any other Great Battles title, you can also play quick missions with the Flying Circus aircraft on other maps, not just the included Western Front map.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Advanced Quick Mission Generator</h2>Once you\u2019ve mastered quick mission combat, and you want to fly a more challenging and detailed objective-based mission, but don\u2019t want to learn our Mission Editor, then the Advanced Quick Mission Generator (AQMG) is for you. Simply pick an airfield, aircraft and mission type and a few other parameters and a fully detailed mission will be generated for you. <strong>No two missions will be identical</strong> guaranteeing hours upon hours of great sorties to fly!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Pilot's Career</h2>Another step forward in complexity is the Career mode: here you can join one of more than 50 historical American, French, British or German squadrons and complete missions day by day, earning awards and rising in rank - after becoming a commanding officer you can direct your subordinates and alter the mission plan. Mission types change and <strong>represent the real missions this squadron was performing on this day</strong>. The weather changes according to history and squadrons fly rebase missions. You can even can ask to be transferred to another unit or read a newspaper with news articles of the time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiplayer</h2>As with all our Great Battles titles, Flying Circus supports both Dogfight and Co-operative multiplayer missions. These can be created with our Mission Editor or you can download multiplayer missions created by the community. You can host multiplayer missions from the in-game menus or utilize our Dedicated Server (Dserver) application that is included. We do recommend the Dserver for advanced users. Multiplayer is a great challenge for IL-2 Sturmovik pilots and many great friendships have started in our multiplayer community. There are even <strong>virtual squadrons you can join</strong>!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Community Content Support</h2>As with all IL-2 Sturmovik: Great Battles series titles, Flying Circus supports content created by the community such as skins, missions and campaigns. Flying Circus fans are already creating additional skins and missions for you to download and enjoy. You can download our Photoshop templates and create your own paintjobs.<br><br>Flying Circus includes support for Scenario Missions that are custom designed single-player missions built by the team or by members of the community using our powerful Mission Editor. These can be one-offs or several missions not necessarily designed to be a campaign. There are lots of Scenario Missions available for download or create your own using our Mission Editor or a community supplied mission builder application.   <br><br>Flying Circus includes support for what we call Scripted Campaigns. These are sets of missions that are created either by the Sturmovik team or by members of the IL-2 Sturmovik: Great Battles community using our powerful Mission Editor application. They are scripted in the sense that they are specifically designed and linked together to tell a story or portray a unique period during the war.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Part of a Larger War</h2>Flying Circus - Volume II is part of the IL-2 Great Battles series and can be used both as a standalone product and together with other games in the series \u2013 Flying Circus: Volume I, Battle for Stalingrad, Battle for Moscow, Battle of Kuban, Operation Bodenplatte and Battle of Normandy.
