In the 1st war, Insurgents lost so many people.  Since DWB used Advanced Robotics they kept pushing the SOA army back to their mainland. After countless losses, SOA wanted to expand its Trifuel mining operations so they ally with other factions. They call it Trifuel Alliance. Agents from all over the world were assigned to the extraction site to protect the harvester from any threat. DWB counter-attacked by cloning these agents and their abilities. DWB used them against the original agents who were assigned to protect the harvester and then the 2nd Trifuel war began.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>Unlike our Previous game, Trifuel Alliance is not a Team Deathmatch game. Instead, we focus our game to be more tactical and your death has consequences if you downed, your team can revive you. but if they fall, you are dead. you have to wait until the next round starts to play. Extraction Valley Trifuel Alliance is a 4v4 PvP character base 3rd person shooter game where one team tries to defend the Trifuel Harvester while other team tries to destroy it.
