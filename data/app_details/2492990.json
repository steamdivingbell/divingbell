{"about_the_game":"Through the water you see the outline of Charlotte's palm for the last time and lose sight of her. Somehow you regain consciousness on the shore of an unknown island. Communication is destroyed and a suspiciously acrid haze accumulates in your lungs.<br>You don't know where to go or where to look, but one thing is certain - you must leave this island!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">An Oppressive Atmosphere...</h2>You hear sounds, but you can't see the source. You see a silhouette, but it's the shadow of a toy. You hear someone breathing behind you, but there's no one there. You hear a loud roar, but you can't hear anymore. You are swallowed up by the darkness...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">An Independent World...</h2>The world of LOCURA doesn't and won't wait for anyone. Events will happen even if the player is not around, the world will follow its own destiny. You are a small cog, but so important.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">They Are Human Beings too, After All...</h2>The game gives you challenges and goals, just like the inhabitants of the island. They also sleep and eat, interact with each other and strive to achieve their goals.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">You Have to Be Able to Listen too...</h2>You were not willingly drawn into the island's inhabitants. You may think that the island and its inhabitants have nothing to hide, but this is far from the truth. Listen to the conversations and monologues, they have something to tell you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Following Your Own Path...</h2>At LOCURA there is no invisible hand guiding you according to a given scenario. Your eyes and interest are the real engines of the scenario, your own scenario. Accept help or offer it, run away or stay, kill or forgive, in the end you will get the ending you have created.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Pure talent","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2492990/d0951905bf14615dec344ffed136888c97c2ec1d.jpg"}],"total":1},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2492990/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1694599901","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2492990/page.bg.jpg?t=1694599901","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2492990/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1694599901","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2492990/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1694599901","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Through the water you see the outline of Charlotte's palm for the last time and lose sight of her.
