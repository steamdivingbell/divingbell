Re-live the lunar rover exploration on the last moon mission - Apollo 17.  This is the apogee of the most extreme travel, camping, and hiking expedition in mankind\u2019s history.  Imagine not only landing on the moon, but then having an incredible moon buggy to explore far beyond where you can see or easily get back to the landing module.  The application employs realistically modeled moon terrain and mountains from satellite images, real moon photographs, and photogrammetry to bring the moon closer than ever before.

This mission was refined using knowledge from all the other Apollo missions.  They stayed on the moon longer and traveled further than ever before and ever since.  The Apollo 17 astronauts  traveled over 22 miles in the rover.  Much of the time in the rover, they were not even in sight of the lander.<br><br>The application also chronicles the astronauts discoveries on this mission and little known facts.  This includes the massive Camelot Crater over half a mile across, orange dirt discovered at Shorty crater, an emergency repair or the rover, and other adventures.  You will see the moon just as the astronauts did.  Some site details are brought to clarity with photogrammetric regions generated from collections of astronaut photos.  The mountains and horizon are generated from low lunar orbit elevation data.  Intermediate terrain is formed with the aid of high resolution orbital images. <br><br>The rover itself is modeled on the original using real physics simulation with 4 wheel suspension, 4 wheel stearing, damping, gravity and power just like the original.
