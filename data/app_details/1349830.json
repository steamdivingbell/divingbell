The Kenji character which we started the game with in <strong>Episode 1</strong> works hard to become a samurai. But with the end of the first episode trouble comes after us that we can never escape. Kenji is no longer alone, and he can\u2019t be alone until the mission is over. With the following episodes, privacy and many more mechanics will be added to the game.
