Billions of humans were crowded into overpopulated shelters, rife with disease and death. Just as their ancestors did so long ago, humanity looked to the stars for salvation. Using incredible technologies designed out of desperation, billions of people forged journeys into the darkness, establishing vast networks of interstellar colonies. The discovery of countless forms of alien life was met with indifference - an indifference that quickly turned to contempt. A powerful human military, honed by centuries of warfare, overpowered and conquered isolated alien worlds, claiming them as new territory for the massive human diaspora.<br><br>Humanity had avoided extinction and resettled itself, but had made a galaxy of enemies in the process. Survivors of countless fallen alien worlds banded together, and launched a suicidal campaign of revenge against the upstart race. All of humanity\u2019s military and technological advances crumbled under the fury of an enraged galaxy, and soon, only a few million people remained, hidden in isolated pockets across the stars.<br><br>Once again faced with extinction, humanity turned to the tool that had brought them to the stars: innovation. But now, surviving military leaders were uninterested in saving lives or defending worlds. Their focus was far more singular - the eradication of everything. Terrible, reality-warping weapons were created by bending the very laws of nature. Captured alien species were spliced together and twisted into genetic abominations. Artificial intelligences were designed and built to brutalize their enemies, stripped of any ethical or moral restraint.<br><br>But there were a few dissenters.
