Having undergone it's first round of raid testing optimization tests and end-game proof of concept, Eternal Tombs plans to deliver one of the strongest end-games ever on launch. (Clarification: &quot;on launch&quot;, we're not beating current WoW on our launch, but we will have much more end-game on our launch than WoW on it's launch)<br><br>Watch Our First Raid Optimization Test<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1668340/extras/WorldOfMithir.jpg?t=1729796699\" /><br>Eternal Tombs will launch with around 30 zones with different biomes, dungeons, secrets, unlockable zones, hidden passages, traps, treasure and more. Our passion is to introduce a truly dangerous world where exploration and traveling can be difficult but highly rewarding.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1668340/extras/MithirMapsSteam2.jpg?t=1729796699\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1668340/extras/BusinessModel.jpg?t=1729796699\" /><br>We're incredibly passionate about getting rid of all microtransactions and earning gear outside of games. Eternal Tombs is a buy to play, single box price game with an optional subscription model for those who want to grow their account with more characters.<br><br>Our Statement on Microtransactions: Eternal Tombs is also a microtransaction-free game. All gear, experience, cosmetics and gameplay items are earned through in-game efforts and solely through those means giving players a true sense of accomplishment and achievement.<br><br>Monetization comes through purchase of game, optional subscriptions and future expansion packs upon release.","developers":["Triune Studios"],"genres":[{"description":"Indie","id":"23"},{"description":"Massively
