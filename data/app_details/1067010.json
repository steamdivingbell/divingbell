{"about_the_game":"&quot;Trouble is brewing in the Shire, and only a desperate journey to the Blue Mountains can set things right. Can you brave the dangers you will find \u2013 and those that find you?<br />\r\n <br />\r\nThe Hunt for the Ember Crown challenges heroes with exciting new adventures, taking them from the haunted mounds of the Barrow-downs to the far side of the Blue Mountains. Each adventure presents its own dangers, whether the ancient trees of the Old Forest, a long-standing grudge between the Dwarves and the Elves, or a vicious Orcish raiding party. All the way, the heroes are stalked by the vengeful Coalfang: a Warg of unnatural shrewdness and skill.
