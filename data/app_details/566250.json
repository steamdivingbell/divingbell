Gameplay Notes:\r\nThe game is open ended, and it's a roguelike so if your character dies, they get deleted. \r\nBe careful when starting a new character and you can also use your partner Bill to help with beginning enemies. \r\nEven a powerful combination of powers still leaves your young character vulnerable to most enemies. \r\nThe controls are mouse all three buttons and Keyboard W,A,S,D there are also lots of little secrets.</p><br><h1>Update Notes</h1><p>If you are having trouble using the Flying Power, just Press &quot;F&quot; in-game instead of Pressing the Flight Button at the top left corner of the screen.
