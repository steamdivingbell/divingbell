{"about_the_game":"Crossedland is a game all about exploration and creating a safe haven as you fight your way through a strange world for the amusement of a distant audience. If you've always loved building villages, farming, and taking care of villagers but wished there was more action and exploration, Crossedland is the home for you!<br><br>Features:<br><br>Arenas: Dive into arenas to collect resources, tech, upgrades, new recruits, and more.<br>Town Building: Build the town of your dreams on a private island. Resources to build are everywhere!<br>Crafting: Make weaponry, armor, gadgets, and more to help you on your journey.<br>Farming and Cooking: Grow crops and make tasty meals to provide you with buffs and feed your recruits.<br>Villager Recruitment: Track down villagers in the arenas to bring back to your town and put them to work or add them to your gladiator team. Some of them will even unlock special abilities you can use.<br>Team Management: Create a team to send into arenas to gather resources for you. You will have to train, equip, and feed them, but they can bring you back some great rewards.<br><br>You have no memory from before you arrived on Crossedland, but you are still immediately thrust into the world and forced to fight for the amusement of others like you\u2019re a gladiator. While you have your own place to retire to, you will barely get any rest as the demands of the world are great, and you must also be great.<br><br>Survive the arenas, put on a good show, and reap rewards beyond your wildest dreams.<br><br><strong>Each arena is filled with loot, enemies, and materials to gather, but if you don\u2019t put on a good show, your performance will suffer and your reward for completing the arena will be smaller.</strong><br><br>Do you want to gather materials and lose favor with the audience, or do you want to slaughter your foes in a glorious fashion to cause the audience to fall in love with you?<br><br><strong>Beware, if you die, you lose everything you gathered in the arena you died in.</strong> Weigh risk and reward to come out on top and get home safely.<br><br>The arenas aren\u2019t always just for fighting, though. Game shows, bonus rounds full of loot, and obstacle courses also await you. Flex your knowledge with trivia, pray to lady luck for a good spin, or show off your dexterity as you tackle everything thrown at you.<br><br>During your journey, you will meet a wide assortment of characters that you can let come live on your private island with you. Bringing them along also brings their needs and wants, so expect requests ranging from better equipment and bigger houses to pink sofas, food, and hard-to-get artifacts. Make them happy and they might even provide you with useful information, recipes, or devices to make arenas a breeze.<br><br>At the start, you will have close to nothing. A small pond of fresh water, some trees, bland mushrooms, and some rocks. You will fight with wooden sticks and bows, wearing nothing but flimsy handmade clothes. The arenas will be difficult and dangerous, but eventually, you'll work your way up (with the right friends) to powerful armor and weapons.<br><br>Find enough hidden tech on the planet, and some of the people you meet will be able to reverse engineer it and upgrade you to the future with energy weapons, enhanced capabilities, and near-impenetrable armor.<br><br>A genre mash-up, Crossedland will let you build a town, recruit villagers, fight in arenas, explore deep caves, farm crops, cook, craft, gather resources, and eventually even automate your farms and gathering operations while you look for a way off the planet for you and your new companions.<br><br><strong>The demo will not include several of the features (like team management and advanced building) but it will let you get a good taste of combat and the flow of the game.</strong>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3036340/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725655441","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3036340/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1725655441","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3036340/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725655441","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3036340/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725655441","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Crossedland is a game all about exploration and creating a safe haven as you fight your way through a strange world for the amusement of a distant audience.
