My name is Wu, the producer of Cream War, and I am very happy to bring this game to you!<br>We originally planned to make a party game that was primarily based on physics, but during the design process, we found that if we just made a physics-based gameplay, it would get boring after a few repetitions-in the middle of development, we redirected the entire game!<br>(A special thanks to the studio cats! Thank them for calming the little emotions of every member of the team!!)<br>We decided to expand the content of the game, adding a lot of different gameplay on the basis of the original map, and adding a lot of items to enhance the fun level of the game - each player is the fun designer of the party<br>We hope this game will bring you many happy times! <br>If you are interested in our game and would like to cooperate with us in the next step, please contact E-mail: <a href=\"mailto:admin@interactef.com\">admin@interactef.com</a></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Cream war puts 6-10 players in a wild group melee, team up to cooperate, and carry out the &quot;destruction of friendship&quot; to the end!
