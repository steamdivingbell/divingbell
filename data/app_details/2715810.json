While some of those (with short durations) are free forever, most require a certain amount of credits to play, depending on game world duration. Credits are charged on a daily basis and can be purchased in-game. There are no recurring subscriptions, topping up credits happens exclusively at the players\u2019 discretion. To unlock all features, especially those that require direct interaction with other players, in all game worlds, at least one completed payment is required. To ensure a level playing field, there are no other charges (like for cosmetics, in-game currency or similar) besides game world fees. More information on AirlineSim\u2019s payment model can be found in the AirlineSim handbook.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE AIRLINE SIMULATION FOR PROS</h2><br>In AirlineSim, you become the CEO of your own airline: Take your business to the skies as you acquire aircraft, schedule flights, form alliances and compete on a real-time market!<br><br>Manage your airline directly from the browser and use comprehensive tools modeled after legacy IT systems to adjust service levels, analyze routes and keep an eye on company finances as your business grows over time.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2715810/extras/inventory.gif?t=1726644263\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE SKY'S THE LIMIT</h2><br>Airport capacities, traffic rights, passenger demand and many other aspects of the game are modeled after the real world.
