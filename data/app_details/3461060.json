{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Storyline</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> You play as a young woman who has moved to a big city and found a surprisingly cheap apartment in one of the blocks on a housing estate. Although it\u2019s quite far from your university and workplace, it offers excellent transport connections. However, the apartment has a story of its own - one you uncover through objects left behind and from local residents, whom you don\u2019t always feel like interacting with but often can\u2019t avoid. <br><br>Before long, you realize you\u2019re not always alone in the apartment. Someone knows how to enter your home; perhaps someone who lived there before you.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> <i>New Face on the Block</i> is a first-person <u>horror walking simulator.</u> Players will explore various locations, interact with the neighborhood\u2019s residents, and uncover a compelling story that took place some time ago. The gameplay focuses on exploration, finding hidden items, and interacting with them to piece together the narrative.\u00a0To progress, players will complete simple tasks that are integrated into the story.<br><br>The game emphasizes atmosphere, building tension and creating a sense of fear. While the game creates a tense atmosphere with immersive audio and occasional jump scares, it is primarily a psychological horror experience. It focuses on building suspense and anticipation rather than relying heavily on sudden scares.\u00a0<br><br>The story unfolds over the course of several evenings in an early-1990s housing estate. As players delve deeper into it, they will face decisions that influence the game's ending. <br><br>The game is designed to be completed in approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3461060/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737723279","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3461060/page.bg.jpg?t=1737723279","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3461060/1ecfe56101b10298c9aec22ae9efe07adfb7d49e/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737723279","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3461060/1ecfe56101b10298c9aec22ae9efe07adfb7d49e/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737723279","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"The storyline and visuals involve some instances of violence and gore.
