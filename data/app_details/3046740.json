{"about_the_game":"Word has spread of Esmar, a new island continent brimming with untold riches and ancient secrets. Adventurers, explorers, and conquerors from every corner of the world set sail to claim their destiny. Will they establish a thriving colony, uncover hidden mysteries, and forge their legend in the annals of history?<br>The uncharted lands of Esmar await your command.

Construct a variety of production facilities such as woodcutters, stonecutters, sawmills, mines, and farms to create a robust and efficient economy. Master the art of production chains to ensure your resources flow seamlessly, enabling rapid growth and development.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Population Growth and Housing</h2>Increase your population by building residential houses, bringing new settlers to your domain. These valuable helpers are essential for transporting goods across your settlement, ensuring the smooth operation of your production chains. They will automatically get assigned to become specialized workers, driving the efficiency of your facilities. When the time comes, these settlers can also be trained and transformed into soldiers, ready to defend your land and expand your territory. Proper management of your population is key to maintaining a thriving and adaptable settlement.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Territory Expansion</h2>Expand your territory by strategically placing watchtowers to secure new lands. Push your boundaries further by conquering enemy watchtowers, asserting your dominance, and gaining valuable resources and strategic advantages. You can only build and collect resources within your own territory!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Play Modes</h2>Challenge your friends or players from around the globe in intense multiplayer battles. Or play against the AI. Or both, whatever you like! A single player campaign might be added at a later stage in the development.<br><br>Explorers of Esmar is the brainchild of a solo developer inspired by strategy games of days long gone.
