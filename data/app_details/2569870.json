I felt extreme helplessness as I saw what was happening, and I couldn't do anything. This wretched helplessness that makes you not taste a morsel of food or savor a drop of water. This helplessness was my motivator and the driving force behind the wheel of art. In the end, game development is my way of expression. Perhaps this game won't have the huge impact - as expected - that would alleviate the suffering of my people in Gaza, but that's the nature of art, helpless in the face of the machine gun. But only in the short term, after that, the machine gun rusts, its carrier dies, and art remains eternal. Apologies from the killer won't bring the murdered back to life, and unfortunately, neither will art. But if I knew a better way to help, I would do it. Is the world we live in now a world controlled by heartless, heartless people? I don't know. I hope the world stops this madness, as I've begun to lose faith in it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2>In their collapsed street, Jihad tries to free his little sister Marwa from under the debris of their shelled home. Can Jihad accomplish this while the airstrikes continue on their street, where no one is left to tell their story except you? Search for stories inside the houses on your phone and share them with the world so they don't forget.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2569870/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1712771599","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2569870/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1712771599","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2569870/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1712771599","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2569870/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1712771599","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>&quot;Inspired by suffering that is hardly close to reality&quot;</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2569870/extras/Untitled-1.png?t=1712771599\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Message</h2>I don't know the impact of this simple game on the world, but I'm sure of its impact on me personally.
