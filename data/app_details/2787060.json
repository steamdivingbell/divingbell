{"about_the_game":"Explore another world in the community-built spiritual successor to One Hour One Life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother Hour Another Planet is a multiplayer survival game of parenting and civilization building. Get born to another player as your mother. Live an entire life in one hour. Have babies of your own in the form of other players. Leave a legacy for the next generation as you help to rebuild another planet from scratch.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach Another Planet server starts out with a practically infinite expanse of untouched alien wilderness.  The first player to join the server is Eve.  Other players who join the server are born as Eve's children and grandchildren, forming a multi-generational family tree.  Each minute that passes in the game is a year of your life as you grow up, have children, age, and eventually die, leaving the world for your offspring to carry on.  You can rejoin the game for another life, getting born as a baby to some other mother somewhere in the world.  In each life, you play one small part in a huge story that started long before you were born and will continue on long after you die.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach Another Planet server can support over one hundred simultaneous players who are building and shaping a persistent, trans-generational world.  The shape a given world today can be quite different from how it will look tomorrow, next week, or next month, as players continue their collective project.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs we design and build another planet together, who knows where we'll end up?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2787060/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724974706","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2787060/page.bg.jpg?t=1724974706","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2787060/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724974706","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2787060/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724974706","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Explore another world in the community-built spiritual successor to One Hour One Life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother Hour Another Planet is a multiplayer survival game of parenting and civilization building.
