Ride the high of your total domination headshot after headshot \u2014 no cool-downs needed.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Weapons Worth Fighting For</strong></h2>Every map in TideTurn has powerful weapons you can use to turn the tides of battle, from sniper rifles, shotguns, and vehicles to incredibly destructive experimental weapons like remote controlled rockets, EMP guns, and liquid light beams\u2014 just make sure you get there first!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Variety Is The Spice Of Life</strong></h2>TideTurn's MapMaker is designed for every player to make their vision of a playable world come to life \u2014 no coding or modeling skills or tools needed! Fight to save the ocean on your own turf, or visit someone else\u2019s creation for inspiration and world domination!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Immersive Story Mode</strong></h2>Cinematic campaigns immerse you in TideTurn\u2019s lore, as Atlantians and Humans battle to save the oceans.
