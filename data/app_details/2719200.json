Takatora Todo, Naotora Ii, and Munenori Yagyu, who previously appeared only in Japanese releases, also appear for the first time in the main &quot;SAMURAI WARRIORS&quot; series. In addition, character designs have been revamped and action elements have been enhanced for fan-favorite characters like Yukimura Sanada and Nobunaga Oda.

In addition, characters' attack types and the overall progression system have been revamped. These new elements offer an unprecedented variety of attacks, along with the strongest sense of exhilaration of any game in the series, all while maintaining the simple controls characteristic of the &quot;WARRIORS&quot; series.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2719200/extras/Yukimura_Screenshot.png?t=1729049924\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\u2022 Travel across the land in Chronicle Mode!</h2>Explore the world of &quot;SAMURAI WARRIORS&quot; in the new Chronicle Mode by completing various types of requests, meeting officers, and collecting items in regions across the land.
