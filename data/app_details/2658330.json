It may seem like a simple love story, but things aren't as simple as they appear. The catch is that Mary, Manny's beloved, is considered missing, and her trail led our hero to the peculiar M City. The city is located in the middle of a forest, and its inhabitants are quite unusual and strange. By the way, with our hero Manny, too, not everything is so simple.
