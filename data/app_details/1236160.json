Each level of the game is replete with fully voiced dialogue sequences that bring the colorful characters and the world of <i>The Last Archwing</i> to life. <br><br>Save Earth together with friends! The game fully supports up to four player cooperative play, either local or online using Steam's Remote-Play-Together feature!<br><br>You must fight your way through an entire fleet of unique enemies and bosses. Destroyed enemies will reward the player with upgrade credits and power-up capsules to collect. Credits may be spent in between levels to upgrade your ship's weapons, shields, and special abilities. <br><br>Collected capsules will charge up the player's special meter. Charges of the meter may be spent to perform a Barrel Roll, which quickly maneuvers the player out of harm's way and offers temporary invincibility. A fully charged meter can be expended to fire the Super Death Wave, a powerful screen clearing weapon.<br><br>The game has a range of difficulty levels that will be sure to challenge players of all skill levels. <br><br>Looking for a greater challenge?
