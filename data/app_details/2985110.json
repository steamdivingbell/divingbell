Both you and your opponent select your moves simultaneously. The moves are setup in a rock-paper-scissors fashion. <strong>Offensive moves</strong> counter <strong>neutral moves</strong>, <strong>neutral moves</strong> counter <strong>defensive moves</strong>, and <strong>defensive moves</strong> counter <strong>offensive moves</strong>. If you do not pick a move within the 30 seconds you will automatically <i>Wait</i>! Your health and energy are determined by your chosen weapon. Moves have an associated <i>energy cost</i> and you can only use moves that you have the energy for. If your health reaches 0 you <strong>lose</strong>, even if you kill your opponent on the same turn. Some moves can <i>stun</i> you. This is indicated by the orange icon below your health bar. When you are stunned you will not be able to select a move that turn. Each weapon has a unique combo that can be read in the weapon's tooltip.
