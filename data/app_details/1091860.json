{"about_the_game":"Build a mining colony on the edge of an an asteroid belt. Explore the depths of the asteroid field as you uncover ancient artefacts and fend off alien creatures and merciless pirates.  Create your modular space station and manage its economy. Design your own space ships and pilot them in a deep, tactical combat system.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Design, Build and Customise  Spaceships</h2>Spaceships can be customised to suit certain roles, e.g. mining ships ships can be fitted with a lightly armoured hull but a large storage capacity. Combat ships can be equipped with heavier weapons and enhancements like shields.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1091860/extras/SpaceShips2_trans.png?t=1593423273\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Construct and Manage a Space Station</h2>Modular components can be added to the space station to things like produce food, filter air, house people and construct new ships. Solar panels can produce energy, research labs unlock new ship designs and improve the efficiency of station modules.  The population of the station must be provided with food and water and kept content.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1091860/extras/SolarPanelImage.png?t=1593423273\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1091860/extras/HabModImage.png?t=1593423273\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1091860/extras/Farm_Image.png?t=1593423273\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>AstroMiners is Inspired by games like:</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Rimworld </li><li>FTL </li><li>Banished </li></ul><br>You can get announcements about the game on Twitter: ","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1091860/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1593423273","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1091860/page.bg.jpg?t=1593423273","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1091860/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1593423273","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1091860/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1593423273","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Build a mining colony on the edge of an an asteroid belt.
