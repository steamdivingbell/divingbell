A century or two after the empires founding ancient ruined gates gradually activated one by one with hordes of demons marching through on a path of annihilation. Great battles were fought, lands were decimated, but the empire finished as the victor and outlawed the use of all but the most basic of magic in the land.

Soon even the emperor was deposed and a Republic, ruled by an elected senate, was put in place preserving what was left of the empire. Over the centuries the scars of the demon war began to fade and many have begun to explore the lost arts of magic even while others make new scientific discoveries and invent fantastic machines. Now, the Republic has begun to fracture again as tensions between races flare, those who seek technological advancement or investigation of magic argue, and the offspring of the demons demand integration and acceptance into the society. It will be up to you to navigate these fractured times, lead your party to victory, and develop the nation into a mighty power.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2640570?t=1725209443","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2640570?t=1725209443","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2640570/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725209443","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2640570/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725209443","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Contains text references to war, crime, political ideologies like Communism and Imperialism."},"detailed_description":"Create a political party, win elections, pass laws, govern, even go to war with your neighbors in this senate simulator with a fantasy twist.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Senate simulation with laws having to pass through committees, senators switching sides, delaying votes by filibuster, assassinations, vetoes and more </li><li>Nation simulation where government expenses need to be balanced and laws, policies, events, all have an effect on the economy, health, freedom, and even the political factions that the population supports </li><li>Win elections by cleverly spending your resources on senate campaigns that have a better chance of winning.
