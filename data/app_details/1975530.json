{"about_the_game":"Sail forth to a land of gods and giants! Wield your sword, words, and magic to take your place among Iceland\u2019s chieftains and forge your legacy of honor in this story woven from Norse sagas, myths, and the lives of real tenth-century Icelanders.<br><br><i>Choice of the Viking</i> is a 306,000 word  interactive historical fantasy novel by Declan Taggart, where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based\u2014without graphics or sound effects\u2014and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.<br><br>In the year 910 CE, countless Viking ships cross the icy oceans of northern Europe, seeking fortune, glory, trade, and land. Yours is one of them, carrying settlers to the remote island of Iceland. With your large farm to tend and your followers to govern, this is your chance to build something new out of the rugged land. <br><br>There are challenges at every turn. The other would-be chieftains are just as hungry for glory as you, and you must defend your share of wealth and honor - especially from the aggrieved rival who constantly tries to thwart you. New faiths and old vie for the souls of the Icelanders, and for the political power that each religion can carry. The long dark winter bears down upon you, threatening hunger and disease. And you must contend not only with the human inhabitants of Iceland but with any number of mysterious creatures - elves, trolls, giants, walking corpses, and even the gods themselves!<br><br>Increase your wealth through raiding, careful tending of the land, or savvy merchant trading. Wield your magic to blast obstacles from your path and gain the spirits\u2019 blessing.
