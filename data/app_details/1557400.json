{"about_the_game":"<i>A Museum of Self and Space should be a reminder of not only the beauty we can bring into the world, but how cruel that beauty can be. </i><br><br>A Museum of Self &amp; Space is a series of interactions paired with visual elements that hope to elicit specific emotions from you. AMoSaS is not fun. <br>You cannot win. <br>It isn't polished. <br>Or true.<br>Or fake. <br>It is a collection of ideas being communicated to you by Jack Hart Games. <br>You explore a museum created by Jules, a queer architect whose last work will be an exhibit focused on their failures. Moral, romantic, professional failures.<br> <br><i>I wanted to make a game where we see a strong nonbinary person old enough to look back on their life and recognize the mistakes made along the way. I don't know if there's a moral or a point in that way. What I do know is that AMoSaS is honest. I think honest works are important. If you any of that sounds interesting to you please support me by purchasing and playing my game. </i>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1557400/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1653246010","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1557400/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1653246010","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1557400/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1653246010","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1557400/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1653246010","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<i>A Museum of Self and Space should be a reminder of not only the beauty we can bring into the world, but how cruel that beauty can be. </i><br><br>A Museum of Self &amp; Space is a series of interactions paired with visual elements that hope to elicit specific emotions from you.
