{"about_the_game":"<p>As John Singleton Mosby, one of the Civil War's most interesting and dynamic leaders, you are charged, not with leading vast armies into battle, but with commanding small bands of skirmishers, scouts, and guerilla fighters on opportunistic missions to scout, ambush, steal supplies, and harass a larger and better-armed force of Union soldiers, in this game of turn-based strategy and real-time tactical combat for the PC.</p>                    \n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Missions and their objectives are randomized, so you'll need to approach each game differently, carefully planning your strategy for success.
