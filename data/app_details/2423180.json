Their private army of powerful generals has forced the village's young people to work in the dangerous Bleakmoore mines, extracting resources for the Alliance's insatiable thirst for power.<br>But a new hope has emerged: the Lux Libertatis, a revolutionary organisation committed to overthrowing the Apex Alliance and freeing Bleakmoore from their grasp. As a member of the Lux Libertatis, it's up to you to infiltrate the Alliance's stronghold, the Obsidian Castle, and take down their five most powerful generals. But the task won't be easy. Each raid on the castle can only be led by a single hunter from the Lux Libertatis, and if they fail to take down all five generals and clear all five floors of the castle, their free spirit is stolen by the Alliance's forces and they become enslaved to their will. You'll need to use all your skills, strategy, and cunning to take on the Apex Alliance's powerful generals. Regina and Rex, the water-wielding siblings who guard the first floor. Stellasolis, the light-wielding defender of the second floor. Impesignis, the fiery guardian of the third floor. Lignavir, the powerful second-in-command wielding a giant axe on the fourth floor. And finally, General Pax, the master of illusion and darkness who guards the fifth and final floor. Only the most skilled hunters will be able to defeat one of the five generals and earn the title of &quot;Highborn Hunter&quot;. And if you can defeat them all and liberate Bleakmoore from the Apex Alliance's rule, you'll earn the title of &quot;Father of Liberty&quot;. With challenging gameplay, a rich and immersive story, and intense battles against powerful enemies, &quot;Liberta:Rise of Freedom&quot; is a must-play for fans of fantasy, roguelike, and indie games alike.
