Each <strong>Helping Hand</strong> can be individually upgraded to give you even more <strong>Pet Points</strong>. You can also use <strong>Pet Points</strong> to purchase <strong>Items</strong>. <strong>Items</strong> are unlocked through reaching milestones and progressing through your <strong>Let's Pet Pets\u2122</strong> journey. These <strong>Items</strong> have a multitude of effects. From increasing the efficiency of manual pet petting to increasing the duration of the <strong>Pet Time Bonus</strong>. The <strong>Pet Time Bonus</strong> is a window of time which will multiply your <strong>Pet Point</strong> production across all sources. This <strong>Pet Point</strong> production multiplier will remain active for the duration of the <strong>Pet Time Bonus</strong>. As you pet pets, upgrade <strong>Helping Hands</strong>, purchase <strong>Items</strong>, and play <strong>Let's Pet Pets\u2122</strong> you will complete <strong>Quests</strong>. <strong>Quests</strong> will earn you <strong>Heart Points</strong>. <strong>Heart Points</strong> are a very valuable resource because they let you get new eggs from the <strong>Pet Shop</strong>. <strong>Eggs</strong> can hatch into a new pet or upgrade a pet you already have. These <strong>Eggs</strong> hold a variety of cute animals ranging from <strong>Anteaters</strong> to <strong>Zebras</strong>. Each pet has its own unlockable <strong>Items</strong>, <strong>Quests</strong>, and even its own <strong>Helping Hands</strong>. You continue to gain <strong>Pet Points</strong> from other pets you have bought even while you are petting a different pet. If you feel progress slowing down and need a boost, you can <strong>prestige</strong>. Activating <strong>prestige </strong>will reset all your <strong>Helping Hands</strong> and <strong>Items</strong>, but you will keep your <strong>Eggs</strong>, <strong>Pets</strong>, <strong>Quests</strong>, and <strong>Upgrades</strong>. As you can clearly see, petting pets is going to be quite the adventure.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Welcome to Let's Pet Pets","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2254600/5cc1683736efa61346dace2aceb00c3f2a0033fa.jpg"},{"name":"Growing your Family","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2254600/655c861b67b1448393cd00799ba169df4a5bc646.jpg"},{"name":"I Heart You","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2254600/dfdecf9fab7be4a9b374ba2c877d073d0235e8fb.jpg"},{"name":"Burn and Turn","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2254600/83843521a9367010194fb496c1b0f0f6d5f6a41d.jpg"},{"name":"Farmer's Friend","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2254600/4342ece01e5a58cc010d93117f57ed79289ab05d.jpg"},{"name":"Stylist's Friend","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2254600/35270f02c6ca53370a7cb6f6377d7ef31aea9e1c.jpg"},{"name":"Nutritionist's Friend","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2254600/50544e5996b032ecec63e6d58fc2a9374bb6d312.jpg"},{"name":"King of the Pets","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2254600/a7eee6b24112556c558b62391af3cb2a56abec8d.jpg"},{"name":"Emperor of the Pets","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2254600/f9183d720de728447f8a0b4735bfb72b561b973f.jpg"},{"name":"Pharaoh of the Pets","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2254600/cc325fde07cb302518045517b80fd828a8032e0c.jpg"}],"total":31},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2254600/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1712010956","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2254600/page.bg.jpg?t=1712010956","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2254600/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1712010956","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2254600/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1712010956","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Welcome to the wonderful world of <strong>Let's Pet Pets\u2122</strong>! </h2><br>This is a game where you pet pets to gain <strong>Pet Points</strong>. <strong>Pet Points</strong> can be used to purchase <strong>Helping Hands</strong>. <strong>Helping Hands</strong> will give you more <strong>Pet Points</strong> automatically every second (even while you are away).
