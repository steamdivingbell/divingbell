{"about_the_game":"CHROMA SHIFT is a cooperative, side-scrolling puzzle game, where the players utilize different colours throughout the environment to solve challenging puzzles. Set in a devastated future version of earth the players must uncover the secrets of the past and find a way to restore power to their home.<br><br>Standing in their way are co-operative color based puzzles that the two characters must overcome with clever use of their abilities and shifting between different colored energy sources. Theta, a large hydraulic based machine can smash through obstacles in his way and carry and throw heavy objects. Psi, a smaller, four armed machine, can transform and bypass security terminals to gain access to new areas.<br><br><strong>Key Features:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Cooperative Focus - Every part of the game designed with two players in mind.
