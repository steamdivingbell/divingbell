{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3383680/extras/photophore-logo-white-512.png?t=1734680449\" /> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Photophore - Chapter 1</strong> is an arcade game that oscillates between shooting, brick-breaking and reflection.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">An original point proposed by the gameplay is based on the need to manage one or several projectiles. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">These projectiles can be used to activate objects, destroy others or inflict damage on enemies. Once launched, the player has no longer control over them: if the projectiles bounce off most of the elements of the scenery, they can also be controlled by numerous elements to be discovered and mastered or... destroyed. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You will therefore have to time, synchronise, aim, shoot and make sure you recover your projectiles to progress and reach the end of each level. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Demo</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>This demo provides 9 levels with the first Photophore of the game.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Besides getting the best score, your aim is to find as many fragments of light as possible in the various game levels: the caves.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The caves are in a row and require a minimum number of fragments to enter. And a cave is only accessible if the previous one has been explored till the end.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You control a Photophore that has shards of light that can be used as projectiles to interact with the world. Thes projectiles are essential: make sure you don't lose them, otherwise you won't be able to progress!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This demo presents a selection of Caves with various gameplays.<br>You can use two saving slots, the third one gives you access to all caves (Free run).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>In this demo, you play with only one type of Photophore, which has only one projectile. So, take good care of it!</strong></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Story</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is the story of a world. A world where all light has been swallowed up. A world destroyed and fragmented, annihilated by a fatal omnipotence. Everything could have ended there... But there was one last glimmer of hope. One last glimmer. A last, precious, fragment of light. A spark that will awaken the first Photophore... </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is the story of a new world recomposed. A world recomposed in the form of a challenge, as if a return to normalcy had been a possibility from the very beginning of its alleged destruction. This first Photophore and the luminous fragments scattered throughout the spaces are proof of this. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The photophore is therefore the only element capable of travelling through this world and finding all the fragments of light. This is certainly a futile task.
