{"about_the_game":"A mecca for urban explorers, Beelitz Heilstaetten is an abandoned hospital in the forests of East Berlin. These explorers have morphed the space from a once-lushous nursing home to an eerie canvas with all sorts of stories to tell. Now you can explore it yourself, wandering through the lecture halls, operating rooms, and gathering spaces. <br />\r\nThe stories of Beelitz\u2019s walls date back to 1898 when a local insurance company purchased to land and built a tuberculosis treatment facility. The availability of relevant equipment changed the buildings use into a fully-functioning hospital during the world wars, specializing in the treatment of chemical warfare. Hitler was actually treated here for blindness during WW1, before anyone knew him as more than an injured soldier. <br />\r\nAfter the fall of the Nazi party, Berlin was split in two. East Berlin specifically fell under Russian rule in a state known as the GDR. The doctors continued practicing their skills here, officially making Beelitz the largest Soviet medical facility outside the USSR. It was operational until the fall of the GDR in 1994, after which it was abandoned and left to the elements. Explorers, like yourself, have been coming here ever since. Some have promoted the space, like the crew behind the acclaimed films The Pianist or A Cure For Wellness. Though others had not-as-kind intentions in mind! There have been several necrophilia-related murders in the past decades. Thankfully, those won\u2019t happen in Realities.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/708622/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1524762649","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/708622/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1524762649","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/708622/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1524762649","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/708622/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1524762649","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"VR Support","id":31},{"description":"Commentary available","id":14}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"A mecca for urban explorers, Beelitz Heilstaetten is an abandoned hospital in the forests of East Berlin.
