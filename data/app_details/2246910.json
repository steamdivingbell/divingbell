{"about_the_game":"A Z device core for playing text-based interactive fiction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis program currently supports most of the Version 3 Z-Machine. This is enough to play the vast majority of Infocom's catalog. Later Infocom games used version 4, 5, and 6 of the Z-Machine, and those will currently not run here. Most modern Interactive Fiction is built with a tool called Inform and usually targets version 5 at the lowest; these games currently don't work with this project. Maybe later.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2246910/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1677703042","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2246910/page.bg.jpg?t=1677703042","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2246910/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1677703042","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2246910/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1677703042","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play on Phone","id":41},{"description":"Remote Play on Tablet","id":42},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"A Z device core for playing text-based interactive fiction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis program currently supports most of the Version 3 Z-Machine.
