Collect and skip dozens of unique stones to unlock new gear, achievements, and levels. Experiment to achieve &quot;the perfect skip&quot;: adjust throw force, launch angle, and more to change how the stone skips. You'll need to factor in wind, waves, and other environmental effects, too - if you want to top the leaderboards!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Explore gorgeous, natural landscapes based on real-world locations. Hang out with your friends in casual and competitive multiplayer modes.

You can find stones by exploring areas near water - some stones can only be found in specific locations, so you'll need to explore to find them all! Once you've got a stone, you're ready to throw! Pick your spot, adjust your aim, then dial in the launch force, angle, and spin. Release your stone and watch it skip... or not! Sidewards uses realistic stone-skipping physics, so you'll need to get creative to make some throws work. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Online Features</strong> </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>NOTE: The online features in Sidewards are optional.
