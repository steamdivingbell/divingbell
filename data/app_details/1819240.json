{"about_the_game":"Short Circuit is an experimental game made in the spirit of a classic award-winning Half-Life mod Earth's Special Forces. Players compete in arena maps set around various macro-sized electronics, playing classic game modes such as Team Death Match, Free For All, Capture The Flag or unique sports game modes such as Zap-Ball.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShort Circuit features a unique style of movement and fighting mechanics. Players are competing against each other flying around at high speeds in open macro-sized electronics-themed arena maps, trying to catch each other with melee attacks, while optionally also competing to score points by capturing flags or doing other game-mode specific tasks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter a successful attack, player gains Charge, which can be activated at any time. And then, for a short time, players actions and properties (damage, speed, recharge rate etc.) are multiplied by the Charge Multiplier. The more charge you accumulate, the higher your Charge Multiplier is. Ever wanted to become super-saiyan? But use your Charge deliberately, its not easy to get and it drains fast!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring your fight, your actions will cost you your Power, and when your power drains, you have to recharge it, but be careful, you can't move when you're recharging and you become an easy target.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nManaging to have your Power high, be faster and in a better position than your opponent, while also trying to get your Charge on, is where maneuvering tactics  and split decisions come into play. Short Circuit aims to provide a unique PvP experience, with multiple factors that players will be able to master and win the fight based on their wits, instincts and reaction (or just pure luck)!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDo you have what it takes?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1819240/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730739839","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1819240/page.bg.jpg?t=1730739839","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1819240/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730739839","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1819240/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730739839","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Short Circuit is an experimental game made in the spirit of a classic award-winning Half-Life mod Earth's Special Forces.
