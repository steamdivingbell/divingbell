{"about_the_game":"Flying through the endless desert in your airship, your engine breakdown, and you crash in a desert where there is almost no food or water. Soon you realize that this is not the only problem you have and you need to start repairing the airship using available tools and materials. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1426870/extras/small-steampunk-era.png?t=1728687767\" /><br><br>You will have to survive in the harsh world of the steampunk era, with a constant shortage of resources. Explore new lands, look for caves with minerals, explore the ruins for food and water. Build factories by modules, creating and assembling each piece. Explore new technologies, and develop new engines. Exlore various fuel technologies. Protect your camp from the invasion of mechanical robots that are constantly eager to dismantle your factories for parts. Research and improve your technologies and factories. <br><br>Create weapons of your dreams from gunpowder pistols to grenade launchers. Craft cartridges manually by mixing powder ingredients in different proportions. Melt ore, blow glass, study chemistry, and make explosives. Cut wood, mine ore, dig, shoot, build and repair, create drones to transport resources, build transport systems and more.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1426870/extras/small-img-10+.png?t=1728687767\" /><br><br>Powder pistols, revolvers, Winchesters, shotguns, sniper rifles, machine guns, Gatling guns, grenade launchers, and more.<br>Want a weapon with 2 barrels - please, 3\u20265 or even 10 barrels, it depends on your imagination.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1426870/extras/Gun.png?t=1728687767\" /><br><br>Make barrels of different diameters and cast bullets of different calibers.<br>Collect various factories from hundreds of different spare parts. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1426870/extras/Details.png?t=1728687767\" /><br><br>Fill your engines with the fuel and use the oil grease so that they don't rust or break down.<br>Repair damaged engines and restore factories replacing broken parts. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1426870/extras/Factories4a.gif?t=1728687767\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Improve your character by raising his skill level.<br></li><li>Develop an exoskeleton and upgrade it to carry heavy parts in your inventory.<br></li><li>Build and manage a complete chemical laboratory, mix, heat, cool reagents for different effects.<br></li><li>Cut, mine, dig, shoot, build, research, design, craft, explore and more!  </li></ul><br><strong><u>In this game, everything you will see, all the tools, factories, engines, every gear, all this will be created and assembled by your hands from scratch.</u></strong>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1426870/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728687767","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1426870/page.bg.jpg?t=1728687767","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1426870/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728687767","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1426870/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728687767","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":1778900,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Flying through the endless desert in your airship, your engine breakdown, and you crash in a desert where there is almost no food or water.
