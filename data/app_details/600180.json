{"about_the_game":"<i>Light Strike Array</i> is a crystalpunk battle arena inspired by martial arts\u2014and powered by VR. Featuring a one-of-a-kind movement system, a multifaceted team-based game mode, and a wide spectrum of motion controlled weapons, <i>Light Strike Array</i> challenges players in ways never experienced before.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay: <strong>Heartbreak</strong></h2><br>In <i>Light Strike Array</i> two Bands of up to three Shards each <strong>fight\u200b \u200bto\u200b \u200bdestroy\u200b \u200bthe\u200b \u200benemy\u200b \u200bHeart\u200b.</strong> Each Heart is protected by a powerful barrier called the Corona, which scatters the light of foes that would wander too close. In order to pierce the Corona, the teams must first gather strength by mining a resource called <strong>Salt</strong>\u200b.<br><br><strong>Salt</strong>\u200b is used to crystallize new tools and weapons. Players fight for control of Salt beds scattered throughout the level, which produce <strong>Salt\u200b \u200bcrystals</strong>\u200b periodically. By relaying Salt back to the base and dissolving it in the Well, the Heart grows in strength, and the Band gains access to more powerful tools and weapons. Under the protective cover of the final tool, the <strong>Censer</strong>, Shards can enter the Corona and strike at the enemy heart!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Torchwave Locomotion System</h2><br><i>Light Strike Array</i> features an original locomotion system called <strong>Torchwave</strong>\u200b. Each map is broken into a series of <strong>Cells</strong>\u200b, hexagonal platforms under 2 meters across. Normally, players are restricted to the confines of their Cell. <br><br>However, by pulling the trigger, a Shard forms a <strong>Torch</strong>\u200b, which can be cast toward another Cell. If the throw is true, the Shard phases out of reality. Now intangible, the player is invisibly teleported to the destination. When the torch arrives, the Shard rematerializes - but unless they <strong>turn around and catch\u200b \u200bthe\u200b \u200bincoming\u200b \u200bTorch</strong>, they &quot;crash,&quot; leaving them momentarily defenseless!<br><br>A competitive game is only as deep as its movement system is robust\u2014and VR locomotion is a brave new world. Light Strike Array tackles these challenges together: the teleportation-derived design <i>mitigates the risk of motion sickness</i>, and the physical act of throwing the torch <i>adds a natural skill cost</i> to long-range movement, incentivising players to mix teleportation and local movement.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tools and Weapons</h2><br>With each completed Pillar of Salt, the Heart forms new <strong>tools</strong>\u200b \u200bfor the Band. <i>Light Strike Array</i> features a brilliant spectrum of tools and weapons, each with unique abilities <i>balanced around their physicality</i>. For example, a patient and precise Shard might take the <strong>Rod</strong>\u200b \u200bto intimidate and blast enemies from afar. A more agile and aggressive player might wield the <strong>Sword</strong>\u200b, a close-range weapon with a wide variety of sweeping strikes. Naturally, for those looking for something more straightforward, there's always the <strong>Bow</strong>.<br><br>Not every tool is a weapon, however! The <strong>Vial</strong>\u200b is a portable reserve that dissolves and transports halite crystals in bulk. A catalyst for rapid Salt growth, its usefulness is only limited by your skill with the Torch. For the tactically-minded, consider the <strong>Focus</strong>\u200b. Weave mystic signs to shape your inner light, and invoke powerful spells to support your allies.<br><br>The tools vary greatly in physicality, technicality, and versatility. Only by knowing your allies\u2019 strengths and weaknesses, and picking the right tool for the right job, can your Band outshine all the rest!","achievements":{"total":0},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/600180/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1523120331","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/600180/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1523120331","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/600180/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1523120331","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/600180/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1523120331","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<i>Light Strike Array</i> is a crystalpunk battle arena inspired by martial arts\u2014and powered by VR.
