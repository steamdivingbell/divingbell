{"about_the_game":"<i>Transfigured is a 2D side-scroller psychological horror game.</i><br><br>After falling asleep on the subway on your way to work, you wake up in a desolate metro station. But be careful - you are not alone. Humanoid monstrosities are stalking you from the dark. Armed with nothing other than a dying flashlight, it's up to you to claw your way back to the safety of civilization by heading deeper and deeper into the nightmare.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>EXPLORE</strong></h2>Explore your surroundings to find the tools you'll need to progress. Make your way back to places you've already been to and use new tools to access previously locked-off rooms. Familiarize yourself with every nook and cranny you encounter, as hiding spots are as sparse as they are vital to increasing your odds of survival. And most importantly, take care to avoid the monsters lurking just outside your sight.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>ESCAPE</strong></h2>Figure out what's happening - where is this nightmarish place? How did you even get here? Why are you confronted with this hellscape? Were these abominations once human, and what happened to them? Unravel the mysteries of the nightmare to increase your odds of making it out alive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>SURVIVE</strong></h2>You are unarmed. The creatures stalking you are relentless, constantly prowling hallways on the hunt for you. Your only hope of survival is to hide before being seen, or to run and use your wits if it's already too late. Your intimate knowledge of your immediate surroundings can be the difference between life and whatever awaits you if you get caught.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2752210/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724807159","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2752210/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1724807159","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2752210/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724807159","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2752210/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724807159","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"This game contains strong horror themes including body and psychological horror."},"detailed_description":"<i>Transfigured is a 2D side-scroller psychological horror game.</i><br><br>After falling asleep on the subway on your way to work, you wake up in a desolate metro station.
