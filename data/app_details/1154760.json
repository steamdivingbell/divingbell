Unlike his family, he is happy to focus on managing his land. The people he governs love him, due to a combination of his own bold personality and his skill in battle. He is determined to make his holdings a place of peace and prosperity for any and all who wish to seek haven there. He feels confident that his imperial kin will get the situation under control, and whilst he will defend them, he is more concerned with keeping his people and his territory safe. Owners of Mandate of Heaven will also be able to begin a campaign in 190 CE as Liu Chong, and his historical conflict with Yuan Shu.<br><br><br><strong>Unique resource: Fortitude</strong><br>Liu Chong has a unique resource called fortitude. This rises as he fights battles, and confers a suite of increasingly powerful military bonuses for his troops.<br><br><strong>Unique Faction Mechanic: Trophies</strong><br>By achieving a proscribed series of feats in battle, Liu Chong can unlock trophies which grant unique bonus effects. Liu Chong can choose a limited set of trophies to display in order to gain these bonuses.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Lu Zhi</h2><br><br>One of the most preeminent scholars of the Han Dynasty, Lu Zhi made a name for himself as an excellent teacher, with such students as Liu Bei and Gongsun Zan studying under him.

Zeal is maintained by capturing counties and fighting battles. <br><br>Fervour represents the rising support of the common people for the rebellion, and the growing instability this causes the Han. Fervour increases in a region due to the presence of Yellow Turbans forces and buildings, causing increasingly punitive public order penalties for Han factions.
