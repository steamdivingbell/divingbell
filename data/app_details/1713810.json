{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Lumencraft: A Top-Down Rogue-Like Shooter with Base Building &amp; Tower Defense</h2><br><strong>Lumencraft is a unique combination of a top-down shooter and base building game with tower defense elements. Enter procedurally generated levels with a fully destructible environment to build your base, dig some tunnels and find the precious Lumen - humanity's only chance for survival.</strong><br><br><strong>BECOME THE SAVIOR OF MANKIND</strong><br>For two centuries the remnants of humanity struggle to survive without electricity and light. But there is a spark of hope. In 2221 the survivors find Lumen \u2013 a crystal of high energy potency that may be the last chance for mankind. Scouts, brave miners, established an underground settlement and voyage into the dark to reach the nearby Lumen deposits. But the darkness consumed them, as the subterranean caves and tunnels hold as much danger as salvation.
