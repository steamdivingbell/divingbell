talent in all its aspects. Its graphics are beautiful, as is its music and the symbolism it employs in its worlds. The sensitivity of its story and dialogue also do a great job of connecting with the emotions of anyone, whether they have experienced the disease or not.&quot; - 7/10 IGN Spain</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">&quot;It's a memorable game that will take you on an emotional journey. The story of Henry and Enid is engaging and will drive you to play until the very end, and the gameplay will challenge you. Every element of the game came together to tell a moving story and also show what it's like to live with Alzheimer's. Inner Ashes is certainly one of those games you should consider playing.&quot; - 7.5/10 KeenGamer</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">&quot;With a graphic display, especially in the dreamlike scenarios, a superb artistic design that reflects a mind that is losing its memories. As for the sound, we again feel the love and care in this title, with an excellent Spanish dubbing, which conveys emotions in each of the voice actors and all emphasised by melodies and themes that pierce your heart, especially in certain moments.&quot; - 7/10 Comuesp</p></p><br><h1>WISHLIST</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1755340/extras/WishlistAction.gif?t=1728918316\" /></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1755340/extras/header_logo_ia.gif?t=1728918316\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1755340/extras/banner_wishlist_en.png?t=1728918316\" /><br><br>Inner Ashes is a first-person narrative adventure in which the player experiences how Alzheimer\u2019s affects people and their memories through an emotive story of a father and daughter set in dreamlike sequences.<br><br>The main character, Henry, must go on an introspective journey through two different realities on his quest to remember why he and his only daughter, Enid, have been estranged for so long.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1755340/extras/steam-sec_mind.png?t=1728918316\" /><br><br>Explore Henry's mind manifested as several dreamlike islands that represent different symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s, and unlock his memories by solving puzzles.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1755340/extras/gif_ExploraSuMente_islaRosa.gif?t=1728918316\" /><br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1755340/extras/steam-sec_story.png?t=1728918316\" /><br><br>Find out the truth about Henry and Enid by collecting the fragments of their past.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1755340/extras/gif_Enfermedad_PostitsCocina.gif?t=1728918316\" /><br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1755340/extras/steam-sec_condition.png?t=1728918316\" /><br><br>Experience the daily life of an Alzheimer's patient and confront their day-to-day struggles.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1755340/extras/gif_Desentra\u00f1aHistoria_foto.gif?t=1728918316\" /><br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1755340/extras/steam-sec_characters.png?t=1728918316\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1755340/extras/Personajes_steam_EN.png?t=1728918316\" /><br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1755340/extras/steam-sec_mechanics.png?t=1728918316\" /><br><br>The mechanics of this game are based on the techniques used to help Alzheimer\u2019s patients alleviate the symptoms of the disease.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Post-it notes help Henry to recognize items and remember how to use them.</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1755340/extras/gif_Mecanicas_Postits.gif?t=1728918316\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Tangram puzzles stimulate Henry's memory and unlock important recollections of his life with Enid.</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1755340/extras/gif_Mecanicas_Tangram.gif?t=1728918316\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1755340/extras/banner_socials.png?t=1728918316\" />","developers":["Calathea Game Studio"],"dlc":[2891670],"genres":[{"description":"Adventure","id":"25"},{"description":"Indie","id":"23"}],"header_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1755340/header.jpg?t=1728918316","is_free":false,"legal_notice":"\u00a9 2022 CALATHEA GAME STUDIO.
