{"about_the_game":"Vast Shadows is in prison for more than the evil deeds most prisoners serve time for.  His dark past involves the deception of innocent people to siphon their valuables and their most prized possessions.  Now this mysterious being camouflaged by his own dark past of lurking in the shadows seeks to escape the confines of the prison walls that limit his criminal freedom.  Winning the prison tournaments based on breaking bricks faster than other inmates is so vital to Vast Shadows that he will again rely on his deceptive powers to gain an advantage!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVast Shadows offers a unique ability to split off multiple shadows of balls approaching his opponent to cause confusion.  Should his opponent target one of his ball shadows thinking it's a real ball, he'll laugh as the real ball slips past and back under his control with ease.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1131370/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1586604163","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1131370/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1586604163","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1131370/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1586604163","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1131370/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1586604163","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"Mature content and humor that is intended for a mature audience."},"detailed_description":"Vast Shadows is in prison for more than the evil deeds most prisoners serve time for.
