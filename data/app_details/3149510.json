{"about_the_game":"Creepmoon is a SF roguelike in a 2D top-down pixel look. After a crash landing on a free drifting moon you must enter an underground complex teeming with giant creepy-crawlies. While roaming the complex, you use the explosives of the decentralized self-destruct system to get rid of the creatures. You also find out what purpose the prepared moon serves.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Genre</h2><br>This is a roguelike with permadeath, so it's all about survival. However, you can unlock some levels as starting levels. The game is fair: if you prepare well and proceed carefully, you have the best chances.<br>You won't have any firearms, only grenades, booby traps, etc. that you craft from items you find.<br>The game pauses when you are looking at the map, but not when you are busy with your equipment. When tidying up or crafting, you have to be careful.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Visuals</h2><br>The game has a top-down 2D view. The levels have a low-res pixel look, while the menus and HUD are displayed in normal resolution.<br>In places there may be total darkness, but you can procure light sources.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Physics</h2><br>Physics plays a major role, not least in the effect and depiction of explosions. Smoke spreads and partially obscures your view. Objects and carcass parts are pushed away. You can find cover behind pillars and corners.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3149510/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728284955","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3149510/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1728284955","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3149510/633dbc1060b3395ad31602a013f8d6e0a3651752/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728284955","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3149510/633dbc1060b3395ad31602a013f8d6e0a3651752/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728284955","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"In all levels of the game you can see how giant bugs, spiders, lizards and the like are killed by explosions.
