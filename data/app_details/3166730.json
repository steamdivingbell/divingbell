Feel free to practice your planning skills and think several steps ahead to create a perfect route for every character. Or just try different ways and see which one works. The game doesn\u2019t punish you and encourages the retry by allowing you to undo each action while solving the puzzle.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Carefully crafted world</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Enjoy the peaceful setting with simple, non-stressful tasks. Participate in festivities and occasionally find some secrets hidden in the woods.

Complete them all in the order you choose. All puzzles are grouped into four seasons of the year, and it\u2019s up to you which season to explore first.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Development plans</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game is currently in development, and the plans are to release it for desktop platforms by the end of 2025.
