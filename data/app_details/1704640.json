The balance of power in the skies continues to shift, back and forth between the allies and Germany. The battle for air superiority will continue until the United States enters the war and fills the skies with hundreds of aircraft.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis classic game will test both your strategic command and aerial combat skills. Plan your strategy, goals, and routes on the overhead tactical map, and then head into the cockpit for side-scrolling dogfights, squadron-to-squadron battles, and eagle-eye bombing runs<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game includes 20 historically accurate, and 34 fictional campaigns, providing hours and hours of gameplay. A detailed campaign editor lets you create even more campaigns, designing battlefields, assigning planes and pilots, defining the rules and even writing the campaign narrative. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Ancient Art of War in the Skies is based on the writings of Sun Tzu, who wrote the military strategy and tactics masterpiece The Art of War. The game is a fantastic, early example of a blended strategy and action title.  Will you destroy your enemies factories in order to gain numerical superiority?
