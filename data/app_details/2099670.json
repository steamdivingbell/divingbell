{"about_the_game":"You and your crew have been shipwrecked on a tropical island in the late 1600s. At the beginning of the adventure, you find yourself with only a few basic supplies, including ropes, sticks, and stones.<br><br><strong>Set Up Your Camp and Expand:</strong> Gather resources on islands and seas. Build new Buildings. Grow your pirate camp by building buildings like Carpenter, Blacksmith etc.<br><br><strong>Survive with your crew:</strong> As the captain, you must survive first. Build new fields for your crews. Organize and train your crews. Give them tasks.<br><br><strong>Raid enemy factions and capture their bases:</strong> You are not alone on the islands. Raid the bases of enemy pirate captains. In addition to you, 3 different pirate captains fight among themselves for a total of more than 50 different bases and outposts.<br><br><strong>Solve the mysteries of the island and the surrounding seas:</strong> You will learn the stories of 7 pirate captains mentioned in the legends. Dig graves, follow the maps and explore the surroundings to find the treasure they hide.<br><br>Your first priority is to find food and water to survive. You can forage for berries and fruits on the island, but these will only provide limited sustenance. To truly thrive, you will need to start growing crops and raising animals.<br>To do this, you will need to clear a field and start planting. You can use the sticks and stones you found to make rudimentary tools, such as a stone ax, to help you clear the land. As the game progresses, you will be able to craft more advanced tools and weapons, including a pirate sword, to help you in your tasks.<br><br>In addition to hunger and thirst, you will also have to deal with other dangers on the island. Wild animals, such as crocodiles and bears, roam the land and can be a threat to your crew. And, of course, there are other pirate crews on the island who will stop at nothing to claim the land and resources for themselves.<br><br>You will need to be careful and strategic in order to survive. Build a sturdy shelter to protect your crew from the island natives and other dangers. Hunt for food and gather resources to sustain yourself. And, when necessary, defend yourself and your crew from other pirates.<br><br>With skill and cunning, you can survive on the island and thrive as a pirate crew. But be warned: the challenges on this island are many, and only the strongest and most resourceful crews will survive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Basic Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Build shelter by cutting trees to survive on the deserted island.
