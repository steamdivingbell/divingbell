{"about_the_game":"(Note: This game is a direct continuation of the story of Crimson Gray.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLizzie has it all: a loving boyfriend, a beautiful collection of knives, and an intense desire to murder. She's escaped the conspiracy that forced her to kill in self-defense, but now she needs to adjust to normal college life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll Lizzie wants is to act like a normal couple, graduate from university, and get married. But a committed relationship isn't enough to stabilize her, and she finds herself spending a lot of time with her knives.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis visual novels plunges you into the mind of a deeply unstable young woman, viewed entirely from her skewed perspective. Your task is to find a way for her to be a normal student, a supportive partner, and not a serial killer. This is a short visual novel with an emphasis on unreliable narration and subtle consequences of the player's actions.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"College Days","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/894460/f9629a242b2c500077ccf9211141cbaf0f3e0901.jpg"},{"name":"Protecting Him","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/894460/f4ef72ed5f8b56c07f51c179c0e27d91eced1ebc.jpg"},{"name":"Defending Him","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/894460/da34da48528f4cca8f8ae75789916fd7fb1deee8.jpg"},{"name":"Supportive","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/894460/8eec9422fbfaa347539779012fc42f5745d8dfc0.jpg"},{"name":"Mrs. Kelsey","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/894460/7c6da378e0cbc3b672f68ce39c51c12df05a26c3.jpg"},{"name":"Digital Murder","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/894460/752ab3f0ce71055821f556df618c475196830379.jpg"},{"name":"Library Fun","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/894460/2333631d3420f457054de378c066141545a7b141.jpg"},{"name":"Bachelorette Party","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/894460/239bee99c74024078039822d7e353a3d1402376e.jpg"},{"name":"True Wedding","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/894460/16de0b502c270017bb16c4ca347385596c7b3682.jpg"}],"total":9},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/894460?t=1726258138","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/894460/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1726258138","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/894460/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726258138","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/894460/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726258138","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"(Note: This game is a direct continuation of the story of Crimson Gray.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLizzie has it all: a loving boyfriend, a beautiful collection of knives, and an intense desire to murder.
