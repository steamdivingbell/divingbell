{"about_the_game":"AC-130 Gunship \u2013 so far (before the official premiere An-12 Aurora) is the most powerful carrier of artillery armament in the world. Moreover, this equipment has been verified in many conflicts fought in Europe, Africa and Asia,  as AC-130 had its baptism of fire  in 1967 in Vietnam. Despite his 53 completed years, aircraft is doing well and is continuously updated with new termovision systems, night-vision and modern passive air defense systems. All those aircraft construction changes and improvements have been also included in the game.

Additionally,  feature, that distinguishes this plane is installation of armament in two turrets that are placed under aircrafts fuselage. Application of this idea gives possibility to fire the enemy simultaneously from both sides of fuselage as well as directly from under the plane, which makes construction of this aircraft, in its category, most advanced in the world. Basic characteristics of this plane were transferred from the project from beginning of 90\u2019s, in which the carrier of armament was suppose to be Il-114 (TOP). Additional feature, that puts this innovative construction on 1st place is totally automatized arms loading, which allowed to significantly increase the rate of fire and minimize number of crew to the minimum necessary.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1466310/extras/AC130_Gif_07.gif?t=1694459548\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1466310/extras/pudnr7_I114TOP.jpg  ?t=1694459548\" /><br>Y-9 Hawk was constructed on a base of manufactured on license aircraft An-12 which construction was self developed by Chinese by changing among others engine, propellers and avionics.
