The game is set somewhere in the Belt where there are several large asteroids in the proximity of each other. We have made many large high-quality asteroids of several kilometers (and several miles) in diameter. You can land on the surface of any of these asteroids and mine them. We have put quite a bit of effort into making the asteroids realistic.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Ore","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2114830/550d4f10aa1f4113c79fd7fda6d3a736d009dd53.jpg"},{"name":"Spacesuit 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2114830/1c001d12429a6f35c00e52b0afd5356864634745.jpg"},{"name":"Spacesuit 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2114830/4947749f5a64c39d668b3342667c3c5918eacbaf.jpg"},{"name":"Spacesuit 3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2114830/c1ddc1c63f07629f72405b29b6880db60c1937b7.jpg"},{"name":"Station upgrade 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2114830/183eb9b2da4c0671a7b5e0f5d3a4f7a77b3d6156.jpg"},{"name":"Station upgrade 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2114830/ebabe2b01dbfdc65ed569580d99ab950a7200947.jpg"},{"name":"Spaceship","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2114830/b2cd3ce42aa9688a5fa242e6ae6e55313f10df3c.jpg"},{"name":"Spaceship upgrade 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2114830/3ea21ac69ecef8c4b22a9ec7673cb8c237c90f9c.jpg"},{"name":"Spaceship upgrade 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2114830/c68d835d9124bc3d2ed6dab485332562cddafacf.jpg"},{"name":"Solar panel","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2114830/8e70874fdeaefb8ff4318646086af3a9406ba1bd.jpg"}],"total":38},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2114830/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728147417","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2114830/page.bg.jpg?t=1728147417","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2114830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728147417","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2114830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728147417","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The year is 2040.
