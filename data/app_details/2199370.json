{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Daemons of Khorne have arrived as a playable faction in Battlesector! </h2>The warp-fuelled manifestations of rage and violence are the latest playable faction in Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector. Eight murderous units, including the dreaded Daemon Prince, are available to bring Chaos to the galaxy. Bring your armies of the Blood Legions to bear in skirmish and multiplayer battles, or to a Planetary Supremacy campaign.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Blood Legions</h2>Bloodletters and Bloodcrushers are ready to charge into battle fuelled by rage and an insatiable need for slaughter, while the Flesh Hounds hunt without mercy those who have dared to offend the Blood God. These horrors are led into battle by the Bloodmaster: powerful Daemons that use dark rituals to create a rent in the fabric of reality, allowing more of their kind to pour forth and shed blood for their ever-thirsty god.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hellforged Machines of War</h2>The Skull Cannon, a war machine forged in the furnaces of the Blood God\u2019s throne, grinds across the battlefield collecting the skulls of the dead to be used as ammunition for its long-range volleys of fire and death. Nobody is safe from the mighty Harvester Cannon of the Soul Grinder, a diabolic fusion of daemon and machine, firing volleys of pure hatred.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Champions of Chaos</h2>The Blood God can always count on his most exalted champions: the Bloodthirsters and Daemon Princes. <br><br>Created from the infinite anger of the Lord of War and armed with a Great Axe of Khorne, the mightly Bloodthirster stalks the battlefield, its arrival heralding the death of all who stand before them. These Greater Daemons also bring a range of special abilities to enhance their power, whilst their massive wings allow them to fly across the battlefield to seek more skulls for the Skull Throne.<br><br>A Daemon Prince was once a mortal, now given the gift of Daemonhood by the Dark God they worship. Upon being granted this precious gift, each Daemon Prince is endowed with murderously sharp talons, in addition to an Infernal Cannon and the deadly melee weapons they carry; none stand a chance against the Hellforged Sword or Daemonic Axe.<br><br>Every unit features distinctive, finely crafted models and unique special abilities. In addition, access brand new HQ abilities that benefit the entire faction: Aura of Terror, Echoes of Endless Fury and Blood Tithe.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2199370/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736418794","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2199370/page.bg.jpg?t=1736418794","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2199370/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736418794","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2199370/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736418794","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Daemons of Khorne have arrived as a playable faction in Battlesector! </h2>The warp-fuelled manifestations of rage and violence are the latest playable faction in Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector.
