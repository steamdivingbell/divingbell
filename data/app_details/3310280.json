{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">New Active Object is a genre-hopping game and multimedia experience synced to the 40-minute genre-hopping Jay Tholen (Dropsy, Hypnospace Outlaw) album of the same name. Remember those auto-playing apps that would appear when you popped pretty much any big album from 1995-2002 into your CD-ROM drive? Remember amateur Klik &amp; Play, The Games Factory, or Game Maker games from around the same time period? New Active Object is inspired by both.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3310280/extras/lilCD.png?t=1734347573\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><br>While the game is <i>only</i> 40 minutes long (if you keep the pitch at 1.0) there are enough secrets and missable details to justify multiple playthroughs.
