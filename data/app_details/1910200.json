{"about_the_game":"You wake up in the Eigen Space, a mysterious digital world where reality just feels altered... and all you got to do is ESCAPE IT. <br>Run , shoot, dodge, loot, kill, and fall with style down a procedurally generated environment that changes in every play through. Find gear and unlock powerful abilities that make every run a little bit easier every time.<br><br>This is no ordinary auto runner. Here we got:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">An Actual story</h2><br>If you are gunna have to play an auto runner at least do it while following a story line! Little by little , run by run you'll uncover the full reason why you are running in the first place, Whether it is by normal level progression, interactive cutscenes or bit and pieces of lore scattered throughout the world, You'll have plenty to read and put together yourself. Plus no story line is complete without a quest log to guide you in the right direction.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Shifts In Gameplay</h2><br>Running and avoiding obstacles isn't the only thing you'll be doing. There will be moments of combat so prepare to take out your weapon and shoot your way though enemy infested corridors from a third person over the shoulder perspective. There will be moments to investigate and explore some areas, maybe use items you have found on your way there. And Boss battles, where what you've learned, weapons you've acquired or super abilities unlocked will all be put to the test. Speaking of weapons...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Loot! Lots Of Loot! </h2><br>Not only do the levels have a slight procedural generational nature to it , but so do the items found in the world. Find armor, weapons, accessories, powerups and consumables. Weapons have a chance to drop in various levels ranging from common, to rare, all the way up to more powerful exotic weapons.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Also Dying... Lots Of Dying...</h2><br>But don't worry failing is all part of the game. Failing unlocks more interactions with Npc's to further the story. Every time you die in the eigen space, a funny thing happens. You wind up back where you started but you get to keep all the goodies you found along the way. So don't fear when the old game over screen pops up!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1910200/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1651755256","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1910200/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1651755256","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1910200/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1651755256","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1910200/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1651755256","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You wake up in the Eigen Space, a mysterious digital world where reality just feels altered... and all you got to do is ESCAPE IT. <br>Run , shoot, dodge, loot, kill, and fall with style down a procedurally generated environment that changes in every play through.
