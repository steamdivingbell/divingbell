{"about_the_game":"Costly Adventure blends a casual Match-3 game with roguelite elements. Instead of geometric shapes, the player matches the party members to perform attacks. Through talent choices each character can contribute to the battle in their own way.

Especially with Troll guarding every single bridge and demanding payment. The further you go, the more expensive it gets. Luckily, you can beat the gold out of the plenty treasure chests that are laying around.
