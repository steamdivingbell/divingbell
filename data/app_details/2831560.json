Each mode has its own set of unique features and challenges, making the game an exciting experience. Please read the sections below if you need more information about the game.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2831560/extras/INFORMATION_STORY-min.jpg?t=1715714111\" /><br><strong><u>STORY MODE</u></strong><br>The story is about Jack, who sets out to rescue his wife Jane from a zombie attack caused by a virus outbreak. Jack's ultimate goal is to take Jane to the safe zone without infection. However, things don't go as planned initially, and they must go on an adventure across multiple islands to reach their destination. During their journey, they come across other survivors who share valuable information that can help people fight against the virus. They also encounter soldiers from the organization responsible for the catastrophe. The story progresses after each level, portrayed like a movie.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2831560/extras/ARENA.jpg?t=1715714111\" /><br><strong><u>ARENA MODE</u></strong><br>In the game, Arena mode offers an exciting and challenging experience where you have to fight against waves of zombies and soldiers. This mode has three different arenas, each with varying levels of difficulty- easy, medium, and hard. Additionally, every arena has a different location, which makes the gameplay even more engaging. By completing certain waves, you can earn Steam achievements. As you progress through the waves, the challenges become increasingly difficult, with each subsequent wave being tougher than the previous one.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"ZOMBIE KILLER","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2831560/7762c7b0e400366145116c7c01f00c929e54445e.jpg"},{"name":"STORY PASSER","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2831560/b0f26468dd236330ccdd79502df256c749b0caf3.jpg"},{"name":"BOSS KILLER","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2831560/50340f5e0cda9f93631a8c97b771bc88bf9f8ca7.jpg"}],"total":3},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2831560/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1715714111","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2831560/page.bg.jpg?t=1715714111","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2831560/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1715714111","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2831560/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1715714111","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2831560/extras/INFORMATION.jpg?t=1715714111\" /><br><strong><u>ABOUT THE GAME</u></strong><br>This game is a horror-action third-person shooter that offers two distinct modes of play: story mode and arena mode.
