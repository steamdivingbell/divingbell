{"about_the_game":"The Dwarves of Glistenveld is a Colony Strategy game about clans of dwarves trying to live and expand underground. Manage your own clan and help them explore, mine, forage, fight, and build a home in a forgotten underworld!<br><br>Goblins have invaded the land of Glistenveld and the dwarven city Glistenborg is besieged! Flanked on all sides, the surviving dwarves flee underground. Cut off and divided, they split into different clans, each with their own ideals and strategies to survive. Goblins are now searching the tunnels under the city to rid the land of dwarves for good! Will you reunite and work together with the other clans, or take the reigns and seek to regain power for yourself?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore Hidden Depths</h2>The world of Glistenveld has many discrete mechanics and behaviours to learn about, and your actions will sometimes have lasting consequences. There are 3 difficulty options if you wish for a more (or less) forgiving experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> </h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/805520/extras/depths.png?t=1719853765\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Meet Quirky Dwarves</h2>Each dwarf is born unique, with generated traits and details that give them their own personality. You will find that some do better at certain jobs than others, or are impacted by their surroundings, or just simply act differently from one another. With over 2,000 possible combinations of impactful traits, you'll be hard-pressed to find two dwarves the same!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> </h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/805520/extras/quirky_dwarves.gif?t=1719853765\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hone Skills &amp; Gain Abilities</h2>Your dwarves gain experience working in each of the four classes: Miners, Foragers, Engineers &amp; Warriors. Miners dig through rocks &amp; walls, Foragers gather wood &amp; food as well as cook, Engineers craft items &amp; build structures, and Warriors fight off enemies.
