On top of that, extra character sets are included for cars, vehicles, treasure chests, switches, and special effects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTwenty-six tilesets-- including autotiled water, terrain and buildings-- provide a variety of options for creative locations. Forests, caves, towns and cities are a given-- there's also tiles for a school, a science lab, a fast-food restaraunt, bathrooms, and more.
