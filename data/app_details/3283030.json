{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Doyle (Jason Isaacs) is a grouchy, self-important gargoyle with a chip on his shoulder \u2013 quite literally, as he was damaged in a fall during installation above the cathedral\u2019s main entrance.

Hundreds of years later, as bulldozers surround the cathedral for demolition, both must confront who they really are and what their lives add up to.
