change.<br />\r\nYou can only move your pieces in 4 directions: up, down, left, and right, and only to where your opponent's pieces are. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo move your pieces, left-click on the one you want to move to select it.<br />\r\nWhile still clicking, flick the piece in the direction you want to move it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you have surrounded an opponent's piece and it has become a dead piece, the piece will have an X mark on it.<br />\r\nPieces with an X on them cannot be moved.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the event that your piece gets accidentally surrounded by your opponent, your piece will become dead as well.<br />\r\nThis game requires anticipating ahead of time the situation after pieces have been moved. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf both you and your opponent wind up with 3 or
