{"about_the_game":"In the Mens Lab, an unknown &quot;Creator&quot; comes up with Extra and other creatures and releases them into a confined space to create the Dominant species.<br>You are one of the artificially propagated creatures dwelling in one of the MENS laboratories set to identify your adaptation skills in an unknown environment. This small closed laboratory has an artificially recreated environment like in one of the universe's planets that back in the past ended up creating life \u2014 Earth.

Its feature lies in its ability to reproduce artificial objects and its outstanding body development by assimilating food and its distribution into basic elements. The player will have to face numerous life-threatening situations, survive in non-standard conditions, show ingenuity and ability to analyze.
