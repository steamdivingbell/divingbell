{"about_the_game":"STATIK is a 4 player online co-op horror game. A group of kids in the 1980's find an abandoned house with a shelf full of VHS tapes. When each tape is played, the events of the movie start to play out in real life. Will you escape with your lives or become another victim of the static. You can choose your ending by finding the maps secrets or defeating the killer. <br><br>Each level has multiple different endings and many easter eggs to find. No playthrough will ever be the same with the killer always making different decisions and items being spawned randomly.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">STORY</h2>In the boring town of Belleville, most summer days are spent by the lake swimming or biking around town. One day, you and your friends discover an old abandoned house in the woods. It's a tall house, furniture and interior untouched like the owners just vanished and left it trapped in time. Inside, the beige wallpaper is decaying and peeling off. When you get to the living room, there is a big tv set on top of a vhs player. Next to the tv you find a shelf containing Vhs tapes with no label or name. You call your friends over to play the tape, thinking nothing of it...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GAMEPLAY</h2>In STATIK, each VHS tape is a different horror movie that plays out in the old house. You will be hiding from the killer while he tries to hunt you down and send you into the static. Find clues on how to send the killer into the static or find clues on how to escape throughout the map. The closer you get to escaping or if you're brave enough to face the killer, he will get smarter and he will be able to hear you better. Be stealthy and quiet or you will be sent into the STATIK.<br><br><br>-  Co-Op Game<br>    When playing a Co-Op game, stick together to solve the mysteries of the house and help each other by using a medkit to get a player out of the STATIK.<br><br>-  Single Player Game<br>    If you're brave enough to play alone, you cannot get yourself out of the STATIK and have to solve puzzles by yourself. It's possible but significantly harder.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1570350/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1615348359","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1570350/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1615348359","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1570350/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1615348359","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1570350/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1615348359","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Includes Source SDK","id":16}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"STATIK is a 4 player online co-op horror game.
