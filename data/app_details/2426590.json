Crafting is another key aspect of the game, allowing you to create weapons, tools, and equipment from the resources you gather. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTrading with the local village is necessary to acquire new resources and supplies, but you'll need to negotiate effectively to get what you need without giving up too much in return. You'll also need to build and maintain your skills in various aspects of survival, including hunting, fishing, farming, and construction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nModern tools and equipment such as a pickup truck, solar panels, and communication devices can be incredibly useful in your quest for survival, but they also come with their own set of challenges.
