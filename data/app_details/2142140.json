Too bad Fritz doesn't know anything about chess! But together with his quick-witted cousin Bianca, he takes up the challenge - after all, the honour of the royal house is at stake.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">On the road with King Kaleidoscope</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2142140/extras/LearnChess6.jpg?t=1694078461\" /><br>So it begins. Fritz and Bianca set off for the chess arena where the duel is to take place. On their way, they meet King Kaleidoscope, an old friend of the family. Of course, the noble gentleman is happy to assist them in their difficult challenge.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Peasant Pawns of Pleasantville\u00b4</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2142140/extras/LearnChess3.jpg?t=1694078461\" /><br>With the help of a series of games with such melodious names as &quot;Smash the toilet bowls&quot; or &quot;The Peasant Pawns of Pleasantville&quot;, he subtly teaches them how the individual chess pieces move. All of this is done without a chessboard - so the children don't realise that this is already a game of chess.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gym for brain-training</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2142140/extras/LearnChess4.jpg?t=1694078461\" /><br>After this playful introduction, it's off to the gym for brain exercises. Here, under the guidance of Chesster, the channel rat, it's time to train your brains: the virtual chess board is used for training: showing not only the movement of the pieces with all the special rules, but also the tactical advantages of the individual chess pieces: what's the point of knowing how the rook moves if you don't then learn how to use it to checkmate your opponent? Tricky questions like &quot;What is stalemate?&quot; or &quot;Why do you need the opposition?&quot; are answered in a way that is as original as it is amazingly simple.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Stair mate: how do I checkmate quickly with 2 rooks?\u00a0</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2142140/extras/Treppenmatt_EN.jpg?t=1694078461\" /><br>For each learning section there is an exercise database with training positions, accompanied by the tireless chess trainer, Chesster. The action-oriented exercises build on the ones before, and in the truest sense, teach chess step-by-step in a playful and interactive way.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Boxing In</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2142140/extras/Einknasten_EN.jpg?t=1694078461\" /><br>What is the fastest way to checkmate the king with a rook?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Capture Game!</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2142140/extras/Schlagspiel_EN.jpg?t=1694078461\" /><br>Chess training for quick thinkers!

And if you want to find out how much brainpower you have already acquired, you can have your own brainpower measured by chess trainer Chesster on his chessometer. Only if you have mastered all the exercises, you will get to the next training room.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Duel against King Black</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2142140/extras/Screen11.jpg?t=1694078461\" /><br>When all the training sessions in light, middle and heavyweight have been completed, the big moment has come: In the chess arena: the final duel against the nasty King Black. Now it's time to play with focus and determination against your most dangerous opponent. This is where you can see whether you have already become a little strategist, a great tactician, or both! With a little luck and a lot of skill, you will succeed in defending the honour of your own royal house.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Train without end</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2142140/extras/LearnChess12.jpg?t=1694078461\" /><br>After the duel with King Black, the adventure is over, but not the fun of playing chess: you can challenge King Kaleidoscope or King Black to a new game at any time or even play against Chesster - and choose the difficulty level of the opponent yourself. Those who wish to train further can do so. 500 tasks and a number of exercises are dynamically generated. And one or two chess fanatics may even be tempted to crack the high score in - picking flowers or - chasing gold coins in the spider tower. Chess fun without end, right from the start. You will hardly find a better gift idea for your children, godchildren, nephews and nieces.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2142140/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1694078461","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2142140/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1694078461","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2142140/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1694078461","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2142140/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1694078461","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fritz &amp; Chesster - Learn to play chess - For children age 6 and up!</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2142140/extras/FritzUndFertigStartscreen_en.jpg?t=1694078461\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">This makes learning chess fun for children! </h2>Together with Prince Fritz and his cheeky cousin Bianca, children learn all the rules of chess in interactive practice modules, i.e., the moves of the pieces, capturing, checkmates; and more in-depth knowledge: What is stalemate and what is a draw?
