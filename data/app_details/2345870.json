{"about_the_game":"Tile Lands is a minimalist, City Building strategy game about managing and optimising buildings using a limited deck of tiles. Enjoy Tile Lands as a peaceful escape to your own minimalist town, enjoying the tranquility of organising neat districts and maintaining optimal building distribution. For those wishing to embrace the challenge, Tile Lands provides a focus on hitting high scores - pay attention to the requirements of your buildings and place tiles strategically to best optimise your town.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GAMEPLAY</h2>In Tile Lands, you play tiles onto a finite grid of spaces from your procedurally generated deck. Tiles can be placed onto the grid either adjacent to a tile already on the grid, or as a replacement for a tile already on the grid. Placing a tile onto another tile of the same type will clear that space. Placing tiles will score points depending on how well you satisfy the conditions of that tile. Once you gather enough points, you'll be given a choice of Tile Packs to add new tiles to your deck - the game is over when you run out of tiles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FEATURES</h2><strong>What Tile Lands Offers:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Relaxing, atmospheric gameplay<br></li><li> The feel of classic tile laying board games like Carcassonne<br></li><li> A highly replayable, arcade like experience<br></li><li> A satisfying balance between strategy and puzzle mechanics</li></ul><br><strong>What Tile Lands Doesn't Offer:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Intense medieval combat<br></li><li> Resource management<br></li><li> Pre-written storyline or cinematics<br></li><li> Online multiplayer</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE TEAM AND A THANK YOU</h2>Tile Lands was developed by <strong>Shiba Dog Studios</strong> - a two person indie studio in the UK comprising a Game Designer/Programmer and a Graphic Artist.
