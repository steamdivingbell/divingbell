{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In this game you will rely on physics as you take control of a paddle or platforms left and right sides. With this ability you will be able to lift up or down either side of the paddle allowing you to be able to control the gravity or mass of a ball sitting on top of the paddle. Your goal is to be able to manipulate the paddles left and right sides correctly to make the ball sitting on top of the paddle go into a randomly selected glowing lit hole to get points while also trying to avoid the other unlit holes around it. There are so far 4 game modes currently in the game they are Classic, Climb, Phantom, and SpeedBall. Currently Climb and Phantom are the only ones with sub game modes. Each sub game mode having a twist on the main game mode they are from. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Classic</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the Classic game mode you are to move the sides of the paddle up and down to roll the ball in the glowing lit hole to score points. But be careful if you are to roll the ball accidently into a black unlit hole it will cost you a life. if you lose too many lives the game will be over. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Climb</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the Climb Game mode you will be trying to guide the ball away from every hole. If you touch any hole it will make you lose a life and if you lose too many lives it will be game over. However every hole is moving in either a up, down, left, or right direction making it a challenging experience to dodge every hole thrown your way. Your only goal in this mode is to survive as long as you can and get the best time. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Phantom</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the Phantom Game mode you will do exactly the same as in the classic mode but there is a twist. Depending on the sub game mode selected you will have one item in the game (ball, paddle, holes) flicker and disappear for a short time. The objects that disappear will be gone for a short amount of time but will then reappear again shortly.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SpeedBall</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the SpeedBall game mode it will also be exactly like the classic mode however, to get points you will need to make the ball go as fast as it can into the correct hole to get more points. The faster the ball moves into the correct hole the more points you will get for that hole. If you use barely any speed you get no points. the points you can get from this game mode are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5. To get 5 you need to make the ball go incredibly fast into the correct hole.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">High Score Board</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game features a online or local high score board for all game modes. On the online board try your hand at being the best in the world at one of the game modes or even all of them! On the local board you can play against others who use your device and you can have a friendly competition with people around you you know.</p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Keeping It Steady!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2799640/7fed5d9a01b513f21ef6f8d9dbd46ea27c15c71f.jpg"},{"name":"Getting The Hang Of It","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2799640/5ea405659afd8dc89407e79adc3f9a9bada3a9bd.jpg"},{"name":"Better Then Most","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2799640/b1f28bd8e576e78b701b62d976b46099c3c91147.jpg"},{"name":"Must Be Luck","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2799640/50d8ee22a783595eaf1fbab2c17317195dee301c.jpg"},{"name":"Physics Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2799640/daf096ffc8d80ad5fef553922dddc7ef7d53fbe9.jpg"},{"name":"Master Ball Balancer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2799640/0f3331373966a308840a51a1b16796f897791e1e.jpg"},{"name":"Secrets?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2799640/8114795b67107b207f0939d1da37b0f5c419885c.jpg"},{"name":"Unexpected Feature","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2799640/807086d12dada6e1a1bfa816ec67f31e9c05bb7e.jpg"},{"name":"Its So Colorful!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2799640/15d6f4359489966b95ad41a4ce02f94422e79209.jpg"},{"name":"Retro Style","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2799640/a5f8427c42cea6c07d4e91d3cae6f8df3a74ff21.jpg"}],"total":31},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2799640/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736145234","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2799640/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1736145234","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2799640/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736145234","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2799640/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736145234","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In this game you will rely on physics as you take control of a paddle or platforms left and right sides.
