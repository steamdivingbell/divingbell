{"about_the_game":"The L-39 Albatros is a low-wing, high-performance jet aircraft that doubles as a trainer and light attack aircraft. The Albatros was developed in Czechoslovakia in the 1960s to replace older L-29 jet trainers. Powered by an Ivchenko AI-25TL turbofan engine, the L-39 has a top speed of Mach 0.80, a service ceiling of 11,000 m (36,100 feet), and can pull up to 8 G. Although primarily used as a trainer and light attack aircraft, the L-39 has also become popular with several aerial acrobatics demonstration teams.<br><br>Being a trainer aircraft, the L-39C has a tandem cockpit with the student in front and the instructor in the back. The instructor has several controls to mimic system failures to test the student. The L-39C also has two underwing pylons for bombs, rockets and close range air-to-air missiles. For decades, the L-39 was used by nations around the world to train pilots that later went on to fly aircraft like the MiG-29 and Su-27.<br><br>A later evolution of the L-39 was the L-39ZA light attack aircraft. The ZA adds two additional weapon pylons and a center pylon to mount a gun pod. The ZA has proved a popular choice for low-intensity conflicts. The L-39ZA will be available later during the Open Beta.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features of the DCS: L-39 Albatros:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Professional Flight Model that accurately mimics the performance and flight characteristics of this legendary trainer<br></li><li>Highly detailed, six-degrees-of-freedom (6 DOF) cockpit<br></li><li>Interact with cockpit controls with your mouse<br></li><li>Fully modelled weapon systems<br></li><li>Accurate L-39C and L-39ZA models with correct country markings<br></li><li>Detailed modelling of the L-39 instruments, weapons, engine, radios, fuel, electrical and hydraulic systems<br></li><li>Fly from either the front seat or back seat<br></li><li>Cooperative multiplayer in the same aircraft</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/316965/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727213319","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/316965/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1727213319","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/316965/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727213319","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/316965/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727213319","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"VR Support","id":31},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The L-39 Albatros is a low-wing, high-performance jet aircraft that doubles as a trainer and light attack aircraft.
