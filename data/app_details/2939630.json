{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Uncover secrets, decipher clues, and lurk in the shadows to solve the case</h2><br>After waking up in an alleyway, you must play as Lucio, a talented writer who has just been murdered... and awoken in the body of his pet cat, Shadow. Using the new gift of <strong>Cat Abilities,</strong> you must work with unexpected allies and collect clues to find who did this to you, all while avoiding the police patrolling the city. Explore the city, solve puzzles, piece together clues, interview other animals, and accuse the murderer to solve the mystery of your own death so you can finally move on to the afterlife peacefully. Will you be the Hunter, or the <i>Hunted?</i> <strong>Mr E. is awaiting your answer...</strong><br><br><strong>Cat Vision</strong><br>When activated, your heightened senses can be used to discover footprints, scents, and objects that may be in your interest. You move slower, but you are able to see things that may not have been visible before. Not only are potential clues highlighted in a bright color, but a scent trail is visible, leading you around objects and walls to follow the scent, as well as going through objects that can be opened, like vents, doors, or hiding spots. <br><br><strong>Cat Memory</strong><br>Take mental pictures of important objects or prints to unlock more information. All clues are stored in a &quot;Journal&quot; which serves as your memory, allowing you to look back and trigger flashbacks of certain scenarios that help you connect the dots, helping find out where to go next in your investigation, and how to track down Mr. E. Each clue also has a description of what you found, making it easier to understand what you're looking at and allowing you to piece together the story. <br><br><strong>Stealth</strong><br>As a cat, you have the ability to squeeze into smaller places, allowing you to hide from the dozens of police officers around the city, who don't want a <i>cat</i> interfering with their evidence. Hide in trash cans, boxes, and other small spaces to avoid being seen, taking the time to assemble your clues before coming out of hiding and continuing to stalk around. You may also hear secret conversations while in a hiding spot, gaining more information to work with in your journal, which could even end up making or breaking your entire investigation. <br><br><strong>Distraction</strong><br>Sometimes it's hard to sneak away from foes, but in this new cat body, you find it hard to avoid pushing breakable objects off the table... so use this to your advantage! Drop glasses, plates, and other objects to distract humans and get them to move out of your way, or push around bigger objects like boxes to uncover clues that may have been hiding underneath.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2939630/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1716853698","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2939630/page.bg.jpg?t=1716853698","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2939630/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1716853698","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2939630/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1716853698","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"The main character, Lucio is murdered in the beginning cutscene, and then thrown off a roof.
