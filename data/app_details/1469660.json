{"about_the_game":"Dontdy is a deathrun and troll game where you have to go from point A to point B without dying.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith a lifespan of 3 hours, Dontdy is a parkour game where you have to avoid a multitude of hidden traps. In this city or even this castle which seems peaceful at first glance, there are deadly traps. So be careful where you walk. Otherwise you will go mad. Face Dontdy's boss in a fight where only one will triumph. And this game is far from being a hiking simulator.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1469660?t=1606233909","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1469660/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1606233909","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1469660/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1606233909","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1469660/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1606233909","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Dontdy is a deathrun and troll game where you have to go from point A to point B without dying.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith a lifespan of 3 hours, Dontdy is a parkour game where you have to avoid a multitude of hidden traps.
