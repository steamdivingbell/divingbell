{"about_the_game":"Door Kickers: Action Squad is nostalgia and old memories rekindled by fresh ideas and inspiration from other cool games we play now. We got hundreds of hours of similar gameplay in our childhoods - back in the 80s or 90s - and wanted to recreate that feeling for today\u2019s players and even our own kids. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo be able to recreate the atmosphere of the time, this side-scroller had to be pixel art. But because we are in the years 2000 retro graphics with high detail is what we wanted to achieve and we hope we did it. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt all started with Knockjack - a prototype that was showcased to us by Mike of PixelShard; It looked cool  - and old school - but had a plumber guy shooting zombies in the face as central character. To make it more our own and transform it into a spin-off of Door Kickers we brought the old gang of troopers in this version too. It took us a while to define the style and characters of the game and this small art book graphically documents the process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMay it bring you inspiration and joy in your own creations!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe artbook is available as a PDF file in:<br />\r\n_game install folder_\\Door Kickers - Action Squad\\Action Squad Artbook_digital artbook.pdf<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo navigate there, right-click on the game in the Steam Library -&gt; Properties -&gt; Local Files -&gt; Browse","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1286400/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1614081180","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1286400/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1614081180","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1286400/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1614081180","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1286400/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1614081180","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Door Kickers: Action Squad is nostalgia and old memories rekindled by fresh ideas and inspiration from other cool games we play now.
