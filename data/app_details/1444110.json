This is Conner.  I just wanted to say that this game was very much made as a way to deal with some really intense existential fears of death.  This was just sort of my way of coping with those big ideas.  Even if those fears or how personal this game is to me isn't very apparent in your playthrough, just know that it's a project that really meant a lot to me and made me feel a bit of comfort.  I hope that if you struggle with these same fears, you'll find comfort in it as well.<br><br>\u200bAll music in Summerland is original.
