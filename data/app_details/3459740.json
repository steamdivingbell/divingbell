{"about_the_game":"Cemetery Warrior 7 Boss Rush. It is a hardcore 3D Shooter from the first person, where you have to defeat 11 strongest bosses! All the best bosses from the previous parts are collected here: here is a giant worm from the 4th part of the game, and a mighty dragon from the 5th part, as well as a number of COMPLETELY NEW bosses, for which you need to choose a special tactic! There are no restrictions! Just choose a boss and test your skill! Boss battles are quite hardcore and will require the player to study the behavior of bosses, as well as the competent use of the Dash - the main skill of the demon Zexus. If you hit the timing and dodge correctly, you can avoid any damage, but this requires a good reaction and competent use of endurance energy. (based on the principle of souls-like games) The game also has a survival mode, where you can fight with ordinary enemies and set your own survival record. For the survival mode, the player receives special coins that can be spent on temporary bonuses - boosts, in case the bosses still seem too difficult. In this way, the player can significantly strengthen himself before the battle with the bosses, for example, by calling on the Fire Dog to help him fight on your side, or by strengthening the armor, or increasing the ammunition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Crazy 1st person 3D Shooter action with heavy metal, play as Demon Zexus and test your skill!<br />\r\n- Various weapons: Shotgun, Minigun, Laser Gun, Grenade Launcher, Blazing Blade that shoots fireballs!<br />\r\n- 11 strongest and most diverse bosses to choose tactics for.<br />\r\n- Survival mode, where you can have a meaty shootout with a large number of enemies!<br />\r\n- Bonus boost system: Fire Dog - assistant, Blazing Blade, armor boost, speed, ammunition.<br />\r\n- A real test for hardcore players, where reaction speed and timing are important!","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3459740?t=1738829154","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3459740?t=1738829154","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3459740/0b837632f0a17449f627ec5eb430c2075ef01acf/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738829154","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3459740/0b837632f0a17449f627ec5eb430c2075ef01acf/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738829154","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Head explosions by headshots."},"detailed_description":"Cemetery Warrior 7 Boss Rush.
