{"about_the_game":"Free to play simple strategy Game! Play against people all around the world, in the same room as you, or the computer!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA war rages between multiple factions. Take your side of multiple different alliances each with their own special ways to play, with the choice of different bonuses and castles that change the way each faction can play. Play through the campaign, a conquest of your enemies and the lands around them, unifying the tribes and creating a Mitch match army using the strongest characters that each faction has to offer! Spice up with different game modes, like the zombie apocalypse event, that change the playing field in different ways. Or play a more traditional game type with the War mode, advance from the stone age to the future age all while balancing the usage of recourses found around the map!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChoose your alliance! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Angels: Servants of religion, they use their collective faith to summon powerful beings into existence. Convert enemy units into your religion. Stall the game long enough to summon gods! or slay the non-believers with faithful knights and crusaders!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Undead: Marching even after death, the undying use the corpses on the battlefield to snowball into an unstoppable force! Infect your opponents with disease and poison, swarm the board with zombies and liches, or drain the lifeforce of your opponent's using vampires!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Mercenaries: Gold is king, this alliance is proud of its stable and reliable income. Build castles and walls to defend key spots of the map, strike quick and hard with calvary, catapults and archers, protect your healers and merchants to keep your units alive and leveling up.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd many more will be added later on! As well as new units, bonuses and Castles.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Winner!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2216750/303c1b08e0cadc0da06e6786f162927a64acb08b.jpg"},{"name":"Winner Winner!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2216750/e42ce9d2015a7447f6870682150785068a5a0573.jpg"},{"name":"New God rising","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2216750/cc2f42a67660fd455234846b87af770ff863e2eb.jpg"},{"name":"World Champion","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2216750/5aea89511c6a36a171b8549030fc3fdf9244d93b.jpg"},{"name":"Free-for-all Victor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2216750/661bb715b572dfd5dd4f3c184c2582d9a162efa5.jpg"},{"name":"New no more!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2216750/b2cbc76d719b9ca31a25b5df3389a681aa1ad155.jpg"},{"name":"Expert!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2216750/6da5d7ded85181f27ca1c31673bbca97f8983fcf.jpg"},{"name":"Raider!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2216750/088050689e1162903c9d56e8d6c2b87deba6b308.jpg"},{"name":"Gold hoarder","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2216750/14b30c046c58f646cb9ab36f68863c68be2ebe46.jpg"},{"name":"Corpse hoarder","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2216750/22eb8970a23719c851c4fd1946287dcc837af46f.jpg"}],"total":19},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2216750/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1676058768","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2216750/page.bg.jpg?t=1676058768","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2216750/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1676058768","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2216750/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1676058768","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Free to play simple strategy Game!
