{"about_the_game":"War War is a 4-player multiplayer real-time / turn-based strategy game intended to be played with friends locally or across the internet.   Build small armies by placing your pieces on the board in the turn-based &quot;campaign&quot; mode.  Invade other armies to enter real-time strategy &quot;skirmish&quot; battles where up to two units can be controlled at once with the dual-analog stick on your compatible game controller! (keyboard controls are also supported).  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach unit type has unique abilities such as machine gunner soldier infantries, cannonball-launching tanks, and missile-firing drones.  Armies can be combined on the strategy map to build even stronger forces.  Random mystery spaces add a party-like element to the game and can drastically change the tides of a war campaign.  When playing with 3 or 4 players, &quot;ridiculous&quot; barn animals can be controlled to get in the way and disrupt skirmish battles between the two battling players.  Battle across 4 different terrain types and 3 unique strategy campaign maps.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1358430/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729457842","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1358430/page.bg.jpg?t=1729457842","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1358430/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729457842","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1358430/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729457842","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"War War is a 4-player multiplayer real-time / turn-based strategy game intended to be played with friends locally or across the internet.
