{"about_the_game":"Space Beastz is a cooperative multiplayer music and rhythm game. On a music-playing spaceship, players must time their actions just right to keep multiple instruments running and make the most amazing music the galaxy has ever heard!<br />\r\nAbout This Game:<br />\r\nIn Space Beastz, a player joins the crew of David, an intergalactic music composer on a mission to bring the gift of life-changing music to the galaxy. The spaceship has a collection of out-of-this-world instruments built-in, but they are prone to breaking down at just the wrong moment. They need human players to keep the beats flowing.<br />\r\nA player can attempt the challenge alone or enlist the help of up to three friends in local or online multiplayer modes. The more players get in on the action, the more instruments will malfunction, and frantic action will ensue as players race from one station to the next, trying not to miss a beat!<br />\r\nEach world the players play for has unique problems and preferred music style, and the difficulty ratchets up as the team plays gigs for increasingly powerful planetary rulers. If they succeed in pleasing the hardest of all audiences, they may be able to bring peace to a troubled galaxy. <br />\r\nA fun-filled way to experience the Bible, Space Beastz shares the story of David and how the music he played had a positive impact on the world around him.<br />\r\nMain features:<br />\r\nFrenetic multiplayer fun, great for parties.<br />\r\nEpic music with a retro 80s digital vibe. Each song is a brand-new creation from several unique and talented composers. <br />\r\nDifficulty levels are set individually by each player, from casual to Beast Mode, so players of all skill levels can have fun playing together.<br />\r\nHigh replayability: Every song can be replayed in the quest for a new top score.<br />\r\nFamily-friendly story, so even small children can join the fun.<br />\r\nCompletely free, with no ads or other monetization to spoil your peaceful intergalactic vibes.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1805700/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1650634977","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1805700/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1650634977","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1805700/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1650634977","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1805700/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1650634977","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Space Beastz is a cooperative multiplayer music and rhythm game.
