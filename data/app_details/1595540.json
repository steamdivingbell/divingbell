Your first foray into programming the MaRUs will involve simple tasks such as moving the MaRUs around a room. As you build your skills, you will encounter more difficult challenges such as using your robot\u2019s sensors to navigate unknown paths or even exploiting the security holes in other robots to use them for your own purpose. Players with more programming experience will find extra challenges in how they go about completing each task.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1595540/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1628175620","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1595540/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1628175620","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1595540/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1628175620","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1595540/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1628175620","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1595540/extras/maru_moving.gif?t=1628175620\" /><br><br>Sam &amp; MaRU is a programming, puzzle-solving game where you take on the role of Sam, a programmer in a robotics company\u2019s automated maintenance department.
