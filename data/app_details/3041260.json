{"about_the_game":"The Mission: Exorcist is a game that combines elements of Tower Defense and Open World genres. Players take on the role of an Exorcist tasked with protecting a dimensional door that connects Hell and the human world for 15 days. The game's ending will depend on the player's remaining Life Force level.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Mission: Exorcist is an ongoing project that will continue to be developed as long as there is player support. Since it is a solo-developed project, it is quite flexible, and the developer aims to improve the game in terms of graphics, animations, and sound. Currently, it is still in its beta stage. The developer finds great joy in working on this project and ideally would prefer to complete it fully before releasing it. However, due to limited funding, the decision has been made to allow players to try it out first to see if they enjoy it. We hope for your support.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you have any suggestions, please do not hesitate to let me know.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you from the bottom of my heart.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3041260/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736510520","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3041260/page.bg.jpg?t=1736510520","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3041260/57c9c5e4833552a10e0674d9c179f7ff6fffa3dd/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736510520","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3041260/57c9c5e4833552a10e0674d9c179f7ff6fffa3dd/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736510520","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3094500,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"The Mission: Exorcist is a game that combines elements of Tower Defense and Open World genres.
