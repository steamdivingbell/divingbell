{"about_the_game":"The challenge of Super Meat Boy returns in Super Meat Boy Forever! This time around Meat Boy is always running, like<strong> literally...it's an auto-runner</strong>. He can't stop and he won't stop. Levels are brutal, death is inevitable, and players will get that sweet feeling of accomplishment after beating a level. Players will run, jump, punch and kick their way through familiar settings and totally new worlds.<br><br>What\u2019s better than playing through Super Meat Boy Forever once? The answer is simple: Playing through Super Meat Boy Forever several times and having new levels to play each time. <strong>We created over 6000 level chunks</strong> and smash them together to create new unique levels and each time the game is completed the option to replay the game appears and generates a whole new experience by presenting different levels with their own unique secret locations. We\u2019ve handcrafted literally thousands of levels for players to enjoy and conquer. You can replay Super Meat Boy Forever from start to finish several times before ever seeing a duplicate level. It is truly a remarkable feat of engineering and a monumental example of ignoring the limits of rational game design and production.<br><br>Super Meat Boy Forever takes place a few years after the events of Super Meat Boy. Meat Boy and Bandage Girl have been living a happy life free of Dr. Fetus for several years and they now have a wonderful little baby named Nugget. Nugget is joy personified and she is everything to Meat Boy and Bandage Girl. One day while our heroes were on a picnic, Dr. Fetus snuck up on them, beat Meat Boy and Bandage Girl unconscious with a shovel and kidnapped Nugget! When our heroes came to and found that Nugget was missing, they knew who to go after. They cracked their knuckles and decided to never stop until they got Nugget back and taught Dr. Fetus a very important lesson. A lesson that can only be taught with punches and kicks.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Similar yet legally distinct","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/581660/c3070b83597ef3cfb192baa179c71e65ca59adb7.jpg"},{"name":"Looks familiar","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/581660/646f1a1181700ed700aeed3152ffe1fac0014baa.jpg"},{"name":"Oak Boy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/581660/396dd0711ea19a42f4fdcf2c398cef7d2056a2cd.jpg"},{"name":"Straight Jacket Girl","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/581660/f28e8611c2ce35ac7700c3142db6e1c92977304c.jpg"},{"name":"Vaccine Boy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/581660/bfdd03b2db21bb787219842825a2a3156a70f1fd.jpg"},{"name":"Research Girl","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/581660/0d525cecb0928688a47cc52ada501fc7dc83aca2.jpg"},{"name":"Dilation Boy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/581660/7b1e9d8af77cef7261332b948a3563df7c0b4c2e.jpg"},{"name":"Buffer Overrun","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/581660/aa9371cfb5039453eb40e128a8f984d72a71597d.jpg"},{"name":"Page Fault","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/581660/869303259a6a3fb7479a532e1a43f0455069f3a0.jpg"},{"name":"Teak Girl","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/581660/2c0585f90e12c615b1ae14025ec49f2cf7479303.jpg"}],"total":36},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/581660/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1641929185","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/581660/page.bg.jpg?t=1641929185","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/581660/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1641929185","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/581660/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1641929185","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"The game is cartoonish in nature but the protagonist dies often and leaves blood wherever he touches.
