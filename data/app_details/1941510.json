{"about_the_game":"This game will have constant free updates including new animations of biblical stories and new levels of gameplay updates on a biweekly to monthly basis. PLEASE NOTE: We have added to + exaggerated throughout the game compared to the actual Biblical stories in effort to enhance gameplay to include more fighting: (FOR EXAMPLE: Noah defends the Ark and fights off bad guys while getting the animals on the Ark; he also has special fighting powers, etc.) We attempt to point where we stray away from the Bible at the beginning of each level with a pop-up of &quot;disclaimers&quot; The animation side of the game sticks much closer to the Bible and doesn\u2019t stray away from our interpretation of it at all.<br>This is meant to be a fun gamified experience of the Hebrew Scriptures. This game was developed by an indie game studio with a mission to allow people to experience and interact with Biblical content in a different way.
