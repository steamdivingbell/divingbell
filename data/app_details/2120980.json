{"about_the_game":"Beihnn wants nothing more than to live a quiet, uneventful life in a cabin in the forest. Alas, adventure calls! Take control of Beihnn and attempt to discover the origin of the force that poisons the land in this NES 2D side-scrolling MetroidVania platformer. Explore eight different zones and traverse various types of terrain in search of the power-ups that will allow you to proceed on your quest. Solve puzzles and discover secrets. Fight nine unique bosses. Talk to other characters for hints.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIsostasy began its life as an indie NES game. This is the PC demo version. It excludes the final two zones of the game, but otherwise is identical to all other versions. The same save files will work in both the demo and full PC versions, so if you start a game on the demo and decide to download the full version, you will be able to continue where you left off without losing any data.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2120980/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1709472781","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2120980/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1709472781","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2120980/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1709472781","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2120980/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1709472781","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Beihnn wants nothing more than to live a quiet, uneventful life in a cabin in the forest.
