{"about_the_game":"TurtleQuest is a 2D-Platformer where you are sent on a quest to save your little turtle village from an unknown disease.<br>You have to follow an ancient path through the old mountains to find the sacred plant Zingiber, which might help to cure all turtles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">You Play As Seni</h2><img class=\"bb_img\"

hidden traps, natural obstacles, and bewitched things.<br><br>TurtleQuest is inspired by games like &quot;TrapAdventure&quot;, &quot;Cat Mario&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Be The Guy&quot;, so it is quite difficult but in a cute look.<br><br>As of now does TurtleQuest only have 7 levels, I am going on summer vacation, and if enough people are interested in the game, will try and make many more.<br>So please tell your friends about this game, if you liked it, or if you want to see how they manage to beat each level.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\"
