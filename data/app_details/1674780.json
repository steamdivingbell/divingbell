You can for instance parry anything that would normally would damage you, but parrying incoming projectiles in particular will shoot them back at foes. You are however never forced to parry and you can even change how the parry system works by equipping Emblems!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Emblems are items you will find all over the world. Equipping an Emblem might change how the parried projectile behaves, for instance, you can make it home into enemies but deal less damage. Or instead of bouncing a projectile off your cap you will do damage to anything near you. There is even a Vortex Emblem which destroys multiple projectiles around the player.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674780/extras/cropped_items.png?t=1732095957\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Upgrades and Build customizations</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In addition to Emblems, there are Relics that work very similarly to the Charm system in Hollow Knight. Some change how your healing works and others increase your sword damage or give you additional protection. There are 60 Relics in the game and you choose what your strengths will be through the Relics. You can make some really specialized builds focusing on defense, healing, speed, melee attacking, or spell-casting!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">And then there are permanent upgrades that you gain from fighting bosses, these are all from spells to new moves and types of attacks!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674780/extras/cropped_boss.gif?t=1732095957\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Bosses</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Lone Fungus, you can challenge and defeat 33 bosses to acquire new abilities. My goal is to design engaging and equitable boss battles that can be won without sustaining any damage from the boss. To achieve this, I craft distinct attack patterns for each boss and provide clear cues before their strikes. Additionally, I limit the randomness of their attacks. My aim is to provide an enjoyable and stimulating experience where players can triumph over bosses by mastering their techniques. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674780/extras/cropped_platforming.gif?t=1732095957\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Platforming</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Lone Fungus is essentially a precision platformer, but it doesn't compel you to undertake overly difficult platforming tasks in order to advance in the game. Instead, all the platforming challenges are confined to optional side rooms, allowing you to relish the game as a Metroidvania-style adventure game focused on combat and exploration, while still benefiting from the precise controls of a precision platformer. However, if you're inclined to master the game's hardcore mechanics, there are practice rooms available for you to refine your skills and take on the most daunting platforming challenges that the game has to offer.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674780/extras/cropped_assistmode.png?t=1732095957\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Play the game how you want!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game features 4 difficulty modes, several ways to customize controls (like a dedicated down-attack button), and a full-featured Assist-Mode!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Assist-Mode allows you to turn on 6 different features which will drastically make the game more accessible.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Platforming Pause</strong> - Increases the pauses between platforming mechanics like Mushmovers, giving you a larger room to react and breathe in between platforming sections.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Magic Platforms</strong> - Adds special platforms to some sections in the game to make them much easier.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Worldmap Hints</strong> - Will show items you have missed in rooms you have already visited.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Stronger Sword</strong> - Increases your sword's base damage, allowing you to beat bosses easier.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Infinite MP</strong> - Play without having to manage your Mindpoints, heal and cast spells as much as you want!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Invincibility</strong> - You cannot die!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Keep in mind that the Assist-Mode is not only for players that might think the game is too tough but it can also be used to just mess around and have fun with the game in your own way!</p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Only the beginning of your power.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1674780/dc34987e399d90bc4f0f207bf72b4993d4dd2910.jpg"},{"name":"I wonder what I can do with this?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1674780/bc8af038a8e8a22f8eb77e85e395a8111c2f1be2.jpg"},{"name":"Spore Magic","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1674780/44d7701512283308e23fd8c030c20b0eea165c15.jpg"},{"name":"Spicy Magic","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1674780/d37c8256690f83f61949f71023b6a23f779a9c2b.jpg"},{"name":"Crystal Magic","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1674780/cc1ab1c70f6d22c427fb996d7937a59926f0604f.jpg"},{"name":"Returning Magic","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1674780/8ddd3d2d583fff84a7facb46ff5ab0ac41d5003e.jpg"},{"name":"Ball Magic","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1674780/70ed3d518bb46290463eb3e690bb2d4e3a0908f1.jpg"},{"name":"Golden Magic","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1674780/4616a98e053612893ffa30361574c264593e6a48.jpg"},{"name":"Berserk Magic","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1674780/30d9fda7ccd3041d2e2a58d79f8bb0ea68ac693c.jpg"},{"name":"Acid Magic","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1674780/88e21ae54dd6716f6f419cb58aee6030ed63a384.jpg"}],"total":52},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674780/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732095957","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674780/page.bg.jpg?t=1732095957","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674780/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732095957","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674780/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732095957","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Lone Fungus is a true Metroidvania set in a world built by mushrooms where you play as the last mushroom alive.
