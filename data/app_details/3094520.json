{"about_the_game":"The K-ONE adventure has begun. Travel to a dimension where training your gaming skills makes you grow. You will explore different eras and places from the past where knowledge is in danger. Solve simple calculation challenges to capture the particles of knowledge and thus preserve the K dimension.<br>This friendly shooter will help you improve your calculation abilities. The mathematical operations become more complex as your game level increases. You must solve them within a given time and capture the particles of knowledge before Ignorantia stops you. Sharpen your operations and be precise in your attempts. You will increase your level and improve your skill in each session.<br>The friendly particles are very playful. Their bright colors will help you find the result of the mathematical operation you must solve, but be careful! Aiming at the wrong particle can deduct too many points. The challenge is greater when you have to defend yourself while performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. The densifier, the machine of knowledge that will accompany you on your adventure, will pose the operation and give you answer options linked to the color of the particles so you can capture them.<br>Try to protect yourself; the flops aim to distract you. You have multiple tools at your disposal to neutralize them. Select your search tool and defend yourself by wielding your protective shield. This will be necessary to overcome some challenges. Does it sound easy? You have ten levels of knowledge and six degrees of skill.<br>You will improve your technique and mathematical skills with your accuracy. You have never felt so much pressure! The annoying flops try to distract you! Pay attention to the context of each level and solve simple operations with mental agility and memory. The logic in complex calculations where you take advantage of mathematical tricks will make you faster and more precise. Pay attention to the instructions. Your goal: to reach your maximum level by capturing particles.<br>Head towards the doors of knowledge. Crossing them will help you find new dimensions of the past: prehistory, Egypt, Vikings, and the medieval era. Increase your skill and now solve complex operations by raising your level of knowledge. Your precision, agility, and mathematical logic will do the rest.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Sessions</h2><br>Make the most of your game time. Enjoy the fun with scheduled breaks every forty minutes. You will notice how your concentration and skill improve in each session. The seeker's training also requires rest times. Playing should always be fun.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Surprising Graphic Environment</h2><br>K-One is the first installment of a new universe of educational video games where entertainment, quality, and knowledge development go hand in hand. The graphical environment of K-Dimension immerses the player in surprising spaces where learning capabilities blend with the user's gaming needs. Learning by playing in our century with the tools of our century is a reality.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Friendly Shooter</h2><br>K-ONE is an FPS (first-person shooter) immersed in an adventure with stunning scenarios. A game where shooting and protecting become much friendlier through weapons of power and knowledge. The particles of knowledge are fun bouncing balls that are everywhere in the dimension. Therefore, capturing them will be your main mission. However, at times you will need much more than good aim. Additionally, the K-ONE environment is designed to immerse you in a fun gaming experience so that the learning challenge is not a barrier and where your mistakes turn into learning. Improve your mathematical ability with basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You will feel more skillful in the game as you progress. Unlock new search tools and play to secure the K dimension.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Set Your Levels</h2><br>K-ONE is designed for six degrees of skill and ten levels of knowledge. In the options screen, you can choose the adaptive knowledge option that will measure your abilities up to the skill level where you feel most comfortable. Thus, your gaming ability will increase as you can challenge yourself.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Building in Community</h2><br>K-DIMENSION and its first installment, K-ONE, are being developed through an expanded concept of the educational community. We must include the digital entertainment universe alongside school, students, families, and society. That is why we invite you to build a new world of knowledge in safe and friendly environments that promote talent investment through development and innovation in the field of education.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3094520?t=1726132839","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3094520?t=1726132839","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3094520/af3b95ba1338c67025d87327c57a12efa380feae/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726132839","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3094520/af3b95ba1338c67025d87327c57a12efa380feae/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726132839","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"VR Supported","id":53}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"The K-ONE adventure has begun.
