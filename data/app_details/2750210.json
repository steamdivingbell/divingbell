You must use it to interact with your surroundings, operating a computer alongside a strange console that controls the locks in the entire facility. You must help the people trapped inside to escape, but be careful. The locks aren't there just for you. <br><br>Your only objective? <br>Save Everyone. <br><br>That doesn't sound so hard, right? <br><br>If you're going to succeed, you'll need to pay close attention to what your allies within the facility say. As you are trapped within a single room, they are your only chance at gaining clues in other parts of the facility, clues that will help you to solve the inner workings of the console and help save everyone. <br><br>Just this once, everybody lives. But only if you can work together with everyone to solve the puzzles and uncover the secrets of the facility.
