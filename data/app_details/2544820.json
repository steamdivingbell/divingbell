The antiquity and late antiquity serve as a template for the factions, the game world, artstyle and goods. However, historical accuracy is not a focus of the game.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What is special about The First Explorers\u00ae?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>You'll experience an atmospheric, Settlers-like game that offers the perfect mix between building and real-time strategy.

Only by observing the game world you will be able to see where your fortunes are needed.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Will there be fantasy elements?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>No. Fantasy elements are not planned. There will be no fantasy peoples, wizards, werewolves or anything like that.</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2544820/extras/EN_Gameflow.png?t=1736919720\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What is the objective in the game?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>You will land with your ship and your crew on an island and have to build a thriving settlement from scratch using the available resources on the map. To successfully complete your game, you must defeat all opponents on the map.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What will be the victory conditions?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Victory by military success is firmly planned. However, there will also be other victory variants, which depend on the map or game mode. Friends of peaceful victories should not miss out here. There are plans for victory through economic success or through the construction of special building-projects.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How long will a game last?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A game can last between 1.5 hours and 4-5 hours and depends on how the players play. The game mechanics offer a lot of flexibility here.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What game modes are planned?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Currently, the focus is on skirmish against the AI and human opponents, i.e. PvE and PvP. There is also a story campaign planned, but that depends somewhat on the development process.</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2544820/extras/EN_Gameplay.png?t=1736919720\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How will building work?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Buildings and roads can only be placed within your territory. <br>There will also be hilly terrain that will increase the construction time of your buildings, so the properly chosen building site is golden.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Can civilian buildings or civilian settlers be attacked?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>No, civilian buildings or civilian settlers cannot be attacked by any unit. Only military buildings like watchtowers can be captured.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Do civilian settlers flee from enemy units?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>No, civilian settlers will continue to transport goods and will not flee.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Is there a direct unit control?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Civilian residents such as carriers or construction workers are indirectly controlled by your construction orders and production tasks.<br>Soldiers, geologists, etc. are controlled directly. Look forward to raising huge armies and commanding them in battle!</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How do I expand my territory?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The territory is delimited with border stones. The border can be expanded by placing military buildings like watchtowers.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Will there be settlement upgrades?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Yes, by building special landmarks the settlement will level up and unlock new buildings and units in the game. The settlement will start at the hamlet level. Currently, 3 settlement levels are planned: the hamlet, village and town level.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Will there be mines and mining?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Yes, and there will be real mountains where you can build mines!</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How does the food system work?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Miners work only when they get their basic food.<br>Production buildings basically work without meals. However, production efficiency can be massively increased with meals. <br>Meals are prepared in residential buildings by cooks. The cooks get the food from market stalls. The higher the settlement level, the higher quality meals are possible.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How to get new inhabitants?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Currently, it is planned to recruit them via a port. The inhabitants will then come by ship from the homeland. It is also planned to be able to get new settlers by land.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Will there be walls?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Yes, wooden palisades and stone walls are planned.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Can soldiers be positioned on towers and stone walls?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Absolutely.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Will there be a combat power system?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Definitely, especially at the beginning of a game the soldiers on their home territory will have a massive combat power bonus over opponents. This effectively prevents rush tactics. In the course of a game you will be able to influence the combat power.</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2544820/extras/EN_Community.png?t=1736919720\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Is mod support planned?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Yes!<br>Modsupport is planned. <br>How extensive this will be, will be decided in the further development. Mods should be able to be searched, installed and activated directly in the game as plugins. Self-created maps should be possible.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Will there be interaction with the community?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Absolutely.
