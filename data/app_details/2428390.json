{"about_the_game":"The year is 2069 and technology has advanced dramatically. Corporations openly run the earth\u2019s politics and governments. One of these corporations, NeuroTech recently invented a new type of integrated AI. This AI is implemented by nanobots in the blood stream. This collective of nanobots is called a S.P.I.R.I.T. The first iterations of implementation of Spirit tech were too invasive for normal humans. NeuroTech then developed technology to create lab grown humans that can withstand the Spirit fusion. The outcome was the creation of the Sentinel unit. Players will play as one of these sentinels. They are tasked to find an artifact in the base on the moon. Upon arrival the situation has elevated to catastrophic levels. Everyone in the base is dead and the Zombie outbreak has gone into full effect. It is up to the player and other sentinels to find the artifact and get it back home.<br><br><strong>GamePlay</strong><br>Combat has many layers to it besides shooting. Players can also melee attack with swords along with blocking. There are tactical and lethal grenades along with other throwables. Bullets will have differing velocities and damages, this affects players in varying ways depending on the bullet type used and the armor stats of the enemy. For example, a low velocity bullet will have a hard time going through heavy armor but may deal a great amount of damage to unarmored or light armored enemies. To add even more depth, bullets can come in different variants. Examples are incendiary, shock, armor piercing and more. Choosing the right tools for the job can make a situation less dire.<br><br>What makes Novalight\u2019s combat different than other shooters is the way melee combat is done. Melee will have souls like mechanics with some major differences. This leads to fast paced gameplay while still having the option to take things slowly. The zombies are most sensitive to sound, attachments like silencers and throwable weapons like throwing knifes or hatchets will get things done quietly. Though since time to kill is relatively short, running and gunning is always an option.<br><br><strong>Weapon Types</strong><br>There will be different firearm categories like other shooters, these are:<br>Assault rifles, handguns. Shotguns, rocket launchers, grenade launchers and sniper rifles. Each weapon will have a specific ammo type tied to it. For example on AR can use 5.56 rounds while another uses 7.62 and so on. <br>There will be different melee weapons as well along with different throwables ranging from standard frags to throwing hatchets.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2428390/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1707335639","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2428390/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1707335639","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2428390/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1707335639","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2428390/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1707335639","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The year is 2069 and technology has advanced dramatically.
