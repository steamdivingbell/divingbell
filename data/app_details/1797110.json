{"about_the_game":"Play as the last cadet himself, Flash Pan, as he tries to get into the workshop through the library in order to get his tools. He'll need the tools to repair the only mini-sub left on the submarine. You'll start with the upgraded lighting system for improved lighting range. You can find the flare gun, harpoon gun, and shotgun as you encounter jellyfish, electric eels, and sharks. There's a built-in speedrun timer too! We're holding a speedrun challenge every month while the full game is nearing completion for a November/December release.
