{"about_the_game":"Try the first ever game that started the journey to Wizard's Quest! This is only a sample game that was made back in 2014 in which I do not plan to complete, but it is a interesting little game to try out. This is an experimental game which features:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQuick free Turn-based combat with classic 2d graphics.  <br />\r\nA jump button feature for some platforming. <br />\r\nOn-the-go story-based sequences. <br />\r\nMinor Character interactions with bigger portraits during dialogue. <br />\r\nMinor environmental interactions. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a top down open world turn-based RPG. Eric is a young lone warrior stranded in a strange island in which is inhabited by monsters he's never seen before. Could the Dragon Legends be true, is he dead, or could he still be dreaming?  Play and find out as Eric beneath the white sun, Sol Blanka!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1568420/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1682529553","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1568420/page.bg.jpg?t=1682529553","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1568420/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1682529553","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1568420/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1682529553","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Try the first ever game that started the journey to Wizard's Quest!
