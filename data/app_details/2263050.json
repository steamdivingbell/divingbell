{"about_the_game":"Originally developed in a few weeks for a game jam, Skyland is the result of one solo developer's years-long attempt to create a gameboy advance game. In this gorgeous FTL-inspired tactical RTS, you and your crew must take command of a flying castle, and defend it from sky pirates while fighting enemies of increasing difficulty.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce only available as a GBA rom, Skyland is now on steam as a free download for Windows!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKey features:<br />\r\n* Complex strategic gameplay - Construct additions to your castle, build new weapons and defenses, give orders to your crew, chose weapon targets.<br />\r\n* Play at your own pace - Pause the game at any time to consider new strategies. You may also speed up, slow down, and even rewind levels!<br />\r\n* Randomized encounters - Encounters occur unexpectedly, and many enemy castle layouts are procedurally generated. No two playthroughs will be exactly alike!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2263050/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738269685","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2263050/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1738269685","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2263050/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738269685","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2263050/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738269685","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Originally developed in a few weeks for a game jam, Skyland is the result of one solo developer's years-long attempt to create a gameboy advance game.
