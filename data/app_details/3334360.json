{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Proton &amp; Electron</strong> is an &quot;electric&quot; pixel-style platformer puzzle game. Set within a piece of electronic equipment corroded by antimatter, the story follows &quot;Dr. Proton,&quot; who shrinks to the atomic level and enters the device. With the help of local creatures &quot;Electron Sprites,&quot; he explores and repairs the machine. Players will control &quot;Dr. Proton&quot; and &quot;Electron Sprite,&quot; utilizing their opposite electricities to solve puzzles, explore a mysterious micro-electronic world, and ultimately confront the antimatter boss.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Electromagnetism Has Never Been This Fun</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game introduces engaging, intuitive mechanics inspired by electromagnetism.
