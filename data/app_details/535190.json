{"about_the_game":"Get up-close and personal with Gravity.<br><br>Chunky Orbits is a simulation of free-floating objects in space based on real life physics. Each object in the scene attracts each of the others in a cosmic tug-of-war that we call Gravity. Toss out a few boulders and contemplate the wonders of the Universe.<br><br>Fill your Universe with a collection of cosmic chunks: boulders, white dwarfs, comets, and chunky fireballs. Add some trails to your rocks to trace their paths. Or bust out the sparkly photon cannon - a delete button with a kick! It's a big physics based playground. Create a random cluster of boulders and watch as they collect into larger, chunky groups. Launch a super-massive White Dwarf and observe how it affects the other bodies in the system. Create a small 'solar system' and see how many chunks you can get into orbit. <br><br><strong>It's your Universe. Do What You Want.</strong> (^_^)<br><br>Features a new kind of 'pinch and pull' movement that makes it easy to move around in 3D space, or oyu can use standard first person stick controls. This isn't a game - more like a physics-based toy. It might even be educational. It certainly gave me a new appreciation for how Gravity works.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/535190/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1630005491","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/535190/page.bg.jpg?t=1630005491","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/535190/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1630005491","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/535190/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1630005491","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Get up-close and personal with Gravity.<br><br>Chunky Orbits is a simulation of free-floating objects in space based on real life physics.
