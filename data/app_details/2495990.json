You find yourself in the institute of a tormented doctor who, driven by desperation, defies ethical boundaries to save his wife, Scarlett, from a deadly illness. As Scarlett succumbs to her fate, the doctor descends into madness and becomes convinced that death is the only respite. Players must navigate the nightmarish corridors of the doctor\u2019s institute, confronting grotesque horrors, uncovering dark secrets, and striving to escape with their lives intact. <strong>Can you survive the twisted labyrinth and unravel the haunting mysteries within?</strong><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2495990/extras/GIF1.gif?t=1738609184\" /><br><br>Your journey begins within the decrepit and foreboding walls of the doctor's institute, a place once dedicated to healing but now consumed by malevolence and despair. <strong>Each step you take into the dimly lit corridors leads you deeper into a world of grotesque horrors, twisted experiments, and unspeakable terror.</strong> The atmosphere is thick with dread, and every creaking floorboard and distant moan only serves to heighten your anxiety.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2495990/extras/survive1.png?t=1738609184\" /><br><br>As you navigate the labyrinthine halls, you'll encounter grotesque abominations, born from the doctor's relentless pursuit of knowledge and power.
