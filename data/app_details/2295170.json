{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Tired and confused, you awake engulfed in darkness, in a prison that seems to have no end. Your memories are clouded, but your desire for freedom allows you to endure.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">But you are not alone. Accompanied by a strange, luminous entity that calls itself your Memento, you carve your way out through might and magic, eager to meet the light of the sun.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Yet, as despair slowly consumes your spirit, a ray of hope shines forward. Imprisoned like countless others, the denizens of a once thriving town, now ravaged by vicious forces, await your aid.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you rescue them from various, terrible fates, they will lend their skills and help you rebuild their homes.
