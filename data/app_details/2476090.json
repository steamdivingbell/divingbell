The game's soundtrack takes players on an immersive adventure through the kingdom of Beebom, as they rise up against the despotic King. <br><br>Each region in this retro-futuristic sonic landscape has its own unique sound. Phlox swells with lively melodies and dynamic percussion propel a spirit of discovery and adventure, whereas Cymbidium's ancient woodlands echo with churning chord progressions and mesmerizing melodies. In the mystical lands of Saffron, dreamy chords, ethereal choirs and ritualistic percussion create a sense of enchantment. Upon reaching Beebom City, the bustling and carnivalesque capital trumpets an enchanting festive atmosphere but listen closely for a nod to the kingdom\u2019s darker undertones. <br><br>Crafted across Antfood's 4 studios in New York, Amsterdam, Sao Paulo &amp; Los Angeles, the masterful composition pays homage to 90s desktop game soundtracks, blending sample-based synths, acoustic percussion, and rich analog synthesis, creating a sonic tapestry that brings the game's concept, illustration, and gameplay to life.<br><br>Find it on major music platforms here.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2476090/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1690556513","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2476090/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1690556513","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2476090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1690556513","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2476090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1690556513","categories":[{"description":"Additional High-Quality Audio","id":50}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Experience the captivating and diverse musical landscape of Let\u2019s!
