{"about_the_game":"<strong>Inkulinati</strong> is a turn-based strategy game inspired by medieval manuscripts. Draw your army of Beasts, and spill the ink of your enemy, defeat medieval superstars and collect perks to unleash hidden powers.

Inkulinati is a game of nuance and brain-sizzling challenge that will test even the most hardened strategists. And as every hardened armchair general knows, it all starts with your units, which we call Beasts. There are multiple deadly (and bizarre) <strong>Beasts</strong> to unlock. They all have their special individual skills, as well as class-specific abilities causing different effects. And when these Beasts work in unison, a symphony of destruction, death, until the literal apocalypse will endure.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/957960/extras/BEASTS_v2.gif?t=1736356670\" /><br><br>It\u2019s not just your Beasts that can cause havoc and damage. There are special, battle tide-turning actions performed by the <strong>Inkulinati Masters</strong> themselves - such as yourself! Use your unique Hand Actions to smash your opponent's units, draw obstacles to create barriers, relocate your units with a move of your finger, or explode your troops to create pure, pure chaos. Just remember - your opponent can do it too. And to keep it more interesting, each Inkulinati Master can have their own set of Talents too that can help win the battle.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/957960/extras/HANDS_v2.gif?t=1736356670\" /><br><br>But wait, there\u2019s more. You will need to adapt your tactics to every battle. Each Battlefield is its own domain, with its own particular dangers that you should watch out for, and opportunities that you can use. Look out for objects that are scattered all over the <strong>Battlefields</strong>, such as exploding Pots of Beans, travelling Hell\u2019s Maws, Clouds of Blessings, and use them to your advantage. <br><br>And just when you think you have a handle on the battle, an <strong>Apocalyptic event</strong> can come in and flip all of your plans upside down.
