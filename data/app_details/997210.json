{"about_the_game":"Felix (Jared Abrahamson, HELLO DESTROYER) and Louis (Jedidiah Goodacre, TOMORROWLAND) love trouble. Wandering Fort McMurray with little to do, the brothers spend their time robbing convenience stores, betting on street fights and running from the cops - until their mother finds out and tries to set them straight, causing even more friction. Meanwhile, across town, beleaguered Misha (Morgan Taylor Campbell, POWER RANGERS) discovers that her less-than-stellar work ethic has gotten her fired in the same week that she discovers she's pregnant. As these wayward youths cross paths and Misha scrambles for money, the consequences of their actions echo through the shadows of this boom town.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/997210/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1556143218","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/997210/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1556143218","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/997210/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1556143218","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/997210/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1556143218","categories":[{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Native Steam Controller Support","id":33},{"description":"Captions available","id":13}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h1>Steam Video</h1><p>This content is only available in an online streaming format.
