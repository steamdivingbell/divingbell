{"about_the_game":"Introduced to handle commuter traffic right up until the turn of the century, and beyond, the \u00d6BB 4020 reigned supreme throughout Austria\u2019s key passenger routes \u2013 from the bustling cities to the rural mountain passes. Experience life in the cab of this classic unit as the \u00d6BB 4020 is ready for Train Simulator service!<br><br>By the 1970s, the \u00d6BB 4030 fleet was in its second decade of service, and with only limited units available, was struggling to cope with the ever-increasing demand that is the Austrian commuter network. A new electric multiple unit was required to take the strain, a unit capable of providing a suitable level of comfort \u2013 and faster journey times \u2013 for the many passengers that would be travelling on them.<br><br>The new units were classified as the \u00d6BB 4020 and began construction in the mid-1970s; Simmering-Graz-Pauker, BES, ELIN, Siemens and Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie were all responsible for the building of the new units. Austrian Federal Railways began delivery of their 120 new \u00d6BB 4020 EMUs by 1978, and quickly pressed them into service on 4 major lines throughout the country; the Vienna S-Bahn, the Lower Inn Valley Railway, the Semmeringbahn and the Mittenwaldbahn.<br><br>The \u00d6BB 4020 fleet represented the latest standard for Austria\u2019s railways, improving on previous units in many ways. A top speed of 120 km/h was a welcome introduction, as were the stronger brakes which allowed for faster journey times \u2013 even on the steeper routes. The spacious interior could comfortably sit 184 passengers plus stand even more, and this was easily doubled by coupling units together on peak-hour services.<br><br>Austrian Federal Railways took in their final \u00d6BB 4020 in 1987, by which point some of the previous \u00d6BB 4030\u2019s had already been withdrawn. The reliable build of the 4020s secured their spot as prominent traction for the latter quarter of the 20th Century, and even when the brand new \u00d6BB 4023 &amp; 4024 EMUs arrived on scene, the 4020s continued to operate on routes such as the Semmeringbahn, and riding on them across the mountains is still possible to this day.<br><br>The \u00d6BB 4020 for Train Simulator includes the 3-car EMU in both \u00d6BB\u2019s classic blue &amp; white, and the modern red &amp; grey liveries with old and new logo options available \u2013 each livery also features clean and weathered variations.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Scenarios</h2><br>The \u00d6BB 4020 EMU Add-on includes three challenging career scenarios for the Mittenwaldbahn: Garmisch-Partenkirchen \u2013 Innsbruck route (available separately):<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>To The Market<br></li><li>S5 from Scharnitz<br></li><li>Last Train to Innsbruck</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
