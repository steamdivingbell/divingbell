{"about_the_game":"Embark on a free adventure and battles in a fantastical world! You will play as one of the characters, embarking on a solo adventure, and along the journey, new 'travelers' will join your team. Despite carrying different dreams, you all set out on the same journey.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Features:</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">1.Colorful Fantastical World: </h2>Explore various regions such as beaches, rainforests, deserts, caves, dungeons, deserts, and grasslands, each inhabited by different types of creatures.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">2.Diverse Gameplay: </h2>Beyond exciting battles, you can choose to gather food for improved character attributes, strengthen character equipment by mining, and even try fishing to acquire random items. Be careful, as you may find yourself trapped in elaborate dungeons.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">3.Carefully Designed Combat System: </h2>The game adopts a semi-real-time tactical gameplay style. Apart from conventional tactical gameplay rules, you need to allocate your energy reasonably to maximize resource efficiency. Different types of weapons and skills can deal various types of damage to enemies, including cutting, piercing, crushing, fire, water, ice, poison, and lightning. Combining different elemental skills can trigger chain reactions, making battles easier.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">4.High Freedom: </h2>If you're tired of intricate plots, you can choose your own path for adventure. The game doesn't force-feed you with a storyline, and your adventure is self-driven.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2653850/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738819258","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2653850/page.bg.jpg?t=1738819258","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2653850/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738819258","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2653850/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738819258","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Embark on a free adventure and battles in a fantastical world!
