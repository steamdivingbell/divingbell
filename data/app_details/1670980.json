{"about_the_game":"In a retro, monochrome fantasy landscape, the white sage Jericho has employed you to stop the local warlock from reviving an ancient evil. Is it up to you, the Warp Soldier, to put an end to his dark ritual. With your vast movepool, unadulterated ferocity, a few movement gimmicks, and tiny peglegs, do you have what it takes to end the warlock's army before they put an end to you?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1670980/extras/ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif?t=1654979629\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EXPLORE A VAST, RETRO, INTERCONNECTED WORLD</h2>While the land lacks in color, the world the Warp Soldier must trek features several ecosystems, all authentically scored with the chippiest of tunes.

Whether the warlock's headliner henchmen become your bitter rivals or eventual allies will depend on how you express yourself during combat.
