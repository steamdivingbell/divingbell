{"about_the_game":"Welcome to &quot;Tactical Warfare,&quot; an immersive real-time strategy (RTS) experience that immerses you in an enthralling narrative of interstellar exploration, colonization, and unyielding conflict.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Breif Description</h2>The tactical war game is a strategic game with a classic perspective system and an enhanced artistic style, featuring an exciting story about a war between two forces, both human, but one group comes from a parallel planet to Earth after the destruction of their planet, seeking a new home. They face resistance from the indigenous inhabitants who consider it an alien invasion. To excel in the game, you must create a tactical battle plan. Based on that plan, you must balance between defense, offense, and resource acquisition.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Modes</h2>The game supports tactical systems that help players create diverse plans, ranging from simple to complex. Players draw specific paths, set objectives, and determine battle routes based on events that unfold in the game. Assigning tasks to each element is crucial to ensure the success of the plans. Building an army depends on the pre-prepared plan, requiring the player to ensure a suitable tactical approach to the war by choosing the appropriate elements to execute the plan and anticipating everything that should be present at all times.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Resources</h2>Money in the game is essential for victory, so players need to build their plans based on sufficient cash flow. The lack of funds leads to a halt in progress in the war. The game includes several systems for obtaining money, and players must choose the most suitable method for investing funds, either by increasing the economy through available methods, building defenses to fortify economic structures, or constructing an army to attack the enemy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Story</h2>The game currently consists of two main factions: the Terrans, the army of native citizens on Earth fighting against the space invasion, and the Assarlions, humans who came from a planet similar to Earth from a distant place. Each faction in the game has different and unique elements with varying combat abilities and styles, including tanks, combat vehicles, various types of aircraft, soldiers, and robots.<br><br>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2777600/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737390531","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2777600/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1737390531","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2777600/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737390531","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2777600/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737390531","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to &quot;Tactical Warfare,&quot; an immersive real-time strategy (RTS) experience that immerses you in an enthralling narrative of interstellar exploration, colonization, and unyielding conflict.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Breif Description</h2>The tactical war game is a strategic game with a classic perspective system and an enhanced artistic style, featuring an exciting story about a war between two forces, both human, but one group comes from a parallel planet to Earth after the destruction of their planet, seeking a new home.
