You must aim your primary weapon, gather resources with the help of your drones, rescue survivors and upgrade the might of your train strategically. Unlock new locomotives, weapons and bosses to defeat!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each locomotive has its own auxiliary system, for example the FP7 has the Fire Breather auxiliary system allowing your train to emit devastating flames. The primary weapon is independent of the locomotive you select so you get to choose which primary weapon you want to crush or melt the zombie horde with!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The environment is fully destructible and destroying buildings will reduce the amount of zombies spawning so it is a good idea to just destroy everything! Your main resources are gold, steel and survivors and these are what you need to upgrade your train. Gold is spawned from crates and a few building types; tombs, cabins, supermarkets, police stations. Steel is spawned from metal structures such as cars, camper vans, and a variety of buildings and structures you'd expect to have steel. Survivors will be hiding out at their safe houses and there are a random number of survivors each time you play.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The track is procedurally generated so each play through is different from the last! When you start your journey go slow and steady, gather  resources, and upgrade. As you progress, more and more zombies of increasing power will emerge and try to destroy your locomotive. Your ultimate goal is to defeat the zombie boss at the end of your journey!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game comes in many different colour schemes and you can choose your favourite from the Settings menu. You can change the game resolution and key binding. 5120 x 1440 wide screen monitors are supported.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Wishlist and signup for the playtest.</p>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3494210?t=1740487995","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3494210?t=1740487995","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3494210/05a4a958d067e802eed2c74471c6f37fd7954452/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1740487995","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3494210/05a4a958d067e802eed2c74471c6f37fd7954452/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1740487995","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"The player shoots down vast hordes of zombies."},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3494210/extras/Choo_Choo_Survivor_2_Short_Action_Clip_600px_shorter_opt.gif?t=1740487995\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Drive your train through the zombie apocalypse and defeat the boss.
