As a Raider, your mission is clear: surf solo or with your squad into the perilous waters of The Fallen World to scavenge ancient technologies while evading the deadly Sumi \u2013 ink-like creatures that corrupt these islands. Complete your mission and escape the tsunami with as much loot as your barge can carry! </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Crush 'n Rush!</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Feel the rush of adrenaline-fueled combat as you fight your way through the ruins, securing Evress \u2013 an ancient energy source vital to the Raider way of life. Master your weapon class and coordinate with your crew to unleash powerful combinations that turn the tide of battle. Whether tanking the Sumi\u2019s relentless onslaught, supporting the team, or dealing pinpoint damage, every Raider\u2019s role is critical for survival.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">But beware \u2013 the longer you stay, the deadlier the Sumi become. Larger foes will knock your team off-balance, requiring quick reaction times and a tactical approach. Make split-second decisions on when to grab loot and when to make a run for it.
