You can do this by using a variety of attacks and special moves given to your character. Note that attacks will deal additional damage if you press the button only briefly. Attacking the opponent will cause them to enter stun. If you attack the opponent while they're stunned you will perform a combo. Combos can be useful for dealing larger amounts of damage than individual attacks.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If you repeat the same move 3 times during a combo, you will gain an Infinite Prevention Strike. If you get 3 strikes, your opponent will automatically break out of the combo. Additionally, they may do this once per round for free by pressing the Special button after being attacked. They may also point their control stick in a particular direction in order to influence their velocity in that direction.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3317000/extras/Pick_Your_Poison.png?t=1735225201\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Who are the characters?</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game currently features 2 characters: Cyanide and Mercury. Cyanide is a feisty girl who carries a giant sword reminiscent of the weapons from anime and manga she enjoys.
