{"about_the_game":"<strong>Light and Embers</strong> is a relaxing experience.  Just sit back and listen to the crackle of the fire and the chirping of the birds.  We provided you with several logs so if the fire starts to burn out you can always add a log or stoke the fire to keep it burning.

Think of it as a fire simulator but without all the work and stress of actually having to keep a fire burning. <br><br><i><strong>What kind of gameplay is it?</strong></i>  You sit back, relax, and listen.  When the fire starts to burn out you can point and click with your mouse to add a log or stoke the fire. <br><br><i><strong>How much play time is in the game?</strong></i>  You can sit and enjoy the fire for as long as you wish.  The fire will burn for around 5 minutes if you don't add logs or stoke the fire.  There is an infinite mode where the fire will never burn out. <br><br><i><strong>Can I bring marshmallows? </strong></i> Yes, but they will not roast on this fire :(","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Infinite fire","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1306250/d8772305672a64ac3bc112cbdcb7c34f7f4cdd7e.jpg"},{"name":"Fire 60","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1306250/dbdf3450f61718666a28052b81f6a007465a1655.jpg"},{"name":"First fire","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1306250/8724dbcd73d045f0680be159499c61e199d460bd.jpg"},{"name":"Alive for 10","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1306250/603a216a7c794d411c268933a2f0b820065b2afe.jpg"},{"name":"Alive for 20","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1306250/df03d46bcc5699fa08c94efb9a322947d1f1b33c.jpg"},{"name":"Can't leave it alone","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1306250/5e1127877586d9b739c789080dc1992c5202cbe7.jpg"},{"name":"Music appreciation","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1306250/a82209813fbe2647c0d68a887d55647296997c1a.jpg"},{"name":"Eyes in the night","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1306250/dbff08f7aca608a31136bd07656494da36b3bec3.jpg"}],"total":8},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1306250/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1670955782","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1306250/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1670955782","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1306250/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1670955782","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1306250/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1670955782","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>Light and Embers</strong> is a relaxing experience.
