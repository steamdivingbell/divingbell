{"about_the_game":"<strong>Psych</strong> is a <strong>psychological horror thriller</strong> with a big focus on a suspenseful, <strong>hand-written story</strong> and an unforgettable <strong>atmosphere</strong>. Through unique, self-developed systems, Psych offers a new and innovative gaming experience that will not be forgotten. The <strong>open world</strong> invites you to explore, if you dare. Every corner of the park is filled with stories, <strong>puzzles</strong> or <strong>secrets</strong> to uncover. However, the biggest mystery is what happened on the day of the accident with Alex. While the main story has a few ways to unravel the mysteries, the side stories also provide plenty of clues and information. Psych is divided into 5 chapters that advance the story immersively, without the player noticing. The customized and countless sound effects will give you goosebumps after goosebumps. With Psych we want to create <strong>real horror</strong>, a game that will shake up the horror genre.
