{"about_the_game":"Space Tail is a 2.5D adventure platformer, which immerses the player in a deep, emotional plot, and lets him explore new planets and interact with alien civilizations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery journey changes the point of view \u2013 it grows with the traveller. Our game tells a story about self-exploration, transformation and understanding the world around us.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe plot of the game is inspired by real events, when people began their conquest of space by sending animals to the stars. We intended it to be a kind of a tribute to all the animals that paved the way for humans to go into space. Most of these animals - the first astronauts, did not survive the journey. Our story tells of the adventures of a dog named Bea, who... managed to beat the odds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBea is a cheerful and courageous character, but the player must remember that she is just a...  dog. She has all the characteristics of a mongrel - she barks, likes to chase her own tail, and learns about the world through her senses. Bea can sniff, listen and observe. These are the main mechanics of detective mode which will help her in exploring and understanding her environment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBea travels through space discovering more planets. Each planet is different and has its specific inhabitants, who can either become friends of the main character or be very unfriendly towards her. We are convinced that exploring this amazing world together with Bea will give the player a lot of satisfaction and pleasure.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2146240?t=1666265127","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2146240?t=1666265127","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2146240/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1666265127","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2146240/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1666265127","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Space Tail is a 2.5D adventure platformer, which immerses the player in a deep, emotional plot, and lets him explore new planets and interact with alien civilizations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery journey changes the point of view \u2013 it grows with the traveller.
