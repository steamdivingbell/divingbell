{"about_the_game":"In the midst of the 2020 pandemic, when performing arts spaces were forced shut, a team of creative and tech collaborators began a mammoth task to document Centre 42's beloved blue house as its own virtual world. Through the process of photogrammetry, we captured a digital rendering of the building. The desire stemmed from preserving memories, but it led to the curiosity in exploring and expanding opportunities to create theatre and build community beyond physical spaces.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Cloud House journey brings the player to a futuristic rendering of Centre 42. It is an invitation to explore its new imagining within a virtual world. You will encounter our very first experience titled 'Love Letters to 42', a single-player filmic story shot in 2020 that captures the history of pre-pandemic C42 at 42 Waterloo Street.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Cloud House, audiences can encounter arts performances, experiences, workshops and interact with artists and other audiences. It is also an invitation and opportunity for digital artists, theatre-makers to imagine their works to be presented in this space. The content, programmes, interactivity functions are being imagined and built as \u2018modules\u2019 and updates along the way after this initial launch. The digital possibilities are endless!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease note: the game environment features bright neon lights and special effects, discretion is advised.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2206960/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1680228578","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2206960/page.bg.jpg?t=1680228578","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2206960/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1680228578","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2206960/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1680228578","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In the midst of the 2020 pandemic, when performing arts spaces were forced shut, a team of creative and tech collaborators began a mammoth task to document Centre 42's beloved blue house as its own virtual world.
