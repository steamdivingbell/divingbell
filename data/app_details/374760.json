{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get in and take a seat at the wheel for a little time travel to Dresden in the year 2000</h2>.<br>In this add-on, Dresden's city center awaits you with its colorful mixture of magnificent buildings and out-of-place GDR buildings, experienced from the perspective of the streetcar driver of a Dresden streetcar. This is not just any streetcar, at the beginning the CarGoTram is ready for you on its route starting at the freight center in Friedrichstadt to the Transparent Factory. In fact, it now takes a simulation to bring these journeys back to life. The CarGoTram ran on its route for probably the last time in December 2020. Furthermore, this add-on is intended to commemorate the Tatra streetcars from Prague. In 2000, the T4D still drove in large numbers through the Dresden capital. On the also already discontinued line 26 you can experience the upheaval in the post-reunification period. The trip takes you on a fake ring line from Johannstadt past the Transparent Factory, the Rudolf Harbig Stadium to the main station along the so-called 26-er Ring back to Johannstadt. As the name 26-er Ring suggests, this ring around the Alstadt of Dresden is known after the streetcar line. It is a pity that it no longer runs today.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/374760/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1635579480","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/374760/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1635579480","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/374760/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1635579480","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/374760/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1635579480","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>In Development</h1><p><strong>Attention</strong><br>This product is currently still under development.
