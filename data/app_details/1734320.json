{"about_the_game":"Hieronymus Bosch's Brutal Orchestra is a Turn-Based Roguelike Strategy Game with resource management and deck-building elements. Employ the help of damaged and daring fools, equip ancient and insidious items and make deals with the devil on your path to revenge.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1734320/extras/Revenge_Steam.png?t=1708110077\" /><br><strong>Revenge:</strong><br>You died. Someone killed you. You are now in Purgatory and you will never escape. Make a deal with the &quot;demon&quot; Bosch and set off into this brutal and bastardous world, finding \u200ball manner of demented and degenerate friends and foes on your quest to get petty revenge.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1734320/extras/ManaSteam.png?t=1708110077\" /><br><strong>Pigment:</strong> <br>Purgatory bleeds pigment. It is a strange substance that Bosch has granted you the ability to control. Channeling pigment allows one to perform powerful and absurd abilities. Pigment comes in many colours, each derived from a different source, some even of your own flesh.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1734320/extras/Fools_Steam.png?t=1708110077\" /><br><strong>Fools:</strong> <br>This may be a place of the dead but even here there are still poor fools eking out a pathetic existence. Some would make for valuable party members or at least entertaining conversation. Most, however, are dim wits or damaged beyond all reason.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1734320/extras/Treasure_Steam.png?t=1708110077\" /><br><strong>Treasure!:</strong><br>Find over 100+ powerful artifacts that dramatically shape how you play Brutal Orchestra, often plucked directly from the artworks of Hieronymus Bosch.<br> <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1734320/extras/Bosses_Steam.png?t=1708110077\" /><br><strong>Hell:</strong> <br>Purgatory is not a gentle place, it is a writhing dump of all that has died in many worlds. Endless deserts of pale sand are stalked by parasitic fish. Storm-cloaked mountain tops hide ungodly things above and below. The Garden waits for you at the end of time.<br><br><strong>Hieronymus Bosch's Brutal Orchestra was developed by Talia bob Mair and Nicol\u00e1s Delgado. With Sound Design by Pato Flores and Chris Dang and Composed by Publio Delgado.</strong><br><br>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"The Veteran","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1734320/51e1e62d6ff47daeee4b75e238345c5f74f58a20.jpg"},{"name":"The Severed","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1734320/44c07b4a00f0007f1ada4279c5aca97e71da72aa.jpg"},{"name":"The Gambler","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1734320/1a43ef491db78180cce589eeaa88aedac62d6c09.jpg"},{"name":"The Conjoined","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1734320/cf17940f551bb954663c0125d89ff75bf9260e26.jpg"},{"name":"The Glutton","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1734320/8e9c4138f1ab6f3fdc7ef2f49323422f901a89f6.jpg"},{"name":"The Trickster","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1734320/5115a7086508bcf678e54825766304fae9cbf3ce.jpg"},{"name":"The Naked","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1734320/73e0d9314c174c1a899378eaf2eca831d8af9c98.jpg"},{"name":"The Failure","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1734320/b05e1ac529a105e3518bf30991c38c4778aa97b6.jpg"},{"name":"The Incinerated","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1734320/2994eb29e9fd60b7e9c47d14709a181463bace00.jpg"},{"name":"The Parasite","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1734320/6c27e2159ae2d89a7dd8ed8464e4080ad5f55e90.jpg"}],"total":135},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1734320/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1708110077","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1734320/page.bg.jpg?t=1708110077","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1734320/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1708110077","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1734320/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1708110077","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Cartoon creatures rupture into giblets of meat and blood upon death.\r\nThemes of substance abuse.\r\nThemes of suicide and self harm.\r\nNon-explicit nudity of humans/humanoids."},"detailed_description":"<h1>Explore the Clownpocalypse in Clown Meat!</h1><p>","developers":["Talia bob Mair","Nicol\u00e1s Delgado"],"dlc":[1880060],"genres":[{"description":"Action","id":"1"},{"description":"Adventure","id":"25"},{"description":"Casual","id":"4"},{"description":"Indie","id":"23"},{"description":"RPG","id":"3"},{"description":"Strategy","id":"2"}],"header_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1734320/header.jpg?t=1708110077","is_free":false,"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Ubuntu Linux<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel or AMD processor, 2.5 GHz<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 8 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce 470 GTX or AMD Radeon 6870 HD series card<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 850 MB available space</li></ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> macOS 10.11 (El Captain)<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 2,4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 8 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> ATI Radeon HD 2600 Pro<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 600 MB available space</li></ul>"},"movies":[{"highlight":true,"id":256863662,"mp4":{"480":"http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/256863662/movie480.mp4?t=1638841938","max":"http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/256863662/movie_max.mp4?t=1638841938"},"name":"Brutal Orchestra Release Trailer","thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/256863662/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1638841938","webm":{"480":"http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/256863662/movie480_vp9.webm?t=1638841938","max":"http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/256863662/movie_max_vp9.webm?t=1638841938"}}],"name":"Brutal Orchestra","package_groups":[{"description":"","display_type":0,"is_recurring_subscription":"false","name":"default","save_text":"","selection_text":"Select a purchase option","subs":[{"can_get_free_license":"0","is_free_license":false,"option_description":"","option_text":"Brutal Orchestra -
