{"about_the_game":"Inspired by the mysterious, dark and sinister tone of the of the Adagio Sostenuto from Beethoven\u2019s Moonlight Sonata, the soundtrack of &quot;At Eve\u2019s Wake&quot; combines innocent melodies with a malicious sense of horror. The music combines the intimacy of instruments like felt piano, harp, guitar and solo strings, with a dark orchestral sound. A sense of unease and slow transition into madness can be heard though the chromatic mediant modulations and gritty soundscapes that define the tonal language of this score.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1796090/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1635414369","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1796090/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1635414369","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1796090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1635414369","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1796090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1635414369","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Inspired by the mysterious, dark and sinister tone of the of the Adagio Sostenuto from Beethoven\u2019s Moonlight Sonata, the soundtrack of &quot;At Eve\u2019s Wake&quot; combines innocent melodies with a malicious sense of horror.
