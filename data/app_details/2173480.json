{"about_the_game":"Nothing ever truly resorts to such madness, but when something is brought to exist that fragments the true nature of what we believe to be possible, everything goes out the window and into the mitts of madness. What shall the world bring of the unnatural, and what should you bring to fix it?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is a survival horror game about completing tasks to slowly progress through levels of the story. Levels will slowly get harder and harder with new types of objectives and new monsters and mechanics. Your time is running short, and sometimes your stamina may be as well. A highly strategic game in a sense. Whether the monster be a deaf but fast monster with a bloodlust or a face in the shadows of another world, there will be one, lurking... waiting to strike, all being shown through a VHS camera. There is currently 1 chapter to enjoy and it has multiple unique monsters to pose as threats. The game can be loud, and can catch you off guard, so be ready for spooks! Take your trusty hammer and explore the depths.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd don't worry, there will be more...","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Find The Shopkeeper","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2173480/5a6dd872c1c776b51f4a76908809cffea2b68969.jpg"}],"total":1},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2173480/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1695708919","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2173480/page.bg.jpg?t=1695708919","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2173480/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1695708919","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2173480/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1695708919","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Nothing ever truly resorts to such madness, but when something is brought to exist that fragments the true nature of what we believe to be possible, everything goes out the window and into the mitts of madness.
