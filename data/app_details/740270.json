With a modern skin and beautiful effects, each song will captivate your senses.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>Ranging from difficult to easy, players can play through various EDM songs using ten keys from the home row of the keyboard. Through pressing notes as they traverse across the activation area, players accumulate score. Missing a note or pressing the wrong key losses life whereas hitting notes in succession heals the player.<br><br>Score is accumulated from both streak and precision. Hitting notes in a row builds streak which applies to the base note value. Base note values are determined by the accuracy of the press. There are three tiers of accuracy. Players must master both precision and consistency to score high.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/740270/extras/coffee.gif?t=1588379444\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Custom Songs</h2>Players can easily create, share, and download custom songs through use of third party tools. This means any song can be turned into a MusicWave track. Songs are generated from midis allowing players to use their favorite midi editing software to create tracks. For more information on creating songs, see the game website.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Career Mode</h2>There are plans for a career mode, or standard set of songs that grow in difficulty. Unlock new songs by scoring higher in the already unlocked songs. All score in career mode goes towards your career score which can be compared against the world for a global ranking in skill.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Encore!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/740270/c9a0e13dfccf5579b17011f42247e5976c27419f.jpg"},{"name":"Not Too Shabby","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/740270/66f05359f3772199564f84c7f61e8d64b19d68da.jpg"},{"name":"Precise Typist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/740270/6c5f3fdd0ded3d18ba72a61a8589f4856a892c49.jpg"},{"name":"Six Zeros!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/740270/9bdcb1d21da06019949c42c7f7f7c265d567bcbe.jpg"},{"name":"Achievement and Arthritis","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/740270/656f9cb28a3d3fcbad083a572c84758916a55d9d.jpg"},{"name":"This Achievement Only Exists Because If Anyone Actually Does This They Deserve to Put It in Their Achievement Showcase","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/740270/5f6df86e4298297f2ead957a0cd09503d1363ad5.jpg"}],"total":6},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/740270/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1588379444","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/740270/page.bg.jpg?t=1588379444","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/740270/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1588379444","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/740270/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1588379444","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<i>Lose yourself in a sea of vibrant lights as you tap along to your favorite electronic music.</i><br><br>Music Wave is a <i>challanging </i>Rhythm game for Electronic Dance Music that uses the home row of the keyboard.
