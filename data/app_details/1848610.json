{"about_the_game":"<i>In the fading light of 1999, the peaceful streets of Greenhart City were shrouded in darkness. On its outskirts stood the majestic Rogue Mansion, an opulent residence once inhabited by the esteemed couple Lazarus and Catherine Rogue. Known for their power, wealth, and influence, they were the pillars of the community. However, tragedy struck when Catherine succumbed to an incurable illness, leaving Lazarus broken and consumed by grief. Overcome by despair, Lazarus chooses to end his own life within the mansion's grand walls.<br><br>Now, months later, unexplained disappearances, strange sightings and disasters centred around the mansion have begun gripping the city. Nobody who has ventured inside to investigate the link has returned. The people of Greenhart need a hero.</i><br><br>ROGUE MANSION is a survival horror game combined with the best of the roguelike genre! Explore a procedurally generated mansion that changes every time you play, and becomes more dangerous and unpredictable according to your level of fear.<br><br>Experience the game in different ways, by choosing from multiple unique characters - each with their own equipment, special perks, and motivations. Switch between first-person or third-person perspectives at any time in order to remix how you see and approach challenges.<br><br>Manage your resources, solve puzzles, fight all kinds of unworldly creatures, and find a way out while you unravel the mysteries of the mansion.
