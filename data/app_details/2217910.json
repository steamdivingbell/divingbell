{"about_the_game":"The exhilarating Atari racing classic \u201cSprint\u201d series returns with NeoSprint. NeoSprint zooms back to life as a single screen arcade racer for up to 8 players, paired with a robust track builder and intuitive sharing tools, ensuring a racing experience that satisfies speed demons and architects alike. Campaign mode, Grand Prix, Obstacle Courses and Time Trials provide tons of pulse-pounding race content, and multiplayer modes make for chaotic fun. Can you conquer the speedways and claim the fastest times?<br><br><strong>Key Features:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Isometric Arcade Action:</strong> Precise controls with an arcade feel makes NeoSprint gameplay easy to pick up but hard to master. Learn the intricacies of drifting and drafting to pull ahead across a dazzling array of pre-made and player-created racetracks.<br></li><li><strong>Robust Track-Building and Sharing: </strong>Design twisting, turning tracks with a deep, customizable track builder. Build ramps, jumps, banks and more, and add a variety of scenery and decorations to make your track unique. Four different biomes - forest, desert, winter, and city - bring a completely different look. Easy tools to share and rank your tracks - and try others tracks - ensuring endless hours of new, exhilarating content.<br></li><li><strong>A Lineup built for Speed: </strong>Featuring 9 different car types, from muscle to sports car, all with their own speed, acceleration and handling. Each car is customizable with different colors and Atari-themed decals. Customize your lineup and get racing!<br></li><li><strong>Campaign Mode: </strong>For those playing solo, challenge 8 different rival racers in NeoSprint\u2019s campaign mode. Travel through multiple Cups with increasingly difficult tracks. As you progress, unlock new decorations and car liveries.<br></li><li><strong>Alternate Game Modes: </strong>Grand Prix mode allows you to build bespoke circuits from your own tracks, or tracks downloaded by the community. Additionally, Obstacle Courses and Time Trials provide hours of racing fun after completing the Campaign.</li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Training Wheels Off","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2217910/80d02d82a1525960f208a53e316393598b0cb004.jpg"},{"name":"Nowhere to go but up","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2217910/5b9ffb9c8f8ec53a98a7991d71fbcd0ef4cf787e.jpg"},{"name":"We Are Number One","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2217910/37e44b5000f2a4c3cbca435e4b22bbcc72ec49b9.jpg"},{"name":"Green Thumb","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2217910/e48e801766ac1ed733e8912b4177f9101bc54e0d.jpg"},{"name":"Le Lion Rouge","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2217910/22807723f55cbfa9a7bb6330ffcc84da0055adcd.jpg"},{"name":"Winter Wonder","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2217910/3886b503ce8183f418bc7fa9e086478f5948aeb4.jpg"},{"name":"NightRaid","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2217910/d7cc509ec44257e05a8e715c35496ceafbd5a20f.jpg"},{"name":"Rule #1: Nobody Talks about the cup","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2217910/c5cec87dc7fb1fb07720563496a7a476d40c6da3.jpg"},{"name":"My GP, my rules","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2217910/e3ed56a4205a478e09d79e197e09909e30751338.jpg"},{"name":"Racing Club","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2217910/b50468984295f3b8db4536c4c39d5743060cd915.jpg"}],"total":37},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2217910/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733160533","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2217910/page.bg.jpg?t=1733160533","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2217910/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733160533","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2217910/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733160533","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"The exhilarating Atari racing classic \u201cSprint\u201d series returns with NeoSprint.
