Here you meet a small community of Elves, Goblins, Dwarves, and other humans going through everyday life together. In this new world, dungeons are a vital source of income, and Dungeonpreneurs are the daring adventurers who explore the ever-changing dungeons for their vast resources! As a Dungeonpreneur you live your everyday life by exploring dangerous dungeons to gather rare loot and exotic ingredients and use your findings to stock up your item shop and sell delicious meals in your tavern.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Learn why you were brought to this world, fall in love with the kind townsfolk, save them from a terrible danger threatening their way of life, and grow your guild to reach the top of the guild rankings!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2564200/extras/Features.png?t=1735475433\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Manage Your Guild</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Run a thriving item shop.</strong> Profit from your dungeon expeditions by selling loot items in your very own shop.

Each monster will require its own strategy to beat. Do not underestimate them: monsters are dangerous and have their own tactics to defeat unsuspecting adventurers.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Magical shifting dungeons.</strong> No dungeon is ever the same! Their layouts constantly shift due to their magical properties. Can you keep your wits about you and get out safely with your loot? Make the tough calls on your expeditions: do you go forward for that one more floor and risk it all.

They all play their own part for the town: running shops and guilds, guarding the island from monsters, fishing, farming, etc.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Compete with rivals.</strong> Not everyone will embrace you and your guild with open arms. Compete with rival Dungeonpreneurs who will try to make their own profits at your expense. Contracts and dungeons are not a monopoly, so you will have to be quicker and smarter to beat the competition!</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Make friends and find love.</strong> Become friends with the locals, and perhaps even profess your love if you find that special someone.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Note</strong>: This game is currently in early development.
