{"about_the_game":"Welcome to <strong>The Concourse</strong>, a highly competitive racing game that forces players to literally think on their feet to conquer randomly generated tracks &amp; obstacles. Take the lead from your foes with energy attacks designed to disrupt their flow and concentration. After every race is completed, the winner chooses a modifier to apply to the subsequent races. Increase speed for everyone, permanently invert controls, decrease the effectiveness of the energy attacks or reset everything to the defaults. Every race you play will be a unique experience.
