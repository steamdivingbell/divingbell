{"about_the_game":"The Institute of Ancient Artifiact Recovery (TIAAR) has hired you and your team to retrieve precious artifacts from the ruins of long forgotten acient civilizations! Your mission is simple, retrieve these artifacts in the utmost pristine condition and deliver them to the museum and you will be compensated handsomely. Your team may use any means necessary to extract the artifacts, including the most high tech solutions like gravity guns and other equipment, AS LONG AS THE ARTIFACTS ARE NOT DAMAGED!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Game Play Features</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Minesweeper-Type Exploration</h2>Using the standard rules of minesweeper will be your best strategy for navigating these trecherous ruins. Clearing out safe mines will reward you with artifacts and access to the depths of the caves. However, if you dare to trigger a trap while in the cave, prepare for a world of pain. Enemies, traps and environmental hazards are all things a sophisticated adventurer such as yourself must be prepared to deal with after all.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Artifact Extraction</h2>Once you ascertained the location of several artifacts, use your handy gravity gun to extract the artifact safely out of the ruins without damaging it. Some items are especially heavy or fragile and require the help of your teammates to tackle such a task. BE WARNED: the museum is not willing to pay for exessively damaged artifacts, and any damages will be collected directly out of your compensation!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Museum Progression and Advancement</h2>As you collect more and more artifacts and fill up the museum, it will increase in size and grow in popularity. This will provide you with access to even more locations of ruins and equipment to expand your operation!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3153030/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726610059","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3153030/page.bg.jpg?t=1726610059","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3153030/931fc854ada9aef4a863d7a682d05b67fa446046/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726610059","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3153030/931fc854ada9aef4a863d7a682d05b67fa446046/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726610059","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Institute of Ancient Artifiact Recovery (TIAAR) has hired you and your team to retrieve precious artifacts from the ruins of long forgotten acient civilizations!
