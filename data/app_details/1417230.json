Damage, reload speed and range affect both you and your enemies, while resistance affects only yourself and your teammates - giving you ample opportunity to customize the game's difficulty to your personal preference. The game supports up to 5 players coop - 4 controllers and one KB/M. You can play it solo as well if you'd like, though it's not recommended.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1417230/extras/store_navy.png?t=1620515324\" /><br>A top-down perspective coupled with simplistic 3D graphics make the game able to run on pretty much any computer you put it on - from your old laptop to your grandpa's Positivo, and intuitive and simple design means gramps can even join you in the fight!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1417230/extras/store_baddie.png?t=1620515324\" /><br>At the start of every level, every player and enemy gets one of four weapons: a shotgun, a pistol, a rifle, or a submachinegun.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The shotgun fires several projectiles at once, but its range, individual projectile damage and reload speed are the worst.<br></li><li>The pistol reloads quickly, but has range, damage, firerate and range worse than the SMG and rifle.
