{"about_the_game":"Layer Hunt is a survival sandbox and dungeon game where the goal is to survive and hunt down all the bosses. To reach your goal you will have to mine, craft, build, farm, fight and explore for new abilities and resources. The world is broken up through many different layers that each offer new enemies, minerals and dungeons to explore. To progress, the player must explore all these layers and eliminate each layer's boss to finally beat the game.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2084230/extras/Markering_Steam_Features.png?t=1726402492\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Layer based dungeon system -</strong> Explore underground layers to hunt down bosses and enemies in their fortified dungeons.
