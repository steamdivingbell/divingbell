{"about_the_game":"<strong>Attack at Dawn: North Africa</strong> is a strategy game set in WW2 North African theatre. You will take command of battalions, brigades, divisions, and air wings. German forces start off probing into the Libyan region of Cyrenaica, and the game concludes either with the complete defeat of the German-Italian Panzer Armee, or the British loss of Egypt and the British retreat across the Suez Canal.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FAST AND INTENSE GAMEPLAY</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1383640/extras/Animated-GIF-Fast-and-Intense.gif?t=1685625815\" /><br><br>You can play the game in either <strong>Real-Time</strong> or <strong>Turn-Based</strong> (WeGo) mode.
