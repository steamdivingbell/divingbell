{"about_the_game":"The content of this DLC includes:<br />\r\nPurchase to acquire the dual action hunter hero:Forrester, and three of Forrester's treasures: Elf Bow, Elf Leather Armor, and Agile Dagger.<br />\r\nForrester can attack from range as well as melee. In addition, he can be the leader of the hunter in the team, increasing the aid for all his hunter Allies at the start of the battle.<br />\r\nBackground:<br />\r\nForrester grew up in the depths of the forest, and his elven ancestry gave him extraordinary senses, so few prey could escape from his arrows. Unconstrained by bow strings and arrows, Forrester's lithe posture allows him to pull a dagger from his waist and deal with close enemies. Forrester devoted himself to nature, and when the ecology he loved was facing destruction, Forrester realized that his arrow had to go much further.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1610510?t=1620984088","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1610510?t=1620984088","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1610510/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1620984088","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1610510/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1620984088","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The content of this DLC includes:<br />\r\nPurchase to acquire the dual action hunter hero:Forrester, and three of Forrester's treasures: Elf Bow, Elf Leather Armor, and Agile Dagger.<br />\r\nForrester can attack from range as well as melee.
