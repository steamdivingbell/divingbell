{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Overview</h2>So it's now been six months since we have had Hannon out on Steam in Early Access. In that time I have quadrupled the locations / systems and added over 60 NPC's with just under 200 specific missions. This does not include Terminal based missions added in the 1.48 release.<br><br>I have managed to cram in Mining, Salvage, Refining and Crafting. Created a storage system and increased the collectable items in the game to 363 (last count).<br><br>I have added multiple weapons systems for the Shuttle and 14 different hand held weapons for Hannon to defend himself.<br><br>I added exploration for Planets and exploration for Derelicts. Allowing for more looting and challenges, plus the collection of weapon Schematics. <br><br>Alongside the planetary exploration, I also added 'Harvesting and Mining' again allowing for the collection of more resources for crafting and NPC missions.<br><br>I created a Galactic Database and added 152 entries including starter guides.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">But I'm FAR from done...</h2>What we have now form's a solid backbone for the game to begin to grow. More systems, more bad guys, many more planets and derelicts for exploring.<br><br><br>The scope for crafting is pretty much-unlimited thanks to SMO's excellent crafting schematic system.<br><br>If we get enough support through Early Access I still intend to add into the mix 'Cooperative gameplay', with players playing in the same Universe, trading and aiding each other in the Phoenix Galaxy.<br><br>Meanwhile, I am working on the Ship Yard. This will allow you to swap out your primary Six weapon mounts. <br><br>More Aliens, more territory for you to traverse, more planets to land on and simply 'More' of the Phoenix Galaxy.  With your Feedback (via our Discord Server and steam Community pages) I hope to continue onwards developing Hannon for you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Storyline</strong></h2>Charlie had been desperate to get off Morland after being without a ship for over a year.

We want to grow on this with a slew of new professions to mix into your game play.<br><br><strong>Art, Sound &amp; Music:</strong> We have striven to add new sounds, music and artwork to Hannon but through Early Access funding we will continue to replace and deploy more and more new designs, sounds and sound effects.\u201d<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dev Footnote</h2>I'm are here for the long haul, what ever it takes to make Hannon a game worthy of your admiration.
