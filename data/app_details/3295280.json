Graphium Studio knows how to do puzzles right; they always have a bunch of settings and puzzle shapes to make them enjoyable. I love that you can see every picture in the demo and do them in any order. There are six different categories: Dark Arts - Fallen Memories - Fright Stories - Music of Autumn - Haunted Phantoms, and a Bonus Chapter. There are two Puzzle Modes, Mosaic with eight different shapes available, and Classic, which has six different puzzle cutouts. You can also select the number of pieces for each puzzle individually and fine-tune the background color with a full-scale color chart. The icing on the cake...there's a pretty interesting story that progresses as you earn energy by completing the puzzles!\u201d<br>5\\5 \u2013 pennmom36<br><br>\u201cAnother excellent offering in the Jigsaw genre. This one is Halloween oriented and the brilliant colors in the autumn picture set are gorgeous. But be warned: the plot is dark, very dark indeed. Our character is a fellow with an evil alter ego, a Jester, that threatens to destroy him for his past sins. The art picks up the menacing atmosphere, concentrating on a panoply of Halloweeny monsters, (even if the Witch Girl is awfully cute). Music this time is a little over-fond of drum rolls and cymbal splashes that fortunately can be turned down. Overall, a rather intense (and too short) plot covering what we're really here for, some beautiful art. Still, a question for the artist, or rather the editor who chose the pieces. Is there no room for little boys in your fantasy world? It must be a boring place\u201d<br>5\\5 \u2013 timothya<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3295280/ss_bc7e04e24e9567c3c6edd00a6a5548e11f120872.1920x1080.jpg?t=1733751922","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3295280/ss_bc7e04e24e9567c3c6edd00a6a5548e11f120872.600x338.jpg?t=1733751922"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3295280/ss_a76bec933a7470ec26efcb254274b118b49a9c99.1920x1080.jpg?t=1733751922","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3295280/ss_a76bec933a7470ec26efcb254274b118b49a9c99.600x338.jpg?t=1733751922"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3295280/ss_61be62fcf7aa639e00ad1fa2cf5bcbfa19d36ca6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1733751922","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3295280/ss_61be62fcf7aa639e00ad1fa2cf5bcbfa19d36ca6.600x338.jpg?t=1733751922"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3295280/ss_1373f07c6a6e93e29043ba3a57fa8d6f4f841804.1920x1080.jpg?t=1733751922","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3295280/ss_1373f07c6a6e93e29043ba3a57fa8d6f4f841804.600x338.jpg?t=1733751922"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3295280/ss_da848213a434688df1f5d407fd02c7384610f6c7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1733751922","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3295280/ss_da848213a434688df1f5d407fd02c7384610f6c7.600x338.jpg?t=1733751922"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3295280/ss_2a5e32a78323e3a96cb279f3a707469ac0c85f18.1920x1080.jpg?t=1733751922","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3295280/ss_2a5e32a78323e3a96cb279f3a707469ac0c85f18.600x338.jpg?t=1733751922"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3295280/ss_4a24a747847cc46f8b35987038970e53ccda1dfa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1733751922","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3295280/ss_4a24a747847cc46f8b35987038970e53ccda1dfa.600x338.jpg?t=1733751922"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3295280/ss_2fba3e7b174d77442a9e745e14d5b63361a77bf7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1733751922","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3295280/ss_2fba3e7b174d77442a9e745e14d5b63361a77bf7.600x338.jpg?t=1733751922"}],"short_description":"Can you break free from the trap set by the strange Jester, who is always laughing?
