{"about_the_game":"Spritify is a tool for the fast and easy generation of 2D sprites.  <br>It transforms simple input images consisting of smart pixels into many distinct output images with varying properties, such as gradient, noise and color which can then be exported and used in your projects.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Demo version</h2>There's a demo version of Spritify that you can get for free to evaluate it.  <br>In the demo some of the import and export functions are disabled.  <br>Also many of the sizes and factors are greatly limited (Palette, Canvas, Sprite counts, Scaling factors, ...).  <br>All other features are available.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Guide</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Quick overview</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hotkeys</h2>Note that several functions can also be performed via hotkeys.
