{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A new adventure game in the Chatbot Roleplay category. Among the ancient Egyptian ruins, a book is found, and in our game, we talk to this book. The book answers everything we write. The book's general power is that everything written in it becomes real in the world, but we discuss the consequences with the book. Topics like governance systems, rainfall, nature, human ideas, and fighting crime. You can also escape from zombies and play many scenarios where you find a shelter for yourself. You can study with the book and teach it. Enjoy the game!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3336020/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733755642","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3336020/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1733755642","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3336020/e650925d80cd89def73629541149ec513222c49e/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733755642","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3336020/e650925d80cd89def73629541149ec513222c49e/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733755642","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A new adventure game in the Chatbot Roleplay category.
