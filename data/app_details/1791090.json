{"about_the_game":"Timmy the Tiger's Big Adventure is a game about a tiger just living his best life.  Then the world suddenly changes around him, making everything bigger and hostile.  Fight your way through groups of possessed enemies, find a new place to call home, and maybe just discover a few secrets along the way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game was designed to be fun, not difficult to beat.  It tells a story more than challenges the player, but that doesn't mean there aren't any tough fights in the game.
