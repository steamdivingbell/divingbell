{"about_the_game":"Become a great tattoo artist and work your way to success! Have you always wanted to learn how to draw tattoos? Now you can do it in our tattoo studio simulator. Move your virtual studio from one city to another, find new clients and expand your tattoo drawing skills. Become the most famous ink master in the world!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow it works.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStory:<br />\r\nYou are a young tattoo artist with a big dream to become famous. You start your journey in a small ink store in Rochester. You start to get good at what you do, so it's time to build your own brand and open your own tattoo studio! Focus on drawing more and more beautiful tattoo designs for your clients. Who knows what city the next one will be in. Check it out!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\nDraw a tattoo according to the customer's idea. You have a sketch of the tattoo. Important:<br />\r\n- don't mix up the colors,<br />\r\n- don't go beyond the edges of the drawing,<br />\r\n- try to draw as accurately as possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut be careful:<br />\r\n- you have limited time!<br />\r\n- your client doesn't like too much pain - she's limited!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is not another photo editor. This game is different, you can learn how to draw tattoos and have fun at the same time. It's more like the idea of a tattoo mogul. You can't get a tattoo of yourself in your photo.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRemember that every customer is different. So everyone has a different idea for their tattoo. They all have different ideas and inspiration for their tattoos. Some of them like old-school category or animals, cat tattoo or dog tattoo, while others like tribal and heart. One client likes a portrait tattoo, another likes biomechanical or geometric tattoos or their name. You have to listen to them and draw what they want.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the game you will find jobs in different cities. One of them is the bonus city of Zombies ;) !!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou constantly need to upgrade your ink machine and tattoo needles. Without it, it will be hard to finish the game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3181400/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731079786","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3181400/page.bg.jpg?t=1731079786","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3181400/25e2960e1c89b4e0b24f6f772745be360ba0a2f9/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731079786","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3181400/25e2960e1c89b4e0b24f6f772745be360ba0a2f9/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731079786","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3239120,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Become a great tattoo artist and work your way to success!
