{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Sleeping: Counting Sheep</strong> is a relaxing and playful experience set on a peaceful, isolated island in the middle of the ocean. Players control a floating camera that watches over a serene pasture, where sheep continuously spawn and leap over a fence in the center. It\u2019s the perfect game for winding down or for streamers looking to entertain their audience while they\u2019re away from the keyboard.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game offers Twitch integration, allowing viewers to interact directly by spawning sheep through chat events, subscriptions, follows, or bit donations. You can customize the percentage chance of sheep spawning from each event, adding a fun and interactive element to your stream. Each sheep spawned from Twitch events comes with the viewer's name, and if the &quot;Baa's&quot; setting is enabled, viewers can communicate as their sheep, sending either shortened messages or simple \u201cBaa!\u201d sounds.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If no keyboard or mouse input is detected for a while, <i>Sleeping: Counting Sheep</i> seamlessly transitions into a cinematic mode, slowly panning around the pasture and the sheep. It\u2019s a calming, hands-off experience designed for streamers who want to relax or entertain their audience while they\u2019re away.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game was developed as a dedicated space for streamers who want to relax on Twitch, offering an alternative to the &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot; category that\u2019s often misused.
