{"about_the_game":"A group of high skilled former martial artists get together and spar for fun to keep up with their old practice. The main character Lushi tends to seek out his old adversaries for a few more rounds of sparring. There are different maps based in different places and environments all over! The first playable characters will meet and uncover new players (playable characters) through Story mode where you will spar and unlock them once it is released(coming Soon!). In Sparring choose a character and match them up with who you want in the menu (some characters will be locked!). Sparring mode does not feature any health bars, you will see your enemy defeated once they turn red or a different color and can no longer be hit!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- This game is a first release version there will be updates where more features and assets will be dropped and added(monthly).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Features original scene, and screen sounds Soundtracks and OFX.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2767970/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738628317","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2767970/page.bg.jpg?t=1738628317","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2767970/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738628317","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2767970/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738628317","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A group of high skilled former martial artists get together and spar for fun to keep up with their old practice.
