Created with endless love; especially for fans of space pirates, sci-fi westerns and alien encounters!</strong><br><br>Silent Sector takes us to a remote part of the galaxy where several factions fight each other over the profits in a new gold rush - in pursuit of an extraordinarily valuable mineral called Eldorite. <br><br>Our hero comes into this Wild West universe and very quickly loses both their ship and cargo.
