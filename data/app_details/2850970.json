{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Warning: This is NOT a game for those looking to dive into a complex storyline or play an RPG. Instead, this is a game for those who love fashion and want to relax by dressing up their model over and over\u2014from the simplest outfits to the most exquisite ensembles. To make things more interesting, the difficulty (or your competitors' level) will adapt to your successes or failures. It\u2019s easy to win at lower difficulties, but it becomes quite challenging (though still possible!) at the &quot;Grand Couturier&quot; level.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The gameplay is divided into two phases: dressing up and competing, round after round. When all rounds are completed, the game ends, adjusts your rating, and you can start again. This may sound dull to those who need a deep story or an RPG experience, but it\u2019s perfect for those who just want to relax, dress up models in beautiful outfits, and compete in the fashion world.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We\u2019ve focused on ensuring that what the game does, it does well. You start by selecting a model, and during the game, you spend coins on items of varying prices. You can always repaint items or add patterns. During competitions, the game takes into account not just how beautiful or expensive the clothing is, but also how well the different parts of the model\u2019s outfit work together.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Overall, it\u2019s a small but replayable paid game for those who enjoy this type of experience. There are no microtransactions, and there never will be, unlike many other fashion games. This was important to us from the very start of development.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">They say fashion is dead. By creating a beautiful, replayable roguelike about fashion, we aim to challenge that idea.
