{"about_the_game":"Gravels of Endless War is a new online turn-based strategy game. There are 1v1 battles like in chess. Each gravel represents one unit. You have to create at least one team to start the online battles (but you can save different presets). <br><br><strong>Build your uniqe team!</strong><br><br>There are 18 available units but you can choose maximum 12. Each unit has a cost and you will have a budget so you have to optimize your selection.<br>The unit's cost is very important because it determines how much you can move during the battles.<br><br><u>The units are divided into 4 groups:</u><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Human</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fantasy</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Mythical</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Spooky</li></ul><br><u>Unit types:</u><br>Each unit has a type (Melee, LongRange, Magic).
