Players take control of Lyn Graves, the precocious niece of legendary treasure hunter Zachary Graves. Lyn visits her uncle\u2019s mansion with her closest compatriots, only to find the house overrun with ghouls and monsters who quickly grab and spirit away her friends. In order to free her uncle and her friends, and capture all the supernatural foes, Lyn must find the shattered pieces of a magical urn and put them back together.<br><br>Through procedurally generated room layouts, shifting walls, unpredictable enemy placements, and unique ghostly encounters, Lyn must creep, sneak, and dash her way through hordes of ghouls and eerie ectoplasms in order to locate her friends and uncle. Each urn shard is fiercely guarded by a bone-chilling boss \u2014 with 3D isometric stealth gameplay, Lyn must think on her feet to conquer each challenge. When she gets knocked out by a shadowy specter, she winds up back at the Haunted House\u2019s entrance and must face an entirely new floor layout and enemy placement, ensuring each run is unique.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Resurrected Roguelite:</strong> Haunted House doubles down on stealth and mystifying challenges while adding roguelite elements, ensuring no two runs are the same. <br></li><li><strong>All-Ages Thrill Ride:</strong> The whimsical, cartoonish art style only thinly veils the chills and thrills in Haunted House! Expertly riding the line between goofy and spooky, Haunted House features primarily stealth-based gameplay and light combat sequences.<br></li><li><strong>Unlockable Characters:</strong> As Lyn explores the Haunted House, she\u2019ll free her trapped friends, who become playable characters you can use to dive deeper into the mansion.
