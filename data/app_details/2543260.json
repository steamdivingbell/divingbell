{"about_the_game":"<i>Noblesse Oblige: Legacy of the Sorcerer Kings </i>is currently a free game. If you would like to support the game as the passion project of a solo developer, consider purchasing this DLC! The Crown Loyalist Pack is <i><strong>primarily for supporting the game</strong></i>.  <br><br>Purchasing this DLC does provide minor in-game benefits, including a larger selection of sprites for Alexander, a token worth one point of Noble Support or Popular Support, and a Crown Loyalist necklace equippable by any party member except Alexander. These benefits are a minor token of my thanks, and will never be expected in setting stat cutoffs or when balancing the game!<br><br>The DLC content is accessible in game during or after Chapter 5 of the game, when the option to customize Castle Kharos has been unlocked. Once you reach this point in the game, a small golden chest will be available on Alexander's desk as pictured in the screenshot on this page. Interacting with this chest will unlock the DLC rewards.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2543260?t=1714205046","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2543260/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1714205046","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2543260/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714205046","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2543260/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714205046","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<i>Noblesse Oblige: Legacy of the Sorcerer Kings </i>is currently a free game.
