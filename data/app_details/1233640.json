{"about_the_game":"Spirit of Glace is a story-rich, open world adventure platformer that tells the unforgettable tale of Glace, a small creature who suddenly appears out of nowhere during a strange experiment.

Help Glace discover true purpose by finding his family and guarding their world against a coming withering darkness. Players will find a fresh platforming adventure as they run, jump, fight and ricochet through the environment.<br><br>Spirit of Glace is based on the original title, &quot;Glace&quot;, from 2004 and is a complete reboot/reimagination brought to you by the original developer.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> An <strong>open world</strong> to explore at your own pace.
