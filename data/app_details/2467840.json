{"about_the_game":"Introducing Artemis Cosmos, the ultimate spaceship bridge simulator designed for both online and LAN gamers seeking thrilling adventures with their friends. With over a decade of multiplayer space gaming excellence, we've reimagined the original game from scratch, preserving its awe-inspiring experience of serving aboard a starship while defending the sector against nefarious aliens and treacherous cosmic phenomena.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Cosmos, you and your friends can join forces on a bridge of up to six players, safeguarding your deep space stations against the menacing Kraliens and Torgoth fleets. Immerse yourself in a modern software environment with enhanced graphics, network play, and endless customization possibilities, guaranteeing countless hours of exhilarating fun.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCosmos is a cooperative spaceship bridge simulation game that allows 2 to 11 players to become the crew of a spacecraft, all from the comfort of your own living room. Gather your friends for an epic gaming session by simply inviting them over with their computers. With Steam, you can install the game on all the computers of your fellow players, creating a classic Local Area Network setup. While there are no official Artemis servers for online matchmaking, you can connect with like-minded players through our forums.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne copy of the game must be the server, and all the players connect and become client stations, controlling the functions of the spaceship you are all aboard.  Players can run more than one copy of the game simultaneously, in case your play group doesn't have enough players.  This should allow a player to play all stations by themselves, but that's no fun.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach ship in Cosmos can accommodate 5 bridge officers alongside the Captain. Some ships even have the capability to carry fighters and their pilots. To embark on an adventure, a minimum of 2 players is required to assume the roles of Helm and Weapons. You can also have multiple human-controlled ships simultaneously exploring the vastness of space. There's no artificial limit to how many individuals can crew their ships together within a single sector.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince 2021, we have been meticulously crafting Cosmos on our  PAX engine, which we began developing in 2018. Our new code systems harness the power of Python as the scripting language, enabling unlimited customization and expansion possibilities for the game as we venture into the future.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPython scripting  allows unprecedented control of the gameplay: NPC AI, User interface, Communication, science, visual effects, DMX and much more. Enabling creation of your own new player console or informational screens, developing rich narrative driven missions, and creating entire new modes of play. Gamemasters and convention organizers should find these abilities extremely helpful to curate the gameplay, while opening limitless possibilities. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrepare for an interstellar journey like no other \u2014 Artemis Cosmos awaits your crew!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2467840/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731680578","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2467840/page.bg.jpg?t=1731680578","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2467840/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731680578","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2467840/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731680578","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Introducing Artemis Cosmos, the ultimate spaceship bridge simulator designed for both online and LAN gamers seeking thrilling adventures with their friends.
