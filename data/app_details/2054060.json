{"about_the_game":"&quot;Midnight Report&quot; is a rogue-lite 3D survival horror game in which a student (the protagonist) who is having hallucinations while staying up all night writing a report struggles to escape from the hallucinations filled with terrifying monsters. Players use items and gimmicks to overcome threats and aim to escape from the randomly generated fantasy world with their friends.<br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><i>Features Of This Game</i></h2></strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong><i>A unique world themed around staying up all night writing a report</i></strong><br>This work is a homage to the experience of being chased by a report assignment, and breathes life into it as a horror game. Each stage is designed with the motif of hallucinations caused by staying up all night, providing an experience of wandering between reality and hallucinations. A new stage, &quot;Village,&quot; will be introduced in the full version. This stage is lined with old houses with tiled roofs, giving you a sense of the solemn Japanese atmosphere of Japanese horror. In the village, reports (archives), movies, new items, new allies, enemies, gimmicks, etc. are implemented to unravel the story that was not revealed in the beta version, allowing you to enjoy more advanced negotiations.<br></li><li><i><strong> Numerous creatures with cunning minds and creepy appearances </strong></i><br>In the full version, more intelligent enemy characters will attack the player, such as a stalker AI that approaches while hiding in the shadows, and a sniper AI that carries a gun and waits for a surprise attack. The creature design is conscious of &quot;creepy smiles&quot;, and is designed to evoke the existence of another world. In the full version, a humanoid monster wearing a doll's head appears, and its strangely human-like movements enhance the fear.<br></li><li><i><strong> Replayability and strategy due to random generation </strong></i><br>In this game, items, gimmicks, enemies, stages, etc. are randomly generated. Some stages are generated using a maze generation algorithm, so you can enjoy a different stage each time. In a world that changes randomly, you will use items and gimmicks to cooperate with your companions and aim to escape from the other world.</li></ul><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><i>Gameplay Overview</i></h2></strong><br>You control the protagonist from a first-person perspective.
