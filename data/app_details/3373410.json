The people of this civilization were highly spiritual, living in connection with the universe in a world of love and harmony, free from ego and conflict. &quot;Kata&quot; represents &quot;things with form (the visible world),&quot; while &quot;Kamu&quot; signifies &quot;life energy (the invisible world).&quot; By understanding both aspects, they are believed to have harnessed the vibrations of the heart and wielded the energy of the universe with incredible mastery.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Katakamuna documents, believed to originate from this ancient civilization, consist of 80 verses arranged in spiral patterns. These &quot;Katakamuna Utahi&quot; were composed in a traditional 7-5 rhythm. The 5th and 6th verses, in particular, are structured with 48 phonetic sounds, forming the basis of modern Japanese (especially Katakana).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each of the 48 sounds of the Katakamuna glyphs embodies an invisible physical law encoded in its sacred vibrations, unveiling the secrets of universal creation and the cycle of life. This timeless wisdom continues to illuminate our lives with new insights, offering profound truths relevant even in the modern era.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Embark on a harmonious journey where the universe and the heart connect in <strong>Katakamuna Idle</strong>.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3373410/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737173800","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3373410/page.bg.jpg?t=1737173800","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3373410/2f991f751bdac62e101a3b0be0685c219d4e61c1/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737173800","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3373410/2f991f751bdac62e101a3b0be0685c219d4e61c1/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737173800","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Experience Cosmic Harmony with the Wisdom of Katakamuna in This Idle Game</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game, inspired by the enigmatic ancient Japanese civilization of &quot;Katakamuna,&quot; is an idle game designed for those who wish to embrace an age of love and harmony.
