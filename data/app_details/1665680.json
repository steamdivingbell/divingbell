Who cares about the details as long as it brings in more substantial revenue to the arena?<br />\r\nBut you have to be careful with these northern barbarians, they are not just a bunch of people with no ambition just looking for money and food. What kind of conspiracies are they hiding behind their arrival in the Freelands? Can their special abilities be used for you?
