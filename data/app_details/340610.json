{"about_the_game":"The Russian Empire campaign describes the events from 1914 to 1917. This campaign is the closest to reality and is based on the memoirs of people who took direct part in them. The player can see the authors of memoirs in the campaign's missions, such as Colonel Belolipetskii or Captain  Schepetilnikov.  Great attention was paid here to reconstruction  of the specific battles features such as night attack at Tarnavka. Sabotage and reconnaissance missions are the base of the campaign and they are replaced by wide scale battles with a variety of techniques and infantry unit.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/340610/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1509053953","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/340610/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1509053953","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/340610/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1509053953","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/340610/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1509053953","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Russian Empire campaign describes the events from 1914 to 1917.
