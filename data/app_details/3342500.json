{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The background of the game is that your tank team has just arrived at a newly built frontline position and is facing a massive attack from enemy tank formations. However, the defense strength of the frontline position is empty, and you can only step forward and use limited resources to turn the tide, thus forging your ace legend.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game uses 3D models with more realistic visual effects, and can switch between multiple 3D perspectives as well as classic 2D perspectives. We believe there is always one that suits you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game contains various obstacles, including blast walls, anti tank walls, anti tank barricades, and anti tank trenches (water), each with different characteristics. At the same time, it contains various terrains such as mud, sand, and snow, which will have different impacts on the tank's movement. In addition, camouflage nets can be used when concealment is required.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Tanks come in various models and can use different types of ammunition, such as incendiary bombs, High-Explosive Shells, armor piercing bombs, landmines, etc. Different ammunition can deal with different scenarios and create special effects on obstacles. Please explore to your heart's content.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">During the game, as the number of defeated enemies increases, when the enemy feels threatened to reinforce or our side provides supplies, we will deploy reinforcement resources, including supply ammunition, spare tanks, engine enhancement, ammunition enhancement, defense enhancement, precision strikes, EMP bomb support, emergency repairs, mine sweeping kits, grid armor, bridge support and other props. Both the enemy and us can seize resources, which will bring more fun and challenges to the game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game has dozens of built-in maps, providing an out of the box gaming experience. And it also provides a comprehensive map editing function that can fully unleash your creativity and build your own frontline positions according to your ideas. By the way, when I was using the map editor, I played with the feeling of you drawing and me guessing. In addition, if you prefer the feeling of the unknown, there will also be random maps and endless modes waiting for you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Another important point is that the joy of childhood is inseparable from friends, so the game offers both local and online multiplayer games, allowing you to experience the same joy even if you are thousands of miles apart. Of course, as we age, everyone has their own things to do and may not be able to gather together often. Therefore, in the game, we have carefully designed an intelligent teammate who can help you fight alone when you need it.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">According to the plan, the game will also support creative workshops, allowing you to share satisfactory maps with others.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If you are interested, you can follow and add it to your wishlist so that we can notify you as soon as there is any new news. Your expectations can bring me more motivation. Thank you very much.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3342500/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733927558","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3342500/page.bg.jpg?t=1733927558","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3342500/a9b770e05f968b0b62365a587c9eb1eb9c1ba7d2/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733927558","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3342500/a9b770e05f968b0b62365a587c9eb1eb9c1ba7d2/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733927558","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The background of the game is that your tank team has just arrived at a newly built frontline position and is facing a massive attack from enemy tank formations.
