{"about_the_game":"Your fleet's fate hangs in the balance of a legendary battle against an alien threat! Unfortunately, there's bad news... you <i>already lost</i>.<br><br>Take command of the <strong>Chaos Theory</strong>, a fighter carrier of the Ad-Hoc Republic, on a desperate attempt to escape a star system after its fleet has lost a pitched battle against unknown aliens. Inspired by Wing Commander and Freelancer, you'll command a wing of fighters in <strong>high-speed starship combat</strong> against alien ships as you pass through each sector of the star system. Each scenario is randomly generated with different objectives and environments for each encounter. The aliens outgun you and can outmaneuver you - but you have your skills, your wingmen, and some heavy physics-based weaponry at your disposal.<br><br>The fleet has been massacred, and you'll have to make do with whatever scraps of material and ammunition you can find as salvage. Along the way, you'll pick up new wingmen and get to know your current wingmen, <strong>each with their own dialogue and special events</strong>. Adjust and upgrade your loadout on each ship to be exactly what you want each wingman to have. Upgrade the Chaos Theory itself to stand more of a chance in pitched carrier-vs-carrier battles at the end of each sector.<br><br>Ultimately, if the threat turns out to be too much for you, you can take advantage of the massively customizable difficulty options as well - or if conversely, you're looking for a challenge, you can find all sorts of punishment there. Adjust AI intelligence, aim values, cowardice, health pools and more.","achievements":{"total":0},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2510820/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1719786256","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2510820/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1719786256","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2510820/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1719786256","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2510820/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1719786256","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2992030,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Your fleet's fate hangs in the balance of a legendary battle against an alien threat!
