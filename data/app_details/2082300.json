Inspired by games like Fable, Stronghold, Sims 4 and Civilization, Legacy puts you in the middle of the kingdom you are building. You will need to gather resources, build a great many different structures\u00a0and research new technologies if your kingdom is to prosper. You cannot control other NPCs, however you can assign them jobs and give them orders and dress them however you want. You play the leader of a tribe\u00a0and if they should die before naming an heir you can select an NPC to play.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2082300/extras/HunterPost.png?t=1735594448\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A year in game is about three hours of play time\u00a0so you have plenty of time to develop your characters. As your legacy continues, you\u00a0pass on traits through your genealogy and through training. In Legacy you live as the king or queen in your kingdom. You make the rules and your citizens do your bidding.
