Feels great to play with cute art and quick animations.\u201d<br>5/5 \u2013 Blunderbuss<br><br>\u201cI'm impressed so far. I don't keep many games on my phone, but I've been playing this one quite a bit and experimenting with different builds/strategies. I love the art style, and the gameplay and setting are both really unique. It's good to play randomly in short bursts, or you can sit down and play for a while. Also it has frequent &amp; substantial updates, and judging by the app description, it seems like the dev has a lot of plans for the future. Definitely recommended for any RPG/Roguelite fan because of the versatility in playstyles &amp; lack of reliance on IAP.\u201d<br>5/5 \u2013 Kern Espinoza<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1612380/ss_80bf5c3fa16703838e4d28e31262b6ab982af773.1920x1080.jpg?t=1726251845","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1612380/ss_80bf5c3fa16703838e4d28e31262b6ab982af773.600x338.jpg?t=1726251845"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1612380/ss_bc1568ca0aed1ce1a4a29ae73ef614a0151b8b81.1920x1080.jpg?t=1726251845","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1612380/ss_bc1568ca0aed1ce1a4a29ae73ef614a0151b8b81.600x338.jpg?t=1726251845"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1612380/ss_df3d288c6d56c7e2625552f3904715dc1ce8c4c8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1726251845","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1612380/ss_df3d288c6d56c7e2625552f3904715dc1ce8c4c8.600x338.jpg?t=1726251845"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1612380/ss_fff70ff92682a1093753f98ce26ccb320034f923.1920x1080.jpg?t=1726251845","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1612380/ss_fff70ff92682a1093753f98ce26ccb320034f923.600x338.jpg?t=1726251845"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1612380/ss_7bb59549bef0c54f640f4b1b8458c2ceaeccda10.1920x1080.jpg?t=1726251845","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1612380/ss_7bb59549bef0c54f640f4b1b8458c2ceaeccda10.600x338.jpg?t=1726251845"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1612380/ss_d90bc408a78f017d7f20f851c0b210c245415a21.1920x1080.jpg?t=1726251845","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1612380/ss_d90bc408a78f017d7f20f851c0b210c245415a21.600x338.jpg?t=1726251845"}],"short_description":"Do you have what it takes to survive the Combat Casino?","steam_appid":1612380,"support_info":{"email":"combatcasino@skylorbeck.website","url":"skylorbeck.website"},"supported_languages":"English","type":"game","website":"https://skylorbeck.website/"}
