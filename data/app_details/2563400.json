Discover how each zone changes in response to your motion. In some zones, your hand motions make colors change, in others, they make shapes change. In some zones, your head motions make brightness change, in others, they make your speed change. Each zone is a unique configuration of elements that dazzle, but how they dazzle is up to you, and there are always more zones being added.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Work your way through playlists of levels to learn more and more complex ways to manipulate visual elements with your body motion. See how many things you can keep track of as you create real-time visuals. Become a creator and configure your own zones that you and others can enjoy.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2563400/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736327811","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2563400/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1736327811","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2563400/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736327811","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2563400/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736327811","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dance like you are the music, like the world is your dancefloor and you are the world.
