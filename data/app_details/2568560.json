{"about_the_game":"Anvil of Tristheim is a card-based crafting game where you merge material cards into components and then items. As the local blacksmith, heroes and those that would be soon line up at your shop. They'll tell you which dungeon they intend to crawl and it is up to you to equip them for it. Equip them too well and you will be operating at a loss - but equipping them not well enough will turn them and all the treasure they might have brought back to dragon food. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnvil of Tristheim is developed by a solo dev and currently in an alpha-like stage with a release scheduled for 2024 (hopefully Q1 or Q2).
