{"about_the_game":"The Broken Dungeon calls to you, adventurer!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBroken Dungeon is a VR roguelike game featuring procedurally generated dungeon layouts, randomized loot with stacking effects, melee and magic combat, and near unlimited replayability.

While the adventurer dawns the VR headset, the Dungeon Master uses the mouse and keyboard.  As the Dungeon Master, you understand the layout of the dungeon, spend mana to spawn monsters of your choice, cast dungeon wide abilities to buff your monsters or debuff the adventurer, and send out ethereal skulls to try and attack your dungeon's invader when they least expect it.
