{"about_the_game":"The harmless puzzle blocks of yesteryear have evolved and formed an alliance. They're armed and they're invading. It's up to you to protect the homeland from defeat. <br><br>To succeed, you must quickly build your power-up meter (by shooting three matching blocks in a row) so your ship can unleash giant connected chains. While powered-up, defeat the marching invaders by repeatedly triggering chains (that match your ship\u2019s color).<br><br>At its core, Puzzle Bloc Invasion is a flow state game. I love games that are all about flow. From the announcer constantly cheering you on, to the steady barrage of chains igniting, Puzzle Bloc Invasion is a fast-paced, score chaser that is meant to make you feel powerful.<br><br>Completely overhauled (2024)!  A while back I re-tested this game on the Steam Deck and was inspired to completely revamp it. It now plays much faster and is better in every way. Extra mode. Better graphics. Better music. Better flow. Better everything. It\u2019s a perfect match for the Steam Deck and other portable PCs.<br><br>A demo is now available. It's a level limited play-through on normal mode.
