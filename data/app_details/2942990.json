{"about_the_game":"The Oga Line is a 26.4 km long line connecting Oiwake Station in Akita City, Akita Prefecture, to Oga Station in Oga City, Akita Prefecture.All trains operate directly to the Ou Line, and this DLC includes a 39.4 km long section, including a portion between Akita Station and Oiwake Station on the Ou Line.<br>The Oga Line began service in 1913 as the Funakawa Light Rail Line connecting Oiwake and Futada Stations, and later in 1916 the entire line was opened to Funakawa Station, which is now Oga Station. Currently, only regular trains operate on the line, but in the past, the night express train &quot;Oga&quot; departing from Ueno Station used to run to Oga Station as a temporary train.<br>The maximum speed changes depending on the section of track (Ou  Line section: 95 km/h, Oga Line section: 85 km/h), and all trains are operated as one-man trains. (*In this DLC, implemented in two-man specification)<br>The EV-E801 series AC battery-powered trains began operating on the Oga Line in 2017, and now all trains on the line are operated by the EV-E801 series. The EV-E801 Series runs in two modes: between Akita Station and Oiwake Station, the electrified section, it runs on electricity from overhead wires, while between Oiwake Station and Oga Station, the non-electrified section, it runs on electricity stored in storage batteries with the pantographs down. The first track at Oga Station is equipped with recharging facilities so that passengers can recharge their batteries during the time the train stops before turning around.<br>On the way to Oiwake Station, the Ou Line section runs through a bedroom town of Akita City. After leaving Oiwake Station, the train enters the Oga Line section, where fields along the line become conspicuous, and from the Wakimoto Station area, the train winds through mountainous areas. Please enjoy driving the EV-E801 series AC battery-powered train with the sightseeing spot &quot;Mt.
