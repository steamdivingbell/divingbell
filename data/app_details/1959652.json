{"about_the_game":"CONTAINER PRODUCTS \u2013 20/40FT DRY VAN CONTAINERS<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome months ago, when I was walking around a large shipping terminal in Waigaoqiao, Shanghai, I saw many colourful containers stacked together - which came from all over the world - looking like towering blocks of beautiful skyscrapers. From that time, I planned to make and place these cool iron boxes into my favorite simulator, making our experiences more awesome and more realistic. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, you will get a total of 10 styles of 20ft and 40ft dry van containers in your railroad world. You are able to carry them by X2K double-stack container well wagons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures Include: <br />\r\n- 10 styles.<br />\r\n- Normal Maps.<br />\r\n- Weathered. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nX2K DOUBLE-STACK CONTAINER WELL WAGONS<br />\r\nIf you intend to travel between Shanghai and Beijing by train, maybe you'll pass a train with double-stacked containers - chances are it will be these, as the X2 series well wagons are the only double-stack container wagons in China. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe X2 series double-stack container well wagon is specially designed to carry container traffic. Once a X2 wagon equips ZK6 bogies, it\u2019s called \u201cX2K\u201d, and its max speed is up to 120 km/h.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThree colors of X2K wagons are included, which should be mixed in a long train for a more realistic effect!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures Include:<br />\r\n- Normal Maps.<br />\r\n- Weathered.<br />\r\n- Rear Sign Light.<br />\r\n- Load Product.<br />\r\n- LOD System.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1959652?t=1653981948","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1959652?t=1653981948","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1959652/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1653981948","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1959652/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1653981948","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"CONTAINER PRODUCTS \u2013 20/40FT DRY VAN CONTAINERS<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome months ago, when I was walking around a large shipping terminal in Waigaoqiao, Shanghai, I saw many colourful containers stacked together - which came from all over the world - looking like towering blocks of beautiful skyscrapers.
