However, when her brother's pregnant wife, Prisilla, gets sick with some sort of unknown illness, Aline must journey outside her comfort zone and face the perils of both the human world and the world of the caverns...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCurrently, only the demo is available in an incomplete state, but this Turn-Based RPG will eventually include complex and uniquely written storylines, the traditional tongue and cheek comedy, three other additional Party Members, and a whole new, expansive world to explore! While we can't say how long the finished game will be, we hope for a length similar to that of the first game, that being ten hours of gameplay. On top of that, you will return to the world of Selendine, full of many more secrets to discover, which will hopefully high resolution graphics just like before!
