{"about_the_game":"The doors to ULTRAWORLD are open and beckon you to return. Come see what's new in <strong>ULTRAWORLD EXODUS</strong>, a free addition to the wildly abstract first-person exploration adventure you've heard so little about.

Change the colors, filters, particles, and rendering modes for infinite visual variety (and I do mean infinite). Then soar above the landscape, camera in hand, looking for the perfect picture.
