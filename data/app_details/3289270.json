{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3289270/extras/gif2.gif?t=1732220327\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">3 short stories set in a mystical fantasy universe. You are a newborn Face of God and must decide which face you are by hearing 3 drama-packed tales of human suffering and triumph. Choose a different ending for each story. A short, linear experience that is introspective and emotionally powerful.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DRAMA-PACKED SHORT STORIES</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The stories have deep emotional, psychological and philosophical significance. They're inspired by great authors of literature like Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky. But written simply, with snappy text that is easy to  get lost in.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A UNIQUE MYSTICAL FANTASY WORLD</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Worldbuilding, lore and immersion are big components here. The universe is inspired by mysticism, history and religion. There are elements of Western and Eastern culture blended together. God has many faces.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CHOOSE PEOPLE'S FATES</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Pick one of three endings for each story. You can preview all paths before making your final choice, so there is no need to replay the whole game in order to see everything. You don't play <i>as</i> the protagonists of each story, but as a newborn Face of God that is learning about this world through these tales.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DECIDE WHICH FACE OF GOD YOU ARE</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">After listening to all three stories and choosing a fate for each protagonist, you get to pick which Face of God you are. Are you the Desperate Face? The Suffering Face? The Hopeful Face? This is your final decision based on your own experience.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SEE ALL CONTENT IN A SINGLE PLAYTHROUGH</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">I respect your time. You will <strong>not</strong> have to replay the game multiple times in order to see everything. You can experience virtually the entire game in one single playthrough, which might last about 1 hour and 30 minutes. This game is short and (hopefully) profound.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">I hope you enjoy.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3289270/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732220327","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3289270/page.bg.jpg?t=1732220327","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3289270/2ff9b845acc5ea54cd2d83d82ec48250ae02bba9/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732220327","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3289270/2ff9b845acc5ea54cd2d83d82ec48250ae02bba9/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732220327","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"The game contains some descriptions of violence."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3289270/extras/gif2.gif?t=1732220327\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">3 short stories set in a mystical fantasy universe.
