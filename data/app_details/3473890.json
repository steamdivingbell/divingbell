{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">It's a pseudo-retro 2D side-scrolling shooter with a variety of gameplay in 8 stages, with visuals (TMS9918A spec V9938 palette) and sound (PSG+SCC) enhanced to mimic the MSX standard popular in Japan in the 1980s. Formerly released for smartphones in 2014 and then passed through Steam Greenlight, the release was delayed for about 10 years due to the production company's busy schedule (Final Re:Quest The Movie). The overall volume of the game has been increased to compensate for this. The controls are very simple and familiar. The player controls a cute little girl with dots, and defeats various enemies with a series of automatic shots. The game is inspired by good old Japanese culture, Gunma's nature and customs, in the 80's style, and the ending may change some by discovering various hidden items in the stage. We aimed to create a simple and kitschy shooting game before the bullet-hell shooters. We hope you will enjoy this game if you are tired of complicated modern games.</p>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3473890?t=1740559563","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3473890/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1740559563","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3473890/55124226be5bf86a6b488bd83941670b5edfcc32/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1740559563","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3473890/55124226be5bf86a6b488bd83941670b5edfcc32/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1740559563","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">It's a pseudo-retro 2D side-scrolling shooter with a variety of gameplay in 8 stages, with visuals (TMS9918A spec V9938 palette) and sound (PSG+SCC) enhanced to mimic the MSX standard popular in Japan in the 1980s.
