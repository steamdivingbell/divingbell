{"about_the_game":"In Jerry Frog's Retro Adventure asteroids from space have hit the city.  Jerry Frog must help rescue the citizens, so they can relocate to a safer area.  During his efforts, he <br>will encounter fires, collapsing buildings, dangerous weather conditions, and unexpected enemies.  Jerry will need to use a water gun to extinguish fires while attempting to rescue citizens from their burning houses.  He will have to leap from building roof to roof seeking anyone in need of help as he tries to avoid falling to his death within the flames below.  Jerry has to balance himself on the fragile buildings that could collapse any second while avoiding other obstacles.  By using physics and proper timing, Jerry can rescue and relocate everyone in need of help.  <strong>&quot;HELP!&quot;</strong> and the distressed citizen disappears once they're rescued and relocated.       <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/762100/extras/JerryFrogPortraitVersion3.png?t=1703719019\" /><br> <br>In <strong>High Score</strong> Mode you can unlock up to 4 characters that are also playable in <strong>Story Mode</strong>:  the Jack-O-Lantern, UV Frog, Golden Frog and, or UFO Frog.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/762100/extras/TMCGPic.gif?t=1703719019\" /><br><br><br>Controls:<br><br>-Space to jump and shoot<br><br>-W, S, A and D to walk","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Level 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/762100/caa41b670f044eef1d40cc4bbf86757062cdfe62.jpg"},{"name":"Level 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/762100/42f32b43122725ec5d467cf4aa6e406cde366372.jpg"},{"name":"Level 3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/762100/a8b228fb3a9ea9538ab62a68c4dfe51392593c67.jpg"},{"name":"Level 4","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/762100/bbccbe081f516c5fd90724557cca3b1fb6ea07e8.jpg"},{"name":"UFO","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/762100/73e162e74799af2f2781ac11ee085590deedc852.jpg"},{"name":"Jack O Lantern","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/762100/627b36ce82b756912ab7b008a54eea25ef89a729.jpg"},{"name":"UV Frog","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/762100/faeb5f255276afc62c70f65f8c2b120a89c9e209.jpg"},{"name":"Golden Frog","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/762100/1fc135124e99afbbfd508483394fda4868870159.jpg"},{"name":"High Score 2000 Points","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/762100/1ba515ad49134de2c071e8cdc093bc48a86ec379.jpg"},{"name":"High Score 3000 Points","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/762100/97beb2b12fb8631889098a15b80fc1ef4bfe617e.jpg"}],"total":19},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/762100/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1703719019","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/762100/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1703719019","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/762100/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1703719019","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/762100/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1703719019","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In Jerry Frog's Retro Adventure asteroids from space have hit the city.
