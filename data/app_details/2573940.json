{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">OVERVIEW</h2>Squid Squabble is a top-down multiplayer arena shooter where players gather single-use items to eliminate each other. Each team has an inkwell that slowly drains, which they can refill by defeating other players and depositing their ink. Make sure that your inkwell doesn't run dry, or you won't be able to respawn anymore. With only one HP and limited items, players must scramble to vanquish their enemies and become the last squid standing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FEATURES</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Online and Local Multiplayer:</strong> Play with up to 8 people over the internet or right on your couch.
