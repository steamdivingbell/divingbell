{"about_the_game":"SCALE is an award winning, highly competitive, and <strong>FREE </strong> fantasy card game that takes all of the best mechanics of popular TCG's and puts them into one action-packed game that gives you ALL of the cards for free.  Never buy a booster pack to get the good cards! <br><br>SCALE features unique mechanics such as &quot;The Loop&quot; which works in a fun way that allows each player to react to every card being played, even if it's not their turn.  This mechanic makes for fast-paced and intense gameplay that leaves tons of room for strategy and different play styles. <br><br>Another distinct aspect of our standard game is that it is played with a SINGLE SHARED DECK.  <br><br>Such a concept is unique to card games like these, as most will require you to buy/build your own deck to play, and can result in very mismatched power levels among players due to card differences.  Our shared deck mode allows for players to have a more fairly balanced and competitive card game because all of the pieces are available to every player, more like chess. <br><br>Currently the game is 1v1, but we plan to implement 3 and 4-player capabilities, deck constructing modes, draft modes, tournaments, and some of the other fun game modes we currently offer with our physical card game, which is available for purchase on our website.<br><br>For more information, click the link to the right!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3072860/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731642318","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3072860/page.bg.jpg?t=1731642318","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3072860/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731642318","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3072860/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731642318","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Stats","id":15}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"SCALE is an award winning, highly competitive, and <strong>FREE </strong> fantasy card game that takes all of the best mechanics of popular TCG's and puts them into one action-packed game that gives you ALL of the cards for free.
