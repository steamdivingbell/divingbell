Discover who you are and awaken your true power.<br><br>You start out living a peaceful life in a simple village, in a beautiful place in harmony with nature. But something feels wrong. You are only a shadow of yourself in this place. You feel that there is something out there in the world that will make you find your true self and fulfill your purpose. Soon, you discover that you are the bearer of a curse, capable of killing you and the people around you. They say it's a punishment from the gods for sinners. But you are not a sinner. Is it really a curse? As you set out on a quest to find a cure, you discover a darkness that grows in the land and corrupts everything it touches.

All this leads you on an epic adventure full of challenges and mysteries, fighting for survival and in search of power and answers about yourself and the world.
