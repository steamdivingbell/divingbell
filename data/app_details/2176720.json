{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2176720/extras/gif1.gif?t=1707157406\" /><br><br>M.E.A.T. II Absolute Zero is a first-person shooter representing the so-called \u201cboomer shooter\u201d genre. The FPS, keeping with the spirit of the series, maintains a pixel art graphical style referring to retro games. At the same time the game is enriched with additional solutions, thanks to which you can also feel a breath of gaming freshness. The whole game is permeated with an awe-inspiring, even brutal atmosphere - dark locations, enemies taken straight out of nightmarish visions, and finally - heavy music. All this completes the final effect, which will certainly not leave you indifferent. The same goes for the plot - following the first part of the M.E.A.T. series.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2176720/extras/1.png?t=1707157406\" /><br>The game presents the further fate of Sir Duncan H. Culligan, who, despite the tragedies he encountered on his way, does not give up. The death of his wife, the epidemic that gradually turned into a terrifying festival of grotesque citizen-murdering creatures, the closure of mining shafts and the further loss of loved ones. It would seem to be too much for one man. Nothing could be further from the truth. After all, the Cannon of Light has not yet dealt with all the evil consuming this 19th century Canadian town. This time, the dark sect MBSXII poses as the main antagonist, using the Rock Resin to prepare an even greater disaster. What\u2019s important however - a disaster threatening further than the known world reaches... Culligan, however, does not give in to any adversity and takes matters - or rather, guns - into his own hands. The wrath of Washagami chief protector will have to undergo another test, and the telestarion-powered weaponry will become his messenger. For the time  of revenge has come. Revenge that takes no prisoners. A revenge painted with blood.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2176720/extras/ilustracja__3_600x338__1_.gif?t=1707157406\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2176720/extras/2.png?t=1707157406\" /><br>Familiar opponents, but also meny new faces.
