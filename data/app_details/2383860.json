{"about_the_game":"(This is the original free student project. The fully complete Octodad: Dadliest Catch can also be purchased on Steam.)<br><br>Octodad is a third person adventure game about destruction, deception, and fatherhood. The player controls Octodad, a dapper octopus masquerading as a human, as he goes about a day of his life. His existence is a constant struggle, as he must master mundane tasks with his unwieldy boneless tentacles while simultaneously keeping his cephalopodan nature a secret from his human family. <br><br>The player controls Octodad like a marionette, dragging his arms and legs around while his body flops along. The player\u2019s goals are often simple household chores made difficult and interesting by the flailing, tenuous control they have over Octodad\u2019s body. <br><br>Being an octopus also has its strengths. Octodad can slip through tight spaces, grab objects with his suckers, and knock things around with tremendous strength. But if the player does things too out-of-the-ordinary, Octodad\u2019s family will grow suspicious and realize what he really is. If they do, it\u2019s game over for Octodad!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FEATURES:</h2> <ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>6 levels full of comedic failure!<br></li><li>3 family members to deceive!<br></li><li>Roughly 35-45 minutes of gameplay!<br></li><li>One very non-canonical ending!</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WHY DID WE MAKE THIS?</h2><br>Octodad: Student Edition is part of Young Horses: Free Range, where we collect our smaller side projects and release them for free!<br><br>This is the game that started it all! Octodad was made before the founding of Young Horses by a group of students at DePaul University. Our goal was to enter the Independent Games Festival in 2010 (we did enter, but we didn't win).
