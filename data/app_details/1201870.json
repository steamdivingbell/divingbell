{"about_the_game":"Drinks with Abbey is a short, slice-of-life visual novel about a first date, from a male's perspective.

I wanted to make a similar, larger game, with more resources put into it, but I wasn't sure what people would think of the style, because it's different than most existing visual novels.  I thought it was important to get feedback on a scaled-down version first, to give the general sense of the larger game, but not do everything I'd like to with it (that's why it's free to play).  If you are willing to give feedback, please be specific so I know what to do more/less of in the next game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Interface</h2><br><br>There are no menus, except when you click the X to quit. You can click the textbox/choices to advance or use the arrow keys + spacebar. You can also press F to enter fullscreen mode. The 5 icons shown in the bottom left of the screen are the game's only options:<br><br>1. Toggle between speaker and headphones modes. Speaker mode is intended to sound like it's being played in the bar and includes crowd noise, while headphones mode plays the music as it was recorded.<br><br>2. Toggle music on and off.<br><br>3. Toggle lightning mode, which just removes the typing effect.<br><br>4. Toggle auto-play mode.  This mode only requires your input for choices.<br><br>5. Toggle skip mode.
