{"about_the_game":"The DCS: Sinai map is focused on the Sinai Peninsula, located between the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba with eastern Egypt to the west and southern Israel to the east. Since ancient times, it has been a strategic location rich in resources, nature, religion, and history. The map includes a variety of landscapes from deserts and mountains in the south to oasis and coastlines in the north. A significant point of interest is the Suez Canal - an artificial waterway connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea that provides a shorter route between Europe and Asia. It marks a conditional border between Africa and Asia, which makes it politically significant for regional security and stability. <br><br>In modern times, it is associated with the Arab-Israeli wars, during which it repeatedly became the subject of disputes. This includes the Suez Crisis of 1956, the Six Day War of 1967, and the Yom Kippur War of 1973. As a result of these wars, the Sinai changed hands between Egypt and Israel until it was returned to Egypt in 1982.<br><br>The map territory includes the entire Sinai Peninsula, eastern Egypt, the Nile Delta, southern Israel, western Jordan and Saudi Arabia, Palestine - the Gaza Strip, and the West Bank. The total size of the map is 1500 x 1000 km, and the detailed section is 700x700 km.<br><br>The map contains many military bases and strategic seaports, emplacements for air defense systems, and helipads. This will allow you to create interesting missions in both the air and on the ground.
