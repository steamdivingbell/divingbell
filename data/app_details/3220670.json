As a detective game set in the 1920s, it revolves around murder investigations and discussions of various criminal activities. The game includes cartoonish depictions of dead bodies and blood, which are shown in the intro and outro scenes. These scenes can be skipped for those who prefer not to view them. Given the historical setting, the game also features period-appropriate depictions of alcohol and tobacco use.\r\nThroughout the gameplay, players will encounter mature themes including murder, deception, and other criminal activities. While the art style is retro and cartoonish, the subject matter is intended for mature players. It's important to note that there are no explicit depictions of sexual content, sexual assault, drug abuse, or self-harm in the game."},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Step into the glittering world of 1920s high society, where secrets lurk behind every champagne flute and murder is the latest fashion.
