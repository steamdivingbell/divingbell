{"about_the_game":"Isadora's Edge is a classic 2D Action Platformer, with a focus on deep and satisfying combat and movement. You'll explore distinct environments in a compelling future fantasy setting - in the midst of an apocalyptic disaster. You'll battle corrupted creatures and take on powerful bosses that are tainted by the forces that seek to consume Isadora's world, and discover the sinister secrets permeating its very core.<br><br>(Important Note: The art found on this page and in screenshots is not final! While most character sprites and animations will remain the same, the environment art is mostly placeholder and all of these details are subject to change before release!)<br><br><strong>Gorgeous Pixel-Perfect Animations</strong><br><br>Every character sprite and animation in the game is hand-drawn by a master of the craft, and our custom made rendering system allows for a seamless blend of crisp pixel-perfect rendering with smooth modern effects. This means you'll get to witness all the beautiful, individually placed pixels for every animation in the game, combined with fluid camera motion and state of the art visual effects!<br><br><strong>Satisfying and Dynamic Movement</strong><br><br>Our character control system was built before any other feature, with a focus on making moment to moment motion in the game feel incredibly satisfying. As a result, everything is built on top of this movement, supporting and enhancing it, which creates an incredible feeling of flow as you navigate through the game.<br><br><strong>Challenge Yourself against Brutal Bosses</strong><br><br>The boss fights in Isadora's Edge are built to be demanding and incredibly challenging. Powerful rapid attacks, with patterns you'll have to etch into your brain to be able to successfully dodge them. You'll have to truly master the combat, weaving well-aimed attacks into the small openings with tight execution to take these bosses down. If you love a difficult boss fight, this is the game for you.<br><br><strong>Hand-Crafted Levels with Retro Charm</strong><br><br>Isadora's Edge features level-based gameplay - where each experience is hand crafted. This structured, linear approach allows us to really focus on exactly what we want the player to go through, creating a structured set of challenges that keep you exactly in the zone. No backtracking, no &quot;come back later with different boots&quot;, no banging your head against the wall because you don't know what key you missed, just a smooth, exciting gameplay experience from beginning to end!<br><br><strong>Unravel a World Rich with Secrets</strong><br><br>The world of Isadora's Edge is full of lore, just waiting to be uncovered. Little bits of information can be found on badges, in the beastiary, from talking with your companions. We won't hold your hand and force feed you the story of the game - if you want to figure out the deep secrets lying under the surface, you'll have to dig them out and piece it together on your own! And speaking of secrets, there will be plenty of hidden bosses, secret upgrades, and all manner of interesting content to discover by playing through with an attention to detail!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3125320/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724382175","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3125320/page.bg.jpg?t=1724382175","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3125320/aa55bd6028544fff7a58fd4f6be7bbcec0d02a27/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724382175","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3125320/aa55bd6028544fff7a58fd4f6be7bbcec0d02a27/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724382175","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Isadora's Edge is a classic 2D Action Platformer, with a focus on deep and satisfying combat and movement.
