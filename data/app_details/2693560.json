In his teenage years, while working in factories and searching for himself, he found nothing but deep depression, financial issues, and relationship problems in his family. Leaving his country to pursue a better life in the United Kingdom, he learned English and worked as a dishwasher in restaurants, sinking further into the oblivion of what he remembered as the joyful life from his childhood. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Seeking an escape, he turned to depressive video games, which made him even sadder, yet they offered a kind of relief. He realized that video games could change people's lives in a positive way. This revelation persuaded him to study game design without any prior education, starting from scratch at a college in Bristol, with hopes that his life would improve along the way. During his studies, he found inspiration in emerging technologies and spiritual life. This game represents a piece of his journey, serving as a reflection of his emotions and experiences during the most difficult time in his life.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2693560/extras/Untitled-1.jpg?t=1738503844\" />photos by Milan Nechv\u00e1tal</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2693560/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738503844","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2693560/page.bg.jpg?t=1738503844","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2693560/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738503844","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2693560/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738503844","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Captions available","id":13}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2693560/extras/u7.jpg?t=1738503844\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Overview:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Hl\u00edna, a game set in a unique town entirely made of clay, you play as Ollie, who is trying to take care of his mum after she lost her job.
