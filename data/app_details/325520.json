{"about_the_game":"FIRE is a puzzleventure with intuitive puzzle design. Without losing many words it tells a savagely hilarious story. Journey into the Stone Age and face the most challenging task of this era: The search for fire!<br><br>This story's hero is the lovably chaotic Neanderthal Ungh who dozes off during his very first night watch. The next morning, the catastrophe ensues: the fire's gone out and Ungh is banished from his village. Now you have to help Ungh finding a new flame, searching every corner of the Stone Age world. No matter if he has to search the insides of a dinosaur, smoldering volcanoes or even through time itself, there is no place Ungh wouldn't look for new fire.<br><br>One click or swipe and your environment comes to life. A small dash of logic and you'll be able to solve any puzzle and there will be no limit to your exploratory spirit while interacting with the game's world: fire coconuts from a mammoth's trunk, turn into an animal or save the fair maiden from the Octo-Boss' grasp.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/325520/extras/FIRE_steam_feature.png?t=1591885179\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li>No text or dialogue at all <br></li><li>Coherent and intuitive controls<br></li><li>Explore a lovable, vividly animated Stone Age world<br></li><li>10 beautifully hand-drawn sceneries<br></li><li>Atmospheric soundtrack by the composer of &quot;The Night of the Rabbit&quot; included with every purchase</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/325520/extras/FIRE_steam_previews.png?t=1591885179\" /><br><br><strong></strong><br>\u201eIt\u2019s [...] an intriguing evolution of the genre\u201d<br><u></u><br><br><strong>4players.de</strong><br>\u201eAfter the presentation I would have loved to start right away.\u201c<br><u></u>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Onk Boga I","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/325520/0ca13bad996e81bcfc00d5e44707a8b0322d7b55.jpg"},{"name":"Onk Boga II","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/325520/51e1389dbe16c7dc8efbf67bd7075157f4ff2aa8.jpg"},{"name":"Onk Boga III","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/325520/bb6cb5020d11e2df5628e307b5ae4b7024aa3e8f.jpg"},{"name":"Onk Boga IV","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/325520/561763f0c87db07eb05312abb5e850b9cd525862.jpg"},{"name":"Onk Boga V","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/325520/32543b88a58f13a54a5848c06bd9936df3b2e976.jpg"},{"name":"Onk Boga VI","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/325520/24326351614d4278f6fa4775a5a39e7001d4d471.jpg"},{"name":"Onk Boga VII","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/325520/5a35da723f1cf380bb74d4dac9fe89404178fa1f.jpg"},{"name":"Onk Boga VIII","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/325520/499722e530f7db654e7272ec2705bda052434c56.jpg"},{"name":"Onk Boga IX","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/325520/4653b926b7b4465317b2dbb18e64f1d4dc2cfba4.jpg"},{"name":"AKRE!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/325520/f86d607090f7618cf1402556a293d80541665532.jpg"}],"total":27},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/325520/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1591885179","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/325520/page.bg.jpg?t=1591885179","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/325520/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1591885179","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/325520/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1591885179","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"FIRE is a puzzleventure with intuitive puzzle design.
