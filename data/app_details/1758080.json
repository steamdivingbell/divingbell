{"about_the_game":"Conquer the galaxy - or befriend it! Empires of the Void II is a beloved board game with deep strategy and a compelling story that you write yourself. This is a digital recreation of that board game, allowing you to play with friends (or strangers) in the same room, or across the world.  Choose a race and befriend the native species, or crush them under your merciless heel. The power card deck contains dozens of missions that connect to the deep story underpinning the galactic fringe. Save innocent lives from a gigantic rampaging beast, kidnap the leader of your enemies, or gamble with space pirates. Every playthrough feels unique and interesting. Minimalistic graphics and atmospheric music set the tone without getting in the way. Create your own adventure at the fringe of the galaxy!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Step into the Void","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1758080/d29024eb1b4fe1df458a3fe65e6efd69bf6b111c.jpg"},{"name":"Master of the Void","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1758080/ad68969fcc547de584adbf5b7a4c88c2f863574a.jpg"},{"name":"Step Into a Connected Galaxy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1758080/9446fd7fc46ffde27395dd0aa6571fe7af543423.jpg"},{"name":"Own a Connected Galaxy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1758080/735021a3c22f65642e9c83b99d599c44e139f0d5.jpg"},{"name":"The Indomitable Human Spirit","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1758080/dce926a850d19648a7b6fc1072f512dd10589ad0.jpg"},{"name":"The Power of Science","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1758080/25eb2266102570f87313526d799b2d28332b6acf.jpg"},{"name":"We Are Everywhere","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1758080/228e4a183f2f3bcb0b640fe60d819bff243e6072.jpg"},{"name":"As Was Foreseen","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1758080/9751a2a36e6d729ed80efca5239038850814c0e5.jpg"},{"name":"All Hail the Might of the Legion","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1758080/cb24f86403f2dff634945aa50cee10497675f63d.jpg"},{"name":"Singularity Averted","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1758080/3f8cbd3add5c23486a442be5debe6cc4e484dae1.jpg"}],"total":40},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1758080/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726853564","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1758080/page.bg.jpg?t=1726853564","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1758080/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726853564","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1758080/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726853564","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>End of Multiplayer Support</h1><p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Sadly, we are announcing the end of multiplayer support for Empires of the Void.
