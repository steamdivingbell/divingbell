{"about_the_game":"This is the fourth and last puzzle box in the puzzle collection based on our favorite classical painter Thomas Cole* and his wonderful series <strong>The Voyage of Life</strong>. The final painting, <strong>Old Age</strong>, is an image of death. The man has grown old; he has survived the trials of life. The waters have calmed; the river flows into the waters of eternity. The figurehead and hourglass are missing from the battered boat; the withered old voyager has reached the end of earthly time. In the distance, angels are descending from heaven, while the guardian angel hovers close, gesturing toward the others. The man is once again joyous with the knowledge that faith has sustained him through life. The landscape is practically gone, just a few rough rocks represent the edge of the earthly world, and dark water stretches onward.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Content Details</h2>Contains <i>one</i> new puzzle box for Masters of Puzzle. The UHD image captures the original painting in great detail which in turn allows for very detailed and diverse puzzle tiles. The huge sky and river in the image will make this puzzle an extremely challenging experience for most puzzle builders. There are some detailed areas to help you with structuring your image, but these are going to be difficult to assemble. Be warned that this puzzle will require a lot of time and patience to complete.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/900103/extras/public_domain_icon_sm.png?t=1572988055\" /> * <i>Note: The painting used in this DLC is in the public domain in its country of origin and other countries and areas where the copyright term is the author's life plus 100 years or less.</i>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/900103/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1572988055","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/900103/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1572988055","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/900103/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1572988055","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/900103/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1572988055","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This is the fourth and last puzzle box in the puzzle collection based on our favorite classical painter Thomas Cole* and his wonderful series <strong>The Voyage of Life</strong>.
