{"about_the_game":"Preface:<br><br>&quot;Main Deity Space&quot; is my first attempt at making a game in my life.

I am extremely grateful to UE5 engine for this.<br><br>During the development process, I conducted testing by releasing a game full of bugs on the Steam platform. I received a lot of help from player friends who patiently tested the game and provided suggestions. I am truly, truly thankful for their support.<br><br>The version currently online is still very basic, with professions, skills, equipment, materials, enemies, and maps continuously being added. The game itself definitely has many issues, and I hope everyone can understand and provide feedback so that I can make continuous improvements and adjustments.<br><br>After the official version is released, the testing version will not be canceled and will continue to be updated. However, the official version will be given priority for updates, with the testing version being updated once a month. <br><br>Apart from the difference in update timing, the leaderboards between the two versions will not be connected, and the testing version will not participate in future reward activities.
