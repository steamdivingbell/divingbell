{"about_the_game":"Lake Nelson is a picturesque fishing venue located in the heart of Texas and is unique for the size of the venue against the size of the fish that can be caught. In fact, at around 10 acres in size, there is no need to use a boat and fishing is from the shoreline only. You can fish for 15 different species in Lake Nelson, including some that are rare to the state of Texas and all go to specimen size. Expect to find monster bass weighing 15lbs and longnose gar topping 47lbs! Species such as crappie, bluegill and walleye are also found and there are some carp up to 25lbs that will also provide great sport.<br />\r\nWith three tournaments to fish on Lake Nelson, three new career events and 25 new Boss Fish to hunt down and catch, you can really see why it is such a popular venue!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1442140/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1615827953","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1442140/page.bg.jpg?t=1615827953","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1442140/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1615827953","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1442140/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1615827953","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Lake Nelson is a picturesque fishing venue located in the heart of Texas and is unique for the size of the venue against the size of the fish that can be caught.
