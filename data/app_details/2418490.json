{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2418490/extras/Trakonius_text.png?t=1733506741\" /><br>Trakonius is an Action-Roguelike wargame set in the gladiatorial arenas of Ancient Rome. You can make offerings to the gods and gain permanent powers, spend the gold you earn as you fight in the blacksmith, and fight with different weapons you choose at the start. Each weapon has its own combat style, and with power-ups, you can fight with different strategies. Leaving the arenas victorious will earn you your freedom.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Battle Style</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2418490/extras/1st_arena.gif?t=1733506741\" /><br><br>Trakonius must always be careful in battle. Since he often fights with more than one person, he may be subjected to several attacks at the same time. He must use the skills he has acquired and the skills he already possesses to defeat his opponents. Of course, at the right time, Dodge and Parry can significantly turn the tide of battle. Just like in a real battle, split-second decisions are very important. Because enemies will look for your vulnerability and want to attack at your weakest moment.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Character Progress</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2418490/extras/Blacksmith.gif?t=1733506741\" /><br><br>Trakonius can improve himself in different ways during his journey in the arena. When he offers his blood as an offering to the gods, he gains permanent powers from them, such as basic attack power, cooldown reduction, attack speed, when he gives the coins he earns from fighting to the blacksmith, his attack or armor improves, and by fighting in the arena, he gains experience and godly powers along with the gladiator spirits.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2418490/extras/Close.gif?t=1733506741\" /><br><br>Trakonius, a respected and beloved Roman commander, succumbed to the false intrigues of the senate and was sent to the arena to die.
