{"about_the_game":"Game<br />\r\nMetacell: Genesis ARCADE is an arcade game with the match 3 mechanic. Inspired by those old-school arcade games I grew up with and I wanted to emulate that experience within our own game. The basic gist of Arcade mode is a score attack mechanic where you want to survive to level 100 with the highest score by fighting back a never ending spawn of game pieces by making matches of 3 or more before the board fills up or even worse you are killed by one of the traps that could spawn at any moment. There are some things to make it not so hopeless; like some cool pickups, bombs and even extra lives.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStory<br />\r\nSummary Metacell: Genesis ARCADE is a sci-fi thriller that takes place in a distant future in which mankind has organized under a single galactic empire called the Imperium.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHaving already mapped and expanded deep within their universe, the Imperium has turned their attention to what lies beyond, and they found it.

Blinded by their eagerness for knowledge, they created an abomination known only as the Metacell.
