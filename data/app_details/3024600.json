{"about_the_game":"You play as Thraebyn Tarbeard, a young dwarf from the exiled tribes, who is abducted by the vile Oluzhias and forced to do the necromancer's bidding.

Will you help Oluzhias become king? Or will a worthier champion, a mighty Seer perhaps, be the one to finally unite all of the Exiles of Yvermist?","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3024600?t=1718026989","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3024600/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1718026989","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3024600/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718026989","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3024600/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718026989","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"This game contains violence, blood, and nudity."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"You play as Thraebyn Tarbeard, a young dwarf from the exiled tribes, who is abducted by the vile Oluzhias and forced to do the necromancer's bidding.
