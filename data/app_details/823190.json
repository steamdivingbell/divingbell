{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Meanders Map Pack: Venmire Woods</strong></h2><br>This pack contains 22 Meanders maps in a ready-to-load Fantasy Grounds Module. Meanders maps are somewhat special by having a built-in repeating entrance/exit point so that no matter whether you put another map on the left, right, above or below, of itself or a different Meander map - the pathways will line up allowing continuous sprawling landscapes and terrains for your adventurers to explore.<br><br>The maps are sized especially for Fantasy Grounds at 1350x900 and under 500 kb each to help prevent slow-down during play and designed to perfectly fit a 50px or 60px grid that you can manually place over the top of the map using Fantasy Grounds options. Users can opt to load/lay the maps manually and build a custom layout - or use a combination of Time-lapse, Role-play and/or the supplied Random Roll Table to determine when maps are used and where adventurers end up next. Maps are coded for easy reference and descriptions appear beside them to help navigate to the terrain you need. This set also contains a Map Selection Panel: a convenient visual display of all the maps pinned with a link (shown as a red pin) that you can simply click to bring up.<br><br>Meanders maps are highly-detailed and feature varied Forest-Themed maps for a huge range of encounters. It includes the interior of a Tavern for starting out; an exterior shot of the Tavern (ME1 Forest 12 S), a large selection of Roads/Forestry with various visual and tactical features, A River Crossing with Bridge, Sentry Gates, a small Village, two Temples and a Castle. It also includes two 'Blenders' - special maps that blend the terrain gradually from Forest into other terrains: in this case, Ice or Desert. Use these or the Sentry Gates to mark edges and borders to your map realm - or as the gateway to their next adventure.
