In the game, you will play as a captain - but carrying a top secret &quot;Lanx prosthetic technology chip&quot;. This type of chip can provide you with very powerful single unit strengthening capabilities and support the free assembly of various detachable modules. This powerful capability is still being developed in secret, but it has been obtained by elusive hostile rebel forces. In the first batch of participants in internal testing, they selected you as the target of plunder. On a stormy night, a small team of rebels broke into your home, &quot;dug three feet deep&quot;, and tried to find the precious chip, but found nothing. Angry criminals have kidnapped your wife and daughter as hostages. You are required to exchange chips within seven days, otherwise their safety will no longer be guaranteed. You are extremely anxious, but there is nothing you can do. Your wife and children are your bottom line, and you do not allow anyone to touch them. In a fit of anger, you took your own accessory gun from the arsenal and decided to embark on the path of snatching someone home alone. Unexpectedly discovered by the military camp carrying weapons without authorization, suspected of fleeing, you are considered a traitor among them. You will have to evade friendly pursuit while searching for clues about your wife and daughter. Collect intelligence and weapons along the way, strengthen your chips, and be fully prepared for the upcoming fierce battle.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3424580/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737419251","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3424580/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1737419251","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3424580/51f7875a7e78644908eb89ee89edf9df4fef5428/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737419251","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3424580/51f7875a7e78644908eb89ee89edf9df4fef5428/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737419251","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3424580/extras/headerGREM.jpg?t=1737419251\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>&quot;The Furthest Distance&quot;</strong> is a 2D side scrolling action adventure game of Metroid Castlevania.
