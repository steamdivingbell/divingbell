At least, that's what she believes. Despite having an overly emotive personality, she's often mistaken for the quiet type despite having a lot to say. Her inquisitive nature usually leads to chaos, as despite enjoying an experiment or two she has no concern for health and safety procedures. Kiyoko is the founder and currently sole member of the science club and tends to keep to herself, being known around the school for her outstanding intellect.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Naomi Sat\u014d (CV: Amber Barile)</h2>Naomi is a girl with plenty of passion, most of which she puts into her attitude. Extremely popular, even to those of the same sex. She isn't afraid of conversation, however despite her popularity her social circle is quite limited. She is the captain of the athletics team when she isn't having her say over every sporting club in the school. She'd be considered a tomboy by most outsiders, but those who know her well are privy to her innermost girlish quirks.</li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Extracurricular Activities","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/734900/6b06622d19230a0aa36f2659912b538bf2edca6d.jpg"},{"name":"Our journey's just begun!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/734900/b5c417e07caab3c1071f6cbf44cad1f24ea22883.jpg"},{"name":"Tsundere Alert!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/734900/a691df43cf3245a8fa2143aefc648f1fb1ccad2b.jpg"},{"name":"Scientific Hearts","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/734900/fc63db5798dfb07c2f8150063b47a5e71f2869e8.jpg"},{"name":"A World to Share Together","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/734900/ff7fd7ac5fcdb801af4e8c675d80adef9a2c08f4.jpg"},{"name":"Chemically Bonded","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/734900/bf21e3a7426906e67c4fbccfd0ce678819fbc30c.jpg"},{"name":"Welcome to the Club!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/734900/ef4d206634f1e38e505fc6db3b7af015b86246c4.jpg"},{"name":"Chasing Futures","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/734900/6bb9f2124161eb5261d27f131f61ca7c5de345c1.jpg"}],"total":8},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/734900/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1609891390","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/734900/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1609891390","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/734900/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1609891390","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/734900/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1609891390","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"Small amount of nudity and innuendo."},"detailed_description":"<h1>Check these out!</h1><p><u></u><br><u></u></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Chemically Bonded</h2><br>Enter the melancholic life of a Japanese high school student, as you soon become entwined in the dispute between two female students.
