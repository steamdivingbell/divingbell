Speaking of method, it\u2018s not always necessary to mash zombies\u2019 heads.

NPC companions will be made to run on AI through multi-threading. So you will fight against many enemies with your NPC companions.<br><br>And you will have to deal with a variety of enemies. Zombies are the main force now, but different living creatures like the devil will be added.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1268900/extras/mutation.gif?t=1648090043\" /><br><br>The main character of the game doesn't have to be human.

You can also wear your favorite crocs with socks, but other survivors might kill you first.<br><br>Weapons? Why should a hero with supernatural powers hold a sledgehammer with both hands? In ND, you can arm these weapons with one hand. Yes, you can hold different rifles in both hands, or you can arm a rifle and a Zweihander.<br><br>Why are all T-shirts blue, skirts all pink, and duster coats all brown? Changing the color of an image doesn't actually require a difficult coding job. So ND is made to let you freely apply various colors for each item. <br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1268900/extras/stpanelsub_seam.png?t=1648090043\" /><br><br>Did you feel frustrated with games that don't connect regions with regions?
