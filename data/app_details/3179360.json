Her violet hair cascades down her back, and her eyes, a mesmerizing shade of violet, hold a mysterious allure. Seraphina\u2019s demonic heritage is evident in her retractable horns and the faint glow of arcane symbols that appear on her skin when she casts spells.

She\u2019s deeply connected to nature and often retreats to the forests surrounding the University to meditate and practice her craft.
