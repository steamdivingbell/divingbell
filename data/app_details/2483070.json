{"about_the_game":"<strong>WTF platformer</strong> is a hardcore platformer with many unique levels, various references and memes. You have to not just run through the next blank, but find a unique approach to each new track. You will not see another inscription or picture with a reference, you will have to flee from them or dodge them with the help of your finger dexterity and skill. In addition to setting your ass on fire due to the complexity, you will see funny thumbnails with simple animations and hear many funny sounds and melodies. The game is crammed with a lot of funny and funny moments.
