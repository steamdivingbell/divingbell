Each professional women\u2019s and men\u2019s player from Novak Djokovic to Nick Kyrgios, and Iga Swiatek to Caroline Wozniacki, has been studied with minute detail to reproduce their signature techniques and strategies, immersing players into the core essence of WTA and ATP play.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2264340/extras/TIBREAK_TITLES_EN02.png?t=1736173634\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2264340/extras/TIEBREAK_GIF_02.gif?t=1736173634\" /><br>Compete as, or against, immortal stars such as Novak Djokovic, Iga Swiatek, Roger Federer, Maria Sharapova, Rafael Nadal, or Naomi Osaka to name just a few of the 120+ tour champions. Each of these legendary players attacks and defends with their own unique playing style. Imagine a tournament on the women\u2019s circuit against Aryna Sabalenka, Coco Gauff, Jasmine Paolini, Maria Sakkari, Caroline Garcia, Qinwen Zheng, Mirra Andreeva and Katie Boulter. Face off with the likes of Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz, Daniil Medvedev, Alexander Zverev, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Ben Shelton, Taylor Fritz or Andy Murray on the men\u2019s circuit.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2264340/extras/TIBREAK_TITLES_EN03.png?t=1736173634\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2264340/extras/TIEBREAK_GIF_03.gif?t=1736173634\" /><br>The TIEBREAK Dev Team has taken player animations to new heights. They have travelled the world to capture authentic signature movements of players to deliver a realistic, immersive experience. Take on Djokovic\u2019s impregnable service return, jump to return Nadal\u2019s powerful topspin forehand, and watch out for Federer\u2019s slice backhand.

Learning how to beat Nadal on clay is no guarantee of victory on grass, hard court or synthetic. A season is long. Victory requires patience and planning. Drive opponents to play to your strengths while you exploit their weaknesses, adjusting for each unique surface.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2264340/extras/TIBREAK_TITLES_EN05.png?t=1736173634\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2264340/extras/TIEBREAK_GIF_05.gif?t=1736173634\" /><br>The power of the racquet in the palms of your hand, feel every shot, live every stroke, embrace the challenge.
