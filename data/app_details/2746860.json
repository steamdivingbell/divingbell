{"about_the_game":"Star Explorers is the interstellar dungeon crawler, but did you know that every piece of music in Star Explorers is procedurally generated while you play the game?  Each song is based on the conditions and parameters of the planet, cave, spaceship or whatever location you have found yourself in the game.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe songs on this soundtrack were all procedurally generated by the game.  However there is no guarantee that you will ever encounter songs like these while you play the game.  Each song is unique and specific to its location.  However, whenever you return to that location, the song will still be there.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnyway if you enjoy some of the music in the game, now you can enjoy some of the songs while you are not playing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNote: This official soundtrack is based on the original game's music algorithm.  That algorithm and some of the musical effects have been updated since the original release, but these songs were recorded prior to those updates.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2746860/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1705340640","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2746860/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1705340640","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2746860/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1705340640","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2746860/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1705340640","categories":[{"description":"Additional High-Quality Audio","id":50}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Star Explorers is the interstellar dungeon crawler, but did you know that every piece of music in Star Explorers is procedurally generated while you play the game?
