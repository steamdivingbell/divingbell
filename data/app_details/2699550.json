Mysterious cosmic forces have created the Fightland, and they\u2019ve plucked warriors from across space and time to do battle there. Split into 4 teams of up to 25 players each, each team has enough players to conquer objectives, defend their positions, attack other factions, and scout for loot - it\u2019s how well each team will coordinate and react that determines the winner.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Featuring 3 main hero classes, a range of primary and secondary weapons, outfits that enable both play style and visual style, discoverable Battle Assets that can change the tide of battle, and 3 varied game modes, each game is a unique, exciting challenge.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>BUILD YOUR HERO</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Going the Brute path gives you access to heavy-hitting weapons, slow but packing a wallop. With Rogue, you are fast on your feet, delivering quick, precision attacks. As a Mage, you can damage enemies at range, heal your allies, or join the fray directly.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2699550/extras/brute_head.png?t=1733780758\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2699550/extras/rogue_head.png?t=1733780758\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2699550/extras/mage_head.png?t=1733780758\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>CHOOSE YOUR LOADOUT</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each of the 3 Hero types has bespoke primary weapons, secondary items, and armored outfits, with tactical and visual reference from fantasy to steampunk to sci-fi.
