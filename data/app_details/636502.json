{"about_the_game":"You are arriving in London, the focus of the world\u2019s high finance and reigning monarch of modern mass communication. Skyscrapers are springing up everywhere as the world clamors for office space here among the history and pageantry of England\u2019s capital. In London Life, you will be challenged to create gleaming office towers for titans of trade, elite global stock exchanges and moguls of media. Your towers will be crowned with soaring antennae and space-facing satellite dishes to access the global information network. <br><br><strong>London Calling</strong><br>London Life adds 12 new office tenants, all looking for space to let within the coveted confines of this regal city. Financiers have always flocked to London; from small banks to sprawling stock exchanges, everybody wants to be near the global hub of commerce in the City. But in recent years, creatives of all types have also found the city\u2019s spirit irresistible: from small recording studios and indie game developers, to bustling newsrooms and lofty movie studios, all are attracted by London\u2019s bright lights and pulsing glamor. <br><br><strong>Rule Britannia</strong><br>London Life brings some British verve into your buildings. Traditional pubs and elegant restaurants impart a bit of English charm to your dining and drinking destinations. Luxuriant lobbies with chic chandeliers create impressive entryways. When combined with a variety of opulent outdoor decorations and posh new artworks, your new London premises will radiate refinement and prestige.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/636502/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1627897878","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/636502/page.bg.jpg?t=1627897878","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/636502/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1627897878","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/636502/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1627897878","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>NEW GAME FROM THE DEVELOPER</h1><p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>You are arriving in London, the focus of the world\u2019s high finance and reigning monarch of modern mass communication.
