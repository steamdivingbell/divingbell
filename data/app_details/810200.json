{"about_the_game":"<i>blue.</i> is the part puzzle game, part visual novel, story of Violet, a young Cubie. Cubies and full grown Cubes live in a colorful, gem-like, world mined out of pink and blue stones. You play as Violet grows up in the Commons with the rest of the Cubies, overlooked by a Matron. As time goes on you learn when it means to grow up and about the world around you. Sometimes growing up isn't easy, and sometimes figuring out what being a Cube isn't as straightforward as you thought.<br><br>Features:<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/810200/extras/cards.png?t=1601345582\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A Bright and Intricate World</li></ul>\tNavigate the bright and varied mined out world of Cubes and Cubies.
