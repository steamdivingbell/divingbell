{"about_the_game":"Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup <br><br>EKCH is the main international airport serving Copenhagen, Denmark, the rest of Zealand, the \u00d8resund Region, and a large part of southern Sweden including Scania. It is the largest airport in the Nordic countries with 30 million passengers in 2018 and one of the oldest international airports in Europe. It is the third-busiest airport in Northern Europe, and the busiest for international travel in Scandinavia.<br><br>The airport covers an area of 11.8 square kilometres (4.6 sq mi).Most of the airport is situated in the municipality of T\u00e5rnby, with a small portion in the city of Drag\u00f8r. It's the main hub out of three used by Scandinavian Airlines and is also an operating base for Sunclass Airlines and Norwegian Air Shuttle. Copenhagen Airport handles around 60 scheduled airlines, and has a maximum operation capability of 83 operations/hour, and a total of 108 jet bridges and remote parking stands. <br><br>Copenhagen Airport was originally called Kastrup Airport, since it is located in the small town of Kastrup, now a part of the T\u00e5rnby municipality.

Those runways point to the \u00d8resund strait, close in both directions. The supplementary runway (30/12) oriented perpendicular to the main runways also has its approach or departure over \u00d8resund in one direction. In the opposite direction, the 30/12 runway has noise restrictions as flight happens close over residential areas","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1278510/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1585918859","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1278510/page.bg.jpg?t=1585918859","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1278510/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1585918859","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1278510/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1585918859","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup <br><br>EKCH is the main international airport serving Copenhagen, Denmark, the rest of Zealand, the \u00d8resund Region, and a large part of southern Sweden including Scania.
