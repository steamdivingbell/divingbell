{"about_the_game":"<strong>Aka Manto</strong> <strong>(\u8d64\u30de\u30f3\u30c8 Red Cloak)</strong>, aka Red Cape or Red Mantle, is a Japanese urban legend about a masked spirit who wears a red cloak, and who appears to people using toilets in public or school bathrooms, specifically targeting young women. Accounts of the legend vary, but one consistent element of the story is that the spirit will ask the individual using a toilet a question. He will ask them if they want a red paper or a blue paper. If they choose the red, they will be lacerated in such a manner that their dead body will be drenched in their own blood. If the individual chooses blue, the person will be strangled to all of the person's blood being drained from their body.<br><br>From the creators of <br><br><br><strong>Controls:<br>Move: WASD + Mouse<br>Interact: Left-Click<br>Crouch: CTRL<br>Run: Shift<br>Inventory: Tab<br>Drop item: Q<br>Switch item: Scroll wheel<br>Options: ESC</strong><br><br><strong>The game is around 90 ~ 120 minutes long depending on your skill and playstyle.</strong><br><i>Warning: This game is very challenging.
