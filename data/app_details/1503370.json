{"about_the_game":"Francisca 2 \u2013 a first-person indie horror game. <br />\r\nHi, my name is Mike, I\u2019m 17. I go to school, and I\u2019m on holiday now.<br />\r\nI\u2019ve already forgotten the events that took place in this house three years ago. It\u2019s been calm until now, but recently I\u2019ve started to feel someone\u2019s presence in the house, and I even think I saw a silhouette in the window.<br />\r\nYesterday somebody left a gift at the door.<br />\r\nToday my parents left for Mexico for a week, and I\u2019m supposed to spend seven days alone in our new house.<br />\r\nThe game is divided into 7 levels (7 days). Every day you\u2019ll have to survive in your own house. At the start of each level, you need to place video cameras inside the house and in the yard and conceal yourself as well as you can, because a ghost girl is going to visit you soon. She will be trying to find you at night. The closer she gets to you, the stronger your fear will grow. You can always close your eyes and ears, so you will not see or hear anything, but your fear will be leaving you then. Using a tablet, you can monitor your house through the cameras. The main thing is that you should never let your fear reach the critical level.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1503370/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1709391939","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1503370/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1709391939","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1503370/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1709391939","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1503370/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1709391939","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Francisca 2 \u2013 a first-person indie horror game. <br />\r\nHi, my name is Mike, I\u2019m 17.
