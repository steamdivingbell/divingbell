The game is set in the fictional city Badlerboro, which has been designed with gritty urban aesthetics, cartoons of our childhood, and our home town of NYC in mind. The game brings you fast paced combat, intense boss fights, and a nuanced story set in a lore-rich world. Every single visual asset and animation frame frame had been hand drawn in our stylized, early 2000\u2019s cartoon inspired, art style.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1710110/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731274328","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1710110/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1731274328","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1710110/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731274328","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1710110/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731274328","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":2465040,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1710110/extras/fightgif.gif?t=1731274328\" /><br>Bad Boro is a 2D souls-like action RPG focusing on exploration and challenging twin-stick melee combat.
