{"about_the_game":"Dead6hot (pronounced Dead-Shot) is a quirky little local multi-player shmup. Dead6hot is focused on fast paced shooting and a very frantic atmosphere. It can be played in short periods making it perfect for the short coffee breaks or whenever you feel like killing a few minutes (pun intended). <br><br>It takes place across 5 unique stages and 15 levels in total. You and your not so arch enemy each play as one of ten character choices while trying to kill each other or the hordes of minions. You get to wield five types of weapons in arena style combat.
