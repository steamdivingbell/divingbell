{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Game Overview:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">&quot;Don't Mess With Your Ex&quot; is a gripping escape room horror game where you find yourself trapped in a strange house after a wild party. You wake up alone, confused, and quickly realize that your ex is behind it. Your only goal is to find a way out, but it won\u2019t be easy. The house is filled with puzzles to solve, objects to find, and terrifying surprises at every turn. The game is packed with jump scares and a constant feeling of being watched, making every moment tense as you try to figure out how to get away from your ex, both physically and mentally.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Storyline:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You wake up disoriented in a small, unfamiliar room. The last thing you remember is a party, and your ex was there too. Now you\u2019re locked in a house you don\u2019t recognize, with no idea how you got there or what\u2019s happening. Soon, it hits you\u2014your ex is behind this. You don\u2019t see her, but her presence is everywhere.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Notes, clues, and key items are scattered throughout the house. You\u2019re forced to confront painful moments while trying to solve puzzles and find the key to your freedom. Every step you take brings you closer to escaping, but also deeper into the nightmare your ex has created for you. Their voice haunts the house, taunting you, reminding you of all the emotional wounds you\u2019ve tried to forget.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Gameplay Mechanics:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Puzzle Solving:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game has challenging puzzles you need to solve to escape. You\u2019ll have to decode messages, find hidden clues, and figure out how to unlock doors. These puzzles aren\u2019t just random\u2014they\u2019re all tied to your ex, forcing you to deal with unimaginable things as you try to break free.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Exploration:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The area is large, with many rooms to explore, but every room feels dangerous and unsettling. As you go deeper into the house, you start to notice strange things\u2014objects. Throughout the game, you\u2019ll find items that are key to solving puzzles and progressing. You\u2019ll have to search through drawers, cabinets, and hidden corners to find what you need. Some of these items are connected to your ex and your relationship, making it even harder to focus on getting out. But without these items, you won\u2019t be able to escape.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Stealth and Survival:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Even though you don\u2019t see your ex, you know they\u2019re always nearby. The house feels like it\u2019s filled with traps, and you have to stay alert to avoid getting caught. The longer you stay in the house, the more dangerous it feels, and the pressure builds as you try to stay one step ahead of whatever your ex has planned for you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Jumpscares and Tension:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game is full of jump scares that will keep you on edge. Sudden loud noises, things you really shouldn\u2019t see, and creepy surprises make every moment tense. You never feel safe, and just when you think you\u2019re making progress, something terrifying happens to shake you up.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Atmosphere and Visual Design:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The house is dark, cold, and unsettling. Old lights, strange noises, and shadows moving in the corners make it feel like the house is alive and watching you. The creepy sound design, from distant footsteps to eerie whispers, keeps the tension high as you move through the house, never sure what\u2019s real and what\u2019s just your mind playing tricks on you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This terrifying game puts you in a race against time, not just to get out of the house but to break free from the grip of your toxic past. With challenging puzzles, heart-pounding scares, and the constant feeling of being hunted, the game keeps you on edge from start to finish. Can you solve the puzzles, find the exit, and escape the nightmare your ex has created for you? Or will you be trapped inside, both in the house and in the emotional mess of your past?</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3246820/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731784381","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3246820/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1731784381","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3246820/c90d3a503b3d327784f10f72993fb68e2d07dc02/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731784381","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3246820/c90d3a503b3d327784f10f72993fb68e2d07dc02/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731784381","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"The game features scenes of violence, including dead bodies, blood, and the presence of weapons.
