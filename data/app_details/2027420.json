{"about_the_game":"Blastonier is a short 2D physics-based experience with minimal neon graphics where your goal is to shoot a ball through a level full of obstacles and into a green win zone to win levels and move on to the next. To do this you only need your mouse to aim your shot, left click to fire a shot in the direction of your mouse, and space bar to retrieve your shots and refill your ammo (your only allowed 2 shots at a time). There are 100 handmade levels requiring a mixture of skill, timing, and luck to win.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2027420/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1661471178","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2027420/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1661471178","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2027420/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1661471178","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2027420/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1661471178","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Blastonier is a short 2D physics-based experience with minimal neon graphics where your goal is to shoot a ball through a level full of obstacles and into a green win zone to win levels and move on to the next.
