Embodying the symbols of royalty and poise in human culture around the world, the Lion is the second-largest of the cats, surpassed only by the tiger. With a muscular and deep chest, the density of their muscles severely complicates shot placement and penetration during a hunt. The lions of Vurhonga Savanna are in their prime and will not take kindly to trespassers on their territory. As a hunter, remain steadfast in your resolve, and keep your wits about you as you venture into the wild to hunt the King of the Jungle. <br><br><strong>Surviving the King of the Jungle:</strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1011280/extras/CoTW_descr_img_surviving.png?t=1732105463\" /><br>Lions prefer to attack targets from behind, going for the neck for a quick kill. They grow more confident around smaller targets and react fiercely to sudden movements. The lions of Vurhonga aren\u2019t maneaters, but will attack humans that they deem invade their territory.
