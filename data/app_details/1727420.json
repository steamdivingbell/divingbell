{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">This looks fun, what is it?</h2>Midinous is a non-linear MIDI sequencer (directly viewable as a MIDI input in your DAW) allowing users to create expansive looping complex sequences which don\u2019t subscribe to a definite timeline. Rhythm is determined only by a user\u2019s imagination. Midinous can, however, still send MIDI clock messages to sync up devices and software. It's not a DAW, nor can it make more than simple sounds using basic waveforms (sine, square, triangle, etc) with its &quot;Internal Synth&quot; option, but it generates MIDI data meant to be sent to other applications. Midinous sends transport, Note, and CC messages on its automatically-created MIDI ports, allowing up to 16 channels of data to be sent simultaneously.<br><br><strong>If you are unsure if Midinous is right for you, try the free demo!</strong><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1727420/extras/Midinous_Simple_Circuit.gif?t=1718155362\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">That sounds confusing. How does it work, really?</h2>Seamlessly! Open Midinous, find it as a MIDI input device in your DAW and start creating. <br>Midinous emulates a hardware MIDI controller by creating its own MIDI Input/Output port on a computer, throwing away the need for any 3rd party software. Launch Midinous, and it can start sending MIDI data within seconds!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Still lost. MIDI?</h2>Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) is the technical standard Midinous adopts to send data to other applications (usually, but not limited to, Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs)). Although Midinous can make simple sounds on its own, it is best used with a DAW.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Grid Based Editing</h2>Midinous works on a grid system where the distance between each tile is a quarter note. Arrange objects called \u2018Points\u2019 and connect them together with \u2018Paths\u2019 to quickly create complex looping or branching sequences of MIDI data. Branch to points randomly or instantly, split signals, or have signals travel in order of Path creation.

A left-handed mode is also included.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\u201cInfinite\u201d Canvas</h2>Midinous provides a virtually infinite scrolling canvas for creations.
