However, records of who founded this corporation and its purpose remain unknown. Many explorers hired for research have gone missing, either lost in the maze-like structure or disappearing under mysterious circumstances.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your mission is to trace their remnants and collect bizarre artifacts found only within the backrooms. But simple item collection is not enough to prove research progress. Utilizing a camcorder to document 'anomalies' and 'creatures' within the backrooms is also a crucial task. Gathering accurate research data may be the key to ensuring your survival.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3136910/extras/HotelScene.gif?t=1738564161\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the Main Control Room, you can buy and sell essential items for exploration. Carefully select your equipment before embarking on your mission. Since inventory space is limited, strategic preparation is necessary.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Once a stage is selected, the elevator doors will open, marking the beginning of your research. Even if you die during the expedition, if your teammates reach the target amount, everyone can escape the stage together. However, if you fail to meet the objective five times, the Control Room will shut down permanently, and the expedition will come to an end.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3136910/extras/Locker.gif?t=1738564161\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Use your radio to stay in constant communication with your team. If you stray too far, the signal may cut off, drastically lowering your chances of survival. Even if you're injured, there may be ways to receive assistance from teammates remaining in the Main Control Room.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The backrooms are an illogical space, and the threats within them defy rational understanding. If you encounter bacteria, do not look back. They are unimaginably fast and cannot be killed. If there\u2019s a locker nearby, hiding is your only chance of survival.
