{"about_the_game":"The Deluxe version of Lightspeed Dating adds two new game modes, one additional character, a new room type as well as three question packs. You also get priority queueing rights, which means there will always be a server space available for you. Having fun with Lightspeed Dating, but want a little more variety? This is the pack for you!  <br><br>For most features of this DLC pack only the <strong>host of a server</strong> needs to own it. This means if you're playing as a group, only one of you needs to own this DLC for all to benefit. The exception to this rule are the characters, only the people who actually own the deluxe version can use them. So, if the price seems steep to you, consider buying it together with your friends!<br><br><strong>Two New Game Modes!</strong>  <br>The <i>Mayhem </i>game mode takes Lightspeed Datings chaos to the next level.

Ever wanted to pretend to your friend while trying to figure out whether the friend you're talking to is just another friend pretending to be the previous friend? Now you can!  <br>  <br>The <i>Kevin </i>game mode is mostly the same as the classic game mode, but with a fun twist that will keep you second guessing the entire time: one of the non-monster players <i>wants </i>to die. They get assigned a special role in the very beggining. Is your opposite doing a terrible impression, or do they want to fool you into pressing that kill button? Who knows!<br><br><strong>New Room Type</strong><br>The Judgement Room (can be enabled and disabled in settings) is a sort of alternate ending to your matches. If only two players are left, then the dead will decide their fate. Both players get a short burst of speaking time, where they answer a question and thus proove their realness. Meanwhile, the dead players vote which of them is real or fake. Awkward and funny as hell!  <br>  <br><strong>Three Question Packs</strong><br>The question packs included in this DLC are:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Icebreaker - For those playing with people who aren't all that well aquainted<br></li><li> Deep - If you're playing with your close friends<br></li><li> Edgy - Not your mommas question pack!
