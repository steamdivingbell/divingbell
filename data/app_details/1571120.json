Crucible is a top-down shooter game made by three DigiPen freshmen for their GAM100 class project.<br><br>You control a magical dragon in a trial by fire against an older, stronger dragon. Your goal is to dodge through an onslaught of colorful bullet patterns without getting hit. There are twelve patterns in all; you win by lasting through all of them in a row. See the true ending by completing either difficulty without using any continues!<br><br>Each bullet pattern can be cleared either by reducing the boss's stamina to zero or lasting until the pattern timer reaches zero. If the player is hit by a bullet, they can prevent themselves from losing a life point by reacting with a fireball burst attack. The player's score increases every second they're alive and whenever they come close to a bullet without touching it. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1571120/extras/Gamefeatures.png?t=1670243132\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Full controller support<br></li><li>Full keyboard support<br></li><li>Two difficulty settings</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1571120/extras/Aboutdevelopment.png?t=1670243132\" /><br><br>This game was developed as a student project at DigiPen Institute of Technology and was created for educational purposes only.
