The Plutonians, feeling left behind and undermined, decide to send Squid, their strongest warrior, to finish off the 8 Emperors of the Solar System, that form Vexus. In his journey, Squid will find hordes of enemies in planets with technology much more advanced than his own. Will Squid exact revenge for his people? Only you can decide.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/924430/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1536341254","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/924430/page.bg.jpg?t=1536341254","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/924430/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1536341254","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/924430/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1536341254","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Indie Game made by a small company (JammSoft).
