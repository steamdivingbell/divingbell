{"about_the_game":"Snap the Sentinel is a first person shooter inspired by classic 2D run 'n' gun games. Use the Chameleon Blaster to shoot everything from boomerangs to bombs to lasers and much more at enemies, and launch them sky high with one shell of a kick!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2>Fame, fortune, influence, you name it: Conrad Ocean had it all. He was once revered as the most powerful businessman under the sea. But that all changed long ago, when he was exiled to the surface world and forced to restart from scratch. Bitter and enraged, he concocted a plan to create a new fortune and take his revenge against the citizens of the seas he once called home. Now that he's rebuilt his riches, he's unleashed a plague of deadly robots bent on poisoning all the world's waters. Only one turtle is tough enough to face off against them: Snap the Sentinel! Snap sets off to rid his home of Ocean's mechanical scourge and set the world back on the right track.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Mechanics inspired by 16-bit era run 'n' gun games!<br></li><li>Tons of weapon modifiers that let you adapt to any combat situation!<br></li><li>Unlockable Hard mode with remixed levels!<br></li><li>Ranking system saves your highest score for every level!<br></li><li>Beautiful low-poly 3D models and stunning pixel art!<br></li><li>FM synth soundtrack with groovy beats and rockin' licks!</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1739960/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1700003538","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1739960/page.bg.jpg?t=1700003538","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1739960/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1700003538","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1739960/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1700003538","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2326580,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Snap the Sentinel is a first person shooter inspired by classic 2D run 'n' gun games.
