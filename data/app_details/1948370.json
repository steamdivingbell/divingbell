We apologize for the inconvenience, but processing the death of your previous form must be done on your own time. Today, you will be attending new-hire orientation for a recently vacated position here at Lightcorp. Because we here at Lightcorp and all other Infinicorp subsidiaries believe in the benefit of accurate job placement, you will be undergoing some tests before we determine the best place for you. You have been assigned a friendly testing helper by the name of Jamie, who will be assisting you with anything you need - all you need to do is to ask for help. Good luck!&quot; - Management<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2><br>In <i>Let There Be Light</i>, the player navigates through the offices of Lightcorp, a subsidiary of Infinicorp. In the afterlife, all aspects of the universe are controlled by a capitalism-focused company with a thirst for everyone to conform to their way of life. As the player progresses through the game, they will learn about the megastructure that they have been trapped in as well as both ends of the spectrum of light and dark. The guide, Jamie, is an employee of Lightcorp that is sick of his job and burnt out in every aspect. He hates his afterlife, and you're going to help him see the light in things again.

The goal of the puzzles in this game is not to make you believe that they are unsolvable, but instead to motivate you to find different approaches using new gameplay mechanics along the way.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1948370/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1653542799","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1948370/page.bg.jpg?t=1653542799","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1948370/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1653542799","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1948370/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1653542799","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1948370/extras/Steam_Page_Discord_Banner.png?t=1653542799\" /><br><br>&quot;Good afternoon applicant 39,064, and welcome to the afterlife.
