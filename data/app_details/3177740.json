{"about_the_game":"A dynamic and colorful platform game featuring penguins that transports players to a magical world where they compete against each other. The game combines classic platform gameplay with a variety of modes, making each session unique and full of surprises.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Tile Coloring Mode</strong></h2>The goal is to color as many tiles on the board as possible by jumping on them and leaving your color behind. Players can interfere with each other by jumping on already colored tiles and changing their color to their own. This requires not only agility but also strategy to anticipate the moves of rivals and dominate the board. When time runs out, the player who has colored the most tiles wins.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Saboteur Mode</strong></h2>In &quot;Saboteur Mode,&quot; one player is designated as the secret saboteur, whose task is to thwart the plans of the other penguins. The saboteur can set traps to slow down or immobilize other players. The rest of the penguins must work together to complete tasks while trying to discover who the saboteur is before it\u2019s too late.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3177740?t=1727475433","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3177740?t=1727475433","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3177740/c0f3510fb1a4b52c6f2d45d5676baa8150bf2eef/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727475433","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3177740/c0f3510fb1a4b52c6f2d45d5676baa8150bf2eef/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727475433","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A dynamic and colorful platform game featuring penguins that transports players to a magical world where they compete against each other.
