{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Intelektronica is a game that has a world simulator that allows any choice of gameplay. The game features factions such as the Sports Gang, which is from Eastern Europe, the Cyber Gang, which is a faction of rebel hackers, and the police who guard order. The game has a trust point system for each faction. The higher the level, the more privileges for the player. Having Friendly da status of a given faction, we can perform missions for it by receiving tasks for which we can earn money. Factions fight each other, so by attacking one gang we earn trust points of the other. When our account has 50 trust points for a given faction, we can perform a mission for that faction. For missions we can report to the headquarters of individual gangs, or in the case of the police to the police station. Sport Gagng is headquartered in a bakery in the southern district, CyberGang headquarters is an abandoned subway station near the port. The police station is located in the central part of the city. The game allows us to explore the city and an area outside the city that we can reach by ferry. During the gameplay by collecting trust points, our rating of other factions changes, thus we have to watch out for the police and enemy Gang when we find ourselves in their sight. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3416300/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738699818","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3416300/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1738699818","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3416300/2ff7f48e9effe91423302f15809daa8f83a61b78/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738699818","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3416300/2ff7f48e9effe91423302f15809daa8f83a61b78/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738699818","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Intelektronica is a game that has a world simulator that allows any choice of gameplay.
