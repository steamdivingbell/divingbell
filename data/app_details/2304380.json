The city had been soaked in rain for five days, and B\u00e9atrice Maunet was drenched and exhausted. She had searched each street and alley, yet her son Henri was nowhere to be found. The only place left to search was the world underground. Desperation brought her to the entrance of the Catacombs of Paris. A faint hope sparked in her heart as she read the warning out loud: \u201cArr\u00eate! C'est ici l'empire de la mort.\u201d Knowing Henri was a courageous boy, she delved into the dark halls. <br><br>After thousands of steps into the abyss, in the world of the living, days turned to nights, but in the halls of the dead, time came to a standstill. She memorized the feel of each bone and skull, every crack and fracture that made them unique. Darkness governed her mind and soul, and the bone-walls whispered countless stories of agony and death. She walked and walked until in a dark, uncharted hall she felt the familiar touch of her boy\u2019s face. She followed the bones back and emerged with him in her arms \u2013 lifeless and decomposing. <br><br>B\u00e9atrice cleaned her boy\u2019s remains carefully, giving him his last bath. Her mind clouded by remorse, she hoped to find closure in the Catacombs, where it all had begun. Each midnight she offered his bones to the walls, treating them with the respect and great precision of an artist, wishing they would accept her precious boy. But the walls had gone silent, and as years passed, she lost her will and name to become the Bone Mason - the phantom of the great Catacombs - so dubbed by those who witnessed her enter the abyss whenever the bells tolled twelve. And as time killed the last spark of hope, a mysterious letter pointed at Louisiana, where she could find other lost souls. Throughout her journey across the Atlantic, she tenderly caressed the satchel she\u2019d crafted. No one believed the story behind the satchel, but B\u00e9atrice found comfort in the familiar touch of its cover, rumored to be bound in her boy\u2019s own skin.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2304380/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728572373","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2304380/page.bg.jpg?t=1728572373","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2304380/0f24f75f4928450404b7e4a6639d619f0341200c/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728572373","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2304380/0f24f75f4928450404b7e4a6639d619f0341200c/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728572373","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Remote Play on Tablet","id":42},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"This DLC contains one Hunter, two Weapons, and one Tool:<br><br>- The Bone Mason (Hunter)<br>- Fissure (Romero 77 Hatchet)<br>- Fresh Marrow (Uppercut)<br>- Scarfskin Satchel (First Aid Kit)<br><br><br><strong><u>The Bone Mason</u></strong><br><br>B\u00e9atrice Maunet lost her light and name in the bone-halls of the Catacombs of Paris after finding her boy\u2019s decomposing remains.
