{"about_the_game":"Aero GPX is an anti-gravity racer that is focused on high velocity, flight, machine-to-machine combat, and responsive controls that are simple to pick up but difficult to master. There are 30 machines on the circuit for each race in Aero GPX; and the race ends with significantly less than that. Pilots fight for the best position possible with high speeds, risky maneuvers, and visceral attacks. While Aero GPX is inspired by classics in the genre, it also has a few twists of its own to feel like a new experience with hints of nostalgia.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2160360/extras/CrimsonDrillAttackSteam.gif?t=1724356130\" /><br><br><strong>Core Gameplay</strong><br><br>The Core Gameplay of Aero GPX is best described by touching upon a few of its most important aspects:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Responsive Handling and Controls</h2>Aero GPX aims to be one of the most responsive racing experiences you've ever played; responding instantly to your input and reacting accordingly.
