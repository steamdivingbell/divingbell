{"about_the_game":"A radioactive invasion is taking over, and it's up to you to save Wayfield!  An action-packed top-down shooter game with several wide-open maps and a dozen unique (and maybe underqualified) heroes, Hollybound truly has it all!

I promise, it's cooler than it sounds.<br><br><br><br><strong>THE STORY</strong><br><br>On the first night of summer vacation, a party is going down on Holly Lane!  Celebrating their newfound freedom, twelve friends enjoy a night of paintball, soda, and drawing.  When a collective rumble of stomachs rings out, the boys get some ice cream out of the freezer.  Unfortunately, it's rock solid!  Ethan suggests heating up the spoons in the microwave to make it easier to eat, and everyone overlooks the common knowledge that silverware in a microwave is a TERRIBLE idea.  Josh mentions that food is supposed to be wrapped with a paper towel when microwaved, and when nobody can find a napkin, Colin just uses the drawing paper from earlier to wrap up the spoons.  The geniuses set the timer for 10 whole minutes, and the radiation begins to react to the spoons and the drawings they had made.  But before anyone could notice...  <strong>BOOM!!!</strong>  A radioactive explosion bursts through the house!  Escaping the blast, the boys laugh, as explosions are really cool and kind of funny.  But then, the sky flashes an ominous red, as the booming voice of LORD OPPTAVIOUS calls upon his army to invade!  From the flames, creatures that resemble the ones they had drawn rise and begin to terrorize the town, spreading across it by using radioactive portals.  To save Wayfield, and hopefully prevent their parents from finding out they caused the apocalypse, the 12 underqualified heroes grab their paintball guns and prepare to take on the radioactive invasion!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2535010/extras/Cutscene13.png?t=1692980500\" /><br><br><br><br><strong>A BEGINNERS GUIDE TO HOLLYBOUND</strong><br><br>THE GOAL: After spawning in a deactivated portal, you must collect the amount of radiation specified in green under the HP display to activate the portal in each map.

Each special move is different depending on which character you use, so make sure to try them all to find your best fit.  An indicator below the wheel will also notify you when a special move can be performed.  Another indicator to the right of that one will notify you when a dash can be performed.  It only requires the stamina wheel to be half-full, and is useful for crossing busy streets or escaping hordes of enemies!
