{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Steel, strategy, sabotage - or forbidden magic? How far will you go to defeat your greatest rival and win glory in the grandest tournament in the entire realm? Will you win back your honor or spark a revolution?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Games of the Monarch\u2019s Eye</i> is a Silk Road inspired interactive fantasy novel by Saffron Kuo. It\u2019s entirely text-based, includes hundreds of choices, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">After a decade in disgrace, you have returned to your home city of Varze to compete for the title of Monarch\u2019s Eye. In this grand tournament, the bravest Varzians compete in games of Intellect, Heart, and Might. The winner becomes the Monarch\u2019s most trusted guard and advisor, gaining wealth, fame, and honor \u2013 everything that you have lost. The only catch? The current Eye - and therefore your main competition - is Casiola, once your childhood friend and now your bitterest rival.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">But while you were gone, the city has grown volatile. Powerful factions vie for dominance and the guilds\u2019 professional differences now spill over into political rivalries. On one side, the idealist Artisans, rumored to still dabble in the ancient magic of Celestia as they seek perfection in their crafts. On the other, the ambitious and pragmatic Merchants, constantly chasing fame and profit. Caught between them is the Monarch, striving for a peaceful revitalization for Varze - if only it can happen before the city tears itself apart with an all-out revolution. And the Games might make the perfect opportunity for the factions to make their first moves.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you prepare for the Games, you must also navigate this factional strife. How will you forge your path to victory? Will you hone your blades, charm the public with your silver tongue, try to get ahead of your opponents with your careful observation of their strengths and weaknesses, or just cheat your way to the top? Will you dive into politics, currying favor with one faction or the other; or will you try to float aloof above them? Do you dare to seek wisdom in the stars, or from forgotten ancient tomes?
