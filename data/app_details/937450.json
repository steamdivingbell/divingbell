My commitment is to not stop once the game is shipped. There will continue to be updates including new features, new buildings, and more after the game is released. Players will be able to add new content including buildings, through robust mod support.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/937450?t=1668043861","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/937450?t=1668043861","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/937450/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1668043861","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/937450/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1668043861","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>The Deeply Complex City Building and Management Game</strong><br>The most authentic city-building simulation experience ever.
