{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Discord</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Info</h2>Cats and Mice is a <u>multiplayer game</u> that offers an <u>online PVP</u> experience and a <u>Battle Royal</u> game mode experience. Cats and mice put an end to the war between themselves and form alliances against each other in this universe. In the game, you can do team battles up to 4 vs 4 with the competitive <strong><u>Deathmatch mode</u></strong>. Also you can also fight individually to be the last player standing with the <strong><u>Battle Royal mode</u></strong>.<br><br>You can play the game with your Steam Id and you can see your global ranking in the game. If you want to play with different name than your Steam username, then your global score in leaderboard won't update. You should play with your steam account if you want to improve your ranking at the global leaderboard.<br><br>You can set up private rooms to play only with your own friends or you can set up public rooms to play with strangers. It's up to you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>The number of weapons and mice of cats changes depending on the game mode. In the classic deathmatch mode, your cat has 3 mice. You control close/melee combat with one of them. You control long-range paint weapon that you choosed with other mouse. And the last mouse is for controlling a catapult system that throws bombs. Yes, you can make bomb attacks with cats! <br>You should change rider mouse to change your combat and attack style during the game dynamically. Which means, you can get in close combats with your cat or long-range combat with your cat base on your tactics and strategy. Choice and tactic are up to you at this point. Also, other important thing is that mice are eateable. Yes, mice are not for only using weapons. If a cat puts another cat to sleep, it can eat that cats' mice. And health amount of eater cat increases. This is so important for stay standing for long time in battle.<br><br>You know that cats have claws. But the claws of cats in this universe are a bit too strong. So much so that they can even cling to very hard and smooth walls. It would be very boring for mice to be able to drive cats only on straight roads anyway. You will be able to get a more tactical game experience by running on walls or clinging to them. Yes, cats can do parkour in this universe. You can also do acrobatic attacks by doing flips in the air.<br><br>In the Battle Royale game mode, you are completely alone. You can drive your cat with only 1 mouse. Only close combat is allowed for this mode. (At least for now.) Get ready for cage fights. Because there will be battle royale battles in a cage with up to 8 players. Don't forget to climb the cage wires and make tactics while fighting. Because making a good strategy is a greater need when your teammates are not around.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Singleplayer</h2>There is also single player mode in the game. It contains battle royal mode cage fight with ai bots. However, single player doesn't contain deathmatch mode or ai bots for deathmatch.<br><br><br>There is a tutorial scene in the game. You can learn how to play by playing in that scene. Or you can just read instructions.<br><br>Cats and Mice are waiting for you. Join this adventure or just play with your own cat. It's up to you.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3041160/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729232912","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3041160/page.bg.jpg?t=1729232912","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3041160/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729232912","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3041160/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729232912","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Discord</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Info</h2>Cats and Mice is a <u>multiplayer game</u> that offers an <u>online PVP</u> experience and a <u>Battle Royal</u> game mode experience.
