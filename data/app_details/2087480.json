{"about_the_game":"A hidden object game where you must find all the bees to complete each level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2>\u204d 1000+ bees<br><br>\u204d 10 unique artworks<br>\u204d Unlimited hints if you get stuck<br>\u204d Restore a small number of bees to a painting so you can find them again! <br>\u204d Additional bee related objects to find<br>\u204d Music and ambiance for each artwork<br>\u204d Achievements<br>\u204d Use your keyboard to move/zoom in if you have no scrollwheel<br>\u204d 3 save slots<br>\u204d Reset progress entirely and play again<br>\u204d Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Context:</h2>The brief was simple. I commissioned artists to create a fantasy world, and hide as many bees as they can inside it. Now it\u2019s your job to find them all! With 10 art pieces to choose from, and 1000+ bees, you will have a lot of searching to do.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Controls:</h2>Use your mouse to move around the image and zoom in / out. When you find a bee, click it and it will disappear. You can also use WASD to move and the arrow keys to zoom.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Difficulty:</h2>A full range of difficulty is included, but all levels start unlocked, your progress is saved as you play, and you can use hints if you get stuck.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get immersed:</h2>Each painting has its own music and ambiance to help you connect with the world, as you search for all the bees.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Replayable</h2>You can restore a small number of bees back into a painting so you can find them again! It\u2019s much harder when there are only a few bees left (especially randomly). You can also use up to 3 save slots so you can replay without progress loss. Alternatively, you can reset your progress for the entire game if you\u2019d like to start over.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Perfect","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2087480/10c3d1c007ef54db811ce47b2c2eb4edb0601031.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Morning Crows","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2087480/2d67050a0f4ab1109394c737a81704c6ff6fd793.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Haunted House","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2087480/79282cc2d21b2adac1ba4d3b839d5e83ce13e2bf.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Planet","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2087480/6f4f1b211ce55235c2e0d64462f6557fe09339b5.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Concert","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2087480/9322dd833da63c4bde33cb3738b56b22547370df.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Junk Monster","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2087480/6172edb9ac1b0b88ab30f607e93a53de8576c68d.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Shed","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2087480/edd371facd625da28bd47c261292ca00aeda2f40.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Fortress","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2087480/7e14eca10648837dd3b3da7619e4a0f1270aa573.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Pumpkin Kingdom","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2087480/21b91d2fe50acbb954ed68eb38fb33ad936b16c5.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Horses","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2087480/cf07f2880e8c479d082b8d46504dc0806e2834d3.jpg"}],"total":11},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2087480/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714855282","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2087480/page.bg.jpg?t=1714855282","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2087480/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714855282","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2087480/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714855282","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>\u2b50 Recommended for you!</h1><p><br><br></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>A hidden object game where you must find all the bees to complete each level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2>\u204d 1000+ bees<br><br>\u204d 10 unique artworks<br>\u204d Unlimited hints if you get stuck<br>\u204d Restore a small number of bees to a painting so you can find them again! <br>\u204d Additional bee related objects to find<br>\u204d Music and ambiance for each artwork<br>\u204d Achievements<br>\u204d Use your keyboard to move/zoom in if you have no scrollwheel<br>\u204d 3 save slots<br>\u204d Reset progress entirely and play again<br>\u204d Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Context:</h2>The brief was simple.
