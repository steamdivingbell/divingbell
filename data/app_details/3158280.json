{"about_the_game":"A demanding platformer similar to Celeste and VVVVVV. <br />\r\nBetween each challenge, we light up the tone with comedic encounters <br />\r\nwhile we drain the blood of every living being we come across.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOddbat is a platformer that explores a simple mechanic:<br />\r\nWhat if you had infinite jumps?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe concept may seem too simple, or even like an easy game \u2014 I can fly! However, it\u2019s quite the opposite. Oddbat cranks up the challenge with intense platforming obstacles that will push your skills to the limit!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game takes place in a 2D open world where the player is free to explore the entire map and tackle challenges in any order they choose.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInstead of locking progress at the beginning, each area of the map offers different challenges and mechanics that require the player to approach the game in various ways.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main objective is to drain the blood of 7 bosses around the map to complete the ritual of immortality.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe gameplay is simple and accessible: jump, glide, and dive, and provides multiple layers of depth that you'll need to master. Respawns are instant, and the map is filled with plenty of checkpoints, so you won\u2019t have to repeat challenges you've already conquered. All of this helps ease the way as you tackle the increasingly difficult challenges in Oddbat.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother VERY important aspect of Oddbat is the humor and surprise. Throughout the game, there are a ton of crazy and absurd situations, both in the story and in the levels of this world. From funny gags with the vampire's victims to the most unexpected enemies...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnjoy and explore:<br />\r\n- Over 700 unique levels in an open world. Use the map to avoid getting lost or to see which areas you have yet to discover.<br />\r\n576 visible areas and more than 200 hidden ones.<br />\r\n- Several teleporters around the map allow faster travel between distant areas.<br />\r\n- 5 large dungeons scattered across the world<br />\r\n- 7 Challenging Bosses.<br />\r\n- Retro aesthetics with a wide variety of environments.<br />\r\n- Over 100 brutal challenges in the realm of Death; for the bravest players. These challenges are unlocked by sucking the blood of NPCs in the game.<br />\r\n- Fill your home with more than 60 pets that you'll find hidden throughout the world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSuck the blood of peasants, wizards, and kings! You can even suck the blood of those beloved characters from children's fairy tales! If you want to, of course.<br />\r\nIn Oddbat, you can suck the blood of over 300 victims to unlock special challenges.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3158280/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727455744","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3158280/page.bg.jpg?t=1727455744","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3158280/f4d7561d00bdd653c4602fe85e9e380a10ff2502/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727455744","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3158280/f4d7561d00bdd653c4602fe85e9e380a10ff2502/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727455744","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"A demanding platformer similar to Celeste and VVVVVV. <br />\r\nBetween each challenge, we light up the tone with comedic encounters <br />\r\nwhile we drain the blood of every living being we come across.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOddbat is a platformer that explores a simple mechanic:<br />\r\nWhat if you had infinite jumps?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe concept may seem too simple, or even like an easy game \u2014 I can fly!
