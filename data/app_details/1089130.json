{"about_the_game":"<strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Download Quake II RTX</h2></strong>Quake II RTX is fully ray-traced and includes the 3 levels from the original shareware distribution. <br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Description</h2></strong>Shortly after landing on an alien surface, you learn that hundreds of your men have been reduced to just a few.
