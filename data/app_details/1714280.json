{"about_the_game":"'Queen of Zarkov' is an 'indie-3rd-person-shooter' that combines elements of 'Escape from Tarkov' with zombies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou embark on missions and loot everything you can, while surviving against different types of zombies and other deadly threats. All your Equipment will be lost if you die, so you have to choose to play it save or risk everything to get better loot. Use the money you make to upgrade your castle and unlock better gear and new levels, and become the Queen of Zarkov. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay how you want: Choose the location you want to enter (varied difficulties and loot quality) and how much you want to invest and risk in gear for preparation. Stay silent, snipe enemies from a distance with a silenced gun and lure enemies away with a distraction or go in loud with a heavy armor and blast everything. Try to go for one of the mission-keys for valuable loot and risk dying or leave the mission to save what you could get so far.
