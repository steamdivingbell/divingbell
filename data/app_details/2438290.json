Among his routine duties, Gab left his office at the police station and went to meet his wife, Lina, who shares the same profession with him. Lina gave him details about the summary of the incident; They were found in the middle of a murder for which Captain Bergerson was taken into custody.

His colleagues decided to expel Gab from his profession because they thought Lina had been murdered, but they did not have enough evidence.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Gab decided that the only way out was to cooperate with Bergerson and go to the Hanctt continent.
