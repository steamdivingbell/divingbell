Vampire Syndicate offers players the chance to challenge the lineage elders for the right to rule the underworld\u2026 or the player could just make a name for themselves as a professional assassin, (or thief, or even skilled lover, etc). <br><br>Very little is forced on the player, and vampirism is not guaranteed. Even the main storyline is completely optional.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Main Storyline</h2><br>For those who want to be fully immersed, <i>Vampire Syndicate</i> offers a lengthy main storyline that will plumb the depths of MoonFall and reveal the terrible origin of all vampires. <br><br>Additionally, the vampire lineage that the player chooses will alter story events, making each playthrough with a different lineage significantly different.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Crime pays</h2><br>As the name suggests, the player\u2019s main activity in <i>Vampire Syndicate</i> is to conduct criminal activities for their lineage faction. With the exception of a few rules, the player is offered complete freedom in how they go about this, and can take on missions or contracts as they wish.<br><br>Missions (such as heists or raids) take place on the overworld map. Players can encounter a variety of different groups, such as corporate officers with their protection retinue, mercenaries, street-level gangers, rival familiars, etc. Or visit new locations and faction headquarters.<br><br>Encounters can be benign, or they can result in violence. The choice is yours.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A thinking opponent</h2><br><i>Vampire Syndicate</i> does not seek to simulate so-called \u201cliving, breathing\u201d RPG worlds. However, The main villain in the game will be an AI-controlled antagonist, reacting to the player's decisions with a degree of unpredictability. <br><br>This AI opponent is the other main force of agency in the game besides the player. It\u2019s independent actions will change the relationships between factions, the power dynamic in the game world, and have a major impact on the main story.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build your crew</h2><br>Every Familiar needs a crew: a team of violent cutthroats, thieves, hackers and flamboyantly-dressed thugs. You won\u2019t have to look far in the dark underbelly of MoonFall to find them.<br><br>Familiars often have dangerous duties, and they aren\u2019t expected to complete them alone. A crew provides extra muscle for Familiars in combat, but also lends their expertise outside of fighting.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Recruiting and permadeath</h2><br>Followers can be recruited all over MoonFall, in a variety of different classes and with different attributes. Each of the major lineages will also offer a follower class unique to their faction. <br><br>However, unlike the player character, followers can die permanently. If a follower falls in combat, they are dead forever, so be careful how you use them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Loyalty</h2>Followers are eager to help you rise through the ranks of the Uzakh Drucah, but they do not do this for free. Your crew expects to be rewarded aptly for watching your back, and failing to do so could have consequences.<br><br>Each crew member has a loyalty score that\u2019s tied to how you treat them. Abuse and neglect may lead to them turning on you at the most inopportune moment.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Creating Familiars</h2><br>When (or if) the player character becomes a full-fledged vampire, they may request for followers to be elevated to Familiars. Followers who are promoted this way can act independently, undertaking their own missions and generating passive Income and Respect for the player.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Respect</h2><br>In the Uzakh Drucah, Respect is even more valuable than hard currency. Respect is a measure of how the player character is viewed in the dark hierarchy of the vampire lords. <br><br>The higher the Respect, the more options available to a player. Black market shops now open their doors to you, rival gangs begin to fear you, while your allies treat you as an honored guest. <br><br>With a high enough Respect, even a lowly Familiar can command the attention of elder vampires\u2026 or a vampire may seek to usurp power over their lineage.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Morality</h2><br>Make no mistake, as a familiar you are a criminal.

While you may certainly go about this according to your own morals and ethics, do not expect to be ever called a hero.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Adult content</h2><br>Vampires are inherently sexual creatures, and during the course of the game, the player will have ample opportunities for casual sex or pursue long-term romances.
