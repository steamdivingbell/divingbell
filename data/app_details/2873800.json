Challenge different monster bosses with powerful artifacts and weapons. Each battle will be a different and exhilarating experience.<br><br>******* The space bar (handle A) is for invincible roll, the F key (handle RT) is for releasing skills************************<br><br>The game has been adapted for GPD and handheld consoles, and perfectly supports handles. I hope handheld players will also have a good gaming experience.<br><br>Spacebar is used to roll to evade attacks and obstacles. Different weapons have different effects, and when combined with appropriate clothing, players can adapt to different boss encounters according to their needs.
