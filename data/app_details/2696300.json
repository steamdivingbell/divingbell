{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>\u25a0Nambu Line</strong></h2>The Nambu Line is a 35.5 km long line connecting Kawasaki Station in Kawasaki City, Kanagawa Prefecture and Tachikawa Station in Tachikawa City, Tokyo.<br>The predecessor of the Nambu Line was a private railroad company, Nambu Railway, which opened between Kawasaki Station and Noborito Station in 1927 for the purpose of transporting gravel from the Tama River. Later, in 1929, the entire line between Kawasaki and Tachikawa Stations, in its present form, was opened.<br>It is a commuter and school route that intersects with the Chuo Line rapid service radiating from central Tokyo, private railway lines, Yokosuka Line, Tokaido Line, and many other lines, connecting them in a circle, and is used as an important means of access between central Tokyo and the Tama region in the southern northern part of Kanagawa Prefecture.<br>Many electronics manufacturers and IT-related companies are located along the line, and the Musashi-Kosugi Station area is lined with high-rise condominiums as well as natural scenery such as the Tama River. The area is also characterized by many boat and bicycle racetracks and horse racing tracks.<br>In 2011, rapid transit service was restored for the first time in 32 years, and currently the fastest connection from Kawasaki Station to Tachikawa Station is 43 minutes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Highlight</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Farewell to the Tokaido Line/Kawasaki Station - Shitte Station<br>The train runs parallel to the Tokaido Line and the Keihin-Tohoku Line, but makes a sharp right curve and separates from both lines.<br></li><li>Merge with Nambu Branch Line/Kawasaki Station - Shitte Station<br>The line joins the Nambu branch line and runs parallel to it until Shirate Station.<br></li><li>Farewell to the Shitte Short Line / Shitte Station - Yako Station<br>The track parting to the left is a freight line heading toward Shin-Tsurumi.<br></li><li>Detention Line/Shirate Station to Yako Station<br>The first train from Yako Station is resting.

Since the station is located in the Keihin Industrial Zone, it is used as a commuter stop by people commuting to factories along the line. Umi-Shibaura Station, along with Omigawa Station on the Shin-etsu Line and Rikuzen-Otsuka Station on the Senseki Line, is known as a station adjacent to the sea, and the Keihin Canal can be seen from the platform. Also, stray cats live in Ogimachi and Asano Stations and greet passengers as they please. Despite its proximity to the city, the line has a loose atmosphere.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Highlight</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Former Honzan Station/Tsurumi Station - Kokudo Station<br>The platform-like structure where the upper and lower lines are separated is the former Honzan Station.
