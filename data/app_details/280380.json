{"about_the_game":"<strong>Uprising44: The Silent Shadows</strong> combines third-person action play with real-time strategy. It is a unique combination of the two modes of play, and has an in-depth and interesting story-line which has not yet been used in WWII computer games \u2013 the greatest civilian Uprising against Nazi occupying forces \u2013 the Warsaw Uprising. It is a story of the Silent Shadows - forerunners of modern day special forces - paratroopers dropped behind enemy lines to organize resistance and use diversionary tactics in the fight against the forces of the Third Reich. An appropriate audio-visual setting combined with cover system (an excellent, proven method of game play), the story-line, and diverse settings ensure a dynamic and enjoyable game not only for players familiar with this type of theme, but also those merely wanting casual entertainment.<br><br><strong>Action Mode</strong><br><br>Play through an over-the-shoulder perspective gives a sense of reality to small groups of soldiers fighting in the tight confines of a city.

You can take cover, give orders to comrades, fight at close quarters, or at a distance - to get advantage over a superior number of the enemy.<br><br><strong>RTS Mode</strong><br> <br>You lead groups of uprisers that take part in heavy fighting on the streets of Warsaw.
