Gather resources (such as Gold, Wood, Stone, and Fish), construct buildings, and erect walls to strengthen your empire. Choose from different game modes and engage in epic battles against up to 7 bots or challenge your friends to see who comes out on top. With an extensive range of options (similar to a sandbox), the possibilities are endless. Take your strategy to the next level by creating your own unique maps inside the in-game level editor. The game is easy to learn, but with customizable settings, it can also offer a challenging experience. Playable with a mouse &amp; keyboard on one screen or with motion controllers through virtual reality. Choose between different play styles such as turn-based (a player takes his turn, and the rest waits) or real-time (where everyone takes a turn at the same time).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2317010/extras/PericulumGameplayGIF.gif?t=1728213424\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>8 Players (multiplayer)</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can play with up to 7 other online (or local) players or bots.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Choose one of 8 colors and maybe even team up with some friends or bots.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You and your friends can also play on your own custom levels/maps.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2317010/extras/PericulumTimelapseGIF.gif?t=1728213424\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">More than 7 Game Modes to choose from:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Default: Whoever is the last player who owns a hexagonal tile wins the game.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Capture the Flag: Capture enemy flags but don't lose your own flag or you will lose the game.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">King of the Hill: Hold the hexagonal tile in the middle the longest to win.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Economy: Be the first player to collect a chosen amount of resources (decide between Gold, Wood, Stone, or Fish).</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Conquer: The first player to conquer a defined amount of hexagonal tiles wins.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Regicide: Every player starts with a king, which he can move around but if the king is lost, the game will be lost too.
