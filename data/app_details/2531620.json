Gee-kun-soft is at it again with this pack of 16 new characters, 8 women and 8 men all ready to jump onto the battlefield. Have your heroes take orders from a twin-tailed redhead or tall, no-nonsense, man, and battle alongside an experienced old man and a young long-haired prodigy, or have your players choose which character they want to play as!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach character comes with a MZ-style sprite, downed frames, SV battlers, facesets with 8 different emotions, waist-up busts with 8 emotions, and even front view enemies in multiple colors so you could face a whole squad of foes! Battle against a cocky blue-haired man whose coat with epaulets is blowing in the wind and defeat him to force him to join your party, and purchase recovery items from a long-haired brunette who worries about how often your party comes to visit him. Make cutscenes where your hero sits down for meals with other female soldiers and talk about camp secrets, or turn the game into a murder mystery after your hero finds their bearded commanding officer dead in his office! This pack also includes bonus high-resolution images of each character so you can resize them to perfectly fit your game, or include their full body images in a character codex!
