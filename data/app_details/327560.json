{"about_the_game":"After your plane crash-lands in Antarctica, you find yourself stranded and alone at an abandoned research facility in the midst of a deadly blizzard. Plunged into utter darkness, temperatures 100 degrees below zero, and conditions far too harsh to allow for rescue, you must explore Sutro Station and and use the tools at your disposal in hopes of escaping and finding your way home.<br><br>Not a survival game, but instead a game about surviving, Near Death pits you against an incredibly cruel opponent: Antarctica. Never more than a few minutes from freezing to death in the darkness of polar night, you must reclaim the station from the elements and fight for your life in a terrifying environment that\u2019s more like another planet than the world you know.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A fully explorable Antarctic research station with seamless open world navigation over an unforgiving landscape.<br></li><li>Unique gameplay and innovative player tools suited to the harsh realities of a frigid, dark continent.
