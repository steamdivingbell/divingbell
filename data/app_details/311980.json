{"about_the_game":"Isomer is an isometric strategy game inspired by classic turn based games from the 90s and many other more recent survival titles. It's open ended, sandbox and each world is procedurally generated leading to an almost unlimited number of different worlds to explore, mine, loot and conquer. <br />\n<br />\nYou play the role of the commander of an alien force sent to a distant planet tasked with setting up a mining outpost. You land with a dropship and a complement of minions who will mine for resources, build fortifications and blast any unwitting humans who venture too close. Each world has it's own distribution of biomes, resources and enemy facilties staffed with angry defenders keen on evicting you from their planet! <br />\n<br />\nHow long will you survive? What will you find on each world? How large will you build your base and armies?","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"They're not so tough...","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/311980/fc79d13002dbf78cdb473e31f0e8497e886d87b2.jpg"},{"name":"Terraforming","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/311980/823453659b7e5475e8c1e340367b1056fa1e047d.jpg"},{"name":"Harvester ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/311980/211ae458183da197d5134715272133b45557216e.jpg"},{"name":"Watch your step","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/311980/e3d4713a44f69810d373094f72a70431e830272f.jpg"},{"name":"Lights out!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/311980/3b518a2065a389bc178450b32aa33713fe58a943.jpg"},{"name":"Next time try a larger gun","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/311980/8cb49aad1b1efa1108ce5fc9610fa2a9615c7a5e.jpg"},{"name":"All that sparkles","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/311980/2e8f5ae8cf62bbb1be7f435296b1a362332d3e66.jpg"},{"name":"Glug!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/311980/429bca18a459807734fdf09f4fabafa41adf3867.jpg"},{"name":"Grim Business","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/311980/555b6b587dda8d5e5e96ee53a14771fdff98d9ac.jpg"},{"name":"Unexpected bonus","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/311980/9d399d897632c68d5a3af0ba0e15c8331f94a05f.jpg"}],"total":30},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/311980/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1447362545","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/311980/page.bg.jpg?t=1447362545","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/311980/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1447362545","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/311980/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1447362545","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Isomer is an isometric strategy game inspired by classic turn based games from the 90s and many other more recent survival titles.
