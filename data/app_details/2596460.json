{"about_the_game":"A Fool's Art Gallery is a unique, laid back, and relaxing first person exploration video game experience, where you do not kill anyone and no one kills you; built inside the GZDOOM engine. It containes a massive art gallery for you to wander around and enjoy. Designed, built by, and featuring 20 years of work by one lone wolf, pagan Canadian artist, working in the psychedelic, absurdist, surrealist, esoteric, expressionist, abstract, art decor style and genre. Making what feels like his last stand before AI artists take over the entire world, and borne out of frustration with Social Media's censorship, bannings, shadow bannings etc, and a dislike of subscription models. You buy the ticket once, and then have life long access to an ever expanding surrealist experience and to avoid monthly subscriptions based services.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is highly recomended to try the demo first, to know what to expect.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe gallery includes: Three now out of print art books, magic tomes, hundreds of paintings, several short story comics, hundreds of drawings, machine designs, boat builds, increasingly bizarre areas to find, hand animated NPCs, and some atmospheric secrets to find and relax in.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA Fool's Art Gallery is intended as a escapist experience for the player, with no threats to themselves or others present in the game. Wander around, exploring, looking, relaxing, taking in the atmosphere. Hidden secrets abound, and items to be found are tucked away in strange places. This is a game about a Zen like experience that acts as a spa for the players mind. A disconnect from the Hyper Crazed Society around us. There are many spaces for contemplation and reflection, while you endeavour on an escapist experience; inside a living work of art, a map of the subconscious and the occult, a blue print of the cosmos, a reflection of reality; constantly growing, evolving and changing over it's life span; a work of art composed of works of art; built inside the GZDOOM engine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n===========================================================<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou are a flying magical mask who s*!*s stars; be sure to look for secret doors to reveal hidden content as you explore the gallery at large, which contains an insane amount of content to consume. With future updates the contents of the content will be constantly expanded upon. Galleries include 3 self published books, a handful of short story comics, hundreds of paintings, hundreds of pen and ink drawings, hundreds of digital drawings; carvings, masks, boats, alters dedicated to my cat The Amazing Mister Number Eight, and hand animated NPCs, all acting as a map of the psychomagical journey that is a human life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith future new art update roll outs, strange new original NPCs and assets from future game releases by Reflection Frequency will make appearances and be added to A Fool's Art Gallery, keeping the roster fresh and ever expanding, creating a semi cohesive Universe of titles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd finally; being crafted with our Lord and Saviour, the GZDOOM Engine; A Fool's Art Gallery is wide open to modification and custom level designs. with the GZDOOM Engine, you can access the core files, extract the art images themselves, and print them off to your heart's content.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n-4 levels packed to the brim with hundreds of works of art.<br />\r\n-Hundreds of weird paintings.<br />\r\n-Hundreds of strange drawings.<br />\r\n-Hand drawn animation.<br />\r\n-100% original content, all textures, maps, music, NPCs, and other assets are handcrafted by the artist.<br />\r\n-Secret rooms and areas.<br />\r\n-Items to find.<br />\r\n-Content previews of future game releases.<br />\r\n-Possibly a cult?<br />\r\n-Some items to find and pick up that don't actually do anything.<br />\r\n-It's pretty giant.<br />\r\n-Free future updates, forever, or until I die, whichever comes first.<br />\r\n-No game breaking glitches or bugs.
