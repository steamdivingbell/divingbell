{"about_the_game":"<strong>Have you dreamed of what it would be ... to soar like an eagle?</strong><br><br>Aquila Bird Flight Simulator lets you experience soaring bird flight using virtual reality.  It was originally designed for the Oculus Rift, but has now been modified for OpenVR.\u00a0 You embody one of three species of eagle flying over either Northwest Scotland, a part of Colombia, or Graham Island in British Columbia. This is designed as a relaxing soaring flight simulation, and is not arcade-style flight, and as such you can make use of ridge lift and thermals.  If you want a work out try flapping with motion controllers!
