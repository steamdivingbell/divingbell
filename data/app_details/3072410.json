{"about_the_game":"MERIDIAN: A Wellness VR Journey<br><br>MERIDIAN is a 1-hour long VR experience that explores your body, its properties, and limitations. Speed up, slow down, and fly around at any angle that suits you best. It encourages you to look at your body as a network of connections between bones, muscles, and fascia, helping you understand movement patterns and postural habits. Muscles and fascia are linked into muscle chains, or myofascial meridians. These meridians extend from head to toe, connecting different parts of the body. This interconnectedness means that tension or dysfunction in one area can affect distant and sometimes unexpected areas. When you exercise, it\u2019s not just isolated muscles that engage; it\u2019s a complex system where bones, muscles, and connective tissues collaborate.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3072410/extras/\u0421\u043d\u0438\u043c\u043e\u043a_\u044d\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430_2024-07-26_200249.png?t=1739030766\" /><br><br>By exploring these muscle chains in VR, guided by emissive flashes, you\u2019ll gain sensory and visual information about how different muscle groups influence your movement.

It involves more than just the nose and diaphragm. It engages your entire body, including the spine.
