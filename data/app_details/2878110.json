{"about_the_game":"It was just another day for the princess, hunting for food alone in the wilderness. What she didn't know is that her younger brother the prince had secretly followed her. She only realized this when she heard his screams as he was being carried off by a band of trolls.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey were too strong for her, and she had to watch helplessly from a distance as he was taken to their cave in the mountains via a winding route through the Dwarven lands. She was able to track them, but she needs your help to defeat the beasts and bring him back safely. It's only a matter of time before they eat him, so time is of the essence. Can you be the heroes that she needs?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nToward The Ice is a classic first-person party-based dungeon crawler RPG with grid-based movement and turn-based combat. It can be described as a gridder, blobber, and a DRPG where you navigate mazes fighting monsters, avoiding or disarming traps, and solving puzzles to reach the next area. Build your party of six from any combination of ten character classes and explore more than a dozen maps, gathering items and equipment along the way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nToward The Ice is a standalone sequel to Into The Inferno, Navigating The Labyrinth, and Crossing The Sands and you do not need to play the previous games to enjoy this one completely.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2878110/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729606522","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2878110/page.bg.jpg?t=1729606522","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2878110/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729606522","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2878110/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729606522","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"It was just another day for the princess, hunting for food alone in the wilderness.
