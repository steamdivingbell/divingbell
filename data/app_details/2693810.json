{"about_the_game":"Remember the days when games were simple to learn and really fun to play? Experience pure joy as you blow up your enemies in real-time with phasers and torpedoes. Watch those enemy ships blow to pieces and their bits fly across your screen. Check the view screen for the status of your Starbases, open up the Galaxy Map and see if enemies are nearby, spend some time jumping to different sectors and explore anomalies, or just jump to the unknown. Each time you jump to a new sector the game will auto save (provided there are no enemies in the sector) so you can re-play should something go wrong.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGalaxy Trek lets you choose between seven levels of difficulty but the game play does not change.  The enemies will not be any stronger and your ship won\u2019t be any weaker, so what you learn at lower levels you can continue to use at the higher levels. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGalaxy Trek was designed to let you focus on the fun, without worrying about the details. As long as your hull remains intact, everything will function. Starbases are not necessary to obtain victory, but they are needed to repair your hull, so you might want to keep one around.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGalaxy Trek is the game for anyone who is looking for that fun and uncomplicated gaming experience. It\u2019s a real-time strategy game, perfectly combined with a bit of Sci-Fi and a lot of exciting action. Featuring fun graphics, high-quality music, great sound effects, and easy-to-learn controls, it is a game that will keep you hooked for hours with no two games ever being the same.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2693810?t=1704122874","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2693810/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1704122874","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2693810/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1704122874","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2693810/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1704122874","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Remember the days when games were simple to learn and really fun to play?
