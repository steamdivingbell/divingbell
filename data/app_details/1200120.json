You can save up to two paint schemes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are more than 50 in game achievements, try to collect them all!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArmorgeddon is bringing the concept of a classic turn based hex board game into 3D life.  Mythopia Studios is committed to making a fun, re-playable experience that is challenging and enjoyable.   Armorgeddon was originally based on a paper and pencil turn based game.  The idea blossomed into a hex board game, but we wanted to take that concept one step further and bring it to life in 3D.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1200120/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1667339657","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1200120/page.bg.jpg?t=1667339657","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1200120/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1667339657","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1200120/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1667339657","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Test your skills and strategies as an armor commander in levels where the starting units change, landscapes are treacherous, and the enemy is tough in the war torn future that is Armorgeddon.
