{"about_the_game":"In Sovereign Reign, dive into a richly layered universe where you assume the role of a humble peasant chosen by the divine voice of a God. Your objective? To carve out a thriving kingdom in a hostile land, including the need to confront barbarians that threaten the peace.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe power of divine speeches becomes your tool to inspire and recruit loyal villagers and for shaping the land's fate, affecting various interactable objects and guiding the actions of the populace.  Lead them in constructing essential edifices, from the foundational castle to resource-generating structures like woodcutters and hunters. These divine will favors serve as both a currency for action and a form of health - a loss of these favors coupled with damage spells doom for your sovereign rule and the realm's fate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBarbarians, an ever-looming threat, must be managed. Their increasing numbers and resource-looting tendencies pose a significant risk. Monitor their growth and prevent their dominance over the lands you've toiled to cultivate. With every action, your subjects amass divine will essence, which they channel through prayers, converting them into favours that fuel your abilities and sustain the realm.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaps auto-generate, offering varied landscapes and challenges, from tightly condensed territories to sprawling domains. Your strategic choices have lasting consequences, affecting your ability to handle threats or allowing time to fortify your realm. Combat uses a nuanced tag system, determining unit allegiances, enabling potential alliances or conflicts between sovereigns, barbarians, and even between barbarian factions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis immersive world extends to multiplayer, where diverse modes pit players in free-for-all battles, collaborative efforts against barbarian threats, and united front battles against waves of enemies. Embrace different multiplayer modes, each offering a distinct experience within this elaborate world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSovereign Reign is a multifaceted adventure, merging divine guidance and strategic decision-making. Dive in and shape your destiny in this dynamic and challenging realm.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2661140/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1699692710","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2661140/page.bg.jpg?t=1699692710","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2661140/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1699692710","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2661140/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1699692710","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In Sovereign Reign, dive into a richly layered universe where you assume the role of a humble peasant chosen by the divine voice of a God.
