{"about_the_game":"The RDF-LT designation stands for Rapid Deployment Force Light Tank. Several prototypes were built for the U.S. armed forces evaluations with various guns. It was, however, never mass-produced and the project was terminated in 1985. <br />\r\nIn Armored Warfare, the RDF/LT is a Tier 6 Light Tank. It was originally offered as a part of the Collector\u2019s Edition, but it also exists as a part of the Claw vehicle edition, featuring unique camouflage. The variant modeled in the game is the vehicle armed with the 76mm M32 gun as it was the closest the RDF/LT came to mass production. Its gun is quite accurate, fires fast and has a lot of penetration, but these advantages are compensated by the low damage per shot value. It is also quite fast and accelerates well but isn\u2019t perhaps as nimble as other Light Tanks of its Tier.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/825650/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1688640292","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/825650/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1688640292","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/825650/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1688640292","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/825650/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1688640292","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Turn Notifications","id":32}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The RDF-LT designation stands for Rapid Deployment Force Light Tank.
