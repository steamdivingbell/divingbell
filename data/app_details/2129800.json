He's got pristine fashion sense, a &quot;unique&quot; sense of humor and he's an all around great guy. You'll get pretty familiar with him over the course of the game and may even learn of unexpected stuff about the guy, if you know where to look.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Totally Epic Features</h2><strong>The Down Dash - </strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2129800/extras/creepoGif_improved.gif?t=1718727830\" /><br>Got a massive mouth demon chasing you?

Well no matter which of those situations you find yourself in, Rectangle Guy's signature down dash ability will be able to help you out.<br><br><strong>Challenging Bosses - </strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2129800/extras/mayorGif.gif?t=1718727830\" /><br>In addition to regular platforming levels, Rectangle Guy also features some challenging boss fights. During these, we use our innovative Fire Panel\u2122 technology to take down foes. And don't worry, there's no stupid random elements during these.
