Now, you\u2019re the star in an epic music journey that's all your own.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LOOK TO THE STARS</h2>With over 100 songs and a growing library, Starri offers a wide range of genres from rhythm game Indie favorites (such as conflict, c.s.q.n, destr0yer), Global Billboard Top Hits that have over a billion listens (Poker Face, Believer, Chandelier and the like), and many hot hits from the Asian and Mandarin scene (Gira gira, Don't don't). You\u2019ll find your rhythm to the songs that move you, and discover new artists along the way. The game includes 41 songs already.
