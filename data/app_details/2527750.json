{"about_the_game":"A former school project completely remade two years later by a bored 17 year old.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDisgraced, a lone knight searches for revenge in a land ruled by bandits and corrupt knights. Fight through an unforgiving world filled with dangers and secrets. Die over and over again until your spirit is broken. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFulfill your lost oath, face your failures, avenge your master.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a 2D side scroller platformer with both Souls-like and Rogue-like elements. You must keep fighting through the world until you reach your goal. If you die, you must start over.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can acquire randomized upgrades by defeating bosses or finding secret areas. You can also offer the lost souls you gather from killing enemies to the shrine of gods in order to upgrade your health, stamina, or damage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn battle, you have three defensive tools at your disposal. Block, backstep, and roll. You can block weaker attacks to leave an opening, you can back away from stronger ones, and roll past enemies while cornered.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Bandit Slayer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2527750/f425f1c88182db32540f1ca73404fcba8bd66478.jpg"},{"name":"Ronin Slayer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2527750/b3bb0cffdcb6fc0644119fde79751c26021316fe.jpg"},{"name":"Rogue Slayer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2527750/f30fd81f17e83c032f4afd9e3f439adcb93deba4.jpg"},{"name":"King Slayer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2527750/ffcd83c306860ce4dcac85613382c84dc31936c3.jpg"},{"name":"The Oath was not Lost","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2527750/04a4f7120bf0a44a16229d2f22686e98898c5ed7.jpg"},{"name":"Doppelganger ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2527750/78130f92f76ba1b70f233d48bf77c200aeab1a03.jpg"},{"name":"The Dark Knight","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2527750/7e76fb448dc824f1bfa91379444428a44db6111d.jpg"},{"name":"Sorocide","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2527750/c8ee2dc7cbbffcdfbe3d363d38723d41115b0932.jpg"},{"name":"The Caves","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2527750/a23b16d800d4880ce93452e1d46ee7bfd65c9099.jpg"},{"name":"Explorer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2527750/182433fe93aa514bc079cad98bfc95a7020bd9ca.jpg"}],"total":12},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2527750/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1700827361","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2527750/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1700827361","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2527750/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1700827361","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2527750/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1700827361","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A former school project completely remade two years later by a bored 17 year old.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDisgraced, a lone knight searches for revenge in a land ruled by bandits and corrupt knights.
