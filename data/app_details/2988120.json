Your best chance is to stand your ground and fight.<br><strong>Bloater:</strong> Approach with caution. This medium-speed menace will explode upon death, releasing a toxic cloud that can be lethal. Long-range weapons are advised, as melee attacks are a death wish.<br><strong>Brute:</strong> The ultimate behemoth.
