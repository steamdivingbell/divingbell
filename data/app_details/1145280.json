{"about_the_game":"Hockey at it's simplest form. Maybe too simple.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQuickly dive into a game of hockey with 2 skaters and a goalie on each side. You'll have to pass, shoot, and hit your way to victory even it that means taking out the ref. Plug in more controllers and have a Blockey party with your friends as you can work together or take each other on. And if you're ever lost in life you can even try our &quot;Ask the Bear&quot; mode.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game was originally made in 2010 for the Xbox 360 indie marketplace. It was my first ever project which put me down the path of software development.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1145280/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1569594879","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1145280/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1569594879","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1145280/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1569594879","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1145280/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1569594879","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Hockey at it's simplest form.
