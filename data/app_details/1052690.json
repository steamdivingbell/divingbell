Either method comes with several poses, allowing you to create the ultimate compositions in each room. And if you feel like it\u2019s time for a change, you can freely remove, replace and reposition your trophies.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1052690/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732104733","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1052690/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1732104733","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1052690/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732104733","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1052690/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732104733","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1052690/extras/CoTW_TL_steam_capsules_Description_image_616x257.jpg?t=1732104733\" /><br>Every experienced hunter ends up amassing a sizable trophy collection that deserves to be presented in an appropriate fashion.
