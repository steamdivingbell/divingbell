{"about_the_game":"Concrete And Steel is a 3D sandbox for creative people to build structures using a huge range of objects and materials. Experience unlimited creativity with huge environments, rich customisation, co-operative multiplayer, modding support and more! The only limit is your imagination!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDive straight into limitless creativity, either alone or with friends or strangers. Concrete And Steel gives you a blank canvas, an intuitive set of tools, and a diverse range of structural and decorative objects - the rest is up to you!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur clever engineers have created a amazing tool bag of powerful tools to help you build your next creation. Create free-form blocks, spawn props, paint stuff, and then wire it all together to make your structures come to life. Everything is built onto a fine 10cm grid, giving you the ability to create detailed structures that align perfectly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNo need to build alone - take your sandbox online with multiplayer to build with friends. Server admins get powerful tools such as password protected building, or entirely private servers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWant to take it a step further? Create and share custom objects and paints with our Modding SDK, which integrates with freely available and cross platform software to empower you to put your ideas and dreams into Concrete And Steel's creative environment. Mods are supported in Multiplayer, too!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConcrete And Steel is perfect for creative build geeks. It's for the players who enjoy the experience of creating their own world, and players who love the satisfaction of standing back and admiring their creation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat will you build?","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/444830?t=1572454702","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/444830/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1572454702","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/444830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1572454702","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/444830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1572454702","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Concrete And Steel is a 3D sandbox for creative people to build structures using a huge range of objects and materials.
