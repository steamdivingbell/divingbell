{"about_the_game":"This demo is a short look at Xenos. For the full details please view the main store page! If you are looking for a retro pet battler with some tongue and cheek humor and simple to grasp mechanics, then this demo is for you! Xenos is all about collecting monsters and finding your favorite strategy. Combat is intuitive but strategic. Having to leverage MP use every turn. You can use small attacks to save up for a big final blow, or you can spend every point of MP each turn to apply constant pressure. Combat is welcoming to all but will challenge you at key points. Stats and movepools are semi random which gives you all the more reason to collect, but can also make difficulty variable at times. If a battle gives you trouble, there are no level caps in any area. You will always have the tools to move forward. In the demo you play as a young creature catcher named Reece going on a journey to find his father.
