Now, Earth's greatest corporate titans have been invited to build companies to support it. The competition to dominate the market is fierce in this fast-paced economic RTS from Civilization IV lead Designer, Soren Johnson.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Venture to Mars to Earn Your Fortune</strong></h2>With space travel becoming a reality and the easy-to-reach resources on Earth dwindling, hopeful people seeking their fortune are rushing to the next great frontier: Mars. Rekindle humanity\u2019s adventurous spirit by leaving Earth behind and make a new name for yourself as a titan of industry on the red planet.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Discover the Origin of the Major Martian Businesses</strong></h2>Determine the fate of the Martian colonization effort in the dynamic single-player campaign mode. Multiple types of CEOs, each with unique traits and abilities, deliver many hours of discovery into their motivations and how they intend to dominate the future of Mars.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Experience New Adventure in Multiplayer</strong></h2>Turn your friends into frenemies! With a robust and exciting multiplayer mode that can support up to eight players, no two games of Offworld Trading Company are the same! The market fluctuates depending on which of the four starting corporations you and your opponents choose and what resources you accumulate. Strategy is key, and tenuous alliances between rivals are easily broken when the opportunity arises.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Control the Market before your Competition Controls You</strong></h2>In Offworld Trading Company, market forces are your weapons, not guns or bombs. The real-time player driven market is your sword and your shield here. In order to win, you will need to make tough choices on what resources to acquire, what goods to build and sell, how to interact with the planet's thriving underworld, and what stocks to acquire and when.

All of these unique elements gives Offworld a truly otherworldly tone.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Expand your Business to Io in the Included Jupiter\u2019s Forge Expansion</strong></h2>If you thought turning a profit on Mars was tough, just wait until you land on Jupiter\u2019s volcanic moon, Io. With resources that deplete over time creating fierce competition, you will have to adapt to the new environment faster than your opponents do in order to survive. Life support is so strenuous on Io that Mars will look like a paradise in comparison!<br><br><br>If community competition is your thing, you can fight for a spot on the leaderboards in the 1000 Map Challenge. Jupiter\u2019s Forge has its own campaign and features several new maps based on Jupiter\u2019s moon, Io. The expansion contained 2 additional factions, patents, resources, and much more.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Business Building Seminar","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/271240/8c385c3af4c472d52af85161f4634b63a85c3894.jpg"},{"name":"Corporations Are People","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/271240/8c385c3af4c472d52af85161f4634b63a85c3894.jpg"},{"name":"Make It Work","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/271240/8c385c3af4c472d52af85161f4634b63a85c3894.jpg"},{"name":"Better Living Through Chemistry","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/271240/8c385c3af4c472d52af85161f4634b63a85c3894.jpg"},{"name":"The Power Within","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/271240/8c385c3af4c472d52af85161f4634b63a85c3894.jpg"},{"name":"Daily Win","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/271240/8c385c3af4c472d52af85161f4634b63a85c3894.jpg"},{"name":"Ranked Attempt (1v1)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/271240/8c385c3af4c472d52af85161f4634b63a85c3894.jpg"},{"name":"Ranked Win (1v1)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/271240/8c385c3af4c472d52af85161f4634b63a85c3894.jpg"},{"name":"Skirmish Win (Manager)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/271240/8c385c3af4c472d52af85161f4634b63a85c3894.jpg"},{"name":"Skirmish Win (Executive)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/271240/8c385c3af4c472d52af85161f4634b63a85c3894.jpg"}],"total":255},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/271240?t=1733506460","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/271240/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1733506460","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/271240/6507400abfe6af3dbcc68b2311d6828a82b0eba6/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733506460","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/271240/6507400abfe6af3dbcc68b2311d6828a82b0eba6/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733506460","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/271240/extras/MOW-otc_steampg.png?t=1733506460\" /><br>Mars has been colonized.
