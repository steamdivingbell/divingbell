{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>ZIRQUITZ</strong> is a unique fusion of logic puzzles, idle strategy, and incremental growth, offering a deeply engaging yet relaxing experience. Build, optimize, and expand your circuits in a dynamic world of interconnected nodes.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Node-Based Circuit Building:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Create intricate networks of Producers, Transformers, and Converters. Each node plays a critical role in generating and processing data (bits, bytes, words...) into &quot;Work&quot;, the game\u2019s primary resource.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Pull-Based Logic System:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A challenging yet intuitive system where inputs actively and automatically request data from connected outputs, introducing opportunities for optimization and creative problem-solving to avoid buffer overflows and underflows.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Wide Variety of Nodes:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Experiment with 25+ node types, including logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, etc.), data processors and converters, and specialized nodes implementing your own custom logic, each with unique behaviors and mechanics.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dynamic Upgrades:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Upgrade your nodes to unlock faster production, more efficient processing, and powerful synergies.
