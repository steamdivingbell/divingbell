{"about_the_game":"&quot; <strong> </strong>  <h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Mechanical Monsters</h2>  <strong> Mighty and Malevolent Machines!</strong>  <br> Mechanical Monsters features over 140 incredible creatures for 5E born from mad sciencists and magitech, clockworks and cybernetics. Sci-fi elements have been a part of the RPG landscape from its earliest days, infusing fantasy with elements of future tech from far realms beyond the stars, ancient empires with lost technology, or curious artificers and alchemists working together to blend science and sorcery. Mechanical Monsters delivers an incredible collection of these creatures for your campaign! <br> Within these pages, you'll find over awesome adversaries and gear-driven goliaths from low-level mecha-minions like walking eye robots, rust-risen undead, and ferrofluid oozes to titanic annihilator robots, magnetoclusters, heavy metal elementals, and clockwork leviathans! You'll find creatures from across the spectrum of technological advancement, from primitive ironrot lichen to sorcerous soulbound shells, gear-punk steamwerks golems and sinister cranial dissectibots, to advanced android assassins and nanite storms. Mechanical creatures also are not limited to the mortal realms of the Material Plane, as you'll find technocurious fey like the asteray and epokasite fixer, fiends like the composite alorbidaemon and endbringer devil, and living spirit-machines like the tsukumogami and more than half a dozen inevitables. <br> Whether you run a classic fantasy 5E campaign and just want to add in new options for tinkers and artificers to create or you have a conclave of technomages devising synthetic servants and soldiers, a fallen starship unleashing rogue AI and cybernetic assimilation, or even a touch of pure sci-fi, you'll find a wealth of incredible options to enhance your campaign.
