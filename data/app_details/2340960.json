Puzzle Game in a peaceful futuristic setting, that features a variety of Puzzles that utilize Lasers and the behavior of light and it's colors to create challenging problems to solve.<br><br>Use proven and some new gameplay mechanics to puzzle your way through the game's beautiful world, which is now filled with even more puzzles than in previous games.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\"

more than 50 Puzzles that make use of newly introduced features and old ones alike, to keep the gears in your head turning.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New and improved gameplay elements:</h2>The &quot;Evolved&quot; branch of the ReThink Series always had the most features, this game is no different.<br><br><br>It comes with almost every feature known from the previous 4 games, often improves them and then adds some new things on top.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2340960/extras/StoreDecoration_3.png?t=1725027641\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Less linear progress:</h2>Unlike previous games, in ReThink | Evolved 5 you are often more free to go where you want within an area, letting you decide which path you want to take, what puzzles to solve first.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Improved Levels:</h2>ReThink | Evolved 5 comes with the largest Levels of any of the ReThink games, as was requested by Feedback in the past, therefore reducing level transitions to a minimum while conveying a sense of scale and place.<br><br><br>What you see, is what you get: If you see a Puzzle that you can not access yet, you will eventually get there, as is normal for the ReThink games.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Overall improved features:</h2>While the game does not reinvent the wheel, it improves the gameplay and usability through a variety of changes and additions.<br><br><br>Many of these changes are aimed at giving players a greater tolerance when handling cubes and solving puzzles, improving the overall feeling of the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Improved Graphics:</h2>Thanks to Unreal Engine 5, ReThink | Evolved 5 looks better than the previous games, while still running &quot;as usual&quot; on older systems when the new graphics are disabled. <br><br><br>Fully dynamic Global Illumination makes the simplistic style of the game shine, while not limiting player actions or Puzzles like previous lighting methods would have.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Additional Soundtrack:</h2>Players wanted one, now they got one. <br><br>There is now a choice between the games original Soundtrack, and the new one introduced with ReThink 4.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Getting
