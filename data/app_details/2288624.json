{"about_the_game":"Explore the U-Bahn Hamburg U1 from Just Trains, a bustling rapid transit line set in the heart of Germany\u2019s vibrant city.<br><br>First opened in December 1914, the U-Bahn Hamburg U1 has a rich history and is one of the oldest lines in the city. Authentically recreated here in full for Train Simulator this cutting-edge transport system stretches over 55 kilometres. Starting in the north at Norderstedt Mitte. The line runs south into the city centre at Jungfernstieg, onto Hauptbahnhof S\u00fcd and then heads north-east out of town to Volksdorf where it divides into two branches, the left one leading to Ohlstedt and the right to Gro\u00dfhansdorf. With 47 stations along its route the U1 serves as a lifeline for daily commuters, tourists, and residents alike.<br><br>On this route you take control of the HHA Type DT5 EMU. Introduced in 2012 to completely renew the existing rolling stock. The Type DT5 is the first U-Bahn train in Hamburg with air-conditioning and which allows passengers to move between carriages. Rebuilt in detail for this route the locomotive features a fully operational onboard computer, manual door controls, video transmissions from platform cameras, authentic sounds and automatic announcements spoken by Ingrid Metz-Neun.<br><br>Alongside the conntrollable DT5 you can enjoy spotting AI controlled vehicles on the route. Look out for the DT4, DT3N, Class 474, AKN Class VTA diesel train, AL2 battery locomotive, and even a plane heading into Hamburg Airport as you near Fuhlsb\u00fcttel Nord station.<br><br>Take a tour of Hamburg visiting residential neighbourhoods, wealthy districts and busy downtown areas as you deliver passengers to their destinations. The U-Bahn Hamburg U1 is your gateway to German urban exploration.<br><br>If you like this route, make sure you also check out the Frankfurt U-Bahn, also available separately on the Steam Store from Just Trains.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2><br>A selection of engaging Standard, Free Roam and Quick Drive scenarios are included:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> U1 Fuhlsbuettel Nord to Farmsen<br></li><li> U1 Farmsen to Ohlsdorf<br></li><li> U1 Norderstedt Mitte to Grosshansdorf<br></li><li> U1 Ohlstedt to Norderstedt Mitte<br></li><li> U1 Norderstedt Mitte to Ohlstedt<br></li><li> U1 Grosshansdorf to Norderstedt Mitte<br></li><li> Free roam: Ochsenzoll<br></li><li> Free roam: Farmsen<br></li><li> Quick Drive U1 FA to GH-OT<br></li><li> Quick Drive U1 GH-OT to FA<br></li><li> Quick Drive U1 GH-OT to NO<br></li><li> Quick Drive U1 NO to GH-OT<br><br>More scenarios are available on the Steam Workshop online and in-game.
