{"about_the_game":"Note1 (N1) was the first A.I. created by Dr. Anderson, a scientist at the US National Space Agency. However, Note1 was infected by a virus and its entire programming changed. Note1 referred to humanity, taking many hostages to the order of solar system X, a system created by him and his army with the aim of exterminating planet earth and establishing a new nova where humans are truly superior and humans are slaves. . Even Ana, daughter of Dr. Anderson, was taken hostage by Note1.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith that, Dr. Anderson created Note2 (N2) the second A.I. in an attempt to stop Note1, defeating his army and find Ana from the 11 planets created in the solar system X. Note must save Ana alive. He was created for this, to save her.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlong the way, Note2 will encounter Note1's army that will try in every way to stop him on his mission.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nControl Robot Note2 in this saga to find Ana. In the game you will use various jump commands, double jump, Flash (Dash), jump with dash, and shoot, against the evil Note1 and his army. In the stages you encountered several were marked by Note1. In this game you'll test your skills in time, space and reflexes on each obstacle posed by Note 1. In addition, you'll face moments of inverse gravity, floating platforms, powerful lasers. And you will still pilot Note2 as a Ship in phase 10. It is worth remembering that Note1 has imprisoned many human beings besides Ana, free them.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1928310/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1662129337","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1928310/page.bg.jpg?t=1662129337","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1928310/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1662129337","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1928310/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1662129337","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Note1 (N1) was the first A.I. created by Dr. Anderson, a scientist at the US National Space Agency.
