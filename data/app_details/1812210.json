{"about_the_game":"In Simpler Times, you step into the shoes of Taina as she prepares to move out of her childhood home and begin the next chapter of her life. Relive her memories and learn how she grew into the creative, expressive person she has become. This is a contemplative, cozy experience. There is no score, no timer, no combat, no failing, and no anxiety. Just vibes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">4 Seasons, 4 Records</h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1812210/extras/1-4_Seasons_4_Records-_ST_SeasonsView_630x231.gif?t=1721157495\" /><br><br>Simpler Times takes place in Taina\u2019s childhood bedroom.
