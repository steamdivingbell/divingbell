{"about_the_game":"Unbreakable is the first DLC of Doom &amp; Destiny Worlds. It includes a new set of Weapons and Armors blueprints, as well as the much requested Unbreakable Mode. Starting a new game with the mode enabled will turn off weapon/armor wear while applying some simple balancing changes. It will also disable the loss of equipment when being defeated (bag content still needs to be recovered).","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1541960/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1630570048","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1541960/page.bg.jpg?t=1630570048","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1541960/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1630570048","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1541960/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1630570048","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Unbreakable is the first DLC of Doom &amp; Destiny Worlds.
