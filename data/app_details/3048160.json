{"about_the_game":"Your mission is to protect the Xenocrystals as you go through alien territory.  Use energy to teleport in your towers to defend the Xenocrystals.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hundreds Of Upgrades</h2><br>At the end of each stage, you can select upgrades that will stay with you through your mission.  There's no purchasing on the towers - once you research that technology, it's yours.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3048160/extras/ExampleUpgrades.png?t=1739931135\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Orbital Strikes</h2><br>You can call down Orbital Strikes to target specific areas.  Be careful though - as they have to recharge.  But you can use energy to use them before they fully recharge on their own.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Different towers and Damage Types</h2><br>Ten different types of towers - long-range/short-range, AOE or single target, shoot slowly or quickly.  You choose your arsenal.  There are also five types of damage - physical, fire, frost, poison, and lightning - with different effects.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Energy Management</h2><br>Energy is used to teleport in your towers, or recharge your orbital abilities quickly.  But between waves of enemies, you will gain energy proportional to how much energy you currently have and how quickly you've cleared the wave.  Plan well and you may be able to use extra energy at the end of the level to get more upgrades or restore crystals.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">True Roguelike</h2><br>No meta-progress.  You will have access to all units, abilities, and upgrades from the start.  Learning how to use them and what the enemies are doing is another story however.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Boss Battles</h2><br>Bosses aren't just damage sponges and have unique abilities or characteristics that separate them from their underlings.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3048160?t=1739931135","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3048160?t=1739931135","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3048160/9c01a24338194ee8bfc3a292dc953df003583987/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739931135","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3048160/9c01a24338194ee8bfc3a292dc953df003583987/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739931135","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3141470,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Your mission is to protect the Xenocrystals as you go through alien territory.
