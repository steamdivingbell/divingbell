I've loved RPGs since the early 1980s, and grew up playing games like Lord British's 'Ultima' series and early Roguelikes. This is my love-letter to a style of gaming that has largely fallen out of fashion: with its vivid, bright sprites overlaid on stark black backgrounds, true open-world gameplay, and lack of handholding. The days I spent playing these games were spent in joyful exploration and discovery, venturing into the dark unknown, a co-author of the experience, filling in the gaps left by the primitive art with my imagination. For those of you who did the same, I hope Moonring recaptures some of the spirit of those days for you. For those who did not, I hope that the more modern conveniences you find in this game allow you to catch a glimpse of what we did 40 years ago.<br><br>My heartfelt thanks to all who spared even a moment to play this. Please be kind to my mistakes. I will fix them. :-)<br><br>- Dene","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2373630/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738113823","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2373630/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1738113823","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2373630/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738113823","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2373630/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738113823","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>A <i>free</i> game by the co-creator of the XBox's Fable series.</strong><br><br>Five hundred years ago, the land of Caldera was plunged into endless darkness.
