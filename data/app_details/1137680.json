Blessed with a huge set of ears, Blender can fly, climb, use sonar and swat enemies with his signature spin move.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThroughout his quest, Blender will call on the Mini Bros. for help. These diminutive helpers grant special abilities ranging from recovering health to lighting dark areas. Mini Bros. are indispensable to exploring the 21 levels on seven hostile planets. Finding all 20 Mini Bros. will likely be the goal of many players.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExploration dominates the game play but eight boss battles break up the action. From the underground base of Shelltarl to the lush jungle of Diva, each world is designed to offer a unique challenge.
