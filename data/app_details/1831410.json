{"about_the_game":"Poly Vita is a thought-provoking isometric puzzle game with turn-based elements, that takes you on a journey through various worlds. The game is about a lost wanderer named Maya, who has been stuck inside her dreams for a long time in search of the missing fragments of her soul. Throughout the game, you will help Maya restore the pieces of her soul, allowing her to finally awaken. If you love challenging puzzle games then Poly Vita is a game for you! At the same time, the games relaxing atmosphere with no timers means you can take your time to solve each puzzle. <br><br><strong>Gameplay</strong><br><br>The gameplay consists of picking up and placing tiles one by one, in available spaces, to form pathways for Maya to walk on. A pathway must connect the tile Maya is standing on to a walkable node. Once a valid pathway is made, Maya will be able to walk to the connected node. In each level, you will need to get Maya to collect each of her soul fragments. Once they're collected, the light in her home will turn on, allowing you to complete the level. Build a final pathway home and the level will be complete! <br><br>As the game progresses, you will need carefully plan out complex pathways while avoiding dangerous obstacles. Certain gameplay elements are turn-based, such as Spiders, that move one tile over every time Maya makes a move, blocking certain pathways. Enjoy the increasingly difficult level progression of Poly Vita, and see if you can solve all of the 30 lovingly crafted puzzles. <br><br><br><strong>Can you solve all of Poly Vita's challenges and help Maya awaken?</strong><br><br>\u25c6 30 Beautifully Designed Levels<br>\u25c6 Mind-Bending Puzzles<br>\u25c6 Unique Puzzle Mechanics <br>\u25c6 Original Soundtrack<br>\u25c6 A Game Crafted With Love By 1 Person","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"The Journey Begins","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1831410/273a6cf50f79cdebf8178b9d1bf29bfd6b504649.jpg"},{"name":"Well Pathed","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1831410/f614ad9f4eba1eb64f52554dd243338ebff8c116.jpg"},{"name":"Traveller","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1831410/1048669bab075973520518a186972ec8ff3f0c7b.jpg"},{"name":"Spikey","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1831410/5d1b9722afcfdb295c23586b4dde4453306ed708.jpg"},{"name":"Spike Patrol","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1831410/4fcb61800d29659f16f178906c2921db078bec63.jpg"},{"name":"Awakening","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1831410/e3f3b6491020aab0ca51f76579fe77975a9f44f2.jpg"},{"name":"Path Pro V","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1831410/d8cb28bf85aca7f9cf8ab7a450fd4937430ea564.jpg"},{"name":"Path Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1831410/e77ff0be2cb95567a85ada1b3ebbbaff0a2a5cf6.jpg"},{"name":"Path Pro I","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1831410/7d156217681c7e843673ae1edaf448c3e5a08eb0.jpg"},{"name":"Path Pro II","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1831410/c7d422cf7cf98b4123c86e3aed66ca9014f7c598.jpg"}],"total":14},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1831410/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728090806","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1831410/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1728090806","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1831410/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728090806","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1831410/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728090806","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Poly Vita is a thought-provoking isometric puzzle game with turn-based elements, that takes you on a journey through various worlds.
