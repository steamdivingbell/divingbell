Effectively eliminating both you and potentially your opponent. <br><br>Take careful aim as missing your opponent will still kill you and even worse <strong>YOU'LL LOSE POINTS!</strong><br><br>A more thoughtful approach is the key to your success. This is not your typical run and gun gameplay, this is First Person Shooter, the game where you shoot yourself first!<br><br>The only strategy is taking the other guy with you faster than he can do the same to you. This mechanic is used to augment and breath fresh life into old ideas. Capture the flag is a completely different game when you can't defend yourself without dying and your teammates defending you can only take one shot before they're expended. <br><br>In traditional game modes, such as Free-for-All and team deathmatch, players accrue points by taking someone with them otherwise they lose a point in they only kill themselves.
