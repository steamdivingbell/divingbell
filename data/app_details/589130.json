{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Mythic Monsters: Bugs</strong></h2><br>Mythic Monsters: Bugs brings you over twenty incredible insects and amazing arthropods from CR 2 to 21, ranging from swarms of tiny terrors to titans of chitin, presenting mythic bugs suitable for every level. You will find familiar favorites like giant ants, mantises, scorpions, spiders, and wasps, as well as army ant swarms, centipede swarms, spider swarms, and wasp swarms, each with unique traits and mythic abilities that set them apart from more mundane myriapods. You will also find a wide variety of monstrous bug beasts, from titanic real-world arthropods like the colossal black scorpion and deadly mantis to fantastical creatures like the acid-spewing ankheg, the crafty cave fisher, and the icy-hot remorhaz. Not all monstrous bugs are dim-witted monstrosities, however, you will also find a variety of highly intelligent insectoids and their crawling kin like the shapeshifting aranea, the fleshwarped drider, the ghostly phase spider, and the mighty formian queen and her formian warrior minions. As if these were not enough, we also bring you eight fabulous feats perfect for mindless mythic monsters, with a special eye toward aiding insectoid enemies of epic proportions!<br><br>The Mythic Monsters series from Legendary Games brings you dynamic and exciting mechanics alongside evocative and cinematic new abilities that really help creatures live up to their flavor text, whether they are creatures of real-world myth and legend or creatures born out of the RPG tradition itself. These creatures can work just as well in a non-mythic campaign as they do in one that incorporates the full mythic rules, as you can throw them at your jaded players who think they\u2019ve seen it all or know the standard monster stats as well as you do. That look of surprise and \u201cWhat was THAT?\u201d will warm any GM\u2019s heart.<br><br>Released on January 31, 2017. Designed for Fantasy Grounds version 3.2.2 and higher.<br><br><strong>Requires:</strong> A Fantasy Grounds full or ultimate license or an active subscription and the included Pathfinder ruleset (3.5E Compatible).","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/589130/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1485974166","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/589130/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1485974166","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/589130/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1485974166","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/589130/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1485974166","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Mythic Monsters: Bugs</strong></h2><br>Mythic Monsters: Bugs brings you over twenty incredible insects and amazing arthropods from CR 2 to 21, ranging from swarms of tiny terrors to titans of chitin, presenting mythic bugs suitable for every level.
