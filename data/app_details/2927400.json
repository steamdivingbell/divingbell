Each choice spins a new thread in your tale, with every decision impacting your journey and the fate of those you meet.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nManage scarce resources, face moral dilemmas, and build or dismantle relationships as you explore the remnants of a world where technology and nature have become indistinguishably entwined.
