{"about_the_game":"There is real science happening here. <i>You</i> are helping materials scientists at Brigham Young University find out how materials work at <i>almost</i> atomic levels! Your contributions here matter, and are helping to publish real scientific data to the world!<br><br>Follow the story as the world is struggling against a new ice age, trying to survive sub-zero temperatures while energy sources are running out. Reggie feels this personally as his family struggles to find heating for their home, in spite of creating incredible new inventions. What Reggie doesn't realize is that this invention holds the key to solving many of the problems the city is facing!
