People would joyfully work and get together when the evening comes. The king of the land, Arkhan, would march his army in the city to help his people feel at peace and get along with each other. Mush, even though it was a beautiful country, had some people with evil thoughts. The Silva Family, living in the side overlooking the woods, was innocuous and simple, focused on living a happy life. Silva and Anna were not in love until a child came into their lives. The couple, who fell in love after having a child called Geoffry, were not aware of the danger they might face in the future. <br>Sorcerers were improving their technique of sorcery to steal people\u2019s goods; hence, slowly deserving Arkhan\u2019s wraith. The number of stolen goods, missing children and enslaved people were increasing every passing day. Wishing to put an end to this situation, Arkhan banned sorcery in his kingdom. With the ban, no one dared to do sorcery, and the ones who did were instantly thrown into a huge fire. Silva promised to his grandfather that he was not going to do sorcery, but he was going to educate his child to make sure he grows up in safe hands and can defend against the darkened troubles awaiting his country. <br>The most feared sorcery was going to change the fate of the human race, but they did not know that. Silva was a grand sorcerer, and he got married to Anna with a small ceremony to continue his bloodline. Even though Silva was a white sorcerer, people would act like he was the center of many troubles, such as dark sorcery. But Silva would want to lend a hand to the people to help solve their problems. One of the notable people of the city, Anton, not only would advocate for Silva\u2019s capability to hurt people but also, he would do anything to get Silva and his family slaughtered. His only wish was to keep sorcery out of the city and return to living a normal life. <br>Geoffry, just when he was 12, started to realize his talents; he was slowly trying them out. His tries carried good intentions, but people watching him were terrified. Anton, while watching Geoffry, saw what he could have done. Even though his first pathetic thought was to kill the king and take control of the country, he had already started to plan how to convey that thought to the people. He gathered many men of the country telling them that they were in danger and in urgent need to get rid of this family. People, seeing Anton this excited for the first time, started to believe in him and were already prepared to do whatever was necessary.<br>After one month, Anton gathered a small team and decided to raid Silva\u2019s house at night. Their aim was, of course, to kill Silva, Anna and Geoffry. By killing them, they were going to be able to preserve the future of the Mush Kingdom. At dawn, they started to move towards Silva\u2019s house; they were not coming back without slaughtering the family. They marched towards the house. When seeing people coming close to his house with lanterns, Silva understood everything and took his family through the back door to keep them safe. While watching his family go, he wanted to calm the others. <br>He came to the front door to calm them down, but he couldn\u2019t. Anton cut Silva\u2019s neck with a scythe. Silva was laying down in a pool of blood. Anna and Geoffry, while running towards the depth of the woods, had realized a horseman was coming towards them. While Geoffry was running in front of her, Anna stayed back and let the horseman catch her. While horseman was trying to learn where the boy ran to, Anna, as if she swore not to talk, was trembling and crying out of fear. After putting a dagger into her heart, the horseman got back on his horse to follow Geoffry. <br>But Geoffry had already gotten close to the house of a master sorcerer, named Salvador. Since Salvador was one of the biggest volunteers that serve Arkhan, no one would dare to get close to him or threaten him. Seeing the lights of Salvador\u2019s house, Geoffry wanted to run towards it. Maybe someone living in that house would help him and save him from this dire situation. When reaching the house, Geoffry quickly started to bang on the door. Opening the door, Salvador understood that the little boy he was seeing had run away from a very dangerous situation. He took him inside and tried to calm him down. <br>By the time it was morning, Geoffry was calm and hopeful that her mother would find him. Salvador was aware of the situation, so, he promised himself to keep him here and train him. Growing up under his unmatched skills, Geoffry was now 21 years old and in that point of life where it\u2019s unstoppable. His skills of sorcery had improved to a point where he could destroy 100 enemy soldiers by himself. Salvador taught every technique to him and greatly contributed to his development. <br>Salvador taught everything he could to Geoffry; he was even unsettled by him since he became even stronger than him. With this much of information and education, even learning how to talk to a dragon, Geoffry decided to go deep into the woods since he had never seen a dragon before. Salvador told him that he needed to go deep into the woods and be careful of Arkhan\u2019s soldier while teaching him how to talk to a dragon. Geoffry, after a couple of hours of dragon search, had found a greenhead, mutant dragon. Saying that he was not going to hurt it while approaching, he was afraid. Geoffry, almost befriending the dragon after a couple of minutes, heard a noise ahead. These noises were coming from Arkhan\u2019s soldiers, and they were looking for the greenhead dragon. Coming across with Geoffry, soldiers aimed their guns at him and asked him to surrender. Surrendering to the soldiers, Geoffry was being taken to face Arkhan. Sitting in his garden unaware, Arkhan saw his soldiers coming in and one of them whispered to him, \u201cMy King, we caught a sorcerer. He was talking to the dragon, asking him to be obedient.\u201d Hearing this, Arkhan flinched and asked them to bring the child right away. Geoffry was in a state of fear while approaching the king, but life was just beginning for him. Arkhan was going to use him against his enemies and, if needed, ask help from him to extend his soil. Approaching the king unaware, Geoffry was sweating. He thought Arkhan was the man who wanted his parents dead. But he was wrong. Truth was to be revealed and, in the future, many victories of Arkhan and Geoffry were to reach prosperity.<br>Arkhan was trying to soothe Geoffry, who was sweating bullets, and telling him that he wasn\u2019t going to hurt him. He was telling him that he needed him, and he was going to be a really important officer for the country in the future. Geoffry was listening to him in excitement and fear, trying to understand what was happening. After telling him everything, Arkhan convinced Geoffry to stay with him. After some time, he started his training. After scientific education with private tutors, he wanted to move into military training. But the only one who could give military training to him was Arkhan.<br>Arkhan started to train Geoffry right away. He, himself, taught him about the history of the country and clearly understood he was going to be a very important officer for the country. Five years into the future, Geoffry had become one of the most important officers of the country. He had become an ambassador working for his country and king. From then on, everything was more beautiful and meaningful for him. He was an officer and a talented sorcerer. He was going to use his talents and ambition for his country and king. was a beautiful kingdom in the middle of the woods. People would joyfully work and get together when the evening comes.
