In single-player mode, you can switch between characters to solve puzzles and navigate levels. In co-op mode, you and a friend can control two characters simultaneously, requiring even more coordination and teamwork to overcome challenges. The game supports both local co-op and steam play together, allowing you to team up with friends no matter where they are.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3253880/extras/themed_header.png?t=1730324182\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Navigate through five distinct environments, each introducing new themed mechanics which will push your problem-solving skills to the limit.
