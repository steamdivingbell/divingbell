It\u2019s aesthetically beautiful and visually intriguing, and its engagement with surrealism and existential horror is both romantic and wryly self-aware. Anyone with a penchant for the gothic or for escape rooms may find something compelling in Dinner With An Owl, and be left wanting more.\u201d<br>Sufficiently Human<br><br>\u201cThe music especially serves to create a very eerie atmosphere. From the piano music, you hear when first starting the game, to the somber background music that plays over the course of the entire game.\u201d<br>Keengamer<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1567420/ss_3f5b0ec1fe876741a3e4f84f2e87954d7720a7c0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1717669306","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1567420/ss_3f5b0ec1fe876741a3e4f84f2e87954d7720a7c0.600x338.jpg?t=1717669306"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1567420/ss_b36960993b250b24283488703532410d4a8d6960.1920x1080.jpg?t=1717669306","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1567420/ss_b36960993b250b24283488703532410d4a8d6960.600x338.jpg?t=1717669306"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1567420/ss_2c0b44fc0aba17379b008b96218178efde69c967.1920x1080.jpg?t=1717669306","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1567420/ss_2c0b44fc0aba17379b008b96218178efde69c967.600x338.jpg?t=1717669306"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1567420/ss_fca2c06b0b7045db1a610a5bafea478bd16048ed.1920x1080.jpg?t=1717669306","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1567420/ss_fca2c06b0b7045db1a610a5bafea478bd16048ed.600x338.jpg?t=1717669306"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1567420/ss_2a8d19bb895910fabd8b968f472848cfc1e8e86e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1717669306","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1567420/ss_2a8d19bb895910fabd8b968f472848cfc1e8e86e.600x338.jpg?t=1717669306"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1567420/ss_da3e97ffa9d021f5b345bee77130bb882fe8b923.1920x1080.jpg?t=1717669306","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1567420/ss_da3e97ffa9d021f5b345bee77130bb882fe8b923.600x338.jpg?t=1717669306"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1567420/ss_8957cccdb3e8961431417aec409134ffe0f5be14.1920x1080.jpg?t=1717669306","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1567420/ss_8957cccdb3e8961431417aec409134ffe0f5be14.600x338.jpg?t=1717669306"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1567420/ss_ff05ec96e57b7646de43dc2685a454c00b11fb98.1920x1080.jpg?t=1717669306","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1567420/ss_ff05ec96e57b7646de43dc2685a454c00b11fb98.600x338.jpg?t=1717669306"}],"short_description":"Break the puzzling spell of your eccentric host!
