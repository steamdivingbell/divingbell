{"about_the_game":"<strong>In My Shadow</strong> takes you on an emotional journey through the mind of Bella in pursuit of reconciliation with her past. The game features 4 rooms with a total of more than 50 puzzles to solve. Each room offers a different glimpse into her memories, exploring the changing relationships in her family. The shadows within each level must be manipulated via objects to progress and there is often more than one solution to a challenge. <br><br>In My Shadow is more than a cleverly designed puzzle platformer; it is a heart-warming story into the mind of a young woman looking for answers to questions in her past. Her childhood memories come to life as shadows on the wall of her house, and you must use those shadows to solve unique puzzles and help Bella try to let go of her past.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>WHERE THERE'S A SHADOW, THERE'S A WAY</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1406200/extras/Hook.gif?t=1637842084\" /><br>The gameplay revolves around a unique core mechanic - the shadows.
