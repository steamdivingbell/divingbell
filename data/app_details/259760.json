It\u2019s a slow burn that\u2019s going to take a long time for you to fully digest, but if you like game soundtracks, I\u2019d be hard pressed to offer you a better one. Full of original content, and drawing from the most memorable games of previous generations, it will give other composers something to aim for when they score their companies next title.\u201d<br>KBMOD<br><br>\u201cTwo Brothers is a wonderful retro-inspired game with an interesting concept and solid core gameplay underneath it all so it isn\u2019t just another love letter to the past that offers nothing else but nostalgia.\u201d<br>Gamecepticon<br><br>\u201cBetween the great story, amazing music, and fascinating world, I\u2019d definitely recommend players to check out Two Brothers.
