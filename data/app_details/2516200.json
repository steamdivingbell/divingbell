{"about_the_game":"<strong>Umbra Description</strong> <br>King Eulith's domain: the kingdom of a fallen monarch who became overcome by the enticing darkness that plagues the land. With elements of fantasy, intricate storytelling, and a sprawling 2D world coming to the full release, there is no end to the possibilities of what adventurers can discover, battle, or in some cases, run for their life from...<br><br><strong>Story:</strong> <br>Umbra begins with the voice of the old king, Eulith, speaking to the player. The &quot;Zoetic&quot; (special term for the player) can be seen being enticed to enter the sprawling mountain, seeking some fallen king buried from his original heights on the mountain peak to deep within the mountain itself. As the player pursues this illusive voice of the king, many things began to seem out of place, as well as the player's health slowly declining from the tole of some abnormal glitching-- It seems the Zoetic doesn't belong in this digital cage Eulith has surrounded the player within. Without spoiling the intricate story beats, one thing can be said: beware of going too far into the mountain, as you may be sucked in, unable to escape... at least not entirely as yourself.<br><br><strong>Gameplay Elements:</strong><br>Though highly story focused, Umbra doesn't spare the potential to have engaging fights with boss enemies, as the player receives a taste of within the demo. Offered is a 3 level scope of the game, with 4 varieties of enemies (many more to come and currently in the works), and a boss battle to end things. Puzzles are also a feature to encourage both exploration and story progression (simple currently, though many more also being implemented).<br><br>Please enjoy this snippet of the game!
