{"about_the_game":"In Miska, you play as a woman returning to an Australian National Park that she used to visit with her family. The Park has fallen into disarray; you will spend the game picking up rubbish, restoring the Park to its former glory. Once restored, flowers will bloom and native Australian animals will come out to play. As you hike up the National Park, reconnect with the environment and the memories she shared with her sister throughout the years.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore Mt Miska</h2>Hike up the mountain and explore the surrounding areas to uncover plants and wildlife. Mt Miska captures different environments found in Victoria within a unique art style. As you explore, clean up the environment and animals may come out of hiding to play with you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Relax</h2>Throughout the park, there are plenty of rest stops for you to sit and relax on. Take a moment to pause and enjoy the scenery while you listen to beautifully composed music.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Capture New Memories</h2>As you return to each point of memory found within your childhood photos, capture new photos along the way as you discover new plants and furry friends.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Collectibles</h2>Along the way, you'll find little trinkets to keep in your campervan. Use your favourite ones to decorate your campervan.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1766940/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1658381183","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1766940/page.bg.jpg?t=1658381183","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1766940/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1658381183","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1766940/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1658381183","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In Miska, you play as a woman returning to an Australian National Park that she used to visit with her family.
