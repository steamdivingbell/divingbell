You know how puzzles have pieces? Well, an action is basically a piece of the puzzle (your command/event). There are over 250 actions in BMD (and you can get community-made ones from workshop too), meaning it's more than capable to do about anything if you can use basic logic.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Still not sure what an action is? Watch the trailer! This is the default action, &quot;Send Message&quot;:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2592170/extras/electron_sRWxrr1h9o.png?t=1740528444\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Support / Community*</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Since nobody's using steam community forums, we have a hybrid support/chatting server -\u00a0.gg/n9PWrxFQFF, off-topic's welcome!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Support threads are generally answered within a few hours, but this depends on the time of day.

You can find components in the send message action.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">It can also: use quickDB, manipulate images, edit messages, store/get data, use logic to jump/skip/call actions, log messages, DM users and a lot more (if you have questions about the featureset or if you can do achieve something with BMD, you can always create a support thread in our community) \ud83d\udc96</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What's so special about this app?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">ActionPalette - universal search for almost everything in-app.<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2592170/extras/electron_UtYIE1r3K7.gif?t=1740528444\" /></p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Steam Cloud (backups) support</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2592170/extras/electron_0t2UV66ThY.png?t=1740528444\" /></p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Aliases (for text commands)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Permissions &amp; Permission Rejection Scenarios (for any kind of command)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Parameter Autocompletion</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Customizable Default Command Type (pick between Text/Slash/Message/User Commands)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Expandable/Collapsible Actions/Command Pane</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A project manager (so you can quickly switch to another project)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Workshop</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Automations</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Heavy duty maintenance / development</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Customizable &amp; Themable</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">I want to sell a bot made with this</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We're not gonna stop you!
