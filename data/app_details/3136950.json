Kotori Mori, a plucky new magical girl, hopes to find a job in one of the famous guilds of Larimar City.

She\u2019s strong, sometimes reckless, and has deep ambitions that drive her every move.  Her low defense and her susceptibility to being stunned make her a bit squishy, but keep her well protected and her high attack and crit stats will give your team the firepower it needs.<br><br>Genteel, at times to the point of being stiff, Kaida is the most put together of the Songbird members.  With heavy defense and very high status resist, she\u2019s a tank, but also hits like a wet noodle.  More complex magical abilities will need to be used sparingly, but her ability to quickly heal stamina makes her a good long-game character.<br><br>Brie is quiet and mellow, but not necessarily shy, just laid back. As the guild\u2019s primary healer, he\u2019s very important in the field, so make sure to protect him! While a pretty tanky character, he is weak to burns.<br><br>Gigi is a nerd on many topics, including history, magic, and technology. Once she starts talking about a subject she\u2019s interested in, it\u2019s hard to get her to stop. She has heavy burn resist, but low defense and is very weak to poison.<br><br>And last but not least, Ai is Kaida's crazy older sister. Gifted with incredible magical power, but lacking the same power of foresight, Ai hits harder than anyone with crazy status effects to boot. Just try not to damage your own team too much in the process.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3136950/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1723695036","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3136950/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1723695036","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3136950/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1723695036","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3136950/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1723695036","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3136950/extras/gayming__1___1___1_.png?t=1723695036\" /><br>Kotori has longed to be a magical girl for most of her life.
