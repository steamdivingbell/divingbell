{"about_the_game":"Add a tech-filled lab for your heroes to call home and deadly factories where AIs slowly take over the internet with the CyberCity R&amp;D Tiles pack! PVGames continues their CyberCity series with another tileset, this time offering more than 2,500 tiles to turn rooms and hallways into a busy research and development laboratory. Build spaces for your heroes to upgrade their weapons and armor at tables filled with tools, medical rooms with healing tanks and high-tech hospital beds for injured party members, shoddily built factories in warehouses that are building killer robots, and more with this pack!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach tile comes in 8 directions to make building your perfect parallax map even easier, so you can put workstations against every wall in a room even if there are diagonal walls and make it so that a room filled with the same type of boxes won\u2019t feel like a box was just copy-pasted over and over. Turn a grimy room into a tactical base of operations with wires criss-crossing the floor and large monitors displaying info next to bulky computers that are lit up with floodlights, or create a villain\u2019s base that\u2019s full of pieces of androids scattered carelessly around and handwritten notes that reveal the canisters on shelves hold a neurotoxin that will enslave every human in the city if your heroes don\u2019t stop it!
