{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Develop your own transport network in different regions and cities: open new routes, buy and upgrade new planes, and increase airport capacity!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1372530/extras/passengers_eng.png?t=1734980576\" /> </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game features an advanced passenger flow system, and all the cities are real with a realistic population. The bigger the population, the more people want to fly. Each passenger has their own destination and they'll fly with layovers if there aren't any direct routes. You won't have enough money to connect every city to all the other cities, so you'll have to analyze the situation and make decisions about where your next transport hub will be. Just like planes, airports also have their maximum capacity. You'll lose if even one of them gets overloaded. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1372530/extras/early_cut_EN.gif?t=1734980576\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1372530/extras/world_eng.png?t=1734980576\" /> </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Almost 200 territories and tens of thousands of cities all around the globe are available! You can build an airport in any city and start transporting passengers. Different locations mean that you'll have to adapt: while in Europe distances are small and it's easy to manage your network, you'll have to think about connecting cities further away because the longer the route, the more you'll have to pay to open it. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1372530/extras/late_cut_EN.gif?t=1734980576\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1372530/extras/game_modes_eng.png?t=1734980576\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Discover the World Mode, you need to unlock every territory in the world (each territory costs in-game money to unlock) and cover the whole planet with your network.

For example, to survive for a certain period or earn a specific amount of money. Each challenge is unique: in some of them you'll have to connect constantly unlocking airports, and in others rebuild your network due to coronavirus outbreaks.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Also, there are daily scenarios.
