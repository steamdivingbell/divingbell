Ayato Sound Create has crafted 25 BGMs to help you find the perfect tracks for a variety of scenes! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo get your players excited to play right from the get-go, why not pick one of the energetic tunes as your title screen music? When those songs pop up again during battles or scenes, your players will know something important is going on!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith a variety of instruments used, you can easily give different parts of your cities their own tracks to put your players in the right mindset for where they are. An upbeat bass and guitar would be great for an outdoor market or port, while a quirky electronic song is perfect for an underground bar.
