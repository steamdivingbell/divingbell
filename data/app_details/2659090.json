{"about_the_game":"In terms of tactical characteristics, the La-5F was an evolutionary improvement of the La-5 on the way to the La-5FN. There weren't enough FN engines to power all the fighters produced until 1944, so the mass production of the La-5F was inevitable through 1943 with continued improvements here and there.<br><br>Gradually, the initial shock of the industry's evacuation to the East was overcome - while in 1942 many of the factories still had shortcomings, workers had to work in hastily built hangars that for a time didn't even have a roof, supply chains had to be rebuilt from scratch, and most resources were in short supply, the quality of production naturally took a back seat to quantity. As working conditions and resources improved, production standards gradually rose, resulting in, among other things, better aircraft: La-5s produced in summer-autumn 1943 became about 150 kg lighter.<br><br>The small design changes added up. For example, the elevator became slightly larger at the expense of the horizontal stabilizer surface. 3 fuel tanks were installed instead of 5 as on the FN - carrying less fuel (465 instead of 539 liters) was considered a good trade-off for saving the weight of the tanks and the fuel, as many pilots preferred to take less fuel anyway. While there weren't enough FN engines to go around, the M-82F engine became the norm. All this meant that the 1943 La-5F was a more dynamic aircraft than an early La-5.<br><br>The biggest improvement from the pilot's point of view was the new bubble top canopy with emergency jettison (even our La-5FN series didn't yet have emergency jettison). This eliminated one of their biggest fears, not being able to bail out of a burning aircraft, which caused many to fly with open cockpits, which severely limited the speed of their aircraft. Now they could put that fear to rest and enjoy the improved field of vision - the main reason why bubble top variants became the norm in all air forces later in the war, despite the increased drag they had compared to older canopy designs.<br><br>To sum up, the La-5F in the sim is a bit more agile than the older La-5, turns a bit better than even the FN, offers a better field of view, and is slower than the FN in level flight and climb because of the more powerful engine of the latter. With a cockpit modeled for today's standards, it is a nice addition for the second half of the 1943 timeframe.<br><br>In addition to Quick Mission Builder, Advanced Quick Mission Generator and Multiplayer modes, you can fly it in Career mode during Battle of Kuban (32nd GIAP received them on July 5th, 1943).<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Default armament: two 20mm guns &quot;ShVAK&quot;, 170 rounds, 800 rounds per minute, nose mounted<br></li><li>Length: 8.67 m<br></li><li>Wingspan: 9.8 m <br></li><li>Wing surface: 17.5 m\u00b2</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Loadouts</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Custom ammo loadout (AP or HE ammo only instead of mixed).<br></li><li>Two 50kg General Purpose Bombs FAB-50sv (120 kg weight increase with racks, 20 km/h speed loss before drop, 12 km/h after drop).<br></li><li>Two 104 kg General Purpose Bombs FAB-100M (228 kg weight increase with racks, 27 km/h speed loss before drop, 12 km/h after drop).<br></li><li>Rear view mirror (1 kg weight increase).<br></li><li>Landing light for night flights (2 kg weight increase).<br></li><li>RPK-10 fixed loop radio compass for navigation with radio beacons (10 kg weight increase).</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Paint Schemes</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Early bicolor camo pattern used until August 1943 (green-black up and light blue bottom, tactical numbers are customizable).<br></li><li><strong>Alexey Maresyev</strong>, Hero of the Soviet Union, 63rd GIAP, Kursk Salient, 1943.
