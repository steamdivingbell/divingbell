Your plan is simple: kill the baddies, get the girl(s), head back home. At least, it <i>was</i> simple\u2026 until you became immortal.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Here\u2019s the catch with immortality: every time you die, Zero loses a piece of his memory. Soon, it won\u2019t just be your keys you\u2019re misplacing.

Every panel represents a new area, scene, or dialogue. You\u2019ll jump between panels, smash through borders, and search for secrets hidden in the margins.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is a comic book world in the literal sense, too. Each hit drains you of color until you\u2019re nothing but a sketch. Here, ink is the difference between life and death.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>A unique mix of genres</strong>:<strong> beat \u2018em up/metroidvania/roguelike  based on comics which we call \u201cCOMIXVANIA\u201d</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Just one thing: don\u2019t expect it to be easy. You\u2019ll need grit (and maybe a map) to make it through.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>FROM ZERO TO HERO</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Comix Zero is designed as an RPG, allowing you to tailor Zero\u2019s abilities and equipment to match your playstyle. Drink consumables from the precious bodily fluids of defeated bosses (gross). Craft powerful items and new weapons (not gross). Talk to NPCs to get quests and rewards (it varies).\u00a0</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>FIGHT, DIE, REPEAT</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">New gear helps, but it\u2019s your skill that counts. Comix Zero\u2019s combat takes its cue from games like <strong>beat \u2018em up</strong>, rewarding precision over button-mashing. You\u2019ll probably try to button-mash your way out of it anyway, so get ready to die. What were you trying to prove anyway?</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>DON\u2019T YOU FORGET ABOUT ME</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The narrative of Comix Zero is intertwined with gameplay. Each time you die, Zero loses a piece of his memory, slowly forgetting parts of his life. As memories slip away, characters start responding to Zero differently, leading to unexpected twists and altering the game\u2019s ending.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A BRUTAL WORLD MEETS ITS SAVIOR</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Comix Zero, ancient myths collide with humanity\u2019s penchant for war crimes. Each faction has its own motivations and alliances, and you\u2019re caught right in the middle. This is a place where spells are created from human blood painted on human skin (detached from a human). It\u2019s not exactly a vacation spot.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A HERO WHO CAN\u2019T TAKE ANYTHING SERIOUSLY\u00a0</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Comix Zero\u2019s narrative is filled with nuanced characters, political intrigue, morally gray choices, and real trauma. And then you had to go and make an absolute joke out of it. Are you proud of yourself?</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">YOU UNDERSTOOD THIS REFERENCE</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The villain who pulled our hero into the world of Comix Zero is obsessed with Earth's mythology and pop culture. Keep an eye out for nods to everything from Greek gods to movie quotes and anime characters scattered throughout the game. Who knew gods had such sticky fingers?</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3149550/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736368146","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3149550/page.bg.jpg?t=1736368146","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3149550/e3d07b823a357edc76fa77dd2072bfc18c2087d1/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736368146","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3149550/e3d07b823a357edc76fa77dd2072bfc18c2087d1/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736368146","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Comix Zero contains graphic scenes of cruelty and violence."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3149550/extras/beach30fps.gif?t=1736368146\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Waking up in a fantasy world was a blast\u2026 Up until you found out it\u2019s run by slavers as pleasant as butt cactus.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You\u2019re Zero, a slacker from Earth with a knack for bad jokes, questionable hygiene, and (somehow) saving the world.
