{"about_the_game":"Moki wakes up in a strange environment. The only memory: their own name. A peaceful world... or is it?! Join Moki in a challenging 2.5D jump &amp; run platformer with many puzzles. Meet lovable and sometimes oddball characters and experience a unique and emotional story.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">&quot;Streak&quot;</h2>Moki has a very special ability: &quot;streaking&quot; (short-range teleportation). Even through organic matter like wood or plants, Moki can &quot;streak&quot; and thus solve puzzles and enter places that other beings are hardly able to reach.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore</h2>Explore a diverse game world and find out what this seemingly peaceful environment is really all about. Is there perhaps more behind the visible facade? Why are you here in the first place? Why do you only remember your own name &quot;Moki&quot; and who the hell are all these other strange creatures you meet on your journey? Explore and find out!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Collect</h2>Find treasures, items and boosters in the game world. Some of them will help you progress, others will give you special abilities, and still others will just make you happy when you find them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Push through</h2>Moki doesn't have strong muscles and doesn't like to hurt anyone. But sometimes you'll get into difficult situations. Help Moki overcome it. There are often puzzles to solve but also one or another adversary that might stand in Moki's way.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Info about the development</h2>MOKI - The Escape is the first game development of studio VAMPIRE - Digital Media (Software House Markus Hermann). Only two people are involved in the project. An indispensable part of the atmosphere of MOKI - The Escape is the fantastic music produced by Jakob Wiersch, the artist who exclusively composes and creates the soundtrack for the game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2270360/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1686308954","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2270360/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1686308954","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2270360/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1686308954","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2270360/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1686308954","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":2301390,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Moki wakes up in a strange environment.
