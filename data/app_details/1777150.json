It features a fluid, impulse-based turns, squad-level, and individual heroics, plus lots of armor and special rules to bring the fight for the city of Stalingrad. From the first drive to cut off the city along the north bank of the Volga to the brutal and close-in street to street and room to room fighting that raged across the city. Fighting in the Dzerzhinsky Tractor Works Factory and on the slopes of Mamayev Kurgan. Fighting in the Red October Factory complex and at Pavlovs House as well as the German attempt to capture the main ferry landings are covered. New equipment is introduced to both sides as the Maxim Machinegun and the ROKS-3 flamethrower are added to the Soviet arsenal. The Germans receive shipments of MG42 Machineguns and the StuH 42 join the battle. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1777150/extras/Enemy_Break3.jpg?t=1654122096\" /><br>New Module Specific rules are introduced such as Severe Rubble terrain, Snipers are allowed to reposition to take advantage of the unique Sniper engagements that were so common in Stalingrad.
