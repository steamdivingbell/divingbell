{"about_the_game":"Featuring a classic pair of characters,<strong> &quot;Ketchup and Mayonnaise&quot;</strong> is an action RPG of ever-increasing stakes. Feast your eyes on cute art, eye-catching gameplay, and battles that keep on coming at a raging pace.<br><br><strong>Ketchup and Mayonnaise</strong> are settling in for a nice day off, when out of the blue a giant capsule crashes behind their house. Upon rushing to the scene, they find a girl who's lost her memory. Who could say no when she implores them to help her find where she belongs... But who knew that such chaotic and weird battles with wacky enemies would follow, not to mention such a grand adventure?!<br><br><strong>Game Features</strong><br><br><strong>6 different weapons for a range of thrilling attacks!</strong><br>The six weapons that Ketchup and Mayonnaise obtain during their quest have different abilities for use in different situations. You can enhance their efficiency by using particular techniques, such as rapid-tapping to activate a &quot;firestorm of fists&quot;, entering commands to activate an &quot;electric shock blitz&quot;, and tapping buttons in the right rhythm (like in a rhythm game!) to activate &quot;rocket hammer blow&quot;. You can also activate duo techniques by using both characters at once.<br><br><strong>Every battle is an unpredictable mess!</strong><br>Each enemy battle is a mini game. You'll need a wide variety of techniques to beat your opponents, not just attacks. For instance, you'll need to dodge bullets, shoot objects, and block at exactly the right time to avoid incurring damage.<br><br><strong>If you would like to purchase this game, please note:</strong><br>This game is currently only available in Japanese.<br>However, we plan to provide updates to also make it available in English and Chinese (traditional and simplified).<br>A keyboard is required to play this game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1753270/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1657110209","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1753270/page.bg.jpg?t=1657110209","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1753270/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1657110209","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1753270/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1657110209","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":1894330,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Featuring a classic pair of characters,<strong> &quot;Ketchup and Mayonnaise&quot;</strong> is an action RPG of ever-increasing stakes.
