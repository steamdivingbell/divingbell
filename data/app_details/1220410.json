The narrative method is inspired by the stream of consciousness which simulates the human thoughts' flow, in order to aim for an emotional truth.<br></li><li>Unique setting - The game is set in southern Italy, an amazing place with a dark folklore. The story unfolds through 5 levels set in real locations, characterized by specific vegetation. The environments are filled with hidden stimuli which are going to help the player to unlock new story nodes.<br></li><li>A complex story - Sea of Leaves story is a mix of mystery and drama. The disappearance is the pivot of an entire community's life, which will emerge from time to time in the form of thoughts and memories.<br></li><li>Replayability - Inspired by ergodic literature, Sea of Leaves story is semi-randomized and doesn't follow a unique path. Each branch will have multiple possibilities: once you choose yours you can only go with the flow. Sea of Leaves is about the journey, not the ending.
