Your primary responsibility is to strategically position your mercenaries before the combat begins, taking into account their strengths, weaknesses, and the nature of the enemies you will face. While the concept might seem straightforward at first glance, the true challenge lies in the meticulous planning required. Success in battle is heavily dependent on your ability to anticipate the enemy's moves and place your units in the most advantageous positions.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You will encounter a diverse array of opponents, each bringing their own unique threats to the battlefield. Some enemies prefer close-quarter combat, engaging your troops in direct confrontations, while others are skilled at attacking from a distance, forcing you to think carefully about your defensive arrangements. Additionally, you'll face enemies with special abilities that can turn the tide of battle. For instance, some adversaries will explode upon nearing your soldiers, dealing significant damage, while others possess healing powers, potentially prolonging the battle. There are even foes capable of summoning reinforcements, creating new enemies that will further challenge your tactical prowess.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you progress, the intensity of the battles will escalate, requiring you to continuously refine your strategies and adapt to the evolving threats.
