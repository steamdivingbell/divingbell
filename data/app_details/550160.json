{"about_the_game":"Street Champ puts you into the world of high-speed cars and endless lanes. Try to carefully cross the road by avoiding rapidly moving vehicles in order to get the highest score. The game is already available to purchase on Oculus Store for Oculus Rift and Gear VR and has been steadily growing an audience among gamers as well as VR review websites. All you need is a gear headset a simple tap to start your journey and go straight ahead.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Unpredictable</strong></h2>Traffic speed and car number on lanes are randomized, so Street Champ requires you to always keep an eye out and pay attention. Cars also come from random directions so please pay attention.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Dynamic</strong></h2>Harder than it seems? No worries! Everytime you fail an attempt you start right back again in a new level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Endless running</strong></h2>It stops when you stop (or a car stops you). Challenge your friends to play and see who lasts the longest.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Global leaderboards</strong></h2>Train yourself long enough and you can get on the global leaderboards with the best players. And when you feel you have the hang on it, try keeping the button pressed for even faster speed.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Great Sounds and Graphics</strong></h2>Street Champ brings bright and colourful scenery combined with realistic traffic sounds to increase user experience and give a jolt in adrenaline levels. Makes you a lot more worried about that school bus coming you way, doesn\u2019t it?<br><br>Think it\u2019s easy? Don\u2019t forget to look left and right!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/550160/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1508867228","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/550160/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1508867228","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/550160/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1508867228","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/550160/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1508867228","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Street Champ puts you into the world of high-speed cars and endless lanes.
