{"about_the_game":"This game is a detective adventure game, made by a former Japanese private detective. <br />\r\nHello everyone! My name is Yusima, a former Japanese detective. Being a detective in Japan is relatively easy. There is no exam and there are no strict trials you must go through. There is no strict approval process also. Detectives are very much like ordinary people. They don't have any special authority for investigations per say. So for example, when a detective ask someone about something or they ask for a survey or when they are on a stakeout, they may be mistaken as a stalker or suspicious person. This means they might be reported to the police. Since this is the case, Japanese detectives should be quick on their feet and should be able to lie and make good excuses on the spot. <br />\r\nI was originally a good person who was very bad at lying, but during my detective work over the past 10 years, I had become a good liar and deceiver. This is a detective adventure game made by someone who is good at deceiving people. <br />\r\nI hope you are challenged by this game! The price is also very cheap, it is very affordable for even small children. However the target audience is Adults.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMain character<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEtuko Goto <br />\r\nAn unmarried mother with two children.
