But, even such menial tasks can hold may dangers of a big city for one not used to its streets.  Scammers, beggars and delinquents lurk around every corner waiting for unsuspecting targets. <br><br>Make friends and enemies in this twisted modern day RPG where every day activities seem like a grueling tasks for the player  to deal with.

Choices will impact future events and interaction with other characters inhabiting Sky City. Introvert Quest also features JRPG style battles, but not as a main focus (mostly optional, plus an entire optional mini game aspect: Digital Duels a game that a lot of people play).
