Fight and win these challenges along the way, save your city. In each stage you will have to collect the medicines and vaccines, overcoming the viral obstacles and rescuing soldiers and nurses before the viruses proliferate any more. Otherwise it will be impossible. The platform game has jump and double jump features, and even, from the fourth stage, vaccine shots to beat enemies.
