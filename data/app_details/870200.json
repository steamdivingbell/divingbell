{"about_the_game":"<i>After six years of development, what began as a simple rocket simulator has become a comprehensive aerospace sandbox in which you can bring to life anything you can imagine - from rockets, airplanes, and cars to entire planets.

Complete contracts to earn money, and discover a mixture of hand-crafted and procedural contracts that offer countless hours of new gameplay. Conquer milestones and explore landmarks to earn tech points and unlock new technology in the tech tree. Interactive tutorials are available to show how to build and operate rockets, cars, and airplanes.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/870200/extras/ProceduralParts.png?t=1726260192\" /><br><br>Stretch and shape fuel tanks, wings, cargo bays, fairings, and nose cones with easy-to-use tools that help you create exactly what you want. Resize solar panels, landing gear, pistons, jet engines, etc to fit your needs. Paint your craft custom colors and tweak their reflectiveness, emissiveness, and texture styles.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/870200/extras/DesignEngines.png?t=1726260192\" /><br><br>Engines can be adjusted in a myriad of ways, such as changing the power cycle, combustion pressure, gimbal range, fuel type, and adjusting nozzle performance and visuals. You can customize an engine to be a power house for lift off, or to be a super optimized vacuum engine that maximizes Isp for interplanetary travel. The engine's performance affects its visuals in flight too as shown by the exhaust's expansion or contraction based on its interplay with the atmospheric pressure. Shock diamonds are pretty but they are a symptom of suboptimal engine performance! If you don't care about any of this, then you can just attach a pre-built engine and hit launch! <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/870200/extras/Vizzy.png?t=1726260192\" /><br><br>Easily drag and drop code blocks to program your crafts to log telemetry, automate them, design your own MFD touch screens, etc. With Vizzy, a programming language designed specifically for Juno: New Origins, you can expand the capabilities of your crafts while learning programming, maths, physics, etc.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/870200/extras/MapView.png?t=1726260192\" /><br><br>Orbits are realistically simulated and support time-warp so you don't have to wait several months to reach another planet.

For the more adventurous, Planet Studio has an advanced mode with many modifiers to add and tweak different noise layers, adjusting the terrain and the biomes, as well as a paintbrush tool to be able to achieve the most complex shapes.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/870200/extras/Share.png?t=1726260192\" /><br><br>Download from a huge collection of user-uploaded crafts, sandboxes, planets, and mods on .
