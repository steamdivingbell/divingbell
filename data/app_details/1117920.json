You've been chosen as man-kinds best hope for survival and given a powerful magical artifact, called DaemonClaw, to aid you in your quest.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117920/extras/StoryGraphicB.png?t=1737713850\" /><br><br>You must traverse the lands of Nnar, through many distinct environments, battling a new cast of foes in every land, confront the powerful leader of each zverkin army, and find a way to end this senseless bloodshed as quickly as possible.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117920/extras/traverse.gif?t=1737713850\" /><br><br>Can you survive long enough to bring peace back to your world and uncover what machinations led to this organized onslaught against all the towns of human kind?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117920/extras/Header_Gameplay.png?t=1737713850\" /><br><br>Hone and test your skills as the deceptively agile Elrik Eisenfaust. While you can always count on your basic move set for fast evasion and powerful physical attacks, you must also learn to utilize the incredible power of your magic gauntlet, DaemonClaw, which takes on a new form in each land, giving you new magical abilities best suited to vanquish the new foes you face.<br><br>Experienced players can discover and master the nuanced elements to the combat. For example, there are many ways to deal with the boomerang blades thrown by the Adleraki (bird-people) of level 1:<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117920/extras/boomerangs.gif?t=1737713850\" /><br><br>While taking place in a epic fantasy world, the intriguing plot unfolds fluidly during the action and level transitions. Like the classic arcade style games of the past, DaemonClaw is intended to be an adrenalin fueled blast. There's no grinding for experience points or health potions in DaemonClaw and no back-tracking to find additional items. Bosses become easier to beat as you build your actual skill playing the game. DaemonClaw is a continual fast action push towards the goal of ending a sudden war and saving humanity. The goal of the game design of DaemonClaw is non-stop fun and great replay value as a result. The kind of game you'll want to play again even though you just beat it earlier that same day.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117920/extras/Header_Characters.png?t=1737713850\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117920/extras/hero.gif?t=1737713850\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117920/extras/wiz.gif?t=1737713850\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117920/extras/zverkin.png?t=1737713850\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117920/extras/bird.gif?t=1737713850\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117920/extras/ram.gif?t=1737713850\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117920/extras/Lore_Fishmen.gif?t=1737713850\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117920/extras/Header_Bosses.png?t=1737713850\" /><br><br>These is the first two bosses you'll encounter in DaemonClaw.
