{"about_the_game":"<strong>The Earth has been ravaged by a devastating invasion by an alien race named the Vulkil.</strong><br><br>Your story begins in the year 2172 as an unidentified Specialist on Olympia Prime, a base located on Earth's moon. <br>You've just been volunteered to participate in a secret military experimental procedure called ZOA Protocol. <br>Little is known about ZOA Protocol except that most who undergo it don't survive. <br>Those who survive experience enhanced abilities such as strength, endurance, speed and dexterity. <br>As a ZOA Protocol survivor you must use your newly discovered powers to race against time to defeat the Vulkil, ultimately saving Earth. <br>The game story will unfold chapter by chapter and saving Earth will require you to commandeer space craft, locate and fly to Alien planets &amp; forge or break  alliances in the search for a way to defeat the Vulkil.<br><br>In this Demo you can play through the first 5 chapters of the pre-alpha version of ZOA Protocol. You will be able to explore your base and launch expiditions to other planets but won't be able to progress the campaign any further forward. We hope you enjoy our little glimpse in to the world of ZOA Protocol","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1974490?t=1650990278","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1974490?t=1650990278","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1974490/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1650990278","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1974490/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1650990278","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"The game features intense gunfight sequences.
