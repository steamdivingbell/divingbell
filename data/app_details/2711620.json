{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"></h2>In Aery \u2013 Midnight Hour you play a little bird on its journey to the devils Halloween party after hearing Dracula talk about it. <h2 class=\"bb_tag\"></h2><br>Enjoy your journey as a little bird and enjoy the feeling of flying while exploring a whole world filled with beautiful, and scary little secrets.<br><br>Within every area of the world, you must find a certain amount of memory shards to remember the path that leads to your destination and advance with the story. Once you have found all the memory shards you are free to explore the next area.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"></h2>Story mode:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"></h2><br>You start in the middle of a dark and scary environment. A huge castle is right next to you \u2013 the castle of Dracula. The sky is red, and you know it is midnight hour.<br><br>You are a little bird which moves continuously forward and are free to fly wherever you want. <br><br>You fly around the castle and start exploring your surroundings. Everything spooky but also kind of cute. <br><br>After you have played around a little and enjoyed the sensation of flying you start to discover the nearby areas and hidden secrets. You fly towards the entrance of Dracula\u2019s castle. <br><br>Once you come closer you see a bright shining memory shard right in front of you. <br>The memory shards are hidden all over the different worlds and contain memories and information about the different levels, the background story and the path that you will need to take to reach your goal. You fly towards the shard and collect it. <br>Once you have found a certain amount of memory shards you will be able to remember the right path and can enter the next area - the story continues. On your journey you will follow the story of your little bird who overheard Dracula talking about the Halloween party of the devil. You go on an adventure to make it to the party and overcome the challenges of the devil to get invited. <br>Each level has a different color theme, general setting, mood and represents the next step in your journey and the different places the little bird visited on its journey. <br><br>At the beginning of each area is a short break in which you are told about the thought that you are in right now. <br><br>The game is a relaxing, abstract flight simulation so there are no enemies or anything else that can harm you. It is a little scary at times but generally has pretty child friendly graphics and overall mood.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Level 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2711620/659a7f06c77a5cc7779f2a436f5685b289bff361.jpg"},{"name":"Level 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2711620/659a7f06c77a5cc7779f2a436f5685b289bff361.jpg"},{"name":"Level 3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2711620/659a7f06c77a5cc7779f2a436f5685b289bff361.jpg"},{"name":"Level 4","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2711620/659a7f06c77a5cc7779f2a436f5685b289bff361.jpg"},{"name":"Level 5","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2711620/659a7f06c77a5cc7779f2a436f5685b289bff361.jpg"},{"name":"Level 6","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2711620/659a7f06c77a5cc7779f2a436f5685b289bff361.jpg"},{"name":"Level 7","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2711620/659a7f06c77a5cc7779f2a436f5685b289bff361.jpg"},{"name":"Level 8","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2711620/659a7f06c77a5cc7779f2a436f5685b289bff361.jpg"},{"name":"Level 9","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2711620/659a7f06c77a5cc7779f2a436f5685b289bff361.jpg"},{"name":"Level 10","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2711620/659a7f06c77a5cc7779f2a436f5685b289bff361.jpg"}],"total":10},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2711620?t=1729353271","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2711620?t=1729353271","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2711620/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729353271","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2711620/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729353271","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"></h2>In Aery \u2013 Midnight Hour you play a little bird on its journey to the devils Halloween party after hearing Dracula talk about it. <h2 class=\"bb_tag\"></h2><br>Enjoy your journey as a little bird and enjoy the feeling of flying while exploring a whole world filled with beautiful, and scary little secrets.<br><br>Within every area of the world, you must find a certain amount of memory shards to remember the path that leads to your destination and advance with the story.
