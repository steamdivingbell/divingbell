Talk to people, animals, and even famous paranormal monsters! Buy pizza! Befriend Bigfoot! Participate in questionable new age healing rituals! Bust evil cults! Get help from secret societies! Read books in a secret library!<br><br><strong>BATTLE</strong><br>Engage in random battles with a whole cavalcade of strange monsters, bizarre cryptids, and gross psychic flying brains (I don't know, maybe that's a selling point for you?). Walk one way and shoot the other with an easy to use twin stick control scheme that supports both keyboard and gamepad play! A unique on/off shooting mechanic challenges both your timing and your ability to manage your limited supply of recharging psychic points! Level up and customize Todd's stats with skill points you can spend for more hit points, more attack power, faster recharge times, or more psychic points!<br><br><strong>EXPERIENCE THE STORY</strong><br>Experience a twisting plot with mysterious secret organizations, an evil cult bent on turning the world into pure chaos, Mothman, Bigfoot, and trans-dimensional aliens! Read goofy dialog, silly jokes, and groan-inducing puns as you explore the world of Believe and interact with its unique cast of weirdo characters. Play through content both wholly original and inspired by real life paranormal monsters and events as you experience each chapter of Believe to be released episodically as DLC!<br><br><strong>BUY IT TODAY</strong><br>If quirky RPGs, twin stick shooting, aliens and the paranormal are your jam, you'll no doubt find something to like in Believe: Paranormal Psychic Adventure!","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/964760?t=1607627642","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/964760/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1607627642","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/964760/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1607627642","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/964760/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1607627642","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>Believe: Psychic Paranormal Adventure</strong> is an RPG with real-time twin-stick shooting action battles!
