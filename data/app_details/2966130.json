{"about_the_game":"<strong>Try Odd Sequence for free for 30 minutes every week!</strong><br><br>I know, not all gamers like complicated games. I know, not all gamers like games that can make them say rude things or become toxic. I also know, not all gamers like games that &quot;just&quot; sell fanservice. <br>I also know very well that some game companies just want to make money from their players without caring about the quality of the game. Some of them also turn a deaf ear to player feedback. Even worse, this kind of thing has been happening to the gaming industry for quite some time now.<br>Are you sick of all that?

Odd Sequence can be a &quot;best friend&quot; for those who like graphic design with a flat, minimalist, geometric, or modern art style. Who doesn't like a clean interface?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Varied Bot Classes</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2966130/extras/Desc_Class.png?t=1714741581\" /><br>There are many bot classes that you can use in the game (although there are only 3 right now). Each bot class have its own uniqueness, starting from weapon type, basic attack types, special move types, and ultimate skill types. Try them all and choose that suits you best!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Choose A Weapon and Set of Equipment for Your Bots!</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2966130/extras/Desc_Weapon_EN.png?t=1714741581\" /><br>Choose your favorite weapon and set of equipment for your bots.

A simple basic attack? Or the most powerful one? Or the most effective one? It's up to you, try to make your own! As a result, you might get the basic attack sequence you want, or you might get a weird, unique, and absurd basic attack sequence. Don't forget to adjust each of these basic attacks!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Choose Your Bot's Special Moves and Ultimate Skills to Your Liking!</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2966130/extras/Desc_SPMV_EN.png?t=1714741581\" /><br>Do you want a more offensive game?

With complex status details, you can change the attribute values of all the basic attacks, special moves, and ultimate skills you want. That's right, as long as the attack attributes aren't &quot;fixed&quot;, you can modify them according to the right type of attacks! Do you want to mess with those attack attributes? Go ahead, try it if you can!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Skill Tree System is Available!</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2966130/extras/Desc_Talent_EN.png?t=1714741581\" /><br>What is a skill tree? Is it something that is necessary in certain games? Of course it is! With this skill tree, you can strengthen your bot even further. Activate all the skills in this skill tree from root to leaf to unlock all your bot's full potential!

So, you need to be able to set the right type of stats and attacks to defeat the enemies and complete the chapter.<br>Fight the enemy bosses and show them who the real boss is! Outsmart these enemy bosses that are technically much stronger than your bots! Will it be a close fight? Hopefully, it won't be a one-way battle.<br><br>Every human being needs refreshment, and one of them is by playing games. But do it in a good and healthy way. If there are healthier games available, why not? What are you waiting for?
