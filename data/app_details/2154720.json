{"about_the_game":"Nofio wireless adapter for Valve Index is built for serious gamers. It comes with everything you need to convert your exising Valve Index to a truly wireless VR Headset. With a dedicated wireless transmitter and receiver, the conversion to wireless is easy, non-destructive and removeable. Simply connect the base transmitter to your PC (DisplayPort, USB and Power), attach the receiver to your headset and connect the supplied short Oculink cable and you are good to go.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Nofio adapter integrates directly with SteamVR, apart from a simple USB driver there is no custom software which needs to be run, or added hardware installed to your PC. The processing is performed completely onboard which means your PC resources are 100% dedicated to gameplay with no impact on gaming performance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe wireless connection is completely standalone, without the need for additional wireless routers which means video quality can be maintained without affecting existing network traffic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNofio is built on the worlds first network aware CODEC technology from IMRnext. The compression ratio can be adaptively adjusted to suit changing network<br />\r\nconditions, and subframe streaming allows the frame to be compressed and sent before the next frame is rendered. All of this results in visual quality and latency equivalent to a traditional cabled experience","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2154720?t=1736298630","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2154720/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1736298630","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2154720/2ab66066e70b4b204d7fff4a7c29d0c0e11c8b01/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736298630","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2154720/2ab66066e70b4b204d7fff4a7c29d0c0e11c8b01/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736298630","categories":[{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Nofio wireless adapter for Valve Index is built for serious gamers.
