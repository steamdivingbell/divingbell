{"about_the_game":"Demonic Episode is a unique first-person online co-op gaming experience in which you travel to Lost Places in a group of content creators to banish a demon back to hell. Each round plays completely different due to an advanced randomized game mechanic, offering a very high replay value with several hours of gameplay. The completely different Lost Places, with their almost photorealistic graphics (thanks to Unreal Engine 5) and the environment created with attention to detail, let you and your friends dive into the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Story</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2438240/extras/CharacterClasses_V2_600x200.png?t=1698305749\" /><br>You're part of a group of content creators who team up with a medium to explore Lost Places for their new video series, Demonic Episode. Once there, you want to provide your community with the best entertainment possible and try to track down paranormal phenomena. However, a much more evil secret lies dormant at these Lost Places, and you unleash a demon that begins a relentless hunt for you. Now it's up to you to fight the demon and, with the help of the medium, perform a ritual to banish the demon back to hell.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Gameplay</strong></h2>Choose from one of 4 character classes, each with two associated characters and different abilities. Then go to one of currently 3 different Lost Places (more will be added during the Early Access phase) to work closely together in three phases:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> In the first phase you'll get an overview of the map and try to detect paranormal phenomena.<br></li><li> In the second phase, the Hell Demon is unleashed and starts chasing you while you try to weaken it. Your flashlights will also help you drive the demon back, preventing it from taking out you or your teammates.<br></li><li> In the third phase you will prepare the banishing ritual with the help of clues to send the demon back to hell.</li></ul><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2438240/extras/DemonicEpisode_Witchwalk.gif?t=1698305749\" /><br>During the 3 phases, the time of day progresses, so you'll have to use your lights to orient yourself at night. In addition, the powers of hell are gradually unleashed, influencing your gameplay.<br><br><i><strong>Singleplayer info:</strong></i> It is possible to play the game in singleplayer. However, for the best gaming experience, I recommend playing the game in a group of 2 to 4 players.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Replay value</strong></h2>Demonic Episode offers an elaborate system to make the game experience of each map always different for maximum replay value. In this regard, many different game mechanics are randomly defined for each map at the beginning of the game. For example, the demon, paranormal phenomena, the ritual place, puzzles and much more are left to chance. Thus, if you are in the same level several times, a new challenge awaits you each time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Technology</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2438240/extras/Technology_600x200.png?t=1698305749\" /><br>The game is developed with the latest Unreal Engine 5 version and therefore offers an almost photorealistic gaming experience thanks to real-time lighting and 3D models with extreme and never before seen detail. Despite the new features, the game has been designed to be playable even on non-up-to-date hardware.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Leveling, XP &amp; Perk system (Perks only after Early Access Release)</strong></h2>During gameplay, players can earn experience points to level up their character. As the character levels up, points can be earned to exchange for a randomized perk.
