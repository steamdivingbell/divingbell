It is important that the game is so difficult so that you make better builds and plan your every move. Winning a whole adventure clearly separates skilled players from unskilled players.

They're designed to be almost like a playable character, and they also unlock unique upgrades, so the player won't face repetitive monsters. The 16 Locations and 40+ Environmental Hazards also help avoid repetitiveness as they add another layer of depth and variation. And finally, the 12 Zodiacs are the bosses in the game, and you can only face 4 of them (a 2/3/4/5 star version) in a single run, adding yet another layer of depth and variation.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">And if discovering new builds every run is not enough, the Reliquary, Star Marks, Steam Achievements, and Global Leaderboard rankings provide the player with endless goals and rewards.</p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"First Win","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3054470/5336b382665fdf945cc3715b65325a8893547508.jpg"},{"name":"Intermediate","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3054470/9763d1a8e7739b403ff4a297775e30c4eb5d3438.jpg"},{"name":"Adept","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3054470/5020b113d75505b89fd5e173849540ae499a1705.jpg"},{"name":"Expert","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3054470/2256093903b7d74d9589c654ea92ca1161892d7e.jpg"},{"name":"Veteran","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3054470/b892a74cd1662051cb957859e42785fb874c0286.jpg"},{"name":"Exceptional","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3054470/9fd55eb5909632a42e4bd8989d2861ca56bb7a1d.jpg"},{"name":"Legendary","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3054470/82bae8b6492d4e559b19d046cfc74bd4be84d561.jpg"},{"name":"Greed Is Good","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3054470/ec57287c7a83c369aecc773ccf0aaf17b9da3b57.jpg"},{"name":"Zodiac Hunter","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3054470/0864bf4524b679b7257e718ef699445bbb3fb809.jpg"},{"name":"Monster Hunter","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3054470/dc2b8f704c8f47e5f2f613df36510998b70a9f68.jpg"}],"total":100},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3054470/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737705641","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3054470/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1737705641","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3054470/0ebbea12330bebd12d263738f7d595b422b3ddda/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737705641","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3054470/0ebbea12330bebd12d263738f7d595b422b3ddda/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737705641","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>TLDR: A content-rich, turn-based roguelite hero/team builder with infinite replayability.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3054470/extras/Red_And_Blue.png?t=1737705641\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Let Us Cook</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The creative vision is to have a game that has truly <strong>endless replayability</strong>.
