{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2706400/extras/wishlistnow.png?t=1738204857\" /><br><br>In a distant future where humanity has abandoned the solar system, leaving silent worlds and unsolved mysteries, you are a lone interstellar traveler who crash-lands on Earth. Now a desolate and unrecognizable planet haunted by the remnants of a vanished civilization, Earth becomes your unexpected battleground for survival.<br><br>With no way to leave, your mission is to restore an abandoned launch base as your only hope for escape. Explore this enigmatic world, scavenge materials, and rediscover lost technologies to rebuild and fortify the base. Survival depends on managing resources like oxygen and energy while facing unknown dangers in the ruins. A Silent Desolation is more than a survival game; it's an odyssey to uncover the mysteries of a forgotten world and answer the ultimate question: what happened on this desolate Earth?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2706400/extras/gifvolcanic.gif?t=1738204857\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Solo Adventure</h2>Embark on an immersive solo survival adventure set on a long-forgotten Earth. The game is centered on exploration, resource management, and unraveling hidden stories. Each decision and action is vital as you manage essential resources, craft tools, and rebuild the launch base for your potential escape.<br><br>The gameplay offers realistic challenges and requires strategic planning. Navigating through diverse and haunting environments, you will encounter anomalies and unseen dangers, demanding adaptability and resourcefulness for your survival.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2706400/extras/gifwindowbroken.gif?t=1738204857\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Space Shuttle</h2>In the desolate remains of Earth, an abandoned launch base becomes a symbol of hope and your potential route for escape. Your mission is to revive this dormant facility, reactivating power generators, repairing the control room, and reinstating the oxygen system, all while scavenging parts and materials scattered across the landscape.<br><br>As the base comes back to life, it offers a degree of safety and stability in a harsh world. It serves as a reliable shelter where you can store resources, plan strategies, and rest from the relentless challenges outside. Reviving the launch base reflects your ability to adapt and persevere, each restored component marking your progress in this unforgiving world.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2706400/extras/GifSpaceShuttle.gif?t=1738204857\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Loot, Craft &amp; Mining</h2>In this game, gathering and managing resources is crucial. The quality of materials, from Pristine to Rusty, affects the durability of your crafted items and the resources you recover during recycling. Pristine materials make equipment last longer, especially against hazards like acid rain. Recycling can upgrade lower-quality materials, but you'll lose some quantity in the process. Balancing this trade-off is essential for survival.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2706400/extras/gifbridge.gif?t=1738204857\" /><br><br><br>Strategic gear placement and mining are key. Position oxygen stations, build shelters against acid rain, and deploy energy equipment. Construct bridges to navigate uncharted terrains and use oil wells and water collectors to thrive. Engage in strategic mining to extract valuable resources from unique rock formations, vital for crafting, repairing, and upgrading equipment. Every choice affects your journey through a land of mysteries and dangers. Master survival with each strategic decision.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Perils of Survival</h2>In this desolate world, hidden dangers lurk in the rain and darkness. Silent entities appear, killing instantly if you get too close or make noise nearby. Acid rain accelerates equipment decay and exposes these threats, while toxic gas spikes test your survival skills. Navigate radiation zones and shifting anomalies with caution, balancing exploration and safety. Craft sturdy shelters and manage resources wisely. Every decision matters, as unseen threats can be as deadly as visible ones. Adapt, stay vigilant, and master the art of survival in this harsh and mysterious environment.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2706400/extras/GifEntities.gif?t=1738204857\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Outposts &amp;Agriculture</h2>In this game, establishing outposts is essential for survival and progression. Crafted from the abandoned launch base, these outposts require significant resources but provide invaluable benefits. Strategically place them throughout the world to create safe zones in a hostile environment. Outposts offer shelter from dangers like acid rain and a place to rest, as sleep is crucial for maintaining your character's health and alertness. Upgrading outposts enhances their utility, allowing you to craft vital equipment and transform looted items into useful materials. Additionally, outposts enable small-scale agriculture and water collection, providing necessary sustenance. The abandoned space shuttle launch base offers greater capabilities for food and water production, but requires quests to repair its agricultural and water modules. Mastering the establishment and management of outposts, along with repairing and utilizing the launch base, is key to thriving in this challenging environment.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2706400/extras/GifOutpost.gif?t=1738204857\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2706400/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738204857","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2706400/page.bg.jpg?t=1738204857","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2706400/051ae248882dfac8fdd775eaa2deecb71932f261/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738204857","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2706400/051ae248882dfac8fdd775eaa2deecb71932f261/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738204857","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"HDR available","id":61}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2706400/extras/wishlistnow.png?t=1738204857\" /><br><br>In a distant future where humanity has abandoned the solar system, leaving silent worlds and unsolved mysteries, you are a lone interstellar traveler who crash-lands on Earth.
