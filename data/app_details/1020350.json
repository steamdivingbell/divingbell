{"about_the_game":"9 new in-game music tracks to enhance Flatspace IIk. Like any in-game music for Flatspace, these will trigger at random when you enter a new sector. Three music packs were originally designed for the Flatspace and Flatspace II games, but these were in ogg format and not compatible with the Steam release of Flatspace IIk, so when the time came to re-release the music packs I saw this as an opportunity to revisit the music.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first, original music pack was created in 2005, and included a mix of unused game music, such as the epic theme to The Heart of Aorkhan, and some tracks from my solo albums up until that time, such as a track from the first version of The Spiral Staircase. I'm now a full time artist and my music has changed considerably since 2005, so I wanted to include some recent music, as well as the best quality versions of those original tracks. I also wanted to make sure that all of the music that had a sense of awe and wonder, the feeling of free space flight that embodies the experience of playing Flatspace.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll of the tracks here are different to some extent from those in the old Flatspace Music Pack. In some cases, such as Sea Monsters, new recordings of the music have been used.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack includes a full description of the music as a pdf booklet. Here is an outline of the music included:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Heart of Aorkhan: Main Theme<br />\r\nCreated using the first generation of my music software, Noise Station, in 2001, this was the main theme for a massive 3D rogue-like game that didn't make it to final release. This is the oldest music in the Flatspace Music Packs, and is a restored version of the recording in the older music pack.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCatacombs<br />\r\nThis was part of The Heart of Aorkhan soundtrack. Catacombs made it onto one of my earliest albums, The Incredible Journey. Catacombs is part of Flatspace II (The Official Soundtrack), and the fan-commissioned track, Journey Through Fractional Space, was developed as a crossover between this and Flatspace tune, Cobra.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFall in Green: Barefoot (instrumental version)<br />\r\nFall in Green are an act of poetry and live instruments made up of myself, Mark Sheeky, and Deborah Edgeley. Barefoot is from 2018, and was released only as a bonus track with our first single, Who is Afraid/She Floats.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInsanity<br />\r\nA simple fugue.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOceanic<br />\r\nOceanic appears on Animalia, one of my early albums, which were heavily influenced by Jean-Michel Jarre.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nReliquary I: Angel on the Moon<br />\r\nA new release, this music was composed to accompany a work of art, a fabulous jewelled cabinet called The Love Reliquary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSea Monsters<br />\r\nSea Monsters is part of my first album on a symphonic scale, a conceptual electronic works called The Spiral Staircase. This is the 2008 version.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpace<br />\r\nA short track which pre-dates the original Flatspace game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe 7th Bell<br />\r\nInspired by 1970s electronic music, such as Pulstar and Alpha by Vangelis. The full version of this track is on Flatspace II (The Official Soundtrack).","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1020350/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737553914","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1020350/page.bg.jpg?t=1737553914","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1020350/f1b30be1d4bcd496325806a950a2fa89dbbfd4f7/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737553914","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1020350/f1b30be1d4bcd496325806a950a2fa89dbbfd4f7/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737553914","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"9 new in-game music tracks to enhance Flatspace IIk.
