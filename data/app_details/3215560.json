Three decades have passed since the onset of &quot;Global Isolation,&quot; triggered by an anomalous incident in the Mediterranean Sea. In this time, the world has transformed beyond recognition. All connections between continents have been severed, and shifting boundaries known as &quot;running lines&quot; gradually consume the land year after year. Nations grapple with profound social, ecological, migration, and food crises. To mitigate logistical challenges, a network of orbital stations has been constructed for intercontinental transport and storage of biome-specific resources.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Your Role</strong></h2>You are a junior technical specialist recently arrived at an orbital station. You possess no extraordinary skills\u2014just an individual trying to escape debt, willing to take on any assigned task.

Your only lifeline is Anna, another survivor of the crash. Together, you must coordinate and solve the problems you face, relying solely on dialogue and shared decision-making.
