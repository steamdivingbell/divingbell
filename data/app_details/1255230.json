{"about_the_game":"Saranity is a 3rd person game, mixing elements from multiple genres like tower defense, MOBA, Strategy into 1 game. The game features single player,  team play in COOP  and Team play in Versus game modes making sure you can play with or against your friends. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main goal of Saranity is to hold of a incoming  wave of ever increasing enemies from destroying you central tower. You do this by either attacking the units directly or by building a maze of towers. In Versus the teams that holds out longer will win the round. Killing enemies earns you gold that you can use to buy new towers, upgrade towers or place simple path blockers. When playing in versus you share the same map and can travel to the enemy team to have PVP combat and earn gold to spawn additional boss units to the enemy side. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is really about bringing back a little bit of the old game play styles where gameplay was focus of the game. This game is completely free and without any in game transactions. It is build for the community.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1255230/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1595533994","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1255230/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1595533994","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1255230/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1595533994","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1255230/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1595533994","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Stats","id":15}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Update Notes</h1><p>New nightfall map coming to the Alpha V3.0 release <br><br>The map features a city  that is place inside the forest while nightfall is setting in.<br><br> <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1255230/extras/unknown.png?t=1595533994\" /></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Saranity is a 3rd person game, mixing elements from multiple genres like tower defense, MOBA, Strategy into 1 game.
