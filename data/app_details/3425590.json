{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In this 2D, Top-Down Shooter, you take control of a mercenary named Suqare as he tries to make a name for himself. You will take jobs from different corporations to build rapport with them and make money. Decisions made during missions determine what jobs you have access to, your reward, if companies target you as an enemy, and even the over-arching story. Use strategy and skill to outwit, outsmart and outshoot your enemies.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You'll have a plethora of melee weapons, guns, gadgets, and upgrades that you can steal from dead enemies or buy from the shop. Change your play-style from guns-blazing to Hitman-like stealth by the way you choose to spend your hard-earned cash. Most weapons have uses that aren't initially apparent, so try them in many ways!\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There will always be multiple options for jobs to take, but keep in mind how you might be working for or against the different corporations. If you anger one, they may stop sending you jobs or even put a hit out on you. If you build good rapport with a company, you might get better rewards and jobs as a result. Sometimes corporations will have jobs that clash with each other, and you'll have the opportunity to side with either one. Maybe take the job from one company and sabotage them from the inside? The choice is yours.\u00a0</p>","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3425590/b0e548f835410c5490495e7cbb6641970a7282a2/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736634391","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3425590/b0e548f835410c5490495e7cbb6641970a7282a2/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736634391","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In this 2D, Top-Down Shooter, you take control of a mercenary named Suqare as he tries to make a name for himself.
