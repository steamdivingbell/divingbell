{"about_the_game":"The cult classic shack-and-slash, in an all-new format. Boyfriend Dungeon: Life On the Edge is a tabletop roleplaying game that lets up to 4 players (plus their Master of Ceremonies) explore their inner psyche, confront their fears, and also smooch swords! Roleplay as your favorite lasersaber or make up your own weapon-person. Wield your friends, defeat your enemies, and level up your love... around the table.<br><br>Includes 3 beautiful, printable PDFs:<br>- The Core Rulebook (50+ pages)<br>- Character Sheet templates (6, one for each weapon-type)<br>- The Mini-RPG, a one-shot quickstart guide (5 pages)<br><br>All you need to bring is two six-sided dice and your imagination!<br><br>The rules were composed by Maso Perez in coordination with Kitfox Games in order to create the ideal storytelling experience in the vein of (but distinct from) the Boyfriend Dungeon video game. But you need not be stuck in Verona Beach if you're craving something more fantastic. You can easily use it to roleplay as Arthurian knight-swords, anxious roommates, an adventuring party, star-crossed Shakespearean rapiers, or any other weapon-people you can imagine.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WHAT SYSTEM IS THIS?</h2>Life on the Edge is its own custom system based on Rhapsody of Blood and of the Powered By the Apocalypse design tradition. However, if you'd prefer to take elements of the game and adapt it for other systems, we'd love to hear about your mods! With weapon types as classes and a suggestion of how to structure your dungeons, the content should be relatively compatible, but let us know how it goes!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2677740/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1705958729","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2677740/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1705958729","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2677740/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1705958729","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2677740/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1705958729","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The cult classic shack-and-slash, in an all-new format.
