If your opponent is doing a good job at controlling the balls, you can drop to your knees and do a blow attack towards your opponent and if you are successful, they will be stunned in a block of ice giving you the opportunity to steal control of the balls!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrison Ball: Full Blown is an indie game made from the heart that offers both lots of laughs and barrels of fun!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game features Full Local Player Convenience!

They will score points for him as any other ball his color, but if you can change these Vast shadow balls your color by deflecting them, they will score points for you instead.  Also if a Vast ball that you've changed to your color hits an interior pink brick, you'll instantly destroy his shadow ball and this will cause a blinding search light to shine on him for several seconds.  While this light may not seem like much, it can blind his ability to see and deflect balls near him and might just turn things back in your favor!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"I won a grueling Nine Minute Long game VS the A.I. !!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1109080/648bfddef78fd2d734e51355dc581426522b5a4d.jpg"},{"name":"Played As Deborah Fire and Defeated the A.I.
