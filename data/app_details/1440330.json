{"about_the_game":"<strong>In It Together is a retro inspired 2D puzzle platformer where you go into dangerous areas and solve problems to retrieve suitcases from the pesky Bandidos Gang. You have no attacks. What you find on the ground is what you need to use to take out the enemy.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SINGLEPLAYER</h2>This is a story based Singleplayer campaign spanning 50 levels in which you have to figure out on your own how to get through. Each world gets progressively more complex with more mechanics, and objects to use. Throw a bowl at a glass wall, throw a bomb at a brick wall, roll a barrel through a tunnel, roll a snowball and see it grow into a force of destruction. Singleplayer should be a great experience for all the lonewolves out there.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1440330/extras/OpenSuitcase.png?t=1611874833\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CO-OP</h2>Hence the name In It Together, the Co-op campaign lets you and a friend work together to solve the problems. Co-op tells the same story as Singleplayer, but here there is a set of 50 different levels that are designed around working together. All the same throwing mechanics are here, but now you must also carry and throw each other, pass objects back and forth and do tasks that make coordination and communication crucial.
