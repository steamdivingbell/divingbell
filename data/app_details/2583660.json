{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Prepare to embark on an epic journey through the theater of strategic warfare with Fractured Alliance. This real-time strategy game draws inspiration from the iconic classics of the genre \u2013 Command &amp; Conquer, Red Alert, KKND and Supreme Commander \u2013 weaving their essence into a captivating gameplay experience accompanied by a rich narrative. This alternate reality features 3 factions and a tense fictional political climate in which the Cold War never ended.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We want to make the nostalgic players feel like they did in around the year 2000. We do that by modernizing the graphics and controls, while at the same time delivering players the same vibe that we love so much from games like that.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Accessible for the new generation of players</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Another priority of ours is to make Fractured Alliance accessible to new players. We'll be adding a faction specifically tailored to them, allowing them to play with an 'largely automated' faction. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">They still have the means to take direct control of course, but with these tools we want to both introduce a new audience to RTS games as well as deliver something new to us nostalgic RTS gamers!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Fun over all</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Overall Fractured Alliance is designed to be a fun casual game.
