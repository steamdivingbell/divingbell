{"about_the_game":"A hidden object game where you must find all the bees to complete each level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2>\u204d 1000+ bees<br><br>\u204d 10 unique artworks<br>\u204d Unlimited hints if you get stuck<br>\u204d Restore a small number of bees to a painting so you can find them again! <br>\u204d Additional bee related objects to find<br>\u204d Music and ambiance for each artwork<br>\u204d Achievements<br>\u204d Use your keyboard to move/zoom in if you have no scrollwheel<br>\u204d 3 save slots<br>\u204d Reset progress entirely and play again<br>\u204d Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Context:</h2>The brief was simple. I commissioned artists to create a fantasy world, and hide as many bees as they can inside it. Now it\u2019s your job to find them all! With 10 art pieces to choose from, and 1000+ bees, you will have a lot of searching to do.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Controls:</h2>Use your mouse to move around the image and zoom in / out. When you find a bee, click it and it will disappear. You can also use WASD to move and the arrow keys to zoom.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Difficulty:</h2>A full range of difficulty is included, but all levels start unlocked, your progress is saved as you play, and you can use hints if you get stuck.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get immersed:</h2>Each painting has its own music and ambiance to help you connect with the world, as you search for all the bees.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Replayable</h2>You can restore a small number of bees back into a painting so you can find them again! It\u2019s much harder when there are only a few bees left (especially randomly). You can also use up to 3 save slots so you can replay without progress loss. Alternatively, you can reset your progress for the entire game if you\u2019d like to start over.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Perfect","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2027000/9a530c592b2175ab7032ee5ff89346a2d8311d6a.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Isles","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2027000/e2d32003733ea4cb034fd8fed41a8e00c4fb153f.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Imagination","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2027000/10c0abafe9fe4ac08389c08be1e2f28c9e4059fb.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Mech","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2027000/1505435574168078455804bf412753de04ccf714.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Zoo","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2027000/18094f2f03f6af23129ab4e5e8e45473ad9bd319.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Space Bees","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2027000/6760419e7a1893851efa55a3fc772a6b6125ab3f.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Canal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2027000/4bc38373c56ee0adce7acbc696334be484e604a1.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Overgrown","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2027000/52e47f84839461faf7dde31050b526693d247a41.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Critters","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2027000/e4eabcc2a15aed28ec31e1578cb2578820f46174.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Theme park","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2027000/b238bbebc730ef8219471dea24270c29d4651ff7.jpg"}],"total":11},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2027000/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714855294","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2027000/page.bg.jpg?t=1714855294","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2027000/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714855294","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2027000/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714855294","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>You might also like</h1><p><br><br></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>A hidden object game where you must find all the bees to complete each level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2>\u204d 1000+ bees<br><br>\u204d 10 unique artworks<br>\u204d Unlimited hints if you get stuck<br>\u204d Restore a small number of bees to a painting so you can find them again! <br>\u204d Additional bee related objects to find<br>\u204d Music and ambiance for each artwork<br>\u204d Achievements<br>\u204d Use your keyboard to move/zoom in if you have no scrollwheel<br>\u204d 3 save slots<br>\u204d Reset progress entirely and play again<br>\u204d Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Context:</h2>The brief was simple.
