{"about_the_game":"&quot;Are you afraid that if you wake up you won't recognize your life, but forever remember the dream you lived?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTimore Narhelma is a surreal experience about human mind and horrors within. The text on the screen is asking you various questions, that all have a connection to your being, yet they don't seem similar on their own. You get to experience a fraction of your mind being tested, and you get to choose your answers. Probably.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis test also puts you in unique situations, asking you to show what would you do in the specific scenarios. Would you approach the horrors yourself, who would you kill, would you let go of your mind, body and your eyes? The game is a combination of a horror-test and 3D exploration of various environments, connecting the story together. You get asked various questions about the human nature, about yourself, and as the game progresses you get to know more about the character that you're controlling. Some answers are showing you what the character in the game might be thinking, even if you don't choose those answers. You're also going to meet a few known characters from Timore series. It's a unique approach to story-telling, and a surreal experience overall, leading you towards one specific goal. Choose your answers, prove them with your actions. Explore the surreal environments and characters living inside of them as you get closer to the city of Narhelma.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Enter Narhelma","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3199400/795682acb260aa4bee9f1d35d394fb4effad469f.jpg"}],"total":1},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3199400/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726747684","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3199400/page.bg.jpg?t=1726747684","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3199400/4774976b01bc7d2352ed7942e72a20eeb146520e/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726747684","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3199400/4774976b01bc7d2352ed7942e72a20eeb146520e/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726747684","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"The game contains themes of horror, violence, abuse, murder."},"detailed_description":"&quot;Are you afraid that if you wake up you won't recognize your life, but forever remember the dream you lived?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTimore Narhelma is a surreal experience about human mind and horrors within.
