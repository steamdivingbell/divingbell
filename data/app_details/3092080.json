{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>ABOUT</strong></h2>Get ready for Fartonauts, a hilarious party game where farts are your weapon and friendship is on the line! Recreate the classic arcade fun of the good old days as you blast your buddies with outrageous fart power.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>SETTING</strong></h2>Imagine stepping into a brightly lit arcade, the sounds of pixelated explosions and chiptune music filling the air. But instead of joysticks and buttons, you're controlling a hilarious cast of astronauts blasting through a retro-futuristic vision of space \u2013 all fueled by the power of farts!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong></h2>Fartonauts is all about simple controls and over-the-top action! It's easy to learn, but hard to master \u2013 just like the best arcade games. Here's how it works:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Move with Style:</strong> Aim your farting to propel yourself through zero gravity. Time your farts just right to navigate obstacles, dodge incoming projectiles, and flank your opponents.<br></li><li><strong>Grab and Go:</strong> See that crazy item? Use it yourself or Grab it! Keep it in your hands to use in the best moment, butt be careful! Someone might snatch it!<br></li><li><strong>Throw Items:</strong> Once you've got something bad in your hands (bad for them, of course), let it fly! Throw at your friends and see them suffer!
