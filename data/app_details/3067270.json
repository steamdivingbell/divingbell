{"about_the_game":"This DLC contains one exclusive alternate color for each character.<br><br><i>Note: By buying this DLC you are first and foremost showing your support for the game and the developers. The extra colors are really just icing on the cake!</i><br><br>===<br><br><strong>FAQ:</strong><br><br>Q: Why does this DLC exist?<br><i>A: Mega Knockdown has had over 2 years of free updates since releasing Early Access. We don't want to charge for significant gameplay additions at this time (such as our next couple characters) so we are offering this small cosmetic perk while we continue finishing the character art and adding more content to the base game.</i><br><br>Q: Are more palettes going to be locked behind this DLC?<br><i>A: Right now there are 9 basic color swaps per character, and this DLC adds 1 more. We plan to add several more color palettes, but we don't plan to charge for them.</i><br><br>Q: Doesn't this game have user moddable colors? Can't I just mod these palettes in?<br><i>A: If you do mod your colors, this DLC gives you one extra color slot to do as you please with.
