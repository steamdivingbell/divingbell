{"about_the_game":"In Mimicry, experience a classic top-down dungeon crawler, with a twist that instead of being the adventurer clearing waves of monsters, you are the monster clearing waves of adventurers. You play as a creature called a mimic, which looks like a chest to lure in prey. It\u2019s kind of like a stick bug, only carnivorous and 20 times the size.<br><br>Traverse the many floors of the dungeon and brave the scary and strange sights of the deep to rid your home of its human infestation. Reclaim sections have been taken by invaders or corruption and save your friends who can help you to rebuild the society of mimics that live within these great halls of stone.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2251650/extras/shop_floor3.png?t=1698735844\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Explore the Underground</strong></h2>Bounce your way through 6 carefully curated floors of the dungeon, and use different gameplay mechanics to face differing enemies. Choose between hiding among crates, barrels, and real chests for sneaky kills or charging headfirst through the pillared hallways to take on an army of explorers.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2251650/extras/floor3_puzzle.png?t=1698735844\" /><br><br>Each floor has a distinct character which influences what will be found there. Some floors may have you dodging through tunnels to avoid detection, while others you'd need to find ways to keep the lights on in the darkness to push forward. Once each floor has been cleared it will open up the way to move on through the dungeon. But you'll need to keep an eye on old floors as baddies can try to reclaim them, and the levels may provide handy items for later-game use.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Fight With Stealth</strong></h2>Unlike most dungeon crawlers, Mimicry plays as a mixture of fighting hordes of enemies and hiding in the shadows, finding the best opportunities to reduce the number of your prey.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2251650/extras/suspicion.png?t=1698735844\" /><br><br>The suspicion bar tells you how much adventurers will think you're just a chest, or if you're secretly a man-eating monster in disguise. Standing still and removing any witnesses are good ways to counter suspicion, while moving around and openly eating people guarantee you a blazing red bar.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Customize Your Playstyle</strong></h2>Choose your character from one of 4 specialized mimics that have their own unique playstyles. Each mimic has their own special skills and combat specializations which can be adapted differently with each playthrough.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2251650/extras/equipables.png?t=1698735844\" /><br><br>There are the two types of mimics, wooden and reinforced, which each have their own light and heavy classes. Wooden mimics focus on motion, combining speed with deadly stealth to eliminate enemies.
