Cast hexes in the form of hexadecimal numbers, and block your opponent's hexes by decimalizing them. The better your wards, the faster you\u2019ll fill up your magic, with which you can cast bigger hexes!<br><br>Speed and strategy are key in a hexaduel: turns last only a few seconds, and hexes must be chosen with care. The bigger your hexes, the more damage they can deal, but the more magic your opponent can gain from blocking them!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Choose your rules</h2><br>There are two kinds of hexaduel. If the already frantic challenge of the <strong>basic</strong> kind isn\u2019t enough for you, try the <strong>advanced</strong> kind, which includes hexes with special properties. These hexes test your knowledge not only of hexadecimal notation but of <strong>binary</strong> and <strong>quaternary</strong> notation too!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Spar alone or with a friend</h2><br><i>Hexaduel</i>\u2019s standard mode is the <strong>spar</strong>. Play alone against <strong>humanlike AI</strong>, or set up a peer-to-peer duel with a friend using either Steam's network or your own server\u2013client connection.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Brave the gauntlet</h2><br>The <strong>gauntlet</strong> offers the ultimate hexadueling challenge. Can you survive five duels of increasing difficulty in a row? After each duel, you can choose from a random selection of <strong>charms</strong>, which synergistically reward various playstyles. There are 33 charms in all!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Master the timed trials</h2><br>Two special timed trials await in the <strong>bonus</strong> mode. Endure an onslaught of hexes in the <strong>trial of pain</strong>, and cast hexes that deal as little damage as possible in the <strong>trial of mercy</strong>. How high can you score in each?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Optimize your experience</h2><br>Choose between two control schemes for casting spells: use the number and letter keys on your physical keyboard to type them out, or use the game's inbuilt virtual keys, which make it fully playable with a gamepad.<br><br>Filters for colorblindness are available.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Defiant","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2441580/f1ce1d57b2d39e82408a120053e192e383fd256d.jpg"},{"name":"Dealer of Destruction","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2441580/621094fe645e258ec8695b20cc38208b922f45b0.jpg"},{"name":"Ward Whiz","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2441580/81a1ac8caf7fac2068e01c47a40c6391c160cfba.jpg"},{"name":"Daredevil","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2441580/140995bf443575659e4bdfea1021360e9aac5a8a.jpg"},{"name":"Undead, Undying","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2441580/33dbc8022f9b373ed2492261fb8925004b4c3086.jpg"},{"name":"Numerophile","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2441580/b35674e8b55beb1eda75cf9324180845ed27bd19.jpg"},{"name":"Tormentor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2441580/dabeea2a788fff41e49f3dddd30bc7f52278357f.jpg"},{"name":"Hexologist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2441580/00a807f4abd425311d20226345ff545d19229bd9.jpg"},{"name":"Speed Demon","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2441580/8ba59c82300b9b6398b46aedfb37e2e379d3bc6e.jpg"},{"name":"Dueling Machine","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2441580/e8c14087f1034226927e898ce05f6534328531f9.jpg"}],"total":16},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2441580/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1699378871","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2441580/page.bg.jpg?t=1699378871","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2441580/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1699378871","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2441580/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1699378871","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2441580/extras/hexaduel-win.gif?t=1699378871\" /><br><br>Test your number skills in this magical turn-based fighter!
