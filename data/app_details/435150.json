From a 3/4 overhead perspective, players explore the fantasy world of Rivellon, interact with various characters, and engage in turn-based combat against human enemies and fantastical creatures (e.g., demons, skeletons, giant insects). \r\n\r\nCharacters use weapon strikes and magic attacks to defeat enemies in combat; battles are accompanied by blood-splatter effects that stain the surrounding environment. Some areas depict large pools of blood amid human corpses and dismembered limbs. \r\n\r\nThe game contains some sexual material: the central character can employ the services of a prostitute at a pub\u2014no sexual activity is depicted, though the dialogue/text makes sexual references (e.g., \u201cYour hand slides all the way up until you reach her, and you make a soft circling motion with your thumb\u201d; \u201cSlowly she undresses you then takes you to bed\"; \"Your world explodes in bliss.\").
