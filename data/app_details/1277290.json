{"about_the_game":"This is a game that is designed to assist the user's learning and understanding of Chinese by utilizing a VR environment. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThroughout the game, the user will be guided between basic Chinese lessons by CTAS (an abbreviation for Chinese Teaching ASsistant). Currently, two lessons are integrated into the game: Lesson 1 informs the user with basic counting in Chinese, lesson 2 handles basic Chinese vocabulary. After each lesson, there is a short quiz, which will check if the user was truly able to digest the material given. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is a 1-man developed game by a high school student. Thank you for enjoying.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1277290/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1596009793","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1277290/page.bg.jpg?t=1596009793","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1277290/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1596009793","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1277290/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1596009793","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This is a game that is designed to assist the user's learning and understanding of Chinese by utilizing a VR environment. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThroughout the game, the user will be guided between basic Chinese lessons by CTAS (an abbreviation for Chinese Teaching ASsistant).
