{"about_the_game":"You bake then you flake!<br><br>You were once one of the finest heroes in the land, but you have grown old and tired. Retirement is upon you, but you must still make a living.

You can only seem to stay awake long enough to bake 5 good loaves a day.<br><br>Monsters from far and wide hear of your amazing (almost burnt) bread and flock to you to buy. You let the poor, brainless foes purchase your less-than delicious bread and then knock them out using the skulls of your past enemies to win back the bread they bought.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Demo Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Six playable levels</li><li><br></li><li>Two unlockable Bakers</li><li><br></li><li>Three unlockable color palettes</li><li></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Full Version Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Five different zones.</strong> There's a total of 50+ levels across all zones to complete on your journey to retirement, each zone having their own aesthetics.<br></li><li><strong>Many different types of enemies.</strong> Some just want your bread, but others have special traits to alter the action.<br></li><li><strong>Special Trinkets.</strong> Cute little trinkets are available to purchase with your hard earned coin.
