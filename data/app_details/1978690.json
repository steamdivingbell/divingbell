{"about_the_game":"A soldier on a night mission searches for important documents in the gray zone, where it seems no soul is present. Suddenly, through the radio, something that identifies itself as a fallen enemy combatant makes contact. This malevolent spirit warns that taking the documents without its permission is dangerous. However, there is an opportunity to negotiate with it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBe cautious: any mistake in the negotiations could awaken the evil forces hiding in the forest, and darkness will come for you. In that case, you will have no choice but to try to find shelter or resort to using your weapon, but remember that your ammunition is limited.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* The game fully supports communication in both Russian and English.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1978690/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1719341551","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1978690/page.bg.jpg?t=1719341551","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1978690/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1719341551","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1978690/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1719341551","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A soldier on a night mission searches for important documents in the gray zone, where it seems no soul is present.
