{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Trapped in a desolate, dark forest where every shadow whispers danger, <strong>&quot;Beware Behind You&quot;</strong> plunges you into a relentless fight for survival. Your only goal: escape. Your only hope: an abandoned car, shattered and missing vital parts.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Armed with nothing but a flickering flashlight and the creeping dread that <i>something</i> is watching, you must navigate the treacherous woods. But beware\u2014you're not alone. A malevolent, supernatural entity stalks your every move, feeding on your fear and twisting reality itself.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each step into the forest blurs the line between paranoia and reality. Is that crackling twig just the wind... or something far more sinister? As your flashlight's dim beam flickers and dies, the overwhelming silence amplifies the pounding of your heart.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Stay hidden. Stay quiet. <strong>Never stop looking behind you.</strong> The forest plays tricks on the mind\u2014but what waits in the shadows is very, very real.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Can you piece together the broken car and escape before the forest consumes you?
