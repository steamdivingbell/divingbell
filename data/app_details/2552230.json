{"about_the_game":"The intention behind the making of this game was to induce a refreshing fear of the unknown in this psychological horror video game. Set within the game is a maze for the player to navigate in the dark with only a flashlight at their disposal. The player's objective is to play a sadistic game of hide and seek against an unknown entity. They must find remains of this unknown entity before it finds them. Players can run, walk, crouch, and jump around the maze as they deem fit, but players will learn that hiding is not a viable option. As the players progress through the maze and familiarize themselves with the dark surrounding, they will encounter NPCs that will give chase. If caught, they player will lose and will have to restart this game of hide and seek. As Albert Einstein once said; &quot;The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.&quot; Players must adapt and persevere in order to successfully beat the entity and hopefully escape this hellish game of hide and seek.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2552230?t=1723846665","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2552230?t=1723846665","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2552230/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1723846665","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2552230/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1723846665","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Psychological Horror"},"demos":[{"appid":3135680,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"The intention behind the making of this game was to induce a refreshing fear of the unknown in this psychological horror video game.
