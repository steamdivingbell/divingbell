The game's primary resource is energy, which is used to build new generators and satisfy the energy demands of villages and cities. When you construct new generators, the environment suffers. Heal the environment by planting saplings and seeing them grow into beautiful trees!<br><br>The game presents a strategic challenge with its five types of energy generators: windmills, solar panels, dams, gas plants, and nuclear plants (on July 6, 2022, the UE Parliament labeled gas and nuclear power as green, equating them with renewables). Each generator has unique attributes, and weather conditions can influence their production. As the game progresses, new villages and cities will appear, increasing the energy demand.
