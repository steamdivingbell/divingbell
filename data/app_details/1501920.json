{"about_the_game":"<u><strong>TOEWR LE FENCE HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED</strong></u><br>This game was quite literally my first baby steps in game development. Nothing was organized and I quite literally have no idea how to code. This was also made back when I was like 6th grade LMFAO (I'm not even kidding I literally feel so bad for those of you who bought this disaster of a game)<br><br>Welp, it's been a good 7 years since I made TLF (at the time of editing this). I've gotten exponentially better at Unity Engine and scripting, and it all stems from Toewr le Fence.<br><br>So - I'd like to thank each and every one of you who supported my very first steps into the world of game development. It's brought me nothing but a good experience, which will stick with me for all future projects I'll be working on!<br><br>The source code is available through my website. Check it out if you want to mess around with it urself (TL;DR idc what u do with the code u can sell it if u want. just credit me or smth. i also don't care if u don't cuz I'm too lazy to hire lawyers lmao)<br><br>Meanwhile, I'll be working on better and more exciting stuff.
