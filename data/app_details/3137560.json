The game traps you in a strange and horrible place, where the act of escape becomes an almost visceral imperative. For fans of minimalistic and impactful horror games, The Liminal Dimension might turn out to be one of their favorite indie titles of the year.\u201d<br>AAG<br><br>\u201cThe Liminal Dimension is something akin to a horror Escape Room that will challenge your mind and, for a brief moment, show you that no tricks are necessary to feel fear. All it takes is a bit of susceptibility to suggestion and a touch of mystery. If you enjoy horror and alternative experiences, don\u2019t hesitate to try The Liminal Dimension. Moreover, its affordable price makes it accessible to any budget.\u201d<br>NextGames<br><br>\u201c\u00ab The Liminal Dimension is a solid contribution to the popular Liminal-themed-games genre \u00bb \u2013 More bizarre and disturbing still is that you don\u2019t encounter new environments, but different versions of the exact same environment \u2013 a corridor lined with doors \u2013 endlessly, with no indication as to when (or even if) it might end. As you run along the corridor, taking each corner as it comes, you may begin to wonder just how long you have been running for. When you turn back to check, however, you are faced with a solid wall that certainly wasn\u2019t there a moment ago.\u201d<br>Cloud Gaming
