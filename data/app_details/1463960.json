There\u2019s an almost terrifying quality to the vaporwave graphics, a reminder that the same anxieties surrounding evil AI and the all-expansive power of Big Tech have and will likely continue to exist forever... What is truly remarkable about Future Proof\u2019s work is that the PSweet game is just a piece in a bigger transmedia puzzle. All of Future Proof\u2019s performances, media, and other works (spanning podcasts, museum tours, and Twitter bot chains) exist in the same universe, which orbits LUX, a corporate giant willing to go to any lengths to convince you to consume their products\u2014or in this case, attend their film screening. Legacy objects, characters, and histories exist across their projects, as they are recycled and reshaped into new storylines\u2014surrounding you with content in a way that feels quite literally immersive.\u201d<br>WIRED Magazine<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463960/ss_b4de7d9ccc55fcff98d384b5ce150f84706b1f5c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1628107912","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463960/ss_b4de7d9ccc55fcff98d384b5ce150f84706b1f5c.600x338.jpg?t=1628107912"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463960/ss_b3306e7d4752bcaee9bc29cd01374ca45150b187.1920x1080.jpg?t=1628107912","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463960/ss_b3306e7d4752bcaee9bc29cd01374ca45150b187.600x338.jpg?t=1628107912"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463960/ss_138e43cd67396a0cd20a6a0d3969a50c2a4afffb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1628107912","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463960/ss_138e43cd67396a0cd20a6a0d3969a50c2a4afffb.600x338.jpg?t=1628107912"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463960/ss_7eeeb4449b5c8d01275d5e746de014d8ac3df8ea.1920x1080.jpg?t=1628107912","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463960/ss_7eeeb4449b5c8d01275d5e746de014d8ac3df8ea.600x338.jpg?t=1628107912"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463960/ss_3f3645bd7a7ba878218fae61561bbbea8b11c03d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1628107912","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463960/ss_3f3645bd7a7ba878218fae61561bbbea8b11c03d.600x338.jpg?t=1628107912"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463960/ss_c6742f8a767944e209851430e104f7a5a50cf0f8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1628107912","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463960/ss_c6742f8a767944e209851430e104f7a5a50cf0f8.600x338.jpg?t=1628107912"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463960/ss_22606d10dcfc9fac12ff47e33e0d6e1b3205a9eb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1628107912","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463960/ss_22606d10dcfc9fac12ff47e33e0d6e1b3205a9eb.600x338.jpg?t=1628107912"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463960/ss_46538410ee1e8f6f86492c1382916e6e8e7ebd57.1920x1080.jpg?t=1628107912","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463960/ss_46538410ee1e8f6f86492c1382916e6e8e7ebd57.600x338.jpg?t=1628107912"},{"id":8,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463960/ss_4b33a5763c2f086c736a825bfa9643b92a227fb0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1628107912","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463960/ss_4b33a5763c2f086c736a825bfa9643b92a227fb0.600x338.jpg?t=1628107912"},{"id":9,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463960/ss_59848404a630f1bfedff941cd52f4516ef1b92cc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1628107912","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1463960/ss_59848404a630f1bfedff941cd52f4516ef1b92cc.600x338.jpg?t=1628107912"}],"short_description":"Date productivity applications in a retro, hand-drawn dating simulator set in a fictional operating system that definitely doesn't have a horrible secret.","steam_appid":1463960,"support_info":{"email":"contact@futureproof.site","url":"futureproof.site"},"supported_languages":"English","type":"game","website":"https://www.luxuryuniversalexperience.com/psweet/home"}
