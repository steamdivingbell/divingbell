Unfortunately, cargo transport in the main asteroid belt still remains not only loss-making business, but it is also a dangerous one.<br><br>This isn\u2019t going to be a routine trip for you this time. You'll have to solve puzzles, deal with friendly inhabitants, and fight enemies to escape a space station captured by pirates.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Advanced system of interaction with non-player characters.
