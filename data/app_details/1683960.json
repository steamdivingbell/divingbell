{"about_the_game":"Meet the Virtues, they are magical beings who live in a secret city above the clouds and whose purpose is to help us, virtuans, learn to express our virtues. They may use their special Instruments (like a whistle) to make us feel brave or friendly in a blink of an eye, but they can only complete their missions if they make us learn how to express virtues by ourselves.<br><br>Courage is a Virtue with confidence issues who hasn't completed a single mission in her life, but when she has a fateful encounter with you, a spark of hope begins to light in her heart. With your help, she's supposed to make a little boy named Sam face a haunted mansion to make his adventurous friend Andrea happy, but is that the only courage issue on this mission?
