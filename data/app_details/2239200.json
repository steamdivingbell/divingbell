{"about_the_game":"<strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WELCOME TO AFRIKA!!</h2></strong><br>With an indie and artsy visual, Animal Across: Afrika promises to be a light and fun game, set in Africa with endemic animals from there. The game is set up similar to Tetris, where pieces are falling and you have to match them in order to eliminate them. The differences are that here the pieces always come in sets of two horizontal blocks and, in addition to the colors, they match the animal with its food. In this game there is no time to complete the puzzle, only the score matters. This game features five gameplay modes between singleplayer and local multiplayer:<br><br><strong>- Singleplayer:</strong><br>In this mode you play by your own, trying to eliminate the pieces through combinations. If the board is full, you lose.<br><br><strong>- Multiplayer 1:</strong><br>This mode is perfect for spending time with a friend. A clash in which each player has their board and both receive the same pieces and need to allocate them. There's only one winner here!<br><br><strong>- Multiplayer 2:</strong><br>Here, everyone also has their board and only one wins, the difference is that each player gets their own pieces, in other words, they are different pieces.<br><br><strong>- Multiplayer V:</strong><br>In this mode, both players have the same board, which is presented in a V format, but each one has their own side. You must use the best strategies to beat your opponent, and you can even play pieces on your opponent's side to harm him and get away with it.<br><br><strong>- Multiplayer Co-op:</strong><br>For those who want to play with a friend, but don't like competition, we have that option too! In this mode there is only one board, a bigger one, where your partner and you must help each other to win the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Features:</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>5 modes of gameplay.<br></li><li>Singleplayer and local multiplayer.<br></li><li>Play in beautiful environments of Africa!<br></li><li>Originally composed soundtracks.<br></li><li>A puzzle game focused on fun, alone or with a friend.</li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Meats, Meats, Meats!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2239200/2b344826b4a3d24be10f8f6f754072f7733b5bdb.jpg"},{"name":"Plants, Plants, Plants!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2239200/c6514f8265b1eea995830d08dfe821685ee8359f.jpg"},{"name":"Bananas, Bananas, Bananas!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2239200/31b9c358006d10a0f096da3a577f75a4784aa01c.jpg"},{"name":"Bones, Bones, Bones!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2239200/a606227437c87094989ee4e934be9117df1712be.jpg"},{"name":"Fruits, Fruits, Fruits!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2239200/cd13d93f5d6f2a75c27eddade673ae57249807e0.jpg"},{"name":"A Bunch of Meats","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2239200/7640e7e2cfa5d6f350c55d9d43d6601bceecc7fb.jpg"},{"name":"A Bunch of Plants","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2239200/7ad0a91af73ed2ad3f9d2ed297dc62df16346bf7.jpg"},{"name":"A Bunch of Bananas","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2239200/09155265d5b3adfcd42ec9d9e5de300a1eb87878.jpg"},{"name":"A Bunch of Bones","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2239200/8cf0bd10242ad6f83945f11fa39b49105cedc347.jpg"},{"name":"A Bunch of Fruits","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2239200/f09a625a63038345408678b71bed3ca71ad8417f.jpg"}],"total":94},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2239200/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1710173635","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2239200/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1710173635","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2239200/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1710173635","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2239200/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1710173635","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WELCOME TO AFRIKA!!</h2></strong><br>With an indie and artsy visual, Animal Across: Afrika promises to be a light and fun game, set in Africa with endemic animals from there.
