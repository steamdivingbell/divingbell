She boiled with rage on hearing the planet is in trouble, and jumped at the opportunity to help. For her Ability, she sets up a bear-shaped power spot which further amplifies her fighting spirit. For her SP Move, she freezes the enemies by making a brisk snow fall from above. Her unlikely weapon is a portable railgun that needs to be charged to fire. Though it may not seem so at first, this is truly pure power to the extreme.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1596662/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1622099214","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1596662/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1622099214","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1596662/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1622099214","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1596662/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1622099214","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"This allows you to use a special character and that character's weapon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis hostess was chosen to join the fight from &quot;Dream Club,&quot; a club for adults that can only be joined by those with a pure heart.
