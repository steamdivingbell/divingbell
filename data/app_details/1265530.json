{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2>In a post-apocalyptic world, you awake inside of a dark bunker. The bunker has kept you safe for many months, however, rations are running low and systems are failing. Exploration of once familiar world remains your only chance for survival. In this new environment you will be tested and constantly reminded of how close to death you truly are.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hardcore Survival Experience</h2>Beware this game will test you! It will push you to the brink of death and if you somehow survive, this world will find a new way to kill you. You start with a limited supply of food, water, and oxygen. You will need to build, automate, and explore if you are to have any hope of surviving. Seriously though, this game is made by lunatic and you will die.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build System</h2>You will need to build everything... and I mean everything from power, plumbing, air/water purification, storage, food, defense systems. Did I mention this world wants to kill you? How you choose to greet death is your choice.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Particle Based Physics System</h2>Elements will be able to change states and flow just like they would in real life. So yes that means we will have solids, liquids, gases running on a particle based physics simulation. I am not saying you should go to college as a physics major before playing this game, but hey, it might help. Some people call this the dark souls of survival games... you should probably just move on.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">3d Platformer</h2>The game is built in 3d world which you will be able to see through a 2d third person view... Gamers who play platformers like super meat boy, terraria, or hallow knight will feel at home navigating this world.","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1265530/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1674410478","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1265530/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1674410478","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"Graphic acts of death, including but not limited to, oxygen deprivation, blunt force trauma, extreme temperatures, disease, radiation, and cannibals.\r\n\r\nGraphics acts to survive, including but not limited to, cook and eating small creatures, building sewage filtration systems, cutting off limbs, and making shelter/clothes from animal furs."},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2>In a post-apocalyptic world, you awake inside of a dark bunker.
