{"about_the_game":"<strong>Catch the celebrity.<br>Avoid the paparazzi.</strong><br><br>Paparazzi is a <strong>local multiplayer</strong> game of cat-and-mouse. The celebrity runs, dashes, and hides while the paparazzi tries to take constant photos of them. It's a simple yet competitive arcade-action game with a Where's Waldo feel. It's a test of focus and reflexes and a silly take on celebrity culture.<br><br>Each match is a tug-of-war battle between a celebrity (battling for dignity) and a paparazzo (battling for money). When the paparazzo player takes a picture of the celebrity, the paparazzo gains money while the celebrity loses dignity. If the celebrity collects an adoring fan, they regain a chunk of their dignity. At the end of each round, when the celebrity reaches the limo, the winner is the player that has more dignity or money!<br><br>Matches can be played multiplayer, with one celebrity player and one paparazzo, or single player as celebrity vs. a paparazzo AI. <br><br>NOTE: This game was intended to played with your friends!
