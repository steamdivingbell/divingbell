Dress your barbarian party member in a fur-lined breastplate and loincloth so they have full mobility while they swing their ax at enemies, or create a noble\u2019s son who still wears the kingdom\u2019s red and black school uniform long after the school was destroyed by invading monsters. Give your bard a skintight top (or no shirt at all!) to help distract his opponents, while the tank of the group wears a simple shirt over a stocky body. Other outfits with varying amounts of armor are perfect for creating NPCs, or let your heroes change clothes every once in a while. The Eyes, Front Hair, and Rear Hair sections each get 5 new pieces, letting you make a man with crazy eyes partly covered in bangs, a youthful elf who wears his green hair long and loose, and even a kind healer with downturned eyes and short hair that sticks out in a few spots.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinish off your hero\u2019s look with 1 Accessory 1, 2 Accessory 2s, and 2 horn options as Beast Ears!
