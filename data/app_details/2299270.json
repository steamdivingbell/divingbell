{"about_the_game":"\u201cThe Abyss\u201d is a concoction of the 3 genres known as <strong>Bullet Hell, Souls-Like, and RPG. </strong> There are over 20 levels with a plentiful amount of unique bosses and enemies scattered about the game. There are also quite a few puzzles and challenges sprinkled about. Put nightmares to rest to learn the Lunar Secrets of Mondriech by using the <strong>abilities and equip able runes </strong>that are collected throughout the game. In \u201cThe Abyss\u201d there is a <strong>full movement and dodge system</strong>, as well as a <strong>projectile based combat system</strong> that deviates from the typical souls-like combat. In \u201cThe Abyss\u201d you can only take <strong>one hit</strong> before you are sent back to your last checkpoint. \u201cThe Abyss\u201d takes a deviation from the typical grindy RPG elements that you see everywhere. Instead of grinding enemies over and over to level up your stats there is only one stat, and that stat is your skill level. The bosses progressively get harder and require the player to have more of a grasp on the game mechanics to beat. \u201cThe Abyss\u201d features <strong>custom controls</strong> for your keyboard inside of the settings as well as some <strong>accessibility settings</strong> like <strong>turning off the camera shake</strong>, and a <strong>performance mode</strong>. There are plentiful secrets just waiting to be discovered hidden throughout &quot;The Abyss.&quot;","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Memories","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2299270/23f70ce0d620d5a5f4fb0094449f7c6b367b6cb8.jpg"},{"name":"Erilaz","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2299270/bda8a0fd726ba857dbb625b9ed153637591f64d0.jpg"},{"name":"Conversationalist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2299270/67a084befe8a43badbf786d811213c82b7dc483f.jpg"},{"name":"Dreamer Awakened","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2299270/57e4523ffe18de70c1320cb60c94b936ddab64c2.jpg"},{"name":"Rescinded Crown","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2299270/7e70f2cb4345266128447d3d322b8d4773766ef0.jpg"},{"name":"Harboring Darkness","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2299270/db0dc36ef49377a4b93622af134bd6ac28aa7108.jpg"},{"name":"Into Madness","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2299270/bf15af2801db586aef17ee88b0de357850968661.jpg"},{"name":"Liberator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2299270/d857936626f33c3aca0f8145975c7eb215f2747f.jpg"},{"name":"What A Sight!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2299270/9839918fb6bbb43f27cc484cd04855e5be6e4e82.jpg"},{"name":"Wood Of Wisdom","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2299270/c622331a278f84c8216ea0d59bb96bff82aeeddb.jpg"}],"total":21},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2299270/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714487248","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2299270/page.bg.jpg?t=1714487248","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2299270/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714487248","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2299270/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714487248","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"The Abyss contains cartoon / pixelated acts of violence all throughout the game.
