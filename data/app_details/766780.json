Activating these skips requires the player to create a giant combo in the shape of several different letters (T, X or Y).","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Getting Started","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/766780/294261217fb87c267d6950ebccdbca16d752260a.jpg"},{"name":"Now We're Talking","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/766780/a6b947dde4653f260ebd91b31ca7261d30b92455.jpg"},{"name":"The Quarter-Mil Club","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/766780/a9ea5d10407acedb66433d2cbdf5705aa9a9ce9e.jpg"},{"name":"To Boldly Go","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/766780/38b34c9067cf2ab90d1ddae1c201c19a25bc6709.jpg"},{"name":"The Big T","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/766780/337e3b6e3a394b509f6b5652e9ba48057a155693.jpg"},{"name":"The Big X","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/766780/3abb987df92547533c66ce526c5a62edd5f6f425.jpg"},{"name":"The Big Y","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/766780/27a8ac87a99310a45662e606e6e318f72b72e875.jpg"},{"name":"Taxi","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/766780/f28a9fdea9799afac788ac8c2ee518565e5b1663.jpg"},{"name":"The Only Way Is Up","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/766780/451525b644f2f59aac1fbd7e63a40dcbf3377487.jpg"},{"name":"A Poultry Million","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/766780/a2a17dedfdb707605b61c20ac902bb07b1fa2b5f.jpg"}],"total":20},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/766780/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1585157006","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/766780/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1585157006","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/766780/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1585157006","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/766780/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1585157006","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"STAX!!!
