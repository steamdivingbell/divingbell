{"about_the_game":"Originally released in 1985, this innovative top-down shooter for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC from famed publishers Ocean Software saw players take control of Nemesis Organisation Mobile Attack Droid (N.O.M.A.D.) 471 in an attempt to stop the machinations of the unspeakably vile Cyrus T. Gross, the greatest criminal in the universe. Now, relive those days in this remastered emulated version, which contains both the Spectrum and Amstrad versions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>Pilot the N.O.M.A.D. through TALOS, Gross's heavily armoured homeworld, solving tricky puzzles, dodging deadly hazards, and shooting fiendish enemies. N.O.M.A.D. is controlled by rotating left and right, and providing either forward or backward thrust. This makes every level a challenging gauntlet, thankfully with regular checkpoints for progress.<br><br><br><br>This enhanced version introduces a number of modern features to this retro classic, including:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Saving/loading the game at any point<br></li><li> Support for most modern game controllers<br></li><li> Full control remapping<br></li><li> Image scaling and smoothing options</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2213260/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1673875267","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2213260/page.bg.jpg?t=1673875267","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2213260/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1673875267","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2213260/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1673875267","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Originally released in 1985, this innovative top-down shooter for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC from famed publishers Ocean Software saw players take control of Nemesis Organisation Mobile Attack Droid (N.O.M.A.D.) 471 in an attempt to stop the machinations of the unspeakably vile Cyrus T.
