In Monster Racing League the driving is streamlined and the focus is on combat. Select your monster and equip your abilities and boosters before each race.

Abilities have cooldown and recharge times so make sure you choose the right boosters for maximum impact! Master your racing skills with finer control using nitro, braking and steering (coming soon).<br><br>Get in on the action with races contested over short, multi rounds of mayhem with up to 10 players.
