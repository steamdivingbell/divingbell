Collect lost souls, upgrade your abilities using an skill tree or learn new ones, and remember to combine your abilities\u2019 elements wisely. Do whatever you can to give hell to Mega Goat Satan and his minions, and watch the malevolent demon hordes crawl back into the hole they came from, which will be all the more impressive thanks to one of the most massive and accurate physics systems ever created!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2614710/extras/gameplay_gif.gif?t=1733834057\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Crush Thy Enemies in Epic, Physics-Based Battles</h2>Complex physics simulation systems will make your epic battles against demons more massive and fun than ever. Thanks to the realistic object and environment behavior, enemies will react to your every move. Send the legions of Satan flying back into the abyss or watch as they fall from your attacks, crowd together, and push against each other before rushing back into battle while avoiding obstacles scattered around the arena.

Mix and match dozens of abilities and weapon types, from stakes and swords to drones and black holes! You can choose the ones that are right for you and then add some elemental buffs (fire, water, electricity, or ice) to make the deadliest build ever.

Stay alive on each level until you receive the Divine Assistance needed to descend.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Play as a Cyber Angel</h2>Take the side of Good as one of the tech-savvy cyber Angels, formless spirits gifted with intelligence, willpower, and might. Seraph is a melee heavy hitter who uses elemental buffs. The blind mage Cherub deals AoE damage and applies CC effects to his enemies. Meanwhile, the swift and spry hoverboard user Throne prefers to keep his distance and fire at the demons from afar.
