{"about_the_game":"Grab the Outbreak: Epidemic - Premium Content and intensify the apocalypse by unlocking full access to play as Gwen, Tom, Kara and Renault, as well as all of their available classes. This premium content also allows you to level up each of their classes to the maximum level through gameplay which unlocks additional buffs for your characters and team. Finally, this premium content allows you to start games on Biohazard and Nightmare difficulty.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNote: All available scenarios across the Campaign, Onslaught and Experiments Modes are available in the free-to-play version without this paid DLC. You can also start your own games on Easy or Normal difficulty in the free-to-play version without this DLC, as well as join and play in other people's games who are hosting on ANY difficulty level without this DLC. This DLC is required to host your own games on Biohazard or Nightmare difficulty though. Without this DLC, the free-to-play version will lock you into playing as a single survivor on their starting class only with limited opportunity to level up.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1104420/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1565728793","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1104420/page.bg.jpg?t=1565728793","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1104420/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1565728793","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1104420/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1565728793","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Outbreak: Epidemic contains violence and gore as your player character will fight monsters and undead with numerous melee and firearms."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Grab the Outbreak: Epidemic - Premium Content and intensify the apocalypse by unlocking full access to play as Gwen, Tom, Kara and Renault, as well as all of their available classes.
