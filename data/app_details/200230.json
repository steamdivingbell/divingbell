Terrain under the vehicle will act just like it does in real life, the car will sink in dirt, the dirt will create a rut and will stick to the car and tires affecting its handling. Stones will fly from underneath the wheels and damage other trucks. The game will feature various surfaces that will not only affect tire friction but have complex reactions based on car weight, speed, wheel torque, tire condition, time on this surface, depth of car immersion into the surface and much more.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features:</h2>\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Leading international off-road championships.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Racing and mud bogging.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Tough challenges and obstacles to beat.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Special off-road equipment and accessories (Lowered gearing, front/rear locking differentials, winch, etc.).<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/200230/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1681220124","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/200230/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1681220124","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/200230/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1681220124","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/200230/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1681220124","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Off-Road Drive</strong>, the off-road racing simulation for PC, is the first game ever to deliver a true-to-life, off-road, extreme racing experience.
