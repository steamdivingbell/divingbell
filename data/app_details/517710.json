{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">NEXT GENERATION AG RACING IS HERE!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Redout is a tribute to the old racing monsters such as F-Zero, WipeOut, Rollcage, and POD.</strong> It is designed to be an uncompromising, fast, tough and satisfying driving experience, soaked in that vertigo that stands at the core of the arcade racing genre. The floating system and driving models are based on physics: each turn, slope, hard braking, acceleration, each turn and twist of the track will apply a unique force to the ship. A sharp low-polygon style blends meshes and terrains with the latest state-of-the-art shading and lighting effects provided by the <strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong>, creating beautiful and instantly recognisable aesthetics. Breezy coastlines, eerie frozen landscapes, vast desert plains: the melancholic, dystopian atmosphere of a semi abandoned Earth is the background for the most high-speed, tense and beautiful futuristic racing clashes.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><u><strong>Features</strong></u></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Online multiplayer - match against 12 players around the world for a real challenge</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Optional VR Support - Oculus Rift, HTC Vive or OSVR.

It's not about the numbers you see on screen, it's about the vibrations, the landscape and buildings flying by, the high-speed collisions, the effects, the sounds, the immersion: everything is meant to feel like you're going FAST. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><u><strong>Online Multiplayer</strong></u></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Challenge up to 12 players from all over the world and find out who's the best Redout pilot in history!

Redout features believable physics derived from quad-copters controllers and real magnetic forces. We came up with the next generation in AG handling. There's always a way to face a corner without braking, but you have to prepare for it and use everything you've got. Steer, strafe and turbo out of a corner are the basics: upgrades and powerups will grant you even more control on your ship's behaviour. You'll need to dominate your ship before you face the advanced tracks.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><u><strong>Thriving Discord Community</strong></u></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Whatever you are in for a casual multiplayer match or just for some chitchatting during a break, the official Discord server is there for you!
