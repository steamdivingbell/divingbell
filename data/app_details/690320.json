{"about_the_game":"Snake-A-Roid is an Arcade style game that's been lost down the back of the sofa.<br>Featuring a clean vector-like style, and crunchy chip tune sound track, it evokes an era where

with multiple waves of asteroids and aliens, with an arena guardian to defeat.<br></li><li>Survival - pick an arena and chase that score, before your snake runs out of segments.<br></li><li>Boss Run - go toe to toe with all the arena guardians, one after the other, before facing off against The Badger.</li></ul><br>Multiple power-ups to feed your snake, including:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>3-way split shot<br></li><li>Faster bullets<br></li><li>Bigger bullets<br></li><li>Snake shield<br></li><li>Smart bombs<br></li><li>And the elusive extra life</li></ul>All of which stack up to turn your
