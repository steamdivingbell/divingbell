Each of the alternate solution unlock one of the possible achievements!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Also please note that there are many clues in the images, so inspecting items and scenes can hint about things you should consider doing - or not doing! -</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Crafting</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game requires you to build some new items from what can be found in the world, and by reading the various documents (books, notes, etc...) present in the game, you should be able to figure out all the necessary parts and how to assemble them.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Achievements and high scores</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game contains 48 possible achievements, about two thirds of them can be unlocked by completing the game. To unlock the remaining achievements you will have to try alternative solutions, but also find all the different ways you can fail to complete the mission: A game over may bring you closer to this objective!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Time limit</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game has a time limit of two hours (in game hours) to complete the mission.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The timer on the right of the screens ticks down in real time second by second, but moving around, inspecting items, crafting, etc... takes some time, so in practice a single play through will take about 30 to 45 minutes before the &quot;out of time&quot; game over triggers.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game will warn you half-way when one hour has elapsed.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3319780/extras/encounter_beep_beep.gif?t=1737884625\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p>","developers":["Defence Force"],"genres":[{"description":"Adventure","id":"25"},{"description":"Casual","id":"4"}],"header_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3319780/header.jpg?t=1737884625","is_free":false,"linux_requirements":[],"mac_requirements":[],"movies":[{"highlight":true,"id":257084724,"mp4":{"480":"http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/257084724/movie480.mp4?t=1735154845","max":"http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/257084724/movie_max.mp4?t=1735154845"},"name":"Fell in the pit -
