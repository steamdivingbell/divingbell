{"about_the_game":"<strong>Defy Gravity</strong> is an action platformer that is a mix between classic platforming and gravity based puzzle solving.  Kara, our heroine, has access to a unique gameplay mechanic that she uses to manipulate the world around her.  She has a gun that is able to alter the laws of physics through the creation of pockets of gravity and anti-gravity. By mastering the use of these abilities Kara is able to augment her jump in order to almost fly past obstacles. These powers can also be utilized to move objects that block her path and platforms that Kara stands on in order to traverse the levels.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features:</h2>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Unique physics engine that provides a never before experienced gameplay experience.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Xbox controller and keyboard/mouse support<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>24 unique levels<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>A second quest mode that radically changes the game and adds an additional 24 levels <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Custom Soundtrack<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>8 Steam Achievements<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Basic Training Complete","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/96100/e9f678474d473f075b414f86b4f95b8aa7d3df78.jpg"},{"name":"Gravity Apprentice","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/96100/efdceb0ed831f2dfcff7bad2a8c0cb8e9973ca29.jpg"},{"name":"Gravity Warrior","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/96100/f9f290cfc79303c76e95712cdb68cc3e545559c7.jpg"},{"name":"Master Gravitymancer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/96100/ef926c03766773aa27bf794d17321e95a504f292.jpg"},{"name":"Grand Master Gravitymancer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/96100/b6082e33463372d8abf30fff6426d5578d707e44.jpg"},{"name":"Gravitymancer Emperor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/96100/581c7dd9a185dcf3d376d7d60c298d9e6f8dcdfd.jpg"},{"name":"The True Challenge has just begun","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/96100/5d04ebea4a93eb6a056377516be302400a96b8a5.jpg"},{"name":"The One","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/96100/cf95315436a73add951614787f06b5a254abe0e3.jpg"}],"total":8},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/96100/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1562661240","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/96100/page.bg.jpg?t=1562661240","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/96100/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1562661240","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/96100/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1562661240","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>Defy Gravity</strong> is an action platformer that is a mix between classic platforming and gravity based puzzle solving.
