{"about_the_game":"Mazetools Soniface Lab Features<br />\r\n- Unlimited instruments (Mazes)<br />\r\n- Pattern mode to create unlimited scenes with different instruments and settings for songs and performances<br />\r\n- Visual Mode mit 1-3 Live-Video-Outputs for performance &amp; VJing <br />\r\n- Unlimited internal audio recording (.wav, up to 7.1).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKey Features <br />\r\n- Creative space to explore sound, music and geometric visuals <br />\r\n- Experiment with audio and visual objects and create your own scenes <br />\r\n- Operate controllers and play instruments via multitouch <br />\r\n- Motion interface to control instruments and parameters through gestures, movements and dance <br />\r\n- Cross-platform compatibility of project files <br />\r\n- Simple design for mobile devices, complex (regular) design for tablets and desktops <br />\r\n- Advanced in-app guide, FAQ &amp; help function in English and German <br />\r\n<br />\r\nInstruments <br />\r\n- Gridsynth - A generative, visual synthesizer for drones and melodies incl. sequencer &amp; arpeggiator <br />\r\n- Rhythm sequencer for sample- and synth-based basses and drums <br />\r\n- Spatial &amp; granular soundscape sampler incl. mic input, sample library and file integration <br />\r\n- Key interface for cross-instrument tonality incl. progression sequencer <br />\r\n- Interactive LivePad and keyboard for Gridsynth, Bass &amp; Sampler <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAutomation &amp; Connectivity <br />\r\n- Advanced controller automation incl. multi-touch editor, body tracking interface <br />\r\n- MIDI input and output <br />\r\n- Master FX and Ableton Link <br />\r\n- Normal mouse and keyboard support <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Pro version represents all capabilities of our yearlong development in terms of a creative progress. The Pattern Mode is the essential feature in the context of musical and performative application. Therefore you have a simple, editable list of Patterns on the main screen. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Pattern Mode enables to build scenes with several instruments and samplers, each with different main settings like tempo, pitch, main EQ, sequence length as well as motion tracking connections. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe additional Visual Interface gives you the possibility to design a whole new look for each scene. The visual corresponds to the sound as well as the motion interaction and main FX. In relation to your device it supports up to 3 display outputs with separate content. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSoniface Pro combines a modular concept with spatial audio abilities. This offers new approaches to audiovisual performances and interactive installations. The desktop version supports surround sound output up to 7.1 speakers. The objects on the display become positioned within the XY field of the surround room. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSoniface Pro does not refer to pro audio but allows you to use all facets of the software. As reference, you will find videos and music of our works (Ectoplastic) which were completely made with it, like multichannel audiovisual performances as will as our musical releases. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are a lot of pro features on our list and we are looking forward for the next update. Don't hesitate to write us your questions and feedback which we will answer personally.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInformation<br />\r\nWe do our best to avoid bugs, often enough we were disappointed when a set was lost. But after the update before the next one. So feel free to write us bugs and problems, definitely also if you made a song or video. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSoniface needs access to the camera for motion tracking, the microphone for audio recording, the local files to save projects and recordings, and the network for Ableton Link.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMuch more content, terms of use, credits and FAQ are in the app's guide and can be found in the app's start-up menu.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbout Mazetools <br />\r\nWe want to empower creativity, democratize musical expression and make it inclusive. These are promises to ourselves and to the future. Soniface is the cornerstone of this and just part of the solution. This is due to the app's history, practical influences from art and music, and project-oriented development. We see it as a process and that's why we have developed a roadmap to deliver on the promises, together with you and all users!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe are Stephan Klo\u00df and Jakob Gruhl, Ectoplastic from Halle/Leipzig, we first met in 1999 as teenagers to make hip hop and electronic music. Since then we are fascinated by music software and sharing our enthusiasm for it with people. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore than 10 years ago we started the Maze project - a software core of instruments and multimedia interfaces. Since then we have been dedicated to audiovisual connections, sound through movement and spatial audio. Through exchanges, sessions, research and development, and public funding, Maze became Mazetools.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur roadmap follows the goal of improving workflow, experience, energy consumption, and new features of our previous mapping tools Mutant and Soniface. We are always open to ideas and constructive feedback. In 2024, we have two new releases coming up, Mazetools Botany and Modyssey VR. We have developed these over the last three years.
