{"about_the_game":"The Koumi Line is a 78.9 km long line connecting Kobuchizawa Station in Hokuto City, Yamanashi Prefecture and Komoro Station in Komoro City, Nagano Prefecture. <br>The line was opened in 1919 by its predecessor, Saku Railway, between Koumi and Komoro Stations. In 1935, the line was extended to Kobuchizawa Station and opened to traffic. Since its opening, the Koumi Line has been a popular commuter rail line and a gateway to sightseeing in Kiyosato and Nobeyama.<br>The greatest feature of the Koumi Line is that it runs at high elevation. Between Kiyosato and Nobeyama stations, the line passes through the highest point on the JR line at 1,375 meters above sea level, and the nine stations between Kai-Koizumi and Matsubarako stations are among the nine highest elevation stations on the JR line, giving the line its nickname, &quot;Yatsugatake Kogen Line (Yatsugatake Plateau Line)&quot;.<br>Along the line, highland vegetables are cultivated at high altitude and in the cool summer climate, and near Nobeyama Station, the train runs through an expanse of highland vegetable fields.
