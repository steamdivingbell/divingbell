With over 60 carefully designed levels, each board will test your ability to think strategically. You\u2019ll need to master unique mechanics, adapt to traps, and solve increasingly complex challenges as you explore this world full of secrets.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">One day, you wake up in an unknown place, but the most unsettling thing isn\u2019t the forest around you... it\u2019s what you are. Transformed into a rabbit and with no clear memory of how you came to be this way, you begin a journey to understand what happened to you and why.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Fortunately, you won\u2019t be alone. Wisehop, a sage rabbit who seems to know the mysteries of this world, will guide you on your path. But the answers won\u2019t be easy to find, as each clue seems to lead to Zurza, a witch whose motivations are shrouded in darkness.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">To unravel the mystery, you must think like a rabbit. Solve puzzles by guiding each rabbit to their carrot, moving them carefully and precisely across different boards. Every jump and every move is one step closer to the truth... though not all secrets are meant to be uncovered.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3371710/extras/slimesGIF.gif?t=1734448841\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3371710/extras/caracteristicasIngles.png?t=1734448841\" /></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Master the art of strategic jumps:</strong> Control up to 4 rabbits at once, guiding them cleverly so each one reaches their precious carrot.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Explore a forest full of mysteries:</strong> Over 6 vibrant worlds, each with its own unique style and challenges.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Discover new ways to solve puzzles:</strong> In every world, an innovative mechanic will test your creativity and ingenuity.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Never get stuck:</strong> Access helpful hints from the options menu to continue your adventure without frustration.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Uncover the forest's secrets:</strong> Meet its inhabitants, discover hidden treasures, and follow the clues that lead to the truth.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Form bonds with memorable characters:</strong> Talk to Wisehop, the sage rabbit, and confront Zurza, the mysterious witch.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>A tribute to nostalgia:</strong> Experience this charming adventure with 16-bit graphics and a magical atmosphere that evokes the classics.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3371710/extras/pelotilla.gif?t=1734448841\" /></p></li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3371710/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734448841","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3371710/page.bg.jpg?t=1734448841","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3371710/ea3292aa1d87b77ce5c0804fae1dfab673dc6e1d/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734448841","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3371710/ea3292aa1d87b77ce5c0804fae1dfab673dc6e1d/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734448841","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3408730,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3371710/extras/acercaDe.gif?t=1734448841\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3371710/extras/acercaDeIngles.png?t=1734448841\" />Dive into a forest full of secrets, magic... and rabbits.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This puzzle game will challenge you to guide the rabbits to their precious carrots.
