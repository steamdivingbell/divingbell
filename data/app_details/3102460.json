{"about_the_game":"A stage-clearing 3D wire action game that tests your &quot;use of wire movement inertia&quot; and &quot;puzzle-solving skills.&quot;<br>The shapes of all 26 stages are based on various letters of the alphabet.<br>Complete the missions for each stage!<br><br><br><strong>In this game, mastering &quot;wire movement inertia,&quot; &quot;puzzle-solving skills,&quot; and &quot;precision control&quot; is crucial.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>What is Wire Movement?</strong></h2>You can perform wire movement by left-clicking to &quot;attach the wire&quot; and right-clicking (either repeatedly or holding down) to &quot;pull the wire.&quot;<br>The pulling force of the wire can be adjusted in 4 levels, allowing you to change your speed.<br>The wire can be attached at any distance without limitation, but if the wire touches a wall, it will retract, and you'll need to reattach it.<br>This allows you to enjoy aerial movement with simple controls.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3102460/extras/stagej.gif?t=1729393174\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>What Missions
