Rise of the Unreaps is a single-player exploration and story driven game for PC, Mac, and consoles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unreap Commander</h2>Soul Reaper: Unreap Commander is an asynchronous multiplayer version of Soul Reaper, focusing on monster team building as well as Soul Reaper's signature fast turn-based combat, and loot and souls systems.<br><br>Assemble teams of Unreaps and train them against pre-defined challenges, or compete online against other players' teams and earn epic loot and souls!<br><br>Some games that Soul Reaper might remind you of are:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Pokemon: (Once you're hooked on soul-collecting, you'll wanna reap 'em all)<br></li><li>Diablo: (Loot with more stats than you can shake a '+50% stick-shaking' stick at)<br></li><li>Final Fantasy: (Side view turn-based combat)<br></li><li>Castlevania: Aria/Dawn of Sorrow (Kill monsters, get souls!)</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Turn-based classic RPG style combat.
