{"about_the_game":"Telltale\u2019s third Sam &amp; Max season debuted in April 2010 under the name Sam &amp; Max: The Devil's Playhouse. Released after two years after the previous season, Sam &amp; Max: The Devil's Playhouse surprised fans with a new &quot;grittier&quot; look, a more cinematic presentation, console-style gamepad controls, and a serialized storyline that linked the five monthly episodes through a series of cliffhangers, building to an epic finale in August 2010.<br><br>Digital distribution was coming out of its infancy back then, but it was still in its early days. Graphics and audio had to be highly compressed to keep download sizes low, and the Devil's Playhouse episodes were designed to work on low-end computers to appeal to a mainstream audience.<br><br>In 2018, when Telltale went through liquidation, four of the studio\u2019s original employees formed Skunkape Games and acquired the rights to Telltale\u2019s Sam &amp; Max games. We've now finished remastering the complete trilogy, but we don't want the originals to be lost to time.<br><br>That\u2019s why we\u2019ve bundled the original episodes with our Sam &amp; Max: The Devil's Playhouse remaster. With this free DLC, you can play the original episodes as they were back in the day\u2014low screen resolution, compressed audio, warts and all!<br><br><strong>Due to insurmountable technical hurdles, these versions will not be updated and we can\u2019t provide tech support.</strong> (Difficulty fixing bugs in the old game engine is a main reason we\u2019re remastering the games in the first place!) We\u2019re making them available for historical preservation purposes only.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Bonus Features</h2>When these episodes first came out, people were very concerned about buying downloadable games without backup copies. To soften the blow, Telltale released a Sam &amp; Max: The Devil's Playhouse DVD at the end of the episodic run, complete with bonus features. We will soon be uploading most of these to our YouTube channel: bloopers, developer commentary, and more! You can also access them by clicking the &quot;Bonus Features&quot; button in the DLC launcher.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3162640/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1723831296","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3162640/page.bg.jpg?t=1723831296","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3162640/a3b0cc3c88b21f9e0dcbbf02d1aa1ee73c1ccfcb/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1723831296","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3162640/a3b0cc3c88b21f9e0dcbbf02d1aa1ee73c1ccfcb/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1723831296","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Telltale\u2019s third Sam &amp; Max season debuted in April 2010 under the name Sam &amp; Max: The Devil's Playhouse.
