{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Dream</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">DitherDream is a trippy little exploration game set across an archipelago of strange islands. Each island is a unique handcrafted explorable puzzle. Understanding each island allows you to transcend it, and reach deeper into The Archipelago.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Exploring The Archipelago</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When you begin, The Nest will have a single portal to a single island. However, the islands are all connected, and visiting one often allows you to create a permanent portal to it. Soon, your nest will be a garden of dozens of portals as you probe every corner of The Archipelago.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>How to Play</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">DitherDream controls like a typical first person game, and is generally enjoyable by those of all skill levels. The player must follow environmental clues to locate four objects on each island, and then click to attune to them. Upon the third attunement, a portal will open where the player entered the island, and expand until it covers the entire island. This portal will send the player back to their home, The Nest, if it catches them. The player must therefore plan and execute a path to reach the fourth attunement before the portal catches them.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The World Breathes</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Every pixel of The Archipelago is alive with bits of motion and flow, and learning to interpret that motion will serve you well. The sun, the water, the wind, and more all seek to guide you to your destination, all you need to do is watch them.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Comfortable and Customizable Play</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Ditherdream can be quite intense visually. With that in mind, there are settings available in the options menu to change the intensity of the color and motion separately and at any time. If you feel uncomfortable, you are able to tone things down, and if you want more, you can intensify the experience!</p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Way of Enclaves","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2735190/3c5011515b0587419afcbeb2bab8f12e616a7516.jpg"},{"name":"Way of Dust","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2735190/c3592fab5ef3a8e7c3bc1462fe788c0e6afe8ea4.jpg"},{"name":"Test of Dust","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2735190/c3592fab5ef3a8e7c3bc1462fe788c0e6afe8ea4.jpg"},{"name":"Court of Dust","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2735190/c3592fab5ef3a8e7c3bc1462fe788c0e6afe8ea4.jpg"},{"name":"Way of Harmony","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2735190/df04a1a316961055102d77968fffaceba6916d36.jpg"},{"name":"Test of Harmony","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2735190/df04a1a316961055102d77968fffaceba6916d36.jpg"},{"name":"Court of Harmony","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2735190/df04a1a316961055102d77968fffaceba6916d36.jpg"},{"name":"Way of Ones","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2735190/8431eb197ac5ddeed199319ca7892e47faf89d27.jpg"},{"name":"Shard of Ones","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2735190/8431eb197ac5ddeed199319ca7892e47faf89d27.jpg"},{"name":"Embassy of Ones","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2735190/8431eb197ac5ddeed199319ca7892e47faf89d27.jpg"}],"total":25},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2735190/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728788117","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2735190/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1728788117","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2735190/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728788117","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2735190/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728788117","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"Some of the islands are shaped a bit like adult humans that don't have clothes on.
