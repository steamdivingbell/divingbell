{"about_the_game":"<strong>Spelling Spree</strong> is a fast-paced multiplayer shooter centered around playing words on a game board.

Your only objective is to collect as many letter tiles as possible, but the other team has the same idea. You're both armed with powerful rifles, and if you've got extra letters to spare, you can lob them like grenades. Navigate the map, collect as many letters as you can, and pin down the enemy team to steal their letters and keep them lexically destitute.<br><br>In <strong>Board mode</strong>, you ascend to an overhead view, where you and your teammates can use the tiles you've collected to spell words on the map. A custom-built crossword engine helps determine legal moves, taking the 3D geometry of the map into account. An intuitive, gamepad-friendly interface ensures that you're able to play words at a breakneck pace: you'll never be staring blankly at a bunch of jumbled-up letters.
