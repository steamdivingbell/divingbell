{"about_the_game":"Bean: the Ultimate Clicker Game<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWelcome to the world of Bean, the clicker game that will have you wondering how beans became the most addictive thing since cat videos. In Bean, your mission is to click your way to bean glory. As you tap, click, and furiously smash that mouse button, you'll gather beans faster than you can say &quot;bean counter.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut wait, there's more! Bean isn\u2019t just about mindless clicking (okay, it mostly is, but bear with us). After a specific amount of time, your patience will be rewarded with mysterious inventory drops. What\u2019s inside, you ask? Could it be a golden bean? A magic bean? A can of baked beans? Who knows! The only way to find out is to keep clicking and praying to the bean gods.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeaturing:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAddictive Clicker Gameplay: Once you start, you won't be able to stop. Seriously, we've tried.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMysterious Inventory Drops: Because who doesn\u2019t love a good surprise? Especially when it involves beans.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, put on your bean boots, grab your clicking finger, and dive into the wonderfully weird world of Bean. May the beans be ever in your flavor!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2471670/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1720642191","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2471670/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1720642191","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2471670/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1720642191","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2471670/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1720642191","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Bean: the Ultimate Clicker Game<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWelcome to the world of Bean, the clicker game that will have you wondering how beans became the most addictive thing since cat videos.
