It is provided in DLC form as a convenience for those users who wish to experiment with it. It is complicated to set up, not suitable for all purposes, with no guarantee of success. If you are not comfortable with experimental software, that requires a lot of tweaking, and may not be suitable for your purposes, then please do not use it. It is not, under any circumstances, to be considered as &quot;production level quality&quot; software. It is open-source software, made by volunteers, in their free time.</p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What is the iVRy PSMoveServiceEx Tracker for SteamVR DLC?</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> <br>\u2022 It is a version of the PSMoveServiceEx software that has been customised to simplify installation and configuration for use with the iVRy Driver for SteamVR.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What is PSMoveServiceEx?</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> <br>\u2022 PSMoveServiceEx is a background service that manages multiple PSMove Controllers and PS3 Eye Cameras.
