{"about_the_game":"Longshot Universe is an arena shooter where you take control of a variety of space ships in the far reaches of space to fight it out with the opposing team.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMuch like other MOBA style games you choose a ship and work to take out the enemy base.  However, you build and customize your ship rather than picking from a predetermined set.  Based on your choices you may end up with an agile fighter with access to special flight maneuvers or a large tank able to move in and take the punishment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the game is three dimensional, the action takes place on three, two dimensional planes: a high, mid, and a low plane.  The main game play loop is like other MOBA-style games where you must fight your way over to the enemy base and destroy it before the other team destroys yours.  There is also a single player and co-op tower defense mode where you must defend your base against increasing hordes of the enemy.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/459770/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1519092471","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/459770/page.bg.jpg?t=1519092471","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/459770/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1519092471","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/459770/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1519092471","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Longshot Universe is an arena shooter where you take control of a variety of space ships in the far reaches of space to fight it out with the opposing team.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMuch like other MOBA style games you choose a ship and work to take out the enemy base.
