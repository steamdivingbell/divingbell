Bumble, our lowest difficulty, intends to ease players in so they can become comfortable with the controls and develop their own style of gameplay through a more forgiving experience.\ud83c\udf38<br>On Humble, the game picks up what we consider to be a proper challenge for players of all levels. We encourage new players to try and try again on Bumble so they may one day play through Humble, a massive accomplishment displaying developed reflexes and coordination at a high level!\ud83c\udf80 <br>Rumble is where things pick up and where long-time fans of the genre should look. Indicated with red hues, this is where the game stops being generous requiring high-speed reactions and clinical navigation to finish.\ud83c\udfb5      <br>For a final challenge, Crumble is our \u201cridiculous\u201d difficulty popular in the genre. We do not recommend players start here until they\u2019ve seen every pattern at least once as Crumble offers little time to learn and works to defeat you at every turn. You have been advised.\ud83c\udfb6 <br><br><strong>Idol Hell\u2019s Game Design</strong><br>For this game, we wanted to design in a way familiar to players of the genre while still developing a unique identity. The general pacing of the game is two waves of enemies introducing you to their attacks, a mid-boss that hints at the boss\u2019 attack, a final wave including a medley of all enemies, and the boss herself. <br>Each boss alternates between a Warm Up attack followed by a Performance attack. Warm Ups are simple in style, typically copying the behavior seen already in the stage, and each consecutive warm-up will be similar to the ones before it in some way. Performances follow a Warm Up and are noted by a change in the background. Performances are very unique with experimental attacks the Idol has come up with herself. This means the nature of the Performances may seem unpredictable at first but can be mastered with understanding and practice. Learning the tempo of waves, Warm-ups and Performances is key to beating the game!<br><br><strong>The Full Game Includes:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>4 Difficulty Levels!<br></li><li>4 Different Game Modes to Play!<br></li><li>6 Chapters!<br></li><li>7 Cute Robot Idols!<br></li><li>14 Songs Filled With Variety!<br></li><li>Hundreds Of Bullet Patterns!</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2067470/extras/Untitled_Artwork__19_.png?t=1729031482\" />","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2067470?t=1729031482","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2067470/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1729031482","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2067470/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729031482","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2067470/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729031482","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":2068470,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<h1>Kickstarter FULLY FUNDED!!</h1><p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Thank you everyone who made this possible!
