You will fight the battles on star systems with unique abilities that can mess up the battlefield. Sometimes they will drop shields from your starships, sometimes they will have the planetary defense system that will be able to damage or destroy your starships, and sometime you will find the exploding star. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFortunately, you will have at your disposal 5 completely different species. <br />\r\nYou will start as a Human race. This is the most universal race focused on short and long ranged weapons with special modules that can overload the enemy's shield. <br />\r\nWhile your galaxy trip, you will be able to play each race that you will defeat. <br />\r\nThere is a Swarm - one mind, organic ships that can heal themselves, Acolytes - a race focused on technology that can mask their ships, Hybrids - the combination of technology and biotechnology, and Strators - a young race whose tactics are based on a cooperation between their starships. There is also the BO'. A high-tech ancient race that really will be helpful with defeating the elders.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile your play the game cards will be crucial.
