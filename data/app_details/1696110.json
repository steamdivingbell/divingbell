Just hitting &quot;attack&quot; over and over should hopefully be a terrible strategy after the 2nd or 3rd floors. A lot of fun mechanics are in place to give you lots of choice in battles, such as unique limited use abilities for main characters, the ability to charge up your attacks and buffs, and weakness protection that you will absolutely want to be breaking as much as you can.<br><br>Upon death, you'll lose everything except for any saved coin. You'll also keep any town unlocks, and if you're a farmer there's probably some fruit and veggies waiting for whatever new character you've chosen!","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1696110?t=1644520454","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1696110?t=1644520454","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1696110/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1644520454","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1696110/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1644520454","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong><i><u>Although progress was delayed significantly, work has resumed.</u></i></strong><br><br>Always a New Journey is a very early development rpg rogue-lite.<br>Inspiration comes from a lot of 90's jrpgs, and some new ones.<br><br>You'll choose one of four characters to start, with four more that can be unlocked.<br>Take your chosen hero through random floors of the dungeon to unlock more companions, things to craft, and upgrades for your town hub.<br>Or if you get strong enough, maybe even reach the top.<br><br>Combat takes place in a side view turn battle system familiar to any final fantasy or jrpg fan.<br>Heavy emphasis will be put on making the battles difficult enough to require strategic thought.
