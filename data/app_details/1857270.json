{"about_the_game":"What might the future have in stock for us? Well, if you go by WinLu\u2019s Cyberpunk Exterior Tileset Pack, it will be both dark and gritty but also progressive, with some preserved trees, impressive futuristic cars and many many neon signs!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith a wide and creative range of autotiles you will get the perfect base for diverse and engaging cities, with a broad selection of tiled floors and all different kinds of walls. Even if your game is \u201cjust\u201d modern and not futuristic, you will find some very nice pieces you might want to use here!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe additional tiles fit the Cyberpunk theme perfectly with every kind of decoration you can think of. There are windows with darkened and lit versions, or even a pane with optional bullet holes for a really rough part of town. You can add gritty fire exit stairs to your multi story buildings and have some trash bins stand around in their backyards, as well as visit the local market to buy some fresh produce or futuristic guns\u2026 or both! On top of the tileset sheets, you also get a huge number of different doors that could lead to many interesting places.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo go ahead and check out this amazing pack, you will not regret it<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIncludes:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* 12 Characters sheets, 9 tile sheets, and 2 parallaxes<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTerms of Use:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* This pack is for use in RPG Maker Series or the engine of your choice.<br />\r\n* OK to be used in Commercial projects<br />\r\n* Contents can be edited<br />\r\n* OK for use in games with gore<br />\r\n* OK for use in adult-rated games","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1857270/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1681237254","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1857270/page.bg.jpg?t=1681237254","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1857270/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1681237254","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1857270/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1681237254","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"What might the future have in stock for us?
