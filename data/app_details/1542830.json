{"about_the_game":"Play as a super skilled combatant, with superhuman speed and agility. Fight against merciless demons, while dashing and jumping to dodge evil traps through carefully designed levels.<br><br>In this DEMO, you can play a careful selection of 4 handcrafted levels.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Infinite ammunition always</h2>The focus of <i>Humanless</i> is on the fun of shooting and platforming. You don't need to save the ammo of your favorite weapon: pull the trigger as much as you wish and have fun watching low resolution demons being shattered to pieces.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fast and responsive movements on the controller that suits you best</h2>Enemies shooting with a real intention to kill and pits of acid waiting to be jumped through will require of you a lot of dexterity. For this reason, <i>Humanless </i>allows you to play both on the joystick or using the keyboard and mouse.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Carefully designed levels</h2>Each level was carefully designed and tested to be unique, fun and challenging yet fair. Checkpoints after each section ensure that your progress will never be lost.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">20 Levels distributed in three episodes</h2>Start in a <strong>devastated city</strong>, enter questionable <strong>military research labs</strong>, and attempt to finish your journey going down to the <strong>hell itself</strong>.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">An elegant action platformer</h2><strong>No</strong> walls of text of story. <strong>No</strong> infinite repetitions of the same section of a level. In <i>Humanless</i>, each level is unique and brings something new, providing an experience that stays fresh throughout the whole game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1542830/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1654700992","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1542830/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1654700992","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1542830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1654700992","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1542830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1654700992","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Play as a super skilled combatant, with superhuman speed and agility.
