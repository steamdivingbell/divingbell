{"about_the_game":"Math Game is a logic game for the speed of solving simple math problems.<br />\r\nThe game is a simple interface, where the player is presented with a problem divided into sections and given four options for solving it, one of which must be substituted into an empty section. There is also a timer during which you must have time to choose the correct solution to the problem. Over time, the timer gets smaller, and the tasks are more varied and you need to try to keep up with the game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1872730/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1699094893","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1872730/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1699094893","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1872730/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1699094893","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1872730/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1699094893","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Math Game is a logic game for the speed of solving simple math problems.<br />\r\nThe game is a simple interface, where the player is presented with a problem divided into sections and given four options for solving it, one of which must be substituted into an empty section.
