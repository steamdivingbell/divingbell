{"about_the_game":"Chemical Sort is a science-themed casual puzzle in which you unscramble various colored chemicals by sorting them into their own test tubes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFresh from the centrifuge, your chemical samples need to be sorted, but you can only pour a chemical onto itself or you risk remixing the solutions (except with the help of a little &quot;time travel&quot; to undo). Get all the colors into their own test tubes to win. Speed things up by selecting multiple vials with the same chemical on top and move them all at once. Plan ahead and keep your vial selected after a move to use the next chemical right away.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach game is randomly generated, but you're in control of the challenge level by selecting how many chemicals you want. For added difficulty, try a hidden match where the only way to know what's in tube is to uncover it. Don't worry if you get into trouble, just add an extra helper vial to hold a small amount of chemical.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCustomize your experience by changing any color to whatever you want and if you still have trouble telling them apart, turn on the symbols for a little more visibility.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2526670?t=1692204694","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2526670?t=1692204694","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2526670/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1692204694","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2526670/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1692204694","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Chemical Sort is a science-themed casual puzzle in which you unscramble various colored chemicals by sorting them into their own test tubes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFresh from the centrifuge, your chemical samples need to be sorted, but you can only pour a chemical onto itself or you risk remixing the solutions (except with the help of a little &quot;time travel&quot; to undo).
