{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Defender's Quest is a Tower-Defense/RPG Hybrid (Think Final Fantasy Tactics meets Tower Defense).

Each character levels-up, learns skills, and equips gear individually, allowing the player to customize their battle experience and strategy.

Game speed is adjustable, and commands can even be issued while the game is paused.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">It also features an engaging, character-driven story written by an actual English major!
