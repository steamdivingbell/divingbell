I believe demos are great for people to try out an experience and see if it resonates with them without committing to a price point.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Why I made this</h2><br>Over the past 9 months, I created Shivering Hearts by myself with RPG Maker MV in my free time to show my artistic skills. I also wanted to create something that brings back the magic that I sorely miss from old school 1990s PC RPGs like Baldur's Gate 2, Fallout 1, 2, and Planescape; Torment. CLANNAD, Undertale, LISA: the Painful RPG, and Oneshot were also huge influences. <br><br>Role Playing Games can be so much more than combat, stats, character builds and optimal play (however, I still value these game design aspects very, very much). I wanted to challenge myself to see if I can still create an engaging experience that doesn't have combat or leveling mechanics, within a 1 month period. That turned into 10 months. I wanted to make a game with deep conversation trees, memorable characters and an emotionally touching story. RPG Maker MV allowed me to create and bug-test very intricate dialogue trees that match the quality and scale of those older titles but at the fraction of the development time and with plenty of polish. I hope that I have done those games justice.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1351820/extras/Demo_Gif_1.gif?t=1595890797\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1351820/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1595890797","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1351820/page.bg.jpg?t=1595890797","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1351820/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1595890797","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1351820/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1595890797","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":1356150,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1351820/extras/Intro_Gif_1.gif?t=1595890797\" /><br><br>Explore a unique fantasy setting with your childhood friend, Rin, and uncover what ills are plaguing the village of Shivering Hearts.<br><br>Become enraptured by a colourful cast of characters and experience beauty, heart-ache, romance, death, hope, nihilism, betrayal, regret, loss, and maybe even help someone on the verge of complete mental collapse.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1351820/extras/Mortal_Gif_2.gif?t=1595890797\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Beautifully detailed, hand-drawn watercolour landscapes and characters.</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>An emotionally gripping story that reacts to your choices.</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Meet a cast of 17 characters, each with their own personalities, goals and dreams.</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The game is a complex web of intricate dialogue choices and cascading consequences.
