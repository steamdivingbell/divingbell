{"about_the_game":"A Journey Through Valhalla was developed by three friends in their spare time and is by no means a AAA game.

Level up and build your character with our advanced skill tree and powerful weapons.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Co-op</h2><br>Don't worry if you can't handle the boss alone. Just bring a friend or two along to keep the boss occupied while you stab him in the back. But make sure not to accidentally stab your friends while you're at it!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dying</h2><br>Death is not the end. Each try will get you and your team closer to your goal. You probably want to change tactics if you keep on dying though. Also, watch out for that friendly fire!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Looting</h2><br>Look for the loot to find a host of powerful weapons, and useful armor to protect you in battle.
