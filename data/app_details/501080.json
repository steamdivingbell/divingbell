Enjoy the beautiful Barents Sea and make your fishing industry dreams come true.<br><br>Learn how to catch different kinds of fish with various fishing equipment on several different boats. Every method is easy to learn, but hard to master \u2013 time to show what you are made of!<br><br>Use officially licensed Scanmar equipment like door sensors and the TrawlEye to have complete control over your trawl. Upgrade it to make sure you get the biggest catch! But be sure to stay under your yearly fishing quotas, every step and every fishing run needs to be planned. 20 years of weather data recreate a realistic environment for the schools of fish in the Barents Sea, which move according to season and water temperature.
