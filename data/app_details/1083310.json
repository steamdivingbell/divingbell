The quality, depth, and acceptance of indie metroidvanias like Axiom Verge &amp; Hollow Knight proved what can be achieved by small teams or even single persons. Those developers inspired me to allocate even more personal resources and dedication to the project so it could eventually evolve into something really special.<br><br>As a father, daytime employee, and gamer myself I loved how progression and iteration were tackled in outstanding indie platformer Celeste, so <strong>OUTBUDDIES</strong> was designed to provide challenging and encouraging gameplay while skipping punishing throwbacks and grinding mechanics in total.
