{"about_the_game":"Play as Bob, a floppy little guy and knockout enemy 'Bobs'. At first Bob isn't very stable or very strong but as you take down more 'Bobs' you will gain strength and stability. Use this new strength to drag down larger 'Bobs' and knock them out with punches. As your strength increases you will start to be able to pickup and throw items and even other 'Bobs' anywhere you like. But beware because the other 'Bobs' are not stupid; they will also use their strength and fists to try and knock you down. Take enough knockdowns or fall off the level and you'll be sent to 'Beaven' (Bob + Heaven) and have to restart the level.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven if you're not the 'smartest Bob in the bucket' (common saying), you can become the strongest Bob in the bucket. But Why? You'll need as much strength as you can get to take down the final giant Bob in each level. After you have successfully knocked down or thrown the final Bob off the level, you will unlock new juicy levels to take your combat to new heights or depths.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnlock different game modes by gaining points each time you complete a new level. Practice your skills in an endless sandbox of Bob fighting! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nKey Features <br />\r\n- Bob<br />\r\n- The ability to grab and pickup items with your hands<br />\r\n- Swinging on ropes <br />\r\n- Punching <br />\r\n- Bobs<br />\r\n- Multiple exciting levels<br />\r\n- Different sized Bobs","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3015380/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1717172187","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3015380/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1717172187","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3015380/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1717172187","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3015380/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1717172187","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Play as Bob, a floppy little guy and knockout enemy 'Bobs'.
