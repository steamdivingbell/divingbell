{"about_the_game":"Discover the mysteries of the island and form a tribe to survive the impending volcano eruption. Gather everything you will need to survive after the disaster. Soon the island will be full of life again and you can rebuild.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Veil of the Volcano you will be born into a tribe living in the shadow of a devastating volcano. You will learn about the world around you and build a tribe that can work together to survive. Once the volcano blows its top you'll want to run and hide, because it could cause the entire island to burn to the ground. It won't grow back until the Spring, so be sure to think ahead. You only get one chance to build up your knowledge, teach others in your group and collect the supplies needed to last through the hardship.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnderstanding is unlocked upon becoming a toddler. From here the rest of the tree is unlocked as knowledge points are acquired. Everything a player does gives some knowledge points, and specific tasks give more to specific areas. Example; crafting items gives more knowledge to the crafting branch. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is an education system in the game that allows players to teach other players in their tribe. At lower levels they are able to pass on small amounts of knowledge on basic skills to individual players, but at higher levels they are able to pass on massive amounts of knowledge to large groups. A master educator can also craft items that will assist other players with gaining knowledge. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe volcano that looms over the island may go off at any time, and when it does parts or all of the island may be destroyed. If you and your tribe haven\u2019t prepared for this event, you may be in for a very hard winter. Regardless of when the volcano erupts, the majority of island plant life will not grow back until the Spring.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1728260/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1671684962","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1728260/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1671684962","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1728260/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1671684962","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1728260/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1671684962","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"This game includes violent acts like attacks on other players and animals, and the players are able to breed."},"detailed_description":"Discover the mysteries of the island and form a tribe to survive the impending volcano eruption.
