{"about_the_game":"<i>The Colossus Is Coming</i> is the 2nd full-length LP by American Musician Conner Rush, also known by the band name Auric Echoes.  Coming almost a year after the music project's soundtrack for the FYRE Games' walking simulator <i>Summerland</i>, Auric Echoes takes center-stage this time around.  Recording over the course of 2 years, <i>The Colossus Is Coming</i> is an art rock / experimental rock record with many influences from contemporary jazz, electronica, post-punk, noise rock, hip-hop, and many other genres, blending all of them into a unique listening experience.  This LP tells a chilling, haunting narrative surrounding topics of anxiety, time and decay, neuroticism, complexities of relationships, religion, and how that all relates to the question of &quot;what does it mean to live life to the fullest?&quot;<br><br>You're highly encouraged to derive your own meaning from this record.  There are no real wrong answers<br><br>I'd like to thank everybody who's taken the time to listen to my newest musical project.  It's always nice to delve back into music after a big video game project (<i>Summerland</i>).  I really hope you all will continue to support me through my different artistic endeavors as I continue to evolve and improve.  If you haven't, I implore you to give The Colossus Is Coming: The Interactive Experience a look.  While it's not an integral piece of the album as a whole, it's a great expansion of the story and themes of it.  I really hope I can continue to make you all proud :).<br>- Conner Rush / Auric Echoes","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1648950/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1636129202","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1648950/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1636129202","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1648950/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1636129202","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1648950/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1636129202","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<i>The Colossus Is Coming</i> is the 2nd full-length LP by American Musician Conner Rush, also known by the band name Auric Echoes.
