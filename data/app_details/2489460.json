{"about_the_game":"This is a card-based Roguelite game that combines farming and tower defense elements. In this fictional world, you play as a farmer sent to a deserted island to grow crops. While farming, you'll also need to build defense towers to fend off small animals that try to steal your food every night. During the tower defense phase, each cycle rewards you with a new island plot to plan your route and expand your farmland. Along the way. There are many desert islands and stranded islanders in the ocean. After linking them, you can turn the desert into an oasis, rescue the islanders, and receive additional rewards..
