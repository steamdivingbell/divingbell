The long struggle between people and corporations left the megacorps as overlords, ruling over the broken remnants of humanity huddled together in vast urban sprawls. But with no law or government beyond corporate boards, the underworld thrives. You are a Shell Runner using lifelike Shells to carry out wet work for anyone willing to pay. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Shell Runner is a top-down tactical shooter hybridized with looter shooter and extraction games. Every run can make you rich - but lose your Shell and you lose all that. Experience high-risk runs as a solo merc - or find allies and face the seedy underbelly of a dystopian future in cooperative mode. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2622280/extras/SHELL-steam-about-en.gif?t=1737042446\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2622280/extras/SHELL-steam_description_header-life-english.png?t=1737042446\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Shells are remotely controlled bodies that blur the line between man and machine.
