{"about_the_game":"Lost and alone in a snow-smothered valley, surrounded by beauty yet mired in terrible danger; your story may be your own, but it will end like all the others. <br><br><i>Into the Wild</i> is a tense yet tranquil survival game where nature holds nothing back. Inspired by the Norwegian hinterlands, the haunting valley of Jegersdal offers a faithful survival experience. Witness the magnificent aurora, scavenge from the remains of those who came before and find whatever means you can to prolong the inevitable end. <br><br><strong><u>Learn to Survive</u></strong><br>Unprepared and unready, you must equip and arm yourself as fast as you can if you hope to endure the perils of Jegersdal. Find shelter and clothes to ward off the cold, food to sate ever-present hunger and tools to orient yourself in an unfamiliar environment. <br><br><strong><u>Reactive Music</u></strong><br>Immersion reaches new heights in the survival genre with music that listens to the player as much as the player listens to it. Certain actions will cause the music to react as it measures the player\u2019s <i>intention</i>, not only the consequences of their choice. Furthermore, when the weather changes, so too does the symphony of the valley - and you would be wise to listen.<br><br><strong><u>Uncover Lost Mysteries</u></strong><br>Littered throughout the valley are messages, notes, journals and other documents, left by those who came before you. Sequestered away in ragged shelters, derelict shacks and dismal caves, the secret history of Jegersdal is just waiting to be discovered. But be warned - piecing together the harrowing tales of the valley\u2019s inhabitants is no easy task, and you must employ every tool at your disposal if you wish to do so before your own story comes to its inexorable end.  <br><br><strong><u>Surrendering to the Wild</u></strong><br>Death comes; it is only a matter of time. Starvation and freezing are reflected by real-world thresholds for an intuitive experience. Much like in real life, however, there are many ways to miscalculate your odds of survival, and every mistake could prove fatal. Survive for as long as you can to discover the full breadth of Jegersdal - and all of its grim tales from the survivors before you. On higher difficulties, death is permanent, and the consequences of your actions become even more extreme. <br><br><strong><u>Unwanted Visitor</u></strong><br>Jegersdal does not permit trespassers. Weather and temperature effects fluctuate frequently, and must be accounted for when setting out on your endeavors. Through understanding Mother Nature\u2019s fickle whims and forfeiting yourself to them, you might just prolong your inevitable fate.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"What Happened Here?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3015260/f9cb575115711352961d1fb5299eeba0ec2d5b1d.jpg"},{"name":"Picking up the Pieces","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3015260/5ead18d6412a4427ced92d4193551843a15f6e6f.jpg"},{"name":"Pieces in Place","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3015260/5c3c52e21e53f2db7ece07b42543ab8dff9d72dc.jpg"},{"name":"What is this Place?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3015260/f55d1ea9f00008231b4d1773bc76dcd3425fed80.jpg"},{"name":"Well Travelled","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3015260/58d8b280977c67b4c3a63c8c73dad9e0eff984ef.jpg"},{"name":"Arctic Explorer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3015260/fc3979e1e56e7959477b976b2feaee51049759f5.jpg"},{"name":"Into the Wild","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3015260/6b558d58f39ffb965e57493631efd7821065fddc.jpg"},{"name":"Wilderness Expert","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3015260/e96fbc6010b9e7a35bb1cdee6a197132bb926245.jpg"},{"name":"Born Survivor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3015260/b613891265e8587626d78ffc946f9d9b36845cd0.jpg"},{"name":"Fade to Black","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3015260/3308de68be56443a8c850e38e0df4d716d236b35.jpg"}],"total":12},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3015260/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1722895258","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3015260/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1722895258","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3015260/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1722895258","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3015260/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1722895258","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Lost and alone in a snow-smothered valley, surrounded by beauty yet mired in terrible danger; your story may be your own, but it will end like all the others. <br><br><i>Into the Wild</i> is a tense yet tranquil survival game where nature holds nothing back.
