{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">3DMark CPU Profile </h2><br>The 3DMark CPU Profile introduces a new approach to CPU benchmarking. Instead of producing a single number, the 3DMark CPU Profile shows you how your CPU\u2019s performance changes and scales with the number of cores and threads used.  <br><br>The 3DMark CPU Profile has six tests that help you benchmark and compare CPU performance for gaming and other activities. Run all six tests for a more complete view of CPU performance. <br><br>For overclockers, the 3DMark CPU Profile gives you more ways to measure the effects of your overclocking and more ways to compete for the highest scores! <br><br><strong>Max-threads test </strong><br>The Max-threads score represents the full performance potential of your CPU when using all available threads, the ideal benchmark for the latest high-core-count processors. <br><br><strong>16-threads test </strong><br>Computationally intensive tasks such as digital content creation and 3D rendering benefit from more threads.  <br><br><strong>8-threads test </strong><br>The performance of modern DirectX 12 games usually correlates most closely with the 8-threads score. <br><br><strong>4-threads test</strong> and <strong>2-threads test</strong> <br>The frame rates of older games developed for DirectX 9 usually correlate with the 2-threads or 4-threads score. <br><br><strong>1 thread test</strong><br>The 1-thread score is a fundamental measure of your processor's performance.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1654370/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736857019","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1654370/page.bg.jpg?t=1736857019","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1654370/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736857019","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1654370/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736857019","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">3DMark CPU Profile </h2><br>The 3DMark CPU Profile introduces a new approach to CPU benchmarking.
