{"about_the_game":"You and your fellow prisoner are trapped in the realm of Castle Rock - were you betrayed, or simply not that clever? To escape, you must explore the sinister castle for puzzles and plot your escape together. Secrets and riddles are hidden in the shadows.

Freeing yourselves from your cells and escaping the Keep is only the beginning - but does one truly escape Castle Rock?  Fresh mysteries await, and you\u2019ll have to make some choices about how to proceed. Your journey leads from the dark prison through the royal halls to the outside. Outside the Keep, you will discover the story of Rockbury, it\u2019s inhabitants, and plans of a resistance formed against the King to escape this icy place. Hope will lead you on to an eerie Graveyard and have you descend down into the dark waters of the Foundry.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1341290/extras/WWHF_STEAM_Gif2_Optimized.gif?t=1733180049\" /><br>You two have been brought here for a purpose.
