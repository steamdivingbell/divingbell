{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Overview</h2><br>Star Scum is a deckbuilding card battler mixed with a tactics game where two ships battle each other using cards, units and ship equipment. Players take turns spending their command points to play cards and control their units and ship equipment in battle across both ships. They must balance offense and defense and make careful use of their command points to outwit their opponent and destroy the enemy ship's core.<br><br>The tiles of each side's ship define their stats, such as the amount of moves the player can make each turn and the maximum amount of power they can have, among others.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Roguelike Mode</h2><br>In the singleplayer roguelike mode, you start with a basic deck and a small ship and travel across the map, battling procedurally generated opponent decks and upgrading your own deck with the cards of your defeated enemies. Players make their way from station to station, upgrading their ship, buying new cards and picking up and delivering dangerous cargo cards for extra cash. Challenging boss card decks guard each section of the map!<br><br>Each run is completely different as the ships and decks you fight are procedurally generated and the map is dotted with random event cards which add unexpected and sometimes tide-turning twists to the battle.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiplayer Mode</h2><br>In the multiplayer mode, players build custom decks from all available cards in the game and battle each other in ranked online battles. In this mode, each player gets an equal amount of credits to spend on their ship upgrades and deck cards.<br><br>A local AI battle mode is also available for practice.
