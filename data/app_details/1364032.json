{"about_the_game":"Operate iconic Steam excursions across Britain with Bossman Games\u2019 Merchant Navy Class 35028 \u2018Clan Line\u2019, as preserved today in the classic BR Green livery!<br><br>The Merchant Navy Class dates back to the 1940s, it was designed by Oliver Bulleid to be a fleet of express passenger locomotives for the Southern Railway. They featured a 4-6-2 wheel configuration, giving them their nickname \u201cBulleid Pacifics\u201d, although not to be confused with \u201cBulleid Light Pacific\u201d, as that was another design built after it transpired that the Merchant Navy was too heavy for some lines.<br><br>The other nickname attributed to the class is \u201cSpam Can\u201d, thanks to the air-smoothing casing that adorned the sides of the locos. It was intended that this smoothing would lift exhaust gases from the loco, and make cleaning easier with the locos fitting in carriage washes better. Unfortunately, the smoothing introduced other issues, maintenance was more challenging and smoke would often cling to the loco body, severely reducing driver\u2019s visibility.<br><br>As a result, in the 1950s the decision was taken to rebuild the fleet, during which the smoothing would be removed and valve gear would be updated. This brought an end to the fleet\u2019s unique design, but produced a set of much improved locomotives that would excel on routes such as the South Western Main Line until the end of the steam era.<br><br>The class was withdrawn between 1964 and 1967, having been superseded by Warship diesel locomotives on the line to Exeter via Salisbury. Miraculously though, just over 1/3 of the fleet was saved from the scrapyard.<br><br>One of those locomotives is 35028 \u2018Clan Line\u2019 which was saved and lovingly restored by the Merchant Navy Locomotive Preservation Society. Under MNLPS ownership, Clan Line has been working on the mainline on tours and excursions since 1974, and has since hauled the British Pullman, visited rails far beyond its operational network, and even hauled the Royal Train in 2018.  Based at Stewarts Lane TMD in Battersea, Clan Line is regularly seen in London and the south of England, and can now be experienced in full authenticity thanks to the hard-working efforts of Bossman Games!<br><br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2><br>A total of 6 Career scenarios are included, 2 for the South Western Main Line: Southampton - Bournemouth route and 4 for the Welsh Marches: Newport - Shrewsbury route:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>[35028] The Bournemouth Belle - Part 1<br></li><li>[35028] The Bournemouth Belle - Part 2<br></li><li>[35028] Welsh Marches Express - Part 1<br></li><li>[35028] Welsh Marches Express - Part 2<br></li><li>[35028] Welsh Marches Express - Part 3<br></li><li>[35028] Welsh Marches Express - Part 4</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on the Steam Workshop online and in-game.
