{"about_the_game":"For players using the English version, I'm sorry that the F1 button help does not have an English version, so I will list the corresponding content in the following description<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA casual game designed to experience the feeling of winning or losing a real sword. The enemy and player are on the same starting line, and both sides use the same mechanism to play games. Without hard opponents, there is no high value, and both sides are completely fair in the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a game that is difficult for ordinary players, and some players may find it relatively simple. However, it is stated in advance that before fully mastering the adversarial mechanism, you may feel a sense of frustration and must also learn combo methods from monsters during the process of death. Please think carefully before downloading.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are complex move release systems in the game, with a bit of Roguelike (random store) and a bit of growth system (random growth).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor brave players who want to try this category of games for the first time, please be sure to drag to the bottom to watch the guide description, which can effectively improve your gaming experience!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nF1 is the help in the game, and the specific button operations can be directly viewed from the help interface. TAP can see the unlocked skills and button methods.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nF2 can take on BOSS challenges. The BOSS in the challenge level will be stronger than those in the main level, and it comes with superior (or inferior) environment scenarios. If you feel that the challenge is not enough, you can challenge the BOSS!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter clearance, screenshots of the second level scene where the character is located can be sent to the customer service email. When a certain number of people pass, the content of the second level can be published as soon as possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe will continue to update gameplay and levels, and add new combat methods and skill modules in the future.<br />\r\nAll bugs, feedback or suggestions related to the game can be sent to the customer service email and will be continuously optimized when available.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf the frame drops, you can try to find a 'save point' nearby and restart the game to effectively alleviate the frame drop (not metaphysics, which is related to the optimization solution I am currently using). If it still cannot be solved, you can provide feedback on the area and configuration information where the screenshot is located, so that the author can confirm the areas with poor optimization.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs long as someone plays the game, it has value, and earning or not is added value!

Dodge can interrupt any offensive or defensive behavior, which can quickly cancel your attack recovery<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2. During an enemy attack, you can press and hold the right mouse button, and the character will automatically enter defense during the gap between enemy combo errors, interrupting the enemy combo (you are very confident in your own operation, and you can also use the enemy's actions to determine the defense timing and trigger precise defense)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3. Don't be impatient during the Footsies stage. If you make a mistake in the combo, please distance yourself as soon as possible<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4. Don't face multiple enemies at the same time, don't turn your back on your enemies!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n5. Do not engage in ineffective attacks during enemy defense, otherwise the enemy will dominate and counterattack during the attack gap!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n6. The concept of combo is to keep the enemy in a state of being attacked and stagger continuously! When the enemy breaks away from the stagger, please judge it as a combo error<br />\r\n<br />\r\n7. When the enemy is in stagnant air, the counterattack ability will be significantly reduced!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n8. Enemies standing on the ground are subject to less buoyancy than those in the air. For example, when an enemy is hit on the ground, it can only rise by 2 meters, and when it is hit in the air, it can reach 4 meters<br />\r\n<br />\r\n9.
