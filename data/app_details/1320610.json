{"about_the_game":"Patrick's Parabox is a mind-bending puzzle game that explores a unique recursive system of boxes within boxes within boxes within boxes. Learn to manipulate the world's structure by pushing boxes into and out of each other. Wrap your head around what happens when a box contains itself, and learn to use infinity to your advantage. Explore more mechanics and recursive twists as you delve deeper and deeper into the system. It's boxes all the way down.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1320610/extras/steam_gif_1.gif?t=1689733545\" /><br><br>The game has over 250 hand-crafted puzzles, which are designed to make you think, but also to guide you and showcase the beauty of the system.
