The world map takes inspiration from Slay the Spire, with the intent of providing a great variety of events. The combat is inspired by Dicey Dungeons, but instead of dice, we use playing cards.

Additionally, Poker Quest is a game that you can play to hone your skills at determining card probabilities, but while playing a fantasy RPG. With enough practice on the hardest difficulties, the answers to questions like &quot;What are the chances they have a Spade in those two cards?&quot; can become second nature to you.
