This genre is one I know well having worked on Atari ST/Amiga games like Kenny Dalglish Soccer Manager and Gazza's Super Soccer \u2013 it's hard to believe that these titles are now over 25 years old! So Movie Studio Boss was born and released around 2001 on our experimental website/shop PlaceforGames.<br><br>Jump forward to 2014 and I thought it would be fun to get back into writing games again. So what to do first? I thought it would be sensible to update some of my old titles and as Movie Studio Boss was always a favourite I thought I'd start with that one. Movie Studio Boss is certainly showing it's age \u2013 I'm pretty sure Hollywood doesn't release too many titles on video now! Plus technically it's screen resolution was fixed at 800 x 600 \u2013 which looks like a postage stamp on modern computer screens. So MSB The Sequel it is. My old artist friend Gary agreed to collaborate and Movie Studio Boss has been updated.<br><br>Besides giving me the chance to get it to run on screens which have larger resolutions there's lots of technical benefits including improved audio (players of the old game will be pleased to note that the tunes I wrote have been replaced with a great score from some new friends Guy, Tim &amp; Bradley) and the ability to have more people on screen. In MSBTS every film has a Production Assistant who will dress in a costume relevant to the film and will walk around the Studio letting you know what stage of production the film is in.<br><br>As well as updating the gameplay \u2013 introducing Blu-ray and updating the financial model \u2013  and pretty much all the graphics I got the chance to add in new features; animated films, musicals, age rating, personnel profiles, more detailed film credits, more reports, notification icons and more.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Thanks For Your Time.</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Edward</h2>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Won Best Film","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/331610/d1d323d0dbda5d0f450eed527b237ad9fe455746.jpg"},{"name":"Won Best Director","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/331610/2fa02d25a905607f15949493c28218d4d9cdeba9.jpg"},{"name":"Won Best Screenplay","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/331610/b1a219cda3fce40ad88526cfc0201e148720a75d.jpg"},{"name":"Won Best Actor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/331610/b07687c6cd0d7b1e942affbde670ccfc3c1ce6eb.jpg"},{"name":"Won Best Actress","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/331610/2a302b4e82930b44387c6c9da69d58982f2c8223.jpg"},{"name":"Won Best Supporting Actor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/331610/97ba2cc87db7dfb85d0043de485cf2cdd2e68eeb.jpg"},{"name":"Won Best Supporting Actress","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/331610/fc62f24c73dd823ee36864c1b1af60f4deacc341.jpg"},{"name":"Won Best DOFP","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/331610/c1d6cceee6a03de7dffb2bf34847e8f4bfd27a32.jpg"},{"name":"Won Best Music","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/331610/e9af09539f35888bfdaa379930f37d3c781abc1f.jpg"},{"name":"Won Best Editing","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/331610/8799bd732dcc9e7b31b49c85db41bd93548a9fa9.jpg"}],"total":17},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/331610/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1572349228","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/331610/page.bg.jpg?t=1572349228","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/331610/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1572349228","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/331610/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1572349228","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":333200,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/331610/extras/MovieStudioBossTheSequel_MainSplash.png?t=1572349228\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/331610/extras/CanYou.png?t=1572349228\" /><br><br>You have just been appointed the head of a new Movie Studio and have been given 10 (now 50) years to make it the most successful studio around.
