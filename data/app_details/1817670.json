{"about_the_game":"Discord\uff1ahttps://discord.gg/gqWAsxfwGQ<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is an open survival game. You can collect, build, explore, and survive. We are randomly sent to a certain location on the desert island, collect and build our own base, find materials for making food, prevent ourselves from starving to death, find materials for making weapons, and protect the base and our own lives. There will be PVP battles between players, and monsters will be fought, it is best to survive the battle or you will lose everything in your backpack and in your hands. Players need to constantly collect materials to build their own houses, and build totems to prevent other players from building. Items can be forged through the furnace, including weapons for legitimate defense. Players can also learn magic skills to fight back against other players or monsters more effectively. Of course, there are many other gameplays, and we will add more gameplay mechanisms in the future, such as fighting with BOSS, iterating more advanced combat systems, and so on. Hope to enter the game experience, after all, this is an open survival game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1817670/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1677763695","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1817670/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1677763695","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1817670/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1677763695","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1817670/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1677763695","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Discord\uff1ahttps://discord.gg/gqWAsxfwGQ<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is an open survival game.
