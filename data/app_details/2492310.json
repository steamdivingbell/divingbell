Navigate a darkly comedic world full of tragic, man-eating wolves <strong>using nothing but your own voice to push the action forwards</strong>. <br><br>This game uses a unique artificial intelligence system to let you improvise your way through a carefully handwritten story.<br><br>You play as Arnold, one of only a few humans left after the gruesome wolf invasion. Your mission? To infiltrate wolf speed dating, make wolf small talk and rescue the human they've got trapped in the kitchen before any wolves discover your true identity!<br><br>Talk spices with Chef Wolf, drink Mai Tails with Casino Wolf, and lift weights with Swolf. Help Virginia Wolf write her book. Tell Paranoid Wolf that no, humans are not hiding in wolf costumes, he's wrong about that, and he should probably start thinking about moving out of his mother's basement too. And there's a lot more speed dating wolves than that. <br><br>This is a game full of twists and turns, hairballs, a narrative with extensive branching paths, unique storylines and endings for each wolf, and even more hairballs.
