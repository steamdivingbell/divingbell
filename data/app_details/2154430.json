{"about_the_game":"<strong>Kinetic Storm</strong> is a top-down arena shooter where you destroy waves of enemies and select upgrades at the end of the wave. It is a roguelike, so enemies and upgrades are randomly generated, and every play-through is radically different as you discover synergies between your weapon, skill, movement, and defence choices. Running on a custom Vulkan game engine, it is both visually stunning and highly performant with responsive low-latency controls.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Powerful weapons</h2><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2154430/extras/GIF_Blaster_Smaller.gif?t=1722265808\" /><br><br>Before each run select your primary and secondary weapon.
