{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Into the mines, Bluebie journey starts. More than a demo this is the first chapter of the game. Bluebie will have to clear the mines from the cyborgs while releasing the captured prisoners. At the end, as in every level, a boss fight is awaiting. Grab all weapons you can, collect diamonds to buy more projectiles, get the help you need from fellow countrymen to clear the mines from the invaders. The demo starts with a tutorial that I highly recommend you to check if you're playing for the first time.\u00a0</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3379730/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737324869","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3379730/page.bg.jpg?t=1737324869","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3379730/e0c9237adbfbc71cf5afdb87deb4c57cda66467e/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737324869","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3379730/e0c9237adbfbc71cf5afdb87deb4c57cda66467e/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737324869","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Into the mines, Bluebie journey starts.
