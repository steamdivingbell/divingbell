There is a moment when choosing to interact or not absolutely transforms the game into a 'hero saves the damsel in distress' or 'hero dukes it out against an arena of bosses with the tools of war at your disposal\u2019. Watch those Pop-in Messages to understand what to do and when to do it. Your actions will give you the edge and let you save the universe...<br><br>2) <strong>&quot;Accessible Lore, if you want it.

But a majority of your arsenal/abilities, allies' motivations, and world order are not directly given to you, but instead are revealed only to the most curious. Explore &amp; investigate, and you will find the truth! Or don't... We can choose to fly around, have a good time, put on the blinders, ignore the signs of instability that Avium is trying to show you. Or dive in and really understand the theme Avium wants to leave you with. As you fly around like a god, a titan, Prometheus himself, you'll get a sense of authority and access to everything at your fingertips. You have an AI there at your beck and call, ready to give you all the tools of war you'll need, but it's all your choice. It's not your choices in dialogue that affect the world, but instead a simpler choice between action and inaction that determine the fate of the world.<br><br>3) <strong>&quot;No single weapon is the best in the game&quot;</strong> - Avium is also designed to give you immense choice in how you fight enemies via the Quick Select Menu.<br>Rather than the modern wheel menu or a 3D character select screen, the Quick Select Menu is navigated by swiping windows, very much like our phones and our social media apps. Every weapon affects Common Enemies and Bosses differently. Choose your weapons wisely to defeat your foes. And watch those pop-ins. While Bosses have their own weaknesses to the tools you're carrying, some of your weapons will destroy parts of the environment. Whether you want to deal with every common enemy using stealth, magic, or telekinesis, or using guns, brute strength, and war-suit artillery...you get to do all of it in Avium. A lot of it!

Perhaps you will not...<br><br>We often hear of the potential positives of a globally unified society. Supposedly, there'd be no tolerance for conflict of any kind, regardless of its degree. That spans from something as massive and horrible as a war down to a simple debate between opposing viewpoints or opinions. In spite of this global peace, it's theorized that with total peace comes total stagnancy, where there's no longer a need to hold debates of any kind, a need to be innovative, or to even have independent thought. Why go to war when everyone is of one mind and one accord?<br><br>Avium is a quirky snapshot of Our society 100 years from your present day. It's a slice of society that's on its way to achieving this total unity, portraying would it might look like, what it might give up along the way to perfection, where We've replaced Our governments <strong>not</strong> with totalitarian corporations, but instead just the opposite: corporations that publicly express opinions or sentiments to demonstrate their good nature and promote the cybernetic future, what the utopian future could be...with their collaboration. In Avium, We explore the areas that would naturally experience a sort of cultural or moral atrophy under the surface of a society that\u2019s 98.6 percent united. <br><br>As We know, 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit is also the temperature of the human body. It's analogous to Avium being the new global human body. As long as the people of Avium remain united, it matters not what the rebels, or outliers, or unfortunates think or say. There's essentially one world view now, a global order the likes of which We've never achieved before, and it's all thanks to the union of corporations known collectively as &quot;The Big Four&quot;. <br><br>Our incredible ability to adapt, left unchecked, carries incredible potential! We are creatures of evolution after all. On one hand, it gave Us marvels of medicine and technology, life-extending wonders! On the other hand, it has changed Our sense of reality. <br><br>As We progress, We're leaving behind history and tradition--a by-product of Progress. Gods in the sky became stars and galaxies. We're naturally and unintentionally replacing Our past with the die-hard pursuit of truth, spectacle, or convenience, or often all three. This is the natural course of adaptation. Taking this to its maximum means that anything We &quot;know&quot; today can't possibly stand the test of time as a concrete definition, thus everything We &quot;know&quot; is subject to redefinition because of some discovery in Our near future. Rules and laws become adapted. Constitutions and democracies become adapted. <br><br>Compounded infinitely, this thesis brings Us to a point when We can redefine any thing to mean anything except what it was originally defined as. However, this coupled with everyone's inescapable dare I say 'mortal' avarice to be &quot;right&quot; and a growing irrational determination to shut down any opposing viewpoint welcomes widespread disorder that pits everyone's definitions against everyone else's diverse perspectives. We can suddenly claim anything We say &amp; perceive as the authentic &quot;truth&quot;...and if proof can no longer be obtained by a sound majority without shattering Our concept of Our self-indulgent reality, then what is reality? What is more deifying than the changing of reality itself in but a single sentence without any opposition?<br><br>As We're sailing through the endless ocean of &quot;truth&quot;, We can suddenly do and be anything!
