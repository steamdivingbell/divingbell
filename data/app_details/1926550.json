{"about_the_game":"Get ready for new type of rhythm action game you may have never experienced before. Listen to various music, dodge various types of obstacles, and successfully finish playing each music to go on to the next level. Be warned, though, the more progress you make, the harder (and even impossible by the looks!) the level becomes for you to finish.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How This Game Works</h2>In each level, you will see a big circle and a small ball circling around the circle. Your main task here is to control the ball (i.e., put it either <i>outside</i> or <i>inside</i> the big circle) to dodge all the obstacles it encounters along the way and successfully finish the level. Each level is accompanied with certain background music, and it will be a lot helpful you listen to the music while playing the game since all the obstacles are positioned according to specific beats of the music.<br><br>But note that it <i>won't</i> be that simple; the game will do everything it can to prevent you from finishing each level. Most of the time, you will be required to &quot;focus&quot; on the beats and the obstacles no matter what the game does to you, such as changing the size of the circle, the position and/or speed of the ball, changing colors, and even showing off <strong>fake</strong> obstacles! Try to get through all those unfair gimmicks and eventually finish all the levels prepared just for you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2>The game contains various minor features for you to fully enjoy it, including:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Basic and advanced tutorial<br></li><li>Key binding personalization<br></li><li>Sync adjustment<br></li><li>3 selectable difficulties (easy, normal, hard) prepared for each music<br></li><li>Special difficulties set for ones who are willing to go through challenge<br></li><li>20+ different music<br></li><li>Online ranking system <i>(To be implemented later)</i><br></li><li>Remote multiplayer mode <i>(To be implemented later)</i></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Credits</h2>The original version of the game was created and released by IMING via Flash in 2014.
