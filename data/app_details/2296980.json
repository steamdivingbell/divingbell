{"about_the_game":"Welcome to Angelshire, a lost county in the United Kingdom, the site of a mysterious civil war between the Past Keepers and the Futurists. You play as Ricky, an unlikely schoolboy who has stumbled upon a pair of magical shoes. Accompanying him are his reluctant frenemy Freddy, and two girls with their own enchanted footwear.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this story-driven RPG, every step you take may have severe ramifications. Players must engage in meaningful conversations with NPCs that set their fates in stone. Establishing relationships with the characters is essential; you can either have a romantic relationship with one of the two girls or make every comrade hate you with your decisions. With every word and action, you can alter future events, so choose wisely!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut De Feet isn't all dialogue and choices. Familiar RPG mechanics are included like stats, an inventory system, and combat. Quests can award you XP to level up and develop your character; although ammunition is rare, so you may need to rely on other methods to get past obstacles. It's time for Ricky, Freddy and the two girls to embark on an unforgettable adventure.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2296980?t=1676536968","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2296980?t=1676536968","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2296980/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1676536968","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2296980/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1676536968","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to Angelshire, a lost county in the United Kingdom, the site of a mysterious civil war between the Past Keepers and the Futurists.
