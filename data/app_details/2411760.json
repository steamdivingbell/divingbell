{"about_the_game":"In this collection of mini-games you can experience four different scenarios, each with different styles of gameplay, including resource management and avoiding the enemies trying to catch you.  None of these short games have nearly enough content to be a full game, but they were all fun for me to create and play, so I wanted to let others play them, as well.  In these four mini-games you can take the role of an Immortal Dragon God trapped in a prison and plotting revenge, a young apprentice to a powerful wizard who undergoes a dangerous test, a young boy who has to overcome a challenging journey, and a... rock.   Yes... a rock.  You'll see.  All four games have simple controls and their own unique stories.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI hope to continue making fun games in the future using everything I've been learning so far, and would genuinely appreciate honest feedback.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2411760/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1694428325","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2411760/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1694428325","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2411760/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1694428325","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2411760/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1694428325","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In this collection of mini-games you can experience four different scenarios, each with different styles of gameplay, including resource management and avoiding the enemies trying to catch you.
