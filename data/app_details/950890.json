{"about_the_game":"Accompany Elsa, a spirited teen-age girl who has just moved to a small town called Home with her mother. Set out on a quest full of mysteries to unravel: Why does the ancient game board in the Slumberwoods work only for you? What does the Elder know about it? Who was that guy they call the \u2018Wizard\u2019, and could he maybe still exist?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Class Selection</h2>At the start of the game, choose between two classes with different skills and, occasionally, slightly different events taking place in the game world. Do you want to get up-close and personal as a Fighter, dual-wielding electrified viking blades, or play the supporter\u2019s role of a Tinker, healing and buffing your robotic allies? It\u2019s up to you!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Character Customisation</h2>Configure the skill setups of your actors whenever you like! Choose between a large number of powerful skills and find the perfect setup against the enemy combinations you encounter.
