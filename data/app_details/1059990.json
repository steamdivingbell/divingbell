These cards can be used to unlock new tromboners, new trombone colors, and other mysteries!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Controls</h2><br>Using a mouse, move your arm forward and back (as if you were holding a trombone slide), and the pitch of the note will slide up and down to match! Click or use the keyboard to blow! The sounds your trombone makes are completely controlled by you. The closer you are to the music track, the more points you will earn, but you have the freedom to play anything you want at any time!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Baboons</h2><br>Nearly every screen in the game, beginning with the main menu, features one or more baboons. You won't believe how many baboons there are in this game! As you discover the secrets of the Trombiverse, their purpose may become clear... but only a true Trombone Champ will uncover their full meaning.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"The Music Enjoyer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1059990/d1b163d37e1530b2ed1c51bc43f55b77a94bdc51.jpg"},{"name":"S Apprentice","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1059990/2a1d6fdb3db3fcaae6206babbc8c6d4f93eee452.jpg"},{"name":"S Associate","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1059990/1f32fb39e7e14fab35d7695398401fbbc9760878.jpg"},{"name":"S Aficionado","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1059990/f138390e56318a1ea2083aa41480cf10ea470214.jpg"},{"name":"S Virtuoso","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1059990/491d3e518d05776523db27401d7b0ddb4c13cb0c.jpg"},{"name":"S GOD","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1059990/ad63795fb17676e747edea4c0a7b7e81b99e4005.jpg"},{"name":"I Would Prefer Not To","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1059990/81bce718adb6e0dd95fc065f03dc6adb79a4c443.jpg"},{"name":"The Tootmaster","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1059990/177baf9f63d94e04b0a8f0e4920b1d844ada2555.jpg"},{"name":"The Bassmaster","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1059990/b74cee42f29e7f45c336e785446813388288d05f.jpg"},{"name":"Aesthete","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1059990/b1ba547e92a9f56d01632ad4115df8b6c055dc96.jpg"}],"total":25},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059990/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730580715","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059990/page.bg.jpg?t=1730580715","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059990/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730580715","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1059990/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730580715","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Trombone Champ</strong> is the world's first trombone-based rhythm music game.
