Players enter battle equipped with electrical body armor, wrist-mounted rocket thrusters, a wingsuit, up to 4 weapons, and 4 grenades. Custom game variants allow for nearly everything to be tweaked to create a wide range of gameplay from insane, high speed aerial combat to slow and careful tactical scenarios.
