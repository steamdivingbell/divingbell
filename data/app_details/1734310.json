Hunt for synergies to unlock godly powers and destroy ever increasingly more difficult enemies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Dungeon Delvers, player will try to progress through as many levels as possible and survive for as long as they can. Each level will have a specific objective that must be completed before the player may use the teleporter to progress. Player objectives range from holding a point, hunting down certain enemies, and collecting glowing artifacts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers progress in the game by killing enemies to receive gold and experience and leveling up. Leveling up increases the players base stats while gold can be used to purchase equipment at random chests. Gear and spells purchased from chests have varying tiers based on rarity. Gear rolled in chests also have a slew of random attributes that have varying effects, each synergizing with a specific element or affliction the weapon and spells can apply to enemies. Find synergies between gear pieces to truly amplify your power to GODLY levels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnemies in the game also increase in frequency and strength throughout the game. Both enemies and the players can scale forever, so make sure you stay more powerful or meet a gruesome end.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1734310/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1654122398","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1734310/page.bg.jpg?t=1654122398","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1734310/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1654122398","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1734310/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1654122398","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Dungeon delvers is a third person action fighting rogue like.
