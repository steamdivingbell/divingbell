Starting on a platform at the base of the virtual dome, you will rise through the vast void, surrounded by an ever-changing performance of realities.<br />\r\nNo controllers, no interactions, no phone, no Instagram. Allow yourself to escape your reality and be completely immersed in another.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1373110/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1598350038","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1373110/page.bg.jpg?t=1598350038","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1373110/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1598350038","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1373110/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1598350038","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Reflect Horizons is a VR immersive art installation that explores the idea of reality within a virtual world.
