AMS2 gives you full control for races to progress just as you want it, ensuring no two laps are the same<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">REAL WEATHER</h2> - Real Weather links AMS2\u00b4s ultra-advanced weather system with a global meteorological data system to provide real time weather for all locations present in the game - that means that if you select the current date and hour for a race at Silverstone and it\u00b4s currently raining there, you\u00b4ll get the same weather in AMS2; if it has just stopped raining a couple of hours earlier, the track will still be wet in real life, and it will likewise still be wet in AMS2 as well. Real Weather does not just mimic current weather conditions though - it packs data for every single day over the last 40 years for every track in the game, allowing users to reproduce historical races in changeable weather very closely to how they actually happened.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MOTORSPORTS RULES &amp; REGULATIONS </h2>- Automobilista 2 also features one of the most complete sets of rules &amp; regulations of any racing sim, allowing users to emulate rules of most major series in the world.
