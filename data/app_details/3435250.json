Each scenario is filled with unknowns and challenges, testing your understanding of neural network structures and your ability to fine-tune them.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Frog Brain</i> is not only a challenge to your thinking and creativity but also a hands-on exploration of neural network principles.
