{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Project Scrapper</strong> is a casual 2D beat-'em-up where players use gravity rivets that draw objects together to manipulate the environment. The wide applicability of these rivets allow players to employ whatever strategies they come up with. Launch environmental objects at opponents to knock them down or launch your opponents themselves. Use the rivets to keep objective items from other players. In some game modes, players can even tear apart the panels composing the map.
