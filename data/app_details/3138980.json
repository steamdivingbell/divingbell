{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE STORY</h2><br>There's a big house at the top of Townstate, and you want what's inside. The value of these goods is beyond what you could possibly imagine. The only problem? Security. Electronic locks, heavy vault doors with magnetic seals, and guards galore fill this mansion. Luckily, you have a team: Alpha Vlad, a bodybuilder and weapons expert; Scarlett, femme fatale and soccer mom extraordinaire; John Doe, the mysterious and stealthy agent of chaos; and finally, Zoomer, a speedy genius with a knack for high-profile theft. These four make up your crew, and with their skills and your careful strategy, you all may be able to finally make it big\u2014and make enough to pay those pesky Townstate HOA dues.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE GAMEPLAY</h2><br>The gameplay of <i>Virtu\u00e1le: Heist Simulations</i> is very straightforward. On a large grid representing your mark's house, you use your four operatives, turn by turn, to deal with guards and obstacles to escape with as much value as possible. But be careful: you only have so much time to reach the quota, and if the guards get too suspicious, they'll call the cops. Break in and break out with the most valuable loot, and see how high you can make the number go! You have abilities such as Hack, which allows you to bypass more difficult locks (such as the vault), or abilities like Swoon, which allows you to use an operative to distract guards for a bit while you make off with your steals!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A WORD ABOUT THE GAME'S SCOPE</h2><br>This game was made by just four people over the course of ten weeks. As such, the game was designed to be as tight and replayable as we could possibly make it. While there is just one playable house, there are a huge number of ways to succeed in the world of Virtu\u00e1le: Heist Simulations, so try out as many as you possibly can!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Sugar Addict","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3138980/d0c641518155b8bb4e14f483889eca3433d29d19.jpg"},{"name":"Lucky Lockpicking","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3138980/afce23ac499dd1173bb788528761fa22bff25eb7.jpg"},{"name":"Open Up","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3138980/5a2cad1d2e16a798d8bcc8640953442b0479ca92.jpg"},{"name":"Hackerman","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3138980/7605b35ac02631168e95a26d7460f41b686111e9.jpg"},{"name":"Show And Tell","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3138980/5d0cb4b3181af23d5bcc63049d00f46be2b53e30.jpg"},{"name":"Fishing Minigame","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3138980/55063864a10efeb0f20ae9f23769fc68f48d1425.jpg"},{"name":"Killed with Love","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3138980/4e8dbfbac65d6e9f45217edbd7b43b9d932742d9.jpg"},{"name":"Hidden in Plain Sight","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3138980/7d1334ee862c98f0b2ebdb2cdf164212bc458f81.jpg"},{"name":"Oopsies...","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3138980/48db9415b43165b2dc13022ffb9cfbaf43c3e203.jpg"}],"total":9},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3138980/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724988621","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3138980/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1724988621","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3138980/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724988621","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3138980/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724988621","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE STORY</h2><br>There's a big house at the top of Townstate, and you want what's inside.
