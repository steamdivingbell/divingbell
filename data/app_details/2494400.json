{"about_the_game":"MiNi is an RPG type adventure turn based game. After entering the game, players need to use the directional keys on the mini keyboard to control the character's movement, the space bar to engage in dialogue with NPCs, touch specific NPCs to create a storyline, add more than ten high-intensity equipment and props to the list of store functions, and add treasure functions. Players need to find treasure chests scattered on the big map and open them to obtain divine level weapons and top-notch equipment, as well as silver coins to pay for riding on balloon airships and ships. Players play the protagonist and embark on the Conqueror's journey to conquer the world.After the timeline returned to the strategic offensive and defensive battle of Yike City, the protagonist Wang Sibei of the Western Liang Dynasty had already obtained control of Sili, Yuzhou, Yanzhou, Qingzhou, Xuzhou, Jingzhou, and Jizhou, with Yike City as the central stronghold. He planned to recapture the old capital of Chang'an City and then head south to Hanzhong to recapture Yizhou. However, everything was not smooth. The Western Liang Kingdom integrated various tribal forces in Liangzhou to fully attack Tongguan and Huguan fortresses. In the rear, the Huainan King rebelled and joined forces with the Sun family forces in Yangzhou to attack the abdomen of the Yike Empire. At this time, the Yike Empire was under attack from both sides. At the beginning, players had to play the role of Wang Sibei of the Western Liang Dynasty to solve the crisis. And embark on the journey of unifying the world.Note: It is recommended that players first read the novels &quot;One gram Empire Chronicles&quot; and &quot;One gram Empire Chronicles&quot; for task analysis.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2494400/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1713844581","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2494400/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1713844581","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2494400/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1713844581","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2494400/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1713844581","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"MiNi is an RPG type adventure turn based game.
