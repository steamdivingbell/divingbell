Your enemies will attack you quickly without stopping. You must be ready not only to input your next orders, but also to block enemy attacks and enhance your own magic. This provides a fun, fast-paced way to control an entire party, where each member brings their own unique abilities to the table.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore a Procedural World</h2><br>Each new game creates a new world for you to explore with randomized treasures, zone layouts, monster stats, and world map. This lets you build up your power in a different way giving you a new experience each time you play.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get Cool Treasure</h2><br>Collect lots of loot and treasure scattered throughout each zone. Enjoy both statistical and cosmetic progression of your characters as well as entire new abilities.<br><br>Steal items and complete quests for truly powerful items that will make your enemies crumble. Equipment doesn't just change statistics, some will give you new skills and alter how you play.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Short Play Time</h2><br>Each playthrough is only a few hours, so you won't have to dedicate a huge amount of time to feel progression. Start a new file and play between the other more epic-length games in your library.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Couch Co-Op</h2><br>The game can be played 1-4 players using controllers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Open Source</h2><br>This game is open source and is built on the Anomalous Engine.
