Build up energy with weaker Skill cards and spend it to play stronger cards. With each Critter having varied stats, abilities, Weakness and Resistances, making a varied team is key. You don't want your whole team to be weak to Blaze attacks do you?<br>But Skill cards can only be used by Critters of the same element, so maybe using multiple Critters of the same type is a good strategy? You wouldn't want your Aqua Critter to be defeated and then not be able to use your Aqua Skill Cards.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2294160/extras/Header_DeckbuildingGif.gif?t=1738591318\" /><br>Build your deck by swapping with the characters you beat in battle. Got some doubles? Swap as many times as you like and are able, no limits here. Any cards are added to your binder to change up your Battle Deck at any time. Equip Stickers for passive bonuses but be aware that using rarer Critters limits how many Stickers you can use. Balance your deck between Critters, Skills and Stickers to claim victory!<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2294160/extras/Header_ChallengesGif.gif?t=1738591318\" /><br>Proceed through Challenges by picking one of 3 map cards but if you're feeling brave, unflipped cards award money that can be used to buy Booster Packs. A victory in a Challenge adds the cards in your battle deck to your permanent Master Binder, letting you customise the starting Critter in future runs. Create decks from the Master Binder to take on the Critter Championship and put your deckbuilding to the test. And the next Challenge run? Totally different. With 6 different areas that can appear in any order, you never know what you'll run into next time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A number of artists have illustrated hundreds of cards to collect and store lovingly in your binder<br></li><li>A whole bunch of Skill cards and passive ability Stickers to come up with an array of strategies.<br></li><li>Swap with characters you beat to build your deck instead of 'pick 1 of 3 cards'.
