Expect things you would be able to see in any R-rated movie or M-rated video game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About the Game</h2><br>We think the best way for us to explain this game is to tell you how we came up with this idea. Everybody who works at Repulse loves fantasy anime. We are huge fans of shows like Attack on Titan and Full Metal Alchemist.  And we also like to play visual novels, especially the ones with erotic and lesbian content.<br><br>When we finished our last game, we asked ourselves:  What if we could combine the elements we love most about anime and visual novels in an interactive VR experience that you could also play without VR. And that is exactly what Iragon is about.<br><br>You play the game as Darick, a poor kid from a small village.  Everything for him changes when he meets a bisexual girl who gets ambushed by soldiers of the Empire. To help her, you must learn to use your magic, but on your quest to bring her home safe, you will have to journey into a dangerous frozen world.  Along the way, you will battle enemy soldiers, undead skeletons, and perhaps cross paths with seductive creatures of the frozen land while you unlock new erotic adventures with her.<br><br>So this is ultimately a game about living out a high fantasy adventure, with a strong emphasis on putting the player in control.  The game is meant to be experienced in VR, but we dedicated an equal amount of care to deliver a standard version that will work for players who do not have a VR headset.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2>Whether you play in VR or not, you can expect us to deliver:<br><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 3 Main storyline romance routes<br></li><li> 4 Side romance routes<br></li><li> 12 Monster girls you can romance<br></li><li> Interactive experiences with your love interests<br></li><li> Different outfits<br></li><li> Voice acting<br></li><li> Motion captured animations<br></li><li> A dynamic combat system that features both magic and melee;<br></li><li> Destructible environments;<br></li><li> A dialogue choice system that influences the response you get.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">STORY</h2>Be the hero, live the story, and go on an adventure of a lifetime while you immerse yourself fully in the world of Iragon, with a complete animated story and full voice acted cast.
