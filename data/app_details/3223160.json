{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Apocalypse Express is an action management Roguelike in which the player conducts, upgrades and repairs different parts of the train through endless waves of enemies in a post-apocalyptic setting. Departing the darkness of their lifelong shelter, the player decides to embark on a journey through the wasteland looking to fulfill the dream of seeing the outside world with their own eyes, charting out a map around the few remaining memories of the past world. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3223160/extras/Combat.gif?t=1739108885\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Manage the Chaos</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Be prepared for some nail-biting tension as you try to keep your train running while balancing putting out fires, collecting resources and dispatching enemies.

Fill up your Wagons with various modules each giving you unique abilities. There are Modules for every type of Wastelander. Go full offense by building up an arsenal of cannons, rocket launchers and turrets, obliterating everything in your path. Take the more defensive approach and create an indestructible machine built around disabling enemies, deflecting shots and extinguishing fires, keeping your train healthy and running even through the harshest conditions. Or experiment with other combinations, perhaps go with a speedy train that gets you to your destination faster or even create a completely autonomous system that does all the work for you.
