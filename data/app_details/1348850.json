The devastation left only a scattered few to start rebuilding their civilization on a ring of islands...<br>Vodari contains all of the iconic things you expect in a fantasy setting, but the familiar becomes surprising and new. Dungeons can be found above and below the waves, in the form of caves, shipwrecks, and lost temples. From island to island, you'll find variety and wonders, ranging from bustling ports filled with travelers from distant lands to the unexplored wilderness, ruins, monsters, and other dangers. Halflings live in villages made of interconnected boats and anything that can float. Dwarves are respected shipbuilders, sailing the seas in search of relics from their sunken homeland and battling an enemy below in the Night War. Elves dwell high in the treetops and below the surface of the seas. Gnomes find themselves on opposite sides of a battle between machines and nature. Goblins are as likely to be encountered as raiders riding waveskippers as working as a tinkerer living in a city. Instead of land armies, Vodari has navies and pirates that battle with flintlocks and cannons to control the seas. The most dangerous monsters are found in the seas, such as sea dragons and white whales. Nature is as deadly as the most powerful monsters, with furious hurricanes, catastrophic tsunamis, and fiery volcanoes.<br> <i>Adapted for Fantasy Grounds by:</i> <strong>Rob Twohy</strong> <br> <br> <strong>Requires:</strong> An active subscription or a one time purchase of a Fantasy Grounds Full or Ultimate license and the included 5E Compatible ruleset.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1348850/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1594747259","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1348850/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1594747259","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1348850/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1594747259","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1348850/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1594747259","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Seas of Vodari</h2><strong> The Seas of Vodari</strong> is a book that provides fifth edition material for both gamemasters and players to enjoy a single adventure or an entire campaign full of swashbuckling action and magical adventure.<br>The Seas of Vodari campaign setting was created to support seafaring adventures that focus on the crew of a ship hunting sea monsters, exploring mysterious uncharted islands, visiting bustling port cities, following maps to find buried treasure, and battling cutthroat pirates.
