{"about_the_game":"&quot;Pathfinder 2.0 RPG - Pathfinder Scenario 4.12 - Negotiations for the Star Gun<br> <br> A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for 1st- through 4th-level characters. <br> Within their vaults the Pathfinder Society has located a rare and mysterious star gun from the distant shores of Arcadia that, while broken, still holds a deep power within it. In order to ensure that past wrongs are made right, the Society must arrange for travel within the borders of Arcadia to repair and return the star gun to its rightful home, but to do so they must first convince the council of Segada to allow a team of Pathfinders entry. <br> A junior team of agents is dispatched to plead their case to the councilmembers, hopefully securing friends and allies of the Society for future exploration and contact. However, a villain lies in wait, aware of the power the agents are concealing and plotting for the exact moment to strike and catch them off guard. <br> This adventure is the first part of the two-part Star Gun metaplot arc in the Year of Boundless Wonder.
