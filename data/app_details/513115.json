{"about_the_game":"The British Railways S15 Livery Pack, which requires the Southern Railway S15 Class Steam Loco Add-On to use, enables you to drive the S15 as it appeared under British Railways ownership in the 1950s-60s. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe S15 Class was originally formed from the mind of the London &amp; South Western Railway\u2019s Chief Mechanical Engineer, Robert Urie, as there was a need for a new locomotive to fulfil heavy freight duties in the early 1920s. Urie\u2019s original mixed-traffic H15 design, which helped the LSWR in the midst of the war effort, would serve as the basis for his future locomotives.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe British Railways S15 Livery Pack for Train Simulator includes the S15 in BR Black, with both early and late British Railways logos. This pack allows you to recreate all class members.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/513115/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1495023307","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/513115/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1495023307","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/513115/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1495023307","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/513115/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1495023307","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"The British Railways S15 Livery Pack, which requires the Southern Railway S15 Class Steam Loco Add-On to use, enables you to drive the S15 as it appeared under British Railways ownership in the 1950s-60s. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe S15 Class was originally formed from the mind of the London &amp; South Western Railway\u2019s Chief Mechanical Engineer, Robert Urie, as there was a need for a new locomotive to fulfil heavy freight duties in the early 1920s.
