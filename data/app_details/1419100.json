{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1419100/extras/logo.png?t=1668505404\" /><br>An adventure game with strategy and management elements in a medieval fantasy setting - drawing inspiration from classics such as Warcraft 3 and The Settlers. Embark on quests, hunt down treasures and manage your resources as you build, battle, cast magic and brew potions to bring order to a world on the brink of disaster.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1419100/extras/divider.png?t=1668505404\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EXPLORE</h2>Strange creatures living in different locations await you. Some of them will help you, others need your help, and others will take a liking to your head...or, rather, your fresh brains. You will visit quiet villages, snow-capped mountaintops, impenetrable forests, and foul-smelling swamps. But one thing will remain the same - adventure awaits you everywhere!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1419100/extras/ezgif.com-optimize7.gif?t=1668505404\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GATHER RESOURCES</h2>Collect everything that isn't bolted to the floor! Dwarves don't mind work, but they won't lift a finger in an empty stomach. You can't build a working mill out of mud and sticks, so you'll have to search for the appropriate materials. Keep food stocked and resources plentiful and your world will expand!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1419100/extras/ezgif.com-video-to-gif9.gif?t=1668505404\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BUILD</h2>Build bridges over turbulent rivers, build docks in the swamps, repair buildings, and build new ones! Mills will provide food, sawmills will provide building materials, forges will improve equipment - and you can always sell the surplus at the market. Many building styles and colors await you in the game.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1419100/extras/close_building.gif?t=1668505404\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GO QUESTING</h2>The citizens of the world have always had many problems to overcome and quests to embark on. Try to help everyone you can, and reap the rewards of your labours.
