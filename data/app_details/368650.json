{"about_the_game":"Trapped in darkness, you must use visualized sound to guide your way through threatening environments. The sounds you create will bounce off obstacles, revealing the shape of the surrounding world. It won't be long before your only way of sensing the world attracts a horrifying evil that devours both sound and souls.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSurvive through 80 levels that will make your heart race and leave you with an irrational fear of red lines. A foreboding soundscape, best experienced with headphones, sets the tone for your journey. Explore, solve puzzles, and most importantly - stay alive.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Escape the Darkness","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/368650/403b6632a7c6048ec2472a50e00cb3fd102ed379.jpg"},{"name":"Escape the Light","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/368650/f9b40084164255e616380efb24331f0393f11f56.jpg"},{"name":"Treasure Hunter","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/368650/6999c86f5d1aed961e65e230de9fceca7c082c03.jpg"}],"total":3},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/368650/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1448577884","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/368650/page.bg.jpg?t=1448577884","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/368650/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1448577884","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/368650/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1448577884","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Trapped in darkness, you must use visualized sound to guide your way through threatening environments.
