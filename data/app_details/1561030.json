{"about_the_game":"Music is the beating pulse of Planet Rhapsody. Groovy tunes constantly thrum through the blue-grass meadows, echo across the haunting wastelands, and howl above the craggy mountains. These musical tunes protect and sustain the mysterious AlgoRhythm, without which Planet Rhapsody would shatter into a silent abyss. <br><br>Now, the AlgoRhythm is under threat from creatures tempted into rampage by a supernatural force and needs your help.<br><br>Sure, you\u2019re just a failed alien pop group who never made it to the big time, but damn it kid you\u2019ve got grit. And you can keep a beat.
