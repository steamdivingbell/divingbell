You can take any additional local players into online sessions with you. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Freedom to choose</strong> different modes such as playing together in real time (local players use split screen) or taking it in turns via hotseat. Online sessions also support joining as a spectator. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Cross-platform multiplayer</strong> lets you play with your Steam friends on both Windows, Linux, and mac OS, as well as with non-Steam players on other platforms, including current-gen consoles. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Compete against ghosts</strong> in practice mode for the top spot in an individual level with both global and friends only leaderboards.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Replay</strong> your previous sessions via the session replays feature.

Five ball designs are available from the start with others being unlocked as you earn XP through playing and level up.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Accessible with full gamepad support</strong> through the inclusion of an on-screen keyboard and ability to create local player profiles for saving any customizations, player names or gamepad settings.</p></li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Tee Time","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1914980/19ea1219e135bc45685e4a3544d66786adad563d.jpg"},{"name":"Nice Shot","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1914980/e79a0f469c0a490e2b1bcec41540cd636a036b4b.jpg"},{"name":"Turkey","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1914980/37277f4f9e6725b319f1caa74ab4c2f095bc6d71.jpg"},{"name":"Bounce Back","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1914980/19d0250dc004eaefdbb857ccb21759b5e319cb38.jpg"},{"name":"Pathfinder","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1914980/efe57369b15d376d49042ba7a97917aa894445cf.jpg"},{"name":"Getting Good!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1914980/0f40feb1a2ab6617d3d9bc8a2e972f90f5810960.jpg"},{"name":"Perfect","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1914980/a8b4fa7c395f3cdb44fba801fb119ce7831b1319.jpg"},{"name":"Around the World","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1914980/2c94235b6f87fd4b61556a2112b8a2dcd920ba9f.jpg"},{"name":"Ghost Buster","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1914980/f94ae7a423680e583010e800dd33e3367a89898d.jpg"},{"name":"Completionist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1914980/63b71d82c4fb02c419bb305c4be63ef631227547.jpg"}],"total":22},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1914980/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734126436","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1914980/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1734126436","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1914980/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734126436","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1914980/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734126436","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Remote Play on Phone","id":41},{"description":"Remote Play on Tablet","id":42},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":2013310,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Randomized course layout</strong> for each session.
