{"about_the_game":"Play quick &amp; fun races with your friends. Ride cute animals through dreamy tracks and use bonuses to outrun the horde! Master the dive to avoid obstacles and gain boosts, and explore environments to find hidden shortcuts.<br><br>Or just take a tour and enjoy the view, while listening to the sympho-ethnic soundtrack. That's up to you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FAMILY FRIENDLY MULTIPLAYER</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1345280/extras/multiplayer.gif?t=1726401950\" /><br>Play up to 8 players in local splitscreen! Steam &quot;Remote Play Together&quot; is supported. The game is family friendly and offers some assistance for younger players or beginners. However, to fully master the game, you'll have to take advantage of all the controls the game offers. Easy to get, hard to master!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DIVE TO BOOST</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1345280/extras/boost.gif?t=1726401950\" /><br>At any time you can choose to dive under the track; this makes you drift but you gain boosts afterwards. The trick is, diving can also be done in a straight line. Use it wisely to outrun your opponents! But will you be able to handle this super speed? Diving is also useful to avoid bad stuff on the track.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">RIDE CUTE ANIMALS</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1345280/extras/animals.gif?t=1726401950\" /><br>Who has never dreamt of riding wildlife animals ? Now you can choose among 6 cute animals. All animals have the same stats, so it's only a matter of personal taste.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EVERLASTING BONUSES</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1345280/extras/bonus.gif?t=1726401950\" /><br>Find bonuses along the way to boost, protect yourself, or clutter the way of other players... But be careful, every trap will stay there until the end of the race.  So try not to punish yourself! It can quickly become a mess and the last lap is often full of surprises.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DREAMY TRACKS</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1345280/extras/tracks.gif?t=1726401950\" /><br>Tracks take place in oneiric worlds where nature is all around: clouds amongst auroras, snowy moutains, tropical islands or celtic lands... Some tracks are totally upside down, others are more peaceful and contemplative. All levels offer hidden shortcuts that you'll have to discover to gain precious seconds.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ABOUT THE DEVELOPER</h2>Hi there! I'm Mathias and I've been creating video games since I was a child. I love science, playing music and drawing. So what's better than creating a video game to do all of this at the same time? I do everything alone because I love every part of it and I'm a curious guy who likes to know how it works!
