Combined with modern features and favorites, this hybrid approach has been carefully calibrated to offer a unique and original experience of balance and flexibility, all while retaining the depth of a traditional RPG. The game features its own theme, lore, and storyline, and the player is placed at the center of it all. The systems in the game all coexist and collaborate to bring life and flavor to the game world. There are often many ways to complete an objective or to reach a goal. The equipment system is deep, and a handy prybar or a strong rope may become useful or even essential at times and could mean the difference between life and death. There is a lot of diversity between gear such as weapons and armor, and there are many different ways to build a character and shape them into a specific role, or even a jack-of-all-trades. Skills and talents also reflect this. The character creation system allows you to choose every aspect about your character. This includes gender, race, familial background, occupational background, traits, religion, alignment, appearance, skills, talents, and more. Create the fiercest slayer, the mightiest knight, the darkest occultist, the deadliest archer, the stealthiest assassin, or absolutely anything in between. The classless advancement system offers complete and total freedom without constraints. The game is intended to bridge the gap between traditional and modern styled RPGs.&quot;</i></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">[I]Plunge into the Lawless Lands of Crossia, a once great kingdom where chaos slowly consumes more and more of the country.
