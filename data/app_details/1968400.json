{"about_the_game":"\u201cWhere The Stars Brought Us\u201d is a visual novel game about a boy, Ryo Yung, who is from Seoul, South Korea. He and his family (mother, father, and sister) take what was meant to be a week-long trip to Kodachi, Japan. This begins Ryo\u2019s many adventures. Though he does not embark on these adventures alone; Mae, a non-human girl with healing powers whom he met by chance in the Narusawa Ice Caves, joins him on his journey. This very journey begins with Ryo searching for the aforementioned ice caves, where he meets Mae along with another odd being. In that time, Ryo\u2019s sister, Nam, has gone missing. Mae uses this opportunity to strike up a deal: she will help Ryo find Nam, if Ryo helps her in return. Ryo agrees, and the events of the game are set in motion.","achievements":{"total":0},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1968400?t=1705152851","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1968400?t=1705152851","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1968400/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1705152851","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1968400/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1705152851","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"\u201cWhere The Stars Brought Us\u201d is a visual novel game about a boy, Ryo Yung, who is from Seoul, South Korea.
