{"about_the_game":"THE TYPICAL GAME OF HANGMAN BUT NOW IN 3D, TOO BEAUTIFUL.<br />\r\nThe traditional game of hangman, remodeled and passed into three dimensions, but keeping all the essence of the original game in an attractive environment,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this game you must guess or guess a hidden word by selecting the letters of the alphabet, if you fail, the pieces of the drawing of a hangman will be completed. If it is completed, you lose, you have up to 10 attempt.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe animations and particles, which include the different scenarios, will give visitation to an entertaining game by definition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso, between word and word, the couples game is included, where you have to choose a couple and guess that they are the same word.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll encouraged with music and sounds that give a very pleasant final atmosphere.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor all this, whether you are a lifelong gamer, a casual player or almost never player of a video game, hangman may be your game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor those who play a lot of action games, it is a pause in the warrior's life. For those who play casually, playing a game from time to time, for example, while waiting to be serviced somewhere, may be an option. And if you never play,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith this game it's not like the other games, and the same why you don't play that's why, because you haven't found your game, hangman 3d, it could be your game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you give hangman 3d a chance, it will surely not disappoint you, it delivers what it promises, a play of words, even if it seems little promise, the fun is greater than it promises.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWITH MORE THAN 77,000 WORDS IN SPANISH AND 55,000 WORDS IN ENGLISH.<br />\r\nWith two dictionaries, spanish and english included, you will have a number of words, in the two languages which it is unlikely that a word which you do not know will not appear.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis number of words makes their classification difficult, each person has a number of words learned, and what is a word known to one, may be unknown to another.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite this, the game has a large number of options so that depending on your vocabulary it can adapt, and you can choose if it is more or less difficult, something that we will explain later.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn summary, with 77,000 thousand words in spanish, and 55,000 words in english, you will always learn new words.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother thing is that you can use them in your day to day, although it depends on what you dedicate to. The average of a person is to know about 20 thousand or 30 thousand. Enlarge up to one hundred percent playing hangman 3d.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso, by having two languages, you can expand in the language you know less, unless you are an anglo-spanish speaker forever. And even so, the game of hangman 3d will surprise you with some word that you don't still know in either of its two languages.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLEARN WHILE YOU PLAY AND EXPAND YOUR VOCABULARY.<br />\r\nTo facilitate the learning of words between both languages, at the end of a word, either if you right or fail, you will be able to see the complete word. But also, you will have two buttons, one to see the meaning of the word and the other to translate into the other language, spanish or english, depending on the language you are playing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA function, which although seems something simple, gives a new perspective to the game, since it allows you to investigate the words that come to you in the game. This will be done through a browser window, in the case of spanish, it will open the page of the royal spanish academy, and in english, the page of merriam webster, to know its meaning first hand. In the case of translation, the google translation page will be used.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso, between each word you get correct and the next word, you can play a couples mini game, where you will also learn words.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the full version, all these words will be saved in your statistics, so you can search them on the internet later, with a simple click.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso in the full version, a dictionary will be added where you can search for any word, to consult and research about it on the internet.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n A LARGE NUMBER OF GAME OPTIONS, THE MORE OPTIONS, THE MORE FUN.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the demo, this is the full version of the single player game mode. And you will now be able to see some of the numerous options that the game incorporates, both at the graphic level and during the game itself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWithin the graphic options, you can choose between eight different gallobes, and also select the background scene, among eight options. In the full version more gallobes and scenarios will be incorporated to choose from.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll scenarios, with animations and particles included, to give it more visitation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWithin the options for a player, to control the difficulty you can choose if you get the chosen vowels at start.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can also find an option where you select if the words that appear have a certain length. The longer a word is, even statistically, the more chances there are that it is the letter you have chosen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn case these aid was not enough, you also have the possibility of whether or not to use clues in the game. When giving you a hint, a random letter will appear inside the word.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs for options currently included, in single player mode, I finish by commenting that there are 2 types of game, with or without time. In time mode, you will have a score so I can challenge you to get the maximum score. In timeless mode, recommended at the beginning, you will have all the time in the world to think about the letter you are going to choose.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the full version options will be included for both single player and multiplayer. Such as a series of challenges in single player mode, so that the fun never ends.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1957120/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1711399799","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1957120/page.bg.jpg?t=1711399799","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1957120/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1711399799","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1957120/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1711399799","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"THE TYPICAL GAME OF HANGMAN BUT NOW IN 3D, TOO BEAUTIFUL.<br />\r\nThe traditional game of hangman, remodeled and passed into three dimensions, but keeping all the essence of the original game in an attractive environment,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this game you must guess or guess a hidden word by selecting the letters of the alphabet, if you fail, the pieces of the drawing of a hangman will be completed.
