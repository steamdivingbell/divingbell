{"about_the_game":"<strong>THE CUBE</strong><br><br>The cube is the best digital representation of the 70's iconic Magic cube. Being one of the greatest puzzles and toys of all time, the cube has different colors (traditionally 3x3 with white, red, blue, orange, green and yellow) and it rotates in different axis. At the beginning it will be shuffled and the objective is to get all faces of the cube having only one color each. The Cube will allow you to compete against your best time. You may pick different sizes from 2x2, 3x3, 4x4 and 5x5. On top of that, there's a lot of customization you'll be able to do, from colors, hue, look &amp; feel, camera type, etc. All of this while playing at the beat of great music.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1105300/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1562732490","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1105300/page.bg.jpg?t=1562732490","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1105300/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1562732490","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1105300/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1562732490","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>THE CUBE</strong><br><br>The cube is the best digital representation of the 70's iconic Magic cube.
