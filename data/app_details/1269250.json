{"about_the_game":"The very trees and stones of the forest have become...hostile. You don't know why your home has become so dangerous, but you must not perish! Team up as two woodland creatures trying to survive in this horde based tower-defense game. One character plays as a Blacksmith, responsible for crafting strategic defenses, while the other plays as a Warrior, responsible for defeating enemies in the field to gather more resources for the Blacksmith's use.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Couch Co-op</h2>Grab two controllers, a friend, and head out to the battlefield! Each character serves a unique role - without working together, you won't last long. Strategically manage your resources to build the ultimate defensive setup as hordes of angry stone golems and animated trees seek you out relentlessly, desperately seeking vengeance. Why? You can't seem to put your paw on it, but maybe it was something you ate...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Speedy Squirrel</h2>Our fierce warrior dashes across the field mowing down enemies left and right, all in the name of protecting their friend. The warrior is responsible for defeating enemies and salvaging resources for the smith to use in crafting defenses. Be careful though, if you're too reckless, the smith won't have much protection.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Buff Rabbit</h2>The natural woodland species to take on blacksmithing, this character is a capable smith who can craft both weapons and defenses. Using resources gathered from defeated enemies, the smith can build defensive walls and turrets, as well as new swords as his friend's weapon durability lessens with each swing. Don't let those muscles deceive you though, the smith is not as skilled in combat as his friend.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1269250/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1587389431","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1269250/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1587389431","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1269250/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1587389431","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1269250/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1587389431","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"The very trees and stones of the forest have become...hostile.
