Melee attacks are automatic when enemies get close. Each time you level up during a run, you will be able to choose a power-up: either in the form of a weapon or a passive bonus.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Collect coins each run by breaking crates throughout the world, or by taking out extra strong elite monsters. Survive longer and the monsters become more deadly but the rewards grow richer. You can spend the coins to upgrade your abilities and unlock new more powerful characters.
