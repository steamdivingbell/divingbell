{"about_the_game":"Nurbits is a music puzzle game. You take on the role of a sound engineer responsible for producing music with a robot band. You must fix the wiring in each robot's brain before it can play the song. <br><br>To do so, you hook up microchips that send and receive signals the same way that neurons do. Each chip has a threshold. If it receives enough stimulation from other chips to reach threshold it will fire and play a note. To solve the puzzle you must hook up the right notes and inhibit the wrong notes. Each puzzle is a phrase in the song the player is assembling. Complete all the puzzles so the band can play the song!<br><br>Nurbits also features a creative mode. You can customize your robot band, and create and share your own songs and puzzles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><br><br><strong>Campaign Mode</strong> <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Over 50 puzzles composing four original songs.<br></li><li>Each song features a distinct musical style: chiptune, rock, hip-hop, and electronic dance music.<br></li><li>Rise to the top of the robot music industry as you progress through four venues: the basement, small club, arena, and space station.<br></li><li>Puzzle mechanics based on real neuroscience concepts.</li></ul><br><strong>Creative Mode</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Compose your own music in an easy and intuitive way.<br></li><li>21 different instrument sounds: guitar, bass, drums, synths, and more.<br></li><li>Add effects and tweak all the parameters of your song.<br></li><li>Robot editor - Make your own custom robots to form your own unique robot bands.<br></li><li>Turn your music into puzzles using the same tools as the game designers.<br></li><li>Online song sharing - Upload your creations.
