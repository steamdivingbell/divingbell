You c figure out how you got there and you don\u2019t know why you\u2019re there. Not only are you stuck, but strange events occur one after the other \u2014 patients are killed, strange figures appear, there are rooms that shouldn\u2019t exist, children are missing..., what happened to this hospital?   <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDream is a mysterious and dramatic puzzle game where the players play  the protagonist that has woken up in an unfamiliar hospital. Throughout the exploration to discover how everything started, there are many unexplainable and weird occurrences. Players need to use their intelligence to solve puzzles and devices and discover the secrets hidden in the hospital.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the story progresses, players will explore and solve puzzles in more than 10 scenes. There will be many puzzles and devices in every scene as some require you to search for hidden clues or answers, while others will test the players\u2019 logic and processing capabilities. Players will have to carefully search every corner of the scene and solve various puzzles to move onto the next segment of the story.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers will get to choose from various options from time to time and players will have to consider their current situation to select the most appropriate option. Some choices won\u2019t affect the progress of the game, while others may lead to death and the end of the game. In addition, players will also find many important items when they aren\u2019t solving puzzles, which can provide additional clues towards uncovering the mysteries in the plot.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDream will start with players waking up in the morgue and then they will come into contact with all kinds of people, occurrences and items. In addition, the players will encounter figures and scenes that should not appear in a hospital, making the story even more confusing.
