{"about_the_game":"<strong>CAWEZ's Puzzlebox: HIRAETH</strong> is a direct look inside of the perplexing mind of its creator: it is a compilation which explores the past mistakes and the dubious decisions of a failed artist who let himself be consumed by his passion.<br><br>In this game, you will solve a series of carefully crafted physics puzzles, exploring unique experimental mechanics, and test your skills at equally mind-bending 3D platforming challenges.<br><br><br>Puzzle types:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Top-down tile pushing: some tiles may enter areas the player cannot, and vice-versa. Some tiles can only be pushed indirectly by another, and some must be pushed directly. This gives rise to complex emergent mechanics you will be tasked with exploring and exploiting.<br></li><li> Gravity puzzles: the player has to power to change the direction of gravity. Some objects will keep their original gravity, whereas some will mimic the player. You will need to figure out how to alter the gravity of specific tiles in order to hold others in place, all while guiding the player to the objective.<br></li><li> Fractal puzzles: tiles cast ghost-like images around them that do not interact with physics in the way you would expect. As the puzzles near a solution, you will find the grid more and more cluttered by these images, blocking your path. You will need to guide the player to the Objective while keeping all 'buttons' pressed.<br></li><li> Zero-G puzzles: The shortest puzzle type, where the player can freely float around in space, and solve 3D tile pushing.</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2361040/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1722517111","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2361040/page.bg.jpg?t=1722517111","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2361040/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1722517111","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2361040/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1722517111","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>CAWEZ's Puzzlebox: HIRAETH</strong> is a direct look inside of the perplexing mind of its creator: it is a compilation which explores the past mistakes and the dubious decisions of a failed artist who let himself be consumed by his passion.<br><br>In this game, you will solve a series of carefully crafted physics puzzles, exploring unique experimental mechanics, and test your skills at equally mind-bending 3D platforming challenges.<br><br><br>Puzzle types:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Top-down tile pushing: some tiles may enter areas the player cannot, and vice-versa.
