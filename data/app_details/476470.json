{"about_the_game":"The Kingdom Wars 2 soundtrack features thirty tracks of epic fantasy music by composer Joel Steudler. The struggle of men, elves, and orcs to save a world from bloodthirsty gods is reflected in diverse instrumentation and thematic melodies. Rustic bagpipes and noble horns signal humankind's plight and mark its resolve in the great battles. The elves' mysticism and might is brought forth with ethereal flutes, angelic voices, and eerie steel drums. Rougher rhythms and pounding percussion sum up the spirit of the orcs. Only together can they prevent the destruction of all that is known.
