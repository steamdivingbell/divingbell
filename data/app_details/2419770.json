With twin-stick controls, not only can you move in all directions, but you can also perform sidesteps and rolls in depth, allowing for skillful evasion of enemy attacks that would be unavoidable in 2D gameplay.<br><br>During your ship's roll, the camera rotates, allowing you to find gaps in enemy attacks and hidden spots in the terrain. Combine rolling with vertical movement to evade enemy attacks or chase down and destroy enemies spread throughout space.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2419770/extras/rolling.gif?t=1739182706\" /><br><br>Sidestepping is a rapid acceleration in depth. Even when normal movement won't allow for evasion in time, you can sidestep to barely dodge enemy attacks. As you become familiar with the controls, you can weave through gaps in enemy fire in 3D space.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2419770/extras/sidestep.gif?t=1739182706\" /><br><br>With a beginner-friendly shield and life system, you automatically recover by using energy when you take damage. The game continues as long as your ship isn't destroyed by consecutive hits. When your ship is hit by enemy attacks, the shield decreases. If you avoid subsequent damage, the shield automatically recovers. When the shield gauge runs out due to continuous damage, the condition gauge decreases. Condition also recovers automatically but requires more energy. If the condition gauge runs out, your ship will be destroyed.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2419770/extras/shieldlife.gif?t=1739182706\" /><br><br>You can switch between the two ships, Luludi and Asteri, with different equipment at any time. Power-ups are performed individually, allowing for strategic play such as switching to balance power-ups or swapping early during a pinch to wait for recovery opportunities.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2419770/extras/myshipchange.gif?t=1739182706\" /><br><br>Enjoy the smooth movements powered by physics calculations and the deformed journey through the solar system as you fight off the giant virus.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2419770/extras/bossbattle.gif?t=1739182706\" /><br><br>There are both normal and difficult routes prepared for each stage, catering to a wide range of players.
