{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Do you have a feeling that there is less and less creativity in the racing games genre? We think so too.

A youngtimer.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">For starters, you\u2019re going to compete with amateurs on local race tracks in Poland. Driving fast is not enough to climb higher. In the real world <strong>everything has a price: repairing damage, changing worn tires</strong>, even entry fee for races.

A roaring engine with big power won\u2019t do you any good if you exceed the noise limit during the pre-race scrutineering.
