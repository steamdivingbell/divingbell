To match the original intention of the placement, let the combat part be a little simple. Some players reported a lack of challenge and purpose. Therefore, add difficult BOSS challenges to enrich the game play and objectives. Therefore, it is put in DLC, so that players who like challenge and rich gameplay can choose. At the same time, players who only like industrial manufacturing will not have a burden.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpeed up the game:<br />\r\nThere are two groups of players in the ontology game. One is the industrial manufacturing player, who does not like to hang up for a long time and prefers a reasonable game duration experience. The other part is the placement hangers group, who like the simple and casual long placement gameplay. In the ontology, due to my obsession with innovative game design, I did not properly integrate the needs of the two types of players. For example, there are always players complaining about not having enough land. Therefore, I specially added behemoths technology in this DLC, which can greatly increase the core of planet land, resources and so on. Warning: This will speed up the game considerably. Recommended for players who like fast games.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2520270?t=1719466415","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2520270/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1719466415","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2520270/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1719466415","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2520270/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1719466415","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Important: Be sure to update the game to the latest version before using the DLC, or an error will occur!<br />\r\nDeep Space Beast DLC content<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Added 72 monster bosses with 12 ranks.<br />\r\n- Behemoths Tech Tree - Contains planet land, resources, leader Max level, etc.<br />\r\n- Added new class pink quality kit.<br />\r\n- Added hunting mission system.<br />\r\n- Added monster map detection system.<br />\r\nNon-subsequent play<br />\r\nThis DLC is a parallel play, which can be experienced from level 1.
