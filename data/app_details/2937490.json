{"about_the_game":"Welcome to \u201cIterations\u201d, a narrative story where you play as Cara. Guide Cara through her mission to uncover the truth behind her friend Amy\u2019s tragic fate. Engage with the world and it\u2019s inhabitants, piecing together clues and uncovering the mystery.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIterations was created over a 26-hour hackathon with 7 people of varying skill levels. The goal of the game was to learn Unreal Engine, but also gauge interest in our core game mechanic. While this is a stand-alone game, we see this as a first chapter or episode in a larger story that we would like to tell if there is enough interest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGive Iterations a try for some side-scrolling action in a small town and a nearby park with several interiors and a handful of characters to interact with. There is a mystery to unravel via a modified Groundhog Day-style narrative structure. Each day Cara learns and discovers things by interacting with the environment. The day ends when she goes to bed. She wakes up confused finding that it is the same day over again, but certain actions have changed the world allowing additional progression. From turning your lights on to helping a friend with writer's block, enjoy interacting with the townfolks through nearly 200 lines of dialog with many branching options.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2937490/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1715266754","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2937490/page.bg.jpg?t=1715266754","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2937490/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1715266754","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2937490/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1715266754","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to \u201cIterations\u201d, a narrative story where you play as Cara.
