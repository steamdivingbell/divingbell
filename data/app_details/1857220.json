With each level of the dungeon cleared, you'll face up against more difficult obstacles, challenges, and enemies. Of course, with great risk comes great reward - collect SandDollars from your surroundings to spend on character upgrades and heals, find powerful weapons to increase your chances of survival, and unlock whimsical characters to play as on your next run through the dungeon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOtterQuest differs from your usual gameplay of button spamming your attacks - your attacks are instead skill-dependant, based on the movements of your mouse. With precision-designed hitboxes, the business end of each weapon will do actual damage to your enemies - it's not just a fancy animation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs time goes on, we plan on adding more dungeons, enemies, characters, weapons, and items - each either hand-designed by our team or hand-selected by the community's submissions, turning OtterQuest into a larger community-developed experience over time.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"They see me rollin..","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1857220/ba51a088af238596b1d4e9044f2c487d48aadf8b.jpg"},{"name":"It's dangerous to go alone!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1857220/9c7af80d9942af39dd46b1f01b8ebb421876d273.jpg"},{"name":"You died!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1857220/aa165a5631fdfac808615567c44d9916dce1dd80.jpg"},{"name":"Utterly Decimated","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1857220/d83ffe823dc0b91b6f026028ad8de236a67996c9.jpg"},{"name":"Road to a Million","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1857220/559d6294246390376ee6df0ace6f9f4d6bc8ff15.jpg"}],"total":5},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1857220/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1643589081","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1857220/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1643589081","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1857220/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1643589081","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1857220/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1643589081","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You\u2019ve been given an odd request, and without protest, you get dressed and grab your sword from your weapons chest, and with much zest, you head west to complete your Otter Quest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDive through the depths of various dungeons, clearing them out of any baddies that plague their chambers, while also collecting shiny coins and fantastical weapons along the way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOtterQuest is an old-school rogue-lite action RPG, reminiscent of some of the earlier Zelda titles and their respective dungeons.
