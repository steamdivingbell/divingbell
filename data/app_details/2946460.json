{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">All the Hits</h2>Welcome to MONSTER LUV RADIO, where you play a radio DJ giving dating advice to a host of supernatural creatures! Your choices could bring them the happily ever after they've always dreamed of, or result in a lifetime of loneliness. Keep your ratings up by following the rhythm of your DJ mix board, and make sure your boss doesn't shut down your show!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Doctor Love</h2>Your advice could mean the difference for a host of supernatural creatures and their lovers. Chat with a vampire who's getting the life drained out of HER. Go undercover to discover why one girl's boyfriend disappears during the full moon. Connect lonely listeners with each other. And do it all without triggering BREAKING NEWS that could mean devastation for the locals!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mix the Music</h2>Between calls, you'll use your DJ Mix Board to follow the pattern and boost your ratings. Featuring a host of wacky radio sound effects, you can pick an easy difficulty level for casual play or bump it up for a real challenge. Match the sounds without errors to boost your ratings higher!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Impress Your Boss</h2>It could be the last night for MONSTER LUV RADIO! Helping your callers have healthy relationships will boost ratings, as will getting the right matches in the mixing mini game. At the end of the night, your boss will make the final call. Will your ratings be high enough to grant your show another season? Or is radio done with you?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2946460/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714240414","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2946460/page.bg.jpg?t=1714240414","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2946460/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714240414","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2946460/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714240414","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">All the Hits</h2>Welcome to MONSTER LUV RADIO, where you play a radio DJ giving dating advice to a host of supernatural creatures!
