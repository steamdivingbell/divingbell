{"about_the_game":"In the game, each level will be a new experience, random ghost, random item refresh, a variety of ways to pass, the player's personal style of challenge strategy and unique &quot;rules&quot; play.  When you trigger the condition required by the Ghost Rule in the level, you will receive a &quot;deadly attack&quot;.  The player can use items to neutralize this attack.  Once in the level the player was very lucky that the &quot;rule&quot; did not trigger, bringing all the items back to the safe zone.  It is also possible to trigger the &quot;rule&quot; of the Ghost continuously in the level, resulting in an early return to the safe zone.  Even return the archive to its original appearance. Players can cleverly use a variety of items to complete the level.  You can also gain insight into and seize the rules of the Ghost, and run amok in the level.  Players can also use ghost rules to attack other ghosts.
