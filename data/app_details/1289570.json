{"about_the_game":"STRAIN is not your typical survival game. While you may find yourself scavenging for resources, crafting equipment, preparing meals to restore hunger and sanity, or fighting off hostile scavengers, there is more to this world than what you see on the surface. <br><br>Factions rule the city from within inescapable walls. You must befriend others, build reputation to factions and prove yourself through faction-specific challenges to join them. These factions can help you in different ways, but who you choose to join will change the course of your life and others' along the way. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1289570/extras/steam-market.gif?t=1699761673\" /><br><br><strong>The Procedural City</strong><br>Parts of the world will change with each playthrough.
