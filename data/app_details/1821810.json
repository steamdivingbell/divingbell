circus.<br><br><br>A simple game, a simple idea, I have tried to finish it within two months, but got some issues within the development, and the time goes by, a month later aproximatelly the game can be released, or atleast trying to release it as indie solo dev... the time was one of the worst enemy that existed for this project, and made that even hardest to be finished.<br><br><br>The game has humor at its bases, I hope taking in consideration that they race over literally Wheels, there is no need to say, the game is just fiction and didn't try other thing, hoping too that the idea of &quot;Wheel races&quot; is something new or something I didn't heard about, the game didn't pretend to be 100% realistic in any ways, and so on... either the characters and other things.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Political
