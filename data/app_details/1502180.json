{"about_the_game":"What could gnomes and harpies have in common? It might seem that there's nothing, but that couldn't be further from the truth. The Harpy Queen and Gnome Queen are old friends. They first met on the Sloping Shores when a gnome ship was wrecked. The Harpy Queen helped the Gnome Queen and the whole crew reach their land and they've been the best of friends since then.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey don't see each other often, but regularly write to each other. These are usually friendly letters about fun celebrations in their kingdoms, the first snow, a nephew's birthday or the building of a new city. However, this letter was completely different to the ones before.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe messenger that delivered it was scruffy and out of breath and this was something the Gnome Queen found strange.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;&quot;What happened?&quot;&quot; the Queen asked. &quot;&quot;Your cloak is torn and your face is scratched up as if you ran through thick thorn bushes.&quot;&quot;<br />\r\n&quot;&quot;That's exactly what happened, Your Majesty,&quot;&quot; the messenger replied.<br />\r\n&quot;&quot;What for?&quot;&quot; the Queen asked in surprise. &quot;&quot;Caravans and messengers haven't used that road for ages. No one actually uses that road.

I had to deliver it as quickly as possible. There's an important message from the Harpy Queen there.&quot;&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Queen thanked the messenger and sent him to get some rest after his long road and started to read the letter from the Harpy Queen. Here is what she wrote.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;&quot;My dear friend!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI am asking you for help because I have no one else to rely on. A terrible thing happened in my kingdom. Someone sent a huge tornado against us. I suspect that it was the Sea Overlord, who has been an enemy for a long time. The tornado has already destroyed the houses of the fishermen on the shore and is now quickly blowing towards the city. I know that gnomes have technologies known to no one else.
