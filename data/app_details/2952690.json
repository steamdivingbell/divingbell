{"about_the_game":"<br><br>Traveling the world and doing good to benefit human society as a whole is what makes being a witch so rewarding. They call this the Law of the Witch--the oath that female magic users must abide to in serving humanity and helping those in need. <br><br>Witches roam from town to town, saving those who need salvation and then quickly drifting to the next destination. All girls born with magic understand that their fate is to travel the world and abide by the Law. <br><br>In a small town called Selene lived a witch-in-training, Liz. In order to become an independent and powerful witch, Liz trains every day under her master and mother, Aretta. <br><br>After finally passing her final exam as a witch-in-training, Liz graduates and becomes a full-fledged magic wielder. As promised by her oath, Liz leaves her village and sets off to the vast world outside. Little did she know, she may be the reincarnation of the Witch of Eclipse--the very woman who saved the world from a great threat in the past.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Classic RPG Experience<br></li><li>Turn-based Combat<br></li><li>Leveling System<br></li><li>Skill System<br></li><li>Fully Voiced</li></ul>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2952690?t=1733549676","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2952690?t=1733549676","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2952690/35f3ba6e82d8f3aa10690828f667c1f837c26f21/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733549676","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2952690/35f3ba6e82d8f3aa10690828f667c1f837c26f21/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733549676","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<br><br>Traveling the world and doing good to benefit human society as a whole is what makes being a witch so rewarding.
