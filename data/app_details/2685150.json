{"about_the_game":"Ace Racers SP is designed to be an FPV drone racing simulator for space drones. The purpose of the project was to make a platform for players to create and share unlimited obstacles and maneuvering challenges for the practice of thrust physics vehicles, primarily a 6axis RCS spaceship. Also available in game is a &quot;lunar lander&quot; style vehicle, and a &quot;forward only&quot; style vehicle (which only moves forward), as well as a 6axis space vehicle purpose built for pushing freight around like a space barge. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough formatted with many similarities to a racing game, and titled as a racing game, the primary function of the game is to create courses and obstacle arrangements for the purpose of expanding the available unique maneuvers to practice for the vehicle type. It is possible to export and import saved courses/obstacle arrangements, and the end-goal of the project is to collect an ever increasing database of course material for players to sift through and expand their capabilities with the sticks. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt IS possible to &quot;race&quot; yourself, although the course order and timing system are intended not for the purpose of player competition, but rather for the purpose of making it easier to share very specific arrangements/courses. By being able to create a course which highlights the next checkpoint it is possible to make a course, save the course order, and for another player to then &quot;race&quot; the course, without having to find a map or video instruction on the specific pattern of checkpoints. The course will simply tell you where to go next and when you are ready to fly without the racing system you can, or you can choose to continue to use the racing system in order to see your lap-times and compare them with your previous laps. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game was not designed with keyboard and mouse in mind, and instead was originally conceived as a way to make use of my own home-made 6axis controller. It is BEST played with some form of &quot;space game rig&quot; , for example a 6axis hotas, space mouse, or for some people a gamepad is adequate, if not a bit unintuitive for 6axis. The best &quot;lunar lander&quot; flight performance I personally have ever seen posted on the internet, was in the classic game &quot;Lunar Flight&quot; and was performed by a player claiming to have flown ONLY using keyboard (no mouse), and therefore the default control configuration for my game is also keyboard-only, as although I prefer my 4joystick gamepad , I am confident that keyboard-only is simply the superior choice over keyboard and mouse. This game uses Rewired so virtually any controller can be set up/configured by the player, although most/all should not be set up by default.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2685150/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1713129413","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2685150/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1713129413","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2685150/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1713129413","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2685150/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1713129413","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Ace Racers SP</h1><p><strong><u>This game is probably better than ice cream.</u></strong></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Ace Racers SP is designed to be an FPV drone racing simulator for space drones.
