You play as Quentin Ashborne, an archaeologist who dives into the mystery of an abandoned local cemetery only to find out that the rabbit hole goes way deeper than he could\u2019ve ever imagined. The cursed lands he has happened upon have nothing to offer him but hordes of undead; members of past civilizations who were laid to rest here, and have been condemned to come alive every night by the evil force that controls this place.
