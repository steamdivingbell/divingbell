{"about_the_game":"&quot;Toukiden: Kiwami&quot; is a hunting action game where players take on the role of a Slayer possessing unique abilities, and battle the Oni to save mankind from destruction. <br />\r\nTo defeat these huge Oni, players band together to sever, pierce, and crush parts of the Oni using the Targeted Destruction System!  <br />\r\nMultiplayer for up to 4 players is supported.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSever! Pierce! Crush!  -Targeted Destruction System-<br />\r\nSome of the Oni players will encounter are many times the size of a human. Defeating these require more than simply attacking. Players must sever a part from the Oni's body, pierce it, and then crush it in order to destroy it. The appropriate use of blade or bow, and cooperation between friendly Slayers is the only way to successfully defeat an Oni!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpirits of Heroes of Japan's Past (Mitama)<br />\r\nWhen Oni are beaten, they release captured spirits called Mitama. These Mitama can take residence in weapons and aid the Slayer unlock certain special powers for use against the Oni. There are a wide variety of powers and players can enjoy creating their own original equipment. Also, each of these 300 Mitama from across time come with a special illustration and voice, making them fun to collect. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn Original World painted in Japanese history<br />\r\nThe story is set in a world set apart in time and space by the power of the Oni. The player starts as a rookie Slayer in a Slayer village called Utakata and fights the Oni in areas that display characteristics of time periods ranging from ancient days to the early Shogunate. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFriends and Allies<br />\r\nThere to show this new rookie around are the veterans Slayers of the Utakata village. These warriors, including Ouka, a swordswoman with no equal in the organization, will guide and train the player as together they battle the Oni and save the human race.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* The images are from an in-development build and may differ from the final version.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"The Ultimate Slayer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/363130/3dd2c5863d482ca4b8497a48061597ad8bb708ac.jpg"},{"name":"Slayer of the Northern Oni","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/363130/6cf945ef6bf74098c22179be26f3895516af932b.jpg"},{"name":"There and Back Again","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/363130/7b14cef7d25d3be776184b6bd554bebbb52e3f0e.jpg"},{"name":"Slaying the Night Away","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/363130/799e238535e5e33b1e131fa14a3b4513c87dae8e.jpg"},{"name":"Through the Valley of Death","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/363130/512e0cd30778d492c43c5f871dc2e8dcba5eed7e.jpg"},{"name":"Hero for the Ages","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/363130/42fef5559f5783b0dedaeec4c81f907e91008c6e.jpg"},{"name":"Conquering Hero","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/363130/381a999f903bd36e45f2b35f34a338d2782b10ee.jpg"},{"name":"Fearsome Warrior","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/363130/1c00adc9f2414bb261dc35ecb8cb9a4d734b8a31.jpg"},{"name":"Ultimate Hero","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/363130/08ee4013c7c49447d8415bbf1abe8a290344bd2d.jpg"},{"name":"Mitama Whisperer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/363130/f68eec6bf7ee66815888f96291f4142f29e1790d.jpg"}],"total":50},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/363130/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729051108","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/363130/page.bg.jpg?t=1729051108","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/363130/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729051108","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/363130/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729051108","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;Toukiden: Kiwami&quot; is a hunting action game where players take on the role of a Slayer possessing unique abilities, and battle the Oni to save mankind from destruction. <br />\r\nTo defeat these huge Oni, players band together to sever, pierce, and crush parts of the Oni using the Targeted Destruction System!  <br />\r\nMultiplayer for up to 4 players is supported.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSever!
