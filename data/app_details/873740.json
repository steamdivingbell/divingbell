These dead-zones are areas in which the player is brought back to the Main Menu. If you have not saved your score you will lose any unsaved points. One of these dead-zones lies within the green radiation area northwest of the Starter Arena. Others are invisible. Because of this, we are lowering the price until the Update is released. Of course, anyone who purchases before the update will receive the update for free.<br><strong>REMINDER:</strong> This is a very large exploration area. 17,000 sq. km, takes a large file.
