{"about_the_game":"The year is 1467. The Sengoku period has just begun. Every Daimyo will be out for blood, trying to bring glory to their clan and be unifier of Japan. More than might and riches, cunning is required. Will you support their bid for power? Will you help the Shogunate regain their strength? Will you assist the Emperor in reclaiming their control over the other Daimyo? Or will you carve your own path to become the unifier?<br><br><strong>Sengoku: Shadow Strikers</strong> is a Tactical RPG that mixes Turn-Based Tactical Combat into the formula, and puts the player in control of their very own Sengoku-era Clan.
