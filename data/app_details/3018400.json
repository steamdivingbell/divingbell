{"about_the_game":"Please play the demo before purchasing. The free demo has most of the functionality of the full game, but it does not have bonds or commodities. The full version includes those features.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this game, you play as a deity that can gamble their shrine treasury on various financial instruments, including stocks, bonds and commodities. Upgrade your shrine with your winnings to perform &quot;miracles&quot; to manipulate financial markets. Do not get attached to your first dozen player characters; this game is quite difficult, with an incredibly steep learning curve. Do not be decieved by the apparent simplicity. There are meant to be dozens of hours of gameplay in the demo and hundreds of hours of gameplay in the full game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is meant to be played with a pencil and paper or with a second monitor and spreadsheet.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo give the game the same thrill that one might experience as a quant trader or investor, statistical models have been used to mirror the United States stock market. The financial markets of the world are generally well-correlated, so you will not miss anything (or at least that is the idea).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFind all ten or so profitable techniques.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3018400/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1720412516","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3018400/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1720412516","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3018400/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1720412516","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3018400/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1720412516","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3018490,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Please play the demo before purchasing.
