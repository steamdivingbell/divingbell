{"about_the_game":"The Great Houses DLC expands the unique feudal economy simulation of Lords and Villeins allowing you to leave your mark on the world at large with a host of new, intricate gameplay mechanics. You can now truly live out the fantasy of building up a great noble house by growing your influence, purchasing land titles and sending peasant families to exploit the new territories to achieve unprecedented levels of wealth and prosperity. You are not alone in this world however - engage in diplomacy and trade with other, AI-controlled, Noble Houses, including the Royal family and their royal city itself; or choose to reach your goals by military means and subdue your competition.
