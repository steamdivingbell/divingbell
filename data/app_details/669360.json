{"about_the_game":"Infested Nation is a top down shooter set 2 years after the apocalypse. You play as a one-man extermination crew, clearing buildings of infected and people in order to then loot it. Outnumbered and outgunned, you will need to rely on your wits and reflexes to make it through each situation alive. <br>Make use of 15 devastating weapons to shoot, cut, burn and blow your way through every target.<br><br><strong>Key Features</strong><br><br>Combat: Fighting both infected and survivors is bloody and brutal. As a single bullet is lethal, you will have to quickly eliminate enemies before they have a chance to attack.<br><br>Story: Murder your way through 16 levels, filled with infected, survivors and the military. <br><br>Weapons: There is a huge variety of weapons, ranging from a simple machete or supressed pistol to flamethrowers and chainsaws. Each weapon has its own advantages and will allow you to approach every situation differently.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"EXECUTION","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/669360/0738fed96918028dddc017e3afc91e34002247b5.jpg"},{"name":"BUTCHER","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/669360/60ecb3cdca194068790e69d9da9bca2f2a66ecd3.jpg"},{"name":"SHARPSHOOTER","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/669360/5d3ae2d42c5dcc73a805fa4b7c7d9581fab30892.jpg"},{"name":"DISSIMILAR","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/669360/a6592992711859e0c4a1a2bf1e5d3d2d7a6d464c.jpg"},{"name":"THE END","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/669360/3bfd53e8f9d98235646584e136456272221f0181.jpg"},{"name":"MISSION 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/669360/98cff38a79577f955f31a2fc35d7117fd6ea1afb.jpg"},{"name":"MISSION 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/669360/9678e23d9b8756636ed510bbc8a5e6d2132acb87.jpg"},{"name":"MISSION 3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/669360/0ec8c20b5af4d9126dc8146035fe947298c68d81.jpg"},{"name":"MISSION 4","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/669360/040c09ca9ea53069c60cd43b1e56682058337f4a.jpg"},{"name":"MISSION 5","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/669360/1e3a9dbd8d641c87523e6e915b9fe8be609090b6.jpg"}],"total":20},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/669360/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1501223573","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/669360/page.bg.jpg?t=1501223573","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/669360/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1501223573","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/669360/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1501223573","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Infested Nation is a top down shooter set 2 years after the apocalypse.
