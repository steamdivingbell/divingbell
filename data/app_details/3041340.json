{"about_the_game":"Ahoy, stinky pirate! Captain Barrel is the wacky arcade puzzle platformer you've been waiting for!<br><br>Strike your enemies with your sword, put them in barrels and kick them across the screen to collect treasure and get a high score!<br><br><strong>Captain Barrel</strong> is very easy to get into, but offers the replay value you expect from an arcade game. Once you master all the mechanics and have learnt the levels, you will be coming back again and again for a higher score. <br><br>If the enemy you knock out was trapped in a barrel, you\u2019ll get a ruby (500pts); if it was on the ground you\u2019ll get an emerald (800pts); if it was active you\u2019ll get a diamond (1000pts)... And if you manage to knock 4 or more with a single barrel, you\u2019ll get a treasure chest (5000pts)! Not enough? The 3rd time you do that within a World, instead of a chest, you\u2019ll get a map to a secret bonus area that will fill your pirate\u2019s pockets with points! Think you can do more? Challenge the bosses and grab gold coins right under their nose. Really want to break a record? Speedrun and complete the game in one life! Still can\u2019t get enough? Have a buddy join the game, and see which of you gets more treasure!<br><br><u>Features:</u><br><br>* 32 levels, split into 4 worlds each ruled by a boss.<br>* Enemies, traps and platforms galore !<br>* An elaborate scoring system designed for competition.<br>* About 25 minutes of arcade playtime.<br>* A challenge scalable to your scoring ambitions, 8 difficulty levels.<br>* Gameplay that is easy to get into, yet takes practice to master.<br>* 2-player alternated competitive play.<br>* Cute, colourful pixel art.<br>* A rocking pirate soundtrack.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3041340/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728386143","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3041340/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1728386143","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3041340/4a722e7a8b3ac1d84aa2d634056fa0e8bc895513/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728386143","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3041340/4a722e7a8b3ac1d84aa2d634056fa0e8bc895513/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728386143","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Ahoy, stinky pirate!
