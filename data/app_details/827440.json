The Oslid are powerful and mobile on the attack, but vulnerable on the defense, and afflicted by poor levies.<br><br><strong>Duchy of Dunwall</strong><br>The Duchy of Dunwall offers a lighter and more flexible alternative to the classic Kingdom of Westdale. Dunwall fields a wide selection of heavy and light infantry supported by lethal longbow men and highly defensive billhook levies. Their armies are well supported by numerous light, recon cavalry, but are chillingly deficient in heavy cavalry.<br><br><strong>Markgravate of Nordwacht</strong><br>The Markgravate of Nordwacht excels in cavalry maneuver and skirmish combat with Outrider horse archers and Jagers. When maneuver fails, they fall back on heavy defensive infantry to hold the line against the goblin onslaught. <br><br><strong>Grand Duchy Ot\u010dina</strong><br>The Grand Duchy of Ot\u010dina employs powerful infantry lines built around elite Battle Master regiments and supported by pavise crossbowmen.
