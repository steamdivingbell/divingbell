{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Design Philosophy</h2><br>FRM offers a unique sandbox experience. The game focuses on bringing the management aspect of the motorsport world to life by providing a challenging simulation, where you steer a racing team in a dynamically changing racing world while respecting your time. Seasons are dynamic, quick, and exciting.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dynamic</h2><br>You take on one of ten teams in the most prestigious motorsport competition. Not only do you need to pick suppliers and secure new sponsors each season, but suppliers and sponsors will change over time. Even teams might decide to sell their team to suppliers and sponsors bringing new names into the competition.<br><br>Drivers and Staff will be the backbone of your team, but they also develop and hone their skills and will eventually retire. When they retire, you may choose a new name and nationality for the newcomers that will generate or choose to let their names be reincarnated into the talent pool.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Putting the Manager into the Manager Genre</h2><br>You will not spend most of your time babysitting your drivers on the track. You are paying a race engineer to do that after all. Instead, you will plan the race weekend, and tell them what to focus on and what degree of risk you want them to take for the strategy.<br><br>This game is about car development, financial management, picking the right staff, and the right drivers, and planning to get your team to the top of the world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">In-Game Editor</h2>The game has an In-Game Editor to offer all kinds of customization. Change Teams, Drivers, Sponsors, Suppliers and so on. Make the game yours and upload it to the workshop for others to experience!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What this is not!</h2>I don't want to lie to you and I don't want to oversell my game. So here is a quick disclaimer telling you what this game is not:<br><br>- This game does not offer any modeled race simulation. They are done in the background and you will get the results. This is nothing that will be done during the life-time of this game. And if you want to see cars go fast, you need to look at Motorsport Manager or F1 Manager.<br><br>- This is not a detailed car simulation. The car stats and the car development are quite gamified. On the flip side this means that this game does not require any knowledge about aerodynamics, air resistance or how engine goes brrrrrr...<br><br>- This game is not AAA polished and if it where, it would be 6x as expensive. I am working solo, I am trying to realize my vision for my games to the best of my abilities.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"The little things","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2990550/8371bfd53d8dd9296248a6eccf450fdb2f6dd47b.jpg"},{"name":"Steps to victory","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2990550/5479c54e7770d6c6b2d6278239efbc97033f5ce3.jpg"},{"name":"The Great Price","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2990550/e4d2df39d93eaad327f652e2e1b7a069ffbca8b4.jpg"},{"name":"1-2 Team Effort","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2990550/98b39afdfee39bc7aeab70014ee6e3d33a55c56e.jpg"},{"name":"Champion","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2990550/8d332472ed6bad7a6eb1cfd44dbb2bff292ee302.jpg"},{"name":"Champions","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2990550/8c2d0dacc33a1c24560da1830319576ac3b28692.jpg"},{"name":"New Powerhouse","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2990550/3561069810391dc52e3ac438a181859fd62b41ea.jpg"},{"name":"Shifting up","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2990550/cc6695cd129c28dcf6b85edeb472743117ba7bd2.jpg"},{"name":"Slowly but steady","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2990550/eb71b3e04170f406314e749c74b588cd1abe4950.jpg"},{"name":"Catching Wind","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2990550/51f23714b31209762cc9bfc9042ff62c25cbbbcd.jpg"}],"total":29},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2990550/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725029968","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2990550/page.bg.jpg?t=1725029968","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2990550/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725029968","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2990550/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725029968","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Design Philosophy</h2><br>FRM offers a unique sandbox experience.
