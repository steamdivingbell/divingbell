{"about_the_game":"Binary Fission is the process by which many single-celled organisms reproduce. They copy their DNA and then split into two new cells.<br><br>In Lifeforms: Binary Fission, you play as a single-celled lifeform and must hunt in a microscopic environment to find food and avoid threats so you can undergo a fission event. Each time you perform a binary fission, you get to choose a mutation which will be applied to both new cells. You continue controlling one cell while your clone autonomously roams the environment looking for food and eventually multiplying again on its own. If the lifeform you are controlling is destroyed, you automatically switch control to the nearest member of your species (provided you are not the last one.)<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2685010/extras/lifeforms_feeding_gif_01.gif?t=1705209318\" /><br>Find food to sustain and grow your lifeform.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2685010/extras/lifeforms_fission_event_gif_01.gif?t=1705209318\" /><br>Choose a mutation for your lifeform during each Binary Fission. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2685010/extras/lifeforms_combat_gif_01.gif?t=1705209318\" /><br>Fight other lifeforms to eat them.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Dominated Demo Environment","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2685010/1f9bca1f84938506abf1cbead75df537f68cb699.jpg"},{"name":"Completed Tutorial Missions","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2685010/2c820edf7eb1058fafb3206738d4bf05da43e10e.jpg"},{"name":"Complete Demo Using All 3 Starting Foods","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2685010/cc0e28f226422996671f1b8591624ba737fc1f13.jpg"}],"total":3},"background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2685010/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1705209318","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2685010/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1705209318","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Binary Fission is the process by which many single-celled organisms reproduce.
