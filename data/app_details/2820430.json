The intricate mental health mechanics simulate the psychological impact of isolation and supernatural encounters. Unseen threats lurk around every corner, with entities that challenge both your sanity and your survival instincts. Navigating this delicate balance involves strategic resource management and keen awareness of your surroundings, as you decipher what is real from the sinister illusions that plague your mind.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2820430/extras/Seclusion_Escape.gif?t=1718813845\" /><br>Escape is not merely about finding a way out but understanding the enigma of your entrapment. Your journey is fraught with choices, each shaping your path and fate. The original death system weaves your decisions into the narrative, leading to multiple endings, each a reflection of your journey. The items you gather, from the mundane to the bizarre, are your tools for survival, each a small piece of the larger puzzle that is the Backrooms. While crafting offers a glimmer of hope, it's your wits, decisions, and the secrets you unlock that will ultimately guide you to your escape or seal your fate within the endless maze.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2820430/extras/Wishlist.gif?t=1718813845\" /><br><strong>And remember to wishlist and follow the game if you want to play it</strong><br><br><strong>Unravel the mysteries, endure the unknown, and find your escape in the shifting labyrinth of The Backrooms.</strong>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Escapist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2820430/2f54b536910dd0f43914b837012b3c9de53df586.jpg"},{"name":"I got a ticket !","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2820430/dd7e070ce2b27c0cf0e3d981ad068dd4000dc52e.jpg"},{"name":"Pathfinder","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2820430/4177b6bda64d8139efaf38fc79c19dad4b7a7949.jpg"},{"name":"Sequencer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2820430/aeb51ff4a70891392f87259787241fd9e78271aa.jpg"},{"name":"Squared dreams","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2820430/62e0c5e2f56aadefb6e0b2f230b879e64e1b8bb8.jpg"},{"name":"Path opened","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2820430/147651b9ab39b751262e4f200e6cc7de97f3374f.jpg"},{"name":"PSX Graphics","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2820430/1062569f022486ce0b9ed13475b9c2828e13eebe.jpg"}],"total":7},"background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2820430/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718813845","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2820430/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718813845","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<br><strong>Join our discord server by clicking this animated banner</strong><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2820430/extras/Seclusion.gif?t=1718813845\" /><br>&quot;Seclusion&quot; plunges you into the mysterious Backrooms, an ever-changing labyrinth where reality unravels.
