Enemies are relentlessly attacking your control gem, so you must defeat them, collect shards, upgrade your gems, and discover powerful elemental combinations to defend your creator.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The twist is that not all gems grow the same way. Their development is completely random, leading to infinite replayability. You'll never know what your gems will turn into, so you'll have to adapt your strategies on the fly to overcome each new challenge.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Inspired by classic and beloved TDs, in Elgem TD you harness the power of the elements - fire, water, earth, and air and many more- to create the ultimate defensive setup. Combine gems in creative ways to unleash devastating attacks and protect the Elgem Nexus. Can you survive the onslaught and prove yourself the master of this element-themed tower defense?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3304610/extras/Random_Gems.png?t=1732248632\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3304610/extras/Random_Gems_gif.gif?t=1732248632\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">At the start of each wave you place a number of gem bases, which are then assigned a random unlocked element by the Elgem Nexus. Choose which one to keep to face the next wave. The level could be won by getting the right gem in the right place. There are damage, support and crowd control gems to unlock and master.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3304610/extras/Gem_Combos.png?t=1732248632\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3304610/extras/Gem_Combo_gif.gif?t=1732248632\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Enemies are coming in droves through the portals.

Every level you play will be different! You won\u2019t always get the same gems in the same locations, even if you unlock the same elements. Some enemies will have immunities and special abilities, so you will need to adapt and try different strategies and different combinations of elements.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3304610/extras/Survival_Mode.png?t=1732248632\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Think you have what it takes to protect the Elgem Nexus?
