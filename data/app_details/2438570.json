{"about_the_game":"<i>Hearth\u2019s Pantheon is a narrative-driven, old school JRPG about an island haunted by fractured ghosts and corrupted deities. Play as Maya and her group of misfit friends, Virgil the Ghost; Luli the Witch; and Flora the Summoner, as they explore and discover the secrets of Hearth Island by talking to ghosts and recording their memories. Uncorrupt the Guardians of Hearth to bring peace to both ghosts and humans!</i><br><br>Maya is new to her sleepy beach town and pretty lonely-- no one really wants to hang out with a dirt-covered, rock-collecting, cave-crawling stranger. It seems like she's the only one curious about the ghosts that hover around her island. For that matter, Maya might be the only one who can see them at all! The ghosts aren't harmless, though-- the weather's been unsettling and people around town are acting strange and kind of depressed. Maya's adventuring soon pays off when she meets Virgil, the ghost of a kid who died last summer. Together, they start to unravel what's bothering the other ghosts, and they make new friends, too!<br><br><strong><i>FEATURES: </i></strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Engage in retro turn-based combat to weaken ghosts.<br><br></li><li> Use Maya\u2019s magical lantern to restore memories to confused ghosts and Guardians.<br><br></li><li> Ghost NPCs populate each area as you restore them! <br><br></li><li> Unlock Moods to provide buffs and disadvantages for each character.
