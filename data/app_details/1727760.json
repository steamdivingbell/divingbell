{"about_the_game":"Mars Tactics combines turn-based tactical gameplay with large-scale strategic operations across a detailed map of Mars. Choose between two factions; the scrappy resource-starved Labor revolutionaries, or the expansive shareholder-controlled Capital army. Lead soldiers that grow and learn dynamically from their experiences, in and out of battle, alongside scientists and engineers that ensure you stay one step ahead of the enemy at all times.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1727760/extras/image_01_loop.gif?t=1736171688\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1727760/extras/headline_01.png?t=1736171688\" /><br>The dust never truly settles on Mars.
