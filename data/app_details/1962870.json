A new food type - nectar - will appear in your inventory. It is one of the most essential ingredients in the nutrition of the birds of Oceania. It\u2019s also an excellent substitute for other types of food for birds from different parts of the world. <br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1962870/extras/OE_Emu.gif?t=1736861043\" /><br><strong>Take on new challenges</strong><br>Along with new bird abilities, Oceania Expansion offers new bonus cards and end-of-round goals. Now you have to pay attention to more details: not only to the sets of birds and nests, and their wingspan but also to which way your bird's beak is facing on the card. There may also be times when a round has no end goal. All these challenges, and many more, will add variety to your subsequent games.<br><br><strong>New alternative player board</strong><br>The player board now presents a new design and functionalities. You will find on it not only a place for your nectar but also options for resetting the bird feeder and card tray. The board also enables you to get more food and cards quicker than before while laying eggs is reduced. All these changes diversify the dynamics of the gameplay.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1962870/extras/OE_Count_Raggis_Bird_of_Paradise.gif?t=1736861043\" /><br><strong>Listen to some more relaxing music</strong><br>In Wingspan: Oceania Expansion we continue to expand the game with new tracks composed by Pawe\u0142 G\u00f3rniak.
