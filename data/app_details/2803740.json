Gee-kun-soft\u2019s latest MZ-style character pack offers up 16 characters with fantasy classes so your dungeon-diving heroes can make sure they have the best team for the quest. Give your players choices in their female and male party member\u2019s classes thanks to 8 class options. Have your armored stoic hero, katana-wielding heroine, and shark-toothed warriors keep their party safe while the assassins in dark outfits sneak around to hit weak points, buff fighters attack head-on, and lightly armored samurai slice foes in half. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach character comes with a walking character sprite, faceset with 8 emotions, a SV Battler, static enemy images, and bust images so you can build full storyline arcs and cutscenes for each hero in your game! This pack also includes 7 SV weapons so you can match a party member\u2019s attack to the weapons that appear in their bust images, or give your main character some cool new swords and staves to wield.
