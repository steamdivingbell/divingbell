{"about_the_game":"Explore a large 2D world in retro 90s pixel style, ally with or wage war against NPC and Human player Guilds, and craft the ultimate gear in this better-than-ever loving remake of the Odyssey Online Classic. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince 1997, Odyssey has provided countless hours of fun.  This labor of love by a former player is bringing the game into the 21st century, with better graphics, better lighting, a much larger, more immersive world, and deeper combat mechanics.  From the character sprites to the buildings to the terrain, many improvements have been applied.  We stand on the shoulders of giants: artwork and features from many previous Odyssey projects and spinoffs have been married to a no-hassle browser experience to provide the same classic experience in HD.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe have been working hard for 2 years on this title, and are proud to say there is a stable server up and world building is underway.  The coding is nearly complete, and many of the features are fully functional.  Please enjoy this Early Access to check out our progress. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSupport us now, and earn Luck tokens which will provide benefits when the game releases.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1880130/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1662050073","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1880130/page.bg.jpg?t=1662050073","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1880130/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1662050073","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1880130/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1662050073","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"The game features cartoon blood and violence against monsters and humans.
