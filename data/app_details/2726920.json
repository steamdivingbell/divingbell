{"about_the_game":"Players take on the role of a girl using scissors to resist weed enemies. There are currently over twenty types of weed enemies in the game, each with their own attack methods and ranges. Humans and plants track players, while other weeds move randomly or remain stationary. Scissors rotate around the player, and the player needs to avoid attacks from weed enemies, find opportunities to attack enemies, and eliminate all enemies.<br />\r\nThe game can be played alone or with two players. In the two player mode, the health of ordinary enemies doubles, and the number of man eating flowers and plants becomes two.<br />\r\nAfter the enemy's health drops to zero, they will not immediately die, but will transform into soul form and can still attack players. When all enemies transform into soul form, the game wins.<br />\r\nThe game has a blocking mechanism, where players can press the attack button to block enemy attacks at the moment they are about to be attacked.<br />\r\nThe game is divided into normal mode (enemies move randomly) and weed mode (enemies do not move). The game can challenge fixed levels, select enemies to challenge, and generate random enemies.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Level 1 (Normal Mode)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2726920/5ec30cddaddea2792d0719c9f6c91ddf8e9f8c4a.jpg"},{"name":"Level 5 (Normal Mode)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2726920/45441cd9bc4c79d773c2ecdd16f4d0cdbb666e52.jpg"},{"name":"Level 10 (Normal Mode)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2726920/527ebecc1baf9edfe9d7e2e4a1002cc4723c13f5.jpg"},{"name":"Level 15 (Normal Mode)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2726920/bb376e38f76745a2ab626f9f7ca5b71fa2903fd0.jpg"},{"name":"Level 20 (Normal Mode)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2726920/2a70164eeb1b1365fee4bc36967fcb3b97376702.jpg"},{"name":"Level 25 (Normal Mode)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2726920/506efeb25682236facc07963c8022e4c15cba6e3.jpg"},{"name":"Level 30 (Normal Mode)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2726920/91fb65c03e22d0e7f193de5892327874c4576db0.jpg"},{"name":"Level 35 (Normal Mode)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2726920/969dd3d8c8771af7b64fdf2e4af70d96f999b3c9.jpg"},{"name":"Level 40 (Normal Mode)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2726920/632d3a045e50d90e665cb914ddd21b1170444c40.jpg"},{"name":"Level 45 (Normal Mode)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2726920/c967890f91528ee0bdb27292bfce76db3810863a.jpg"}],"total":26},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2726920/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1722952290","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2726920/page.bg.jpg?t=1722952290","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2726920/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1722952290","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2726920/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1722952290","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3083970,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<h1>\u5173\u6ce8\u6211\u4eec</h1><p>qq\u4ea4\u6d41\u7fa4\uff1a160196732\r\nB\u7ad9\uff1ahttps://space.bilibili.com/3493135049033939</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Players take on the role of a girl using scissors to resist weed enemies.
