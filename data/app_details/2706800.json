{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><i><u>Features</u></i></strong></h2><br>Frogenlav: Skyward Bound features many interesting mechanics to indulge in as you explore the world. These range from simple movement mechanics to obscure magical abilities!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Magic</h2>Frogenlav quickly discovers his world is magical, and is in a race to master it. Use abilities such as: A floating lily pad platform, a jump of your axe from wherever it currently is, a super jump, sliding along the floor on your axe, gliding through the sky with a leaf, blow bubble warp points and even more ridiculous, change the time of day at will by sleeping on the spot!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Movement</h2>Frogenlav's movement is physics based. Jump, roll, and swing through the skies! Utilise movement specific abilities like axe slide and lily pad platform to help you maneuver through the levels.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combat</h2>Throw your magical war axe to get rid of the cane toads, but make sure to keep a distance from them! Kick off of your axe while riding to fling it forward and hit enemies as well!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">World</h2>Use your movement and magical abilities to hop through platforming challenges, calm towns, challenging combat, and tricky puzzles! Frogenlav will feature 6 distinct districts and many levels to complete!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><i><u>Story</u></i></strong></h2><br><strong>Frogenlav</strong> is a little frog living his ordinary life in his little frog village. That is, until the pesky, evil Cane Toads hatched their plan of sending themselves to the sky in search for a transformative power called <i>'total self-control'</i>. Follow Frogenlav and his magical Viking Avian friend Ava, as they chop and hop their way through the skies!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Cane Toads Strike</h2>The Cane Toads are long time rivals of the frogs, and this time they're back and seeking absolute power. Hop through the many different biomes of the sky islands to stop the Cane Toads from succeeding and leading an oppressive rule over the land with their leader, <strong><i>'Citizen Canetoad'</i></strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Frogenlav's Struggles</h2>After becoming a Viking Frog, Frogenlav quickly finds himself overwhelmed. This is not the first time Frogenlav has been vulnerable, though. Traverse the Monochromatic Plane to get to the bottom of Frogenlav's struggles as he fights his internal battle.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2706800/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1703809326","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2706800/page.bg.jpg?t=1703809326","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2706800/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1703809326","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2706800/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1703809326","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><i><u>Features</u></i></strong></h2><br>Frogenlav: Skyward Bound features many interesting mechanics to indulge in as you explore the world.
