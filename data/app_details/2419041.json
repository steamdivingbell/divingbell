When they meet in a solar eclipse, time collides with time, sending jagged pieces of Was, Will-Be, and Might-Have-Been tearing through the weave of seasons and years. This Spirit exists mostly in the high reaches of the heavens, but touches the island now and then, time and possibility flowing around it like a wind-blown mantle.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Spirit - Lure of the Deep Wilderness:</strong> From time to time, a handful of Dahan residents would get a distant look in their eyes and stride off into the heart of the island, no pleading or reason dissuading them from seeking some distant call only they could hear. Many of these involuntary wanderers survived and settled together in time. A few of them spoke, in voices of wonder mingled with fear, of finding the Spirit that called them ever-further inward. But most never even saw it, only felt its distant beckoning.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Spirit - Many Minds Move as One:</strong> A Spirit of flocks, swarms, schools, and packs, where the whole moves together in concert to accomplish what the individuals in it could not do alone. Its nature leans towards smaller and simpler creatures, and it regards other sorts of animals \u2212 including humans \u2212 as bizarrely alien in their individuality.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Spirit - Shroud of Silent Mist:</strong> A Spirit of dissolution and the cold silence of death, creeping quietly down from the hills and across the open waters. Its trail is adorned with dew-covered leaves and the bones of small animals. Some legends say it came from the final breath of a Dahan Spirit-speaker who spoke too freely of secrets entrusted to him\u2026</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Spirit - Stone's Unyielding Defiance:</strong> Some things refuse to break. Underneath the soil and sand of the island lies rock, layer upon layer built up over the ages. Some stones weather quickly once exposed to the elements, while others are sterner and harder. This is a Spirit of that stone which resists being shattered, moved, or shaped to the will of another. It\u2019s not unfriendly to other Spirits or the Dahan, but it works with them on its own terms.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Spirit - Vengeance as a Burning Plague:</strong> A Spirit of vengeance, anger, and retribution. It slumbers in a simmering volcanic pool, awakening at unpredictable intervals\u2026 or when roused through supplication by one wronged. Most Dahan consider this foolhardy, for it vents its wrath on entire communities, and its pestilence may spread anywhere. It is unclear whether its recent waking is due directly to the ravaging of the Invaders or to some Spirit\u2019s pleas.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Spirit -\u00a0Volcano Looming High:</strong> A Spirit of fire and earth stretching upwards to the sky, casting a long and dangerous shadow across the land. It doesn\u2019t dislike humans per se, but neither does it have much use for them, so the Dahan tend to keep away from it as much as possible. However, they sometimes end up dealing with its temper whether they want to or not\u2026</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Adversary - The Habsburg Monarchy (Livestock Colony):</strong> Emperor Joseph I inherited the Habsburg Monarchy upon the death of his father, Leopold I, shortly after the conclusion of the War of the Spanish Succession. Habsburg colonies are newer than those of any European power save Russia but have grown quickly due to their focus on nomadic herding rather than farming and infrastructure.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Adversary - The Tsardom of Russia:</strong> The newest colonial power in Europe, having recently emerged as a fledgling naval power. Given their control of a massive population as well as the vast lands of Siberia, Russia has no need for additional population or land. Instead, the early Russian colonies have focused on the rapid exploitation of natural resources that require minimal infrastructure to extract, notably furs and ivory.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Scenario - Despicable Theft:\u00a0</strong>Small groups of Invaders have been searching the island, and a few have found wonders. If they make it home, their people will stop at nothing to seek out more such fantastic treasures. Even those without wonders have tales and trophies that may bolster the Invaders\u2019 resolve to stay.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Scenario -\u00a0Elemental Invocation:</strong> The Spirits can call forth wellsprings of essence to empower small areas of the island, strengthening and aligning nature with a particular element. This is fortunate, for the Invaders are encroaching more strongly than before.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Scenario - The Great River:</strong> The island is vast, and the Invaders are firmly entrenched in its western lands.
