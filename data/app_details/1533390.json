{"about_the_game":"Reject Humanity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRun, climb, and jump in VR using a unique locomotion method that only needs the movement of your hands and arms. No buttons, no sticks, no teleportation. Push off of surfaces to jump and squeeze them with both hands to climb.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are four different game modes - From simple Tag, for up to 3 players, or infection mode, with 4 or more.  The Hunt game mode gives you a unique personal target to chase down.  Paintbrawl is a team vs. team paintball battle using slingshots.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRun from the other gorillas, or outmaneuver the survivors to catch them. Parkour up trees and cliff faces to evade and chase monke down. Hang out in a virtual jungle with randos or group up in a private room with friends to hang out and play. The stakes are low, so feel free to just chat or make up your own games. The movement is easy to learn, and hard to master. Crossplay with the PC versions of the game, so play with anyone on any platform.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are six different levels to explore.
