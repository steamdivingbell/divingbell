{"about_the_game":"Find the Energy is a spin-off game to our successful Find the Birds and Find the Whales free educational games for all ages.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Find the Energy, players choose from a male or female avatar. They then choose a place, based on an actual location, from the globe, to travel to in their solar-powered ultralight.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce they arrive, for example, at Pincher Creek in southwest Alberta, Canada, they are greeted by a non-player character (NPC). The NPC represents local companies that are doing work regarding renewable energy development and installation in the area.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers are taught by the NPC about green energy, such as wind power. They are shown around the area. They take photos for their photo album.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThen they collect information cards about the energy history of the area, like hydroelectricity. They also collect points, which they will use in the store to purchase (no actual currency or paid upgrades in this totally free game!) tools which will help them complete quests.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers find the parts and then set up three wind turbines. After doing this, they connect them to the power grid and turn on the system. Then they get a charging station so they can connect it and charge their farm tractor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers receive rewards such as an badge and a winter pass so they can view the area in winter.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2283440/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1677533566","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2283440/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1677533566","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2283440/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1677533566","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2283440/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1677533566","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Find the Energy is a spin-off game to our successful Find the Birds and Find the Whales free educational games for all ages.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Find the Energy, players choose from a male or female avatar.
