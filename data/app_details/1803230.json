In &quot;Late for Class: Variety King&quot;, falling is just part of the journey. With 9 movement mechanics to master, you will need to push through the tough spots to come out on top.<br><br></li><li><strong>No checkpoints</strong>. Falling from some places will set you back to the start, but from others, you'll only fall partway, giving you a chance to recover and keep going.<br><br></li><li><strong>Chill practice mode</strong>.
