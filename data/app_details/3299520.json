Please enjoy.&quot;</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Set in a Fantasy World</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game is  about the player being reincarnated into another world. The new world has monsters, humans etc. The goal of the game is to climb to the top of the dungeon tower in <strong>100 days</strong>. Manage your time, level up, train your stats or work to earn extra money. Will you finally be the one to climb to the top and claim the title of the strongest?</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>All About Cards</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The entire system is based on Cards.
