{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore this post apocalyptic future</h2><br>Last Days Of Future is a post-apocalyptic multiplayer survival game set in 2765. You have just woken up in the back of an old bunker, you are alone and probably one of the last survivors of the human species. Go on an adventure to discover what happened to this world that evolved without you and find answers to your questions.<br><br>Use what you find to craft useful items for your survival by exploring ruins and abandoned buildings. But beware of the dangers lurking. Some areas will require more preparation than others with much greater dangers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Manufacturing and construction</h2><br>The crafting system is scalable and doesn't require long hours to level up and unlock new stuff. You will have to dismantle what you have at hand and try combinations of objects, the results will be varied and not always effective, but it is by trying that you learn.<br>The weapon crafting is not like all the other survival games, you take the pieces you have and combine them. Exemple : you have a broom, a toaster and some ducktape, what will you do ? broom as handle and toaster to be the head ? obvious but what if you want broom to hit and toaster as handle ? here you can, maybe not the more effective weapon but it's your choosen weapon.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2204650/extras/DescriptionImg01.jpg?t=1683062719\" /><br><br>You can establish your base wherever you want, whether in a house that you barricade or in the middle of nature by putting up the walls and fences yourself to feel safe at night.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2204650/extras/DescriptionImg02.jpg?t=1683062719\" /><br><br>Recovery will also be important to improve your daily life, survival is good but with electricity it's better! Why not even a pet robot that will do the tasks for you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Play Solo and co-op</h2><br>Whether you're a solo adventurer or prefer community living, Last Days Of Future lets you have the experience you desire. Players versus players is possible, friendly fire too but if you want survival only it is also a possibility and you have the choice to leave the game public or private. In-game communication is done in a realistic way, if you are too far away you will not be heard. The sessions are dynamic, your friends (or enemies) can join you whenever they want.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The world evolves with you</h2><br>As you advance in Last Days Of Future, new elements will be offered to you and the discoveries and experiences you will have will make you a better survivor.<br>The seasons will have their importance on your survival which will force you to find solutions to warm you up or feed you for example.<br>Random events may occur to upset your daily life.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2204650/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1683062719","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2204650/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1683062719","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2204650/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1683062719","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2204650/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1683062719","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore this post apocalyptic future</h2><br>Last Days Of Future is a post-apocalyptic multiplayer survival game set in 2765.
