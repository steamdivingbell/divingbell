{"about_the_game":"Babel of Ystilia combines tactical, turn-based gameplay of traditional roguelikes with fast-paced, minimalistic and intuitive combat where your movement and turn timings are the key to getting out of fights unscathed. Learn enemy patterns to outsmart them, loot equipment to create powerful synergies and slay the gods to save the world of Ystilia from divine lunacy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Every enemy is a micro puzzle</h2>Every enemy has a predictable behavior that feels like a micro puzzle. Learn their patterns and you will always be able to beat them with any weapon and without taking any damage. <br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2056180/extras/gif1.gif?t=1739381635\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Play at your own pace</h2>This game is completely turn-based, but it can feel quite fast due to the minimalistic nature of the combat system and the absence of turn delays. Speed up in simple rooms and slow down when you are surrounded by a crowd of enemies to carefully think about your plan. <br> <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2056180/extras/gif2.gif?t=1739381635\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Create your own item combinations</h2>Your inventory is limited so make the most of it because every item matters.
