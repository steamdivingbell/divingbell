{"about_the_game":"You are a courier in the furniture delivery service.<br />\r\nYesterday you drove a chair to Tomato Street, and today - a mirror on Lenin Avenue.<br />\r\nAnd again the car broke down - which means that all the daily earnings will go to repair.<br />\r\nThe only thing that will brighten up these working days is music. Every week a single track is added to the radio in the rotation. What will be a hit in February? And in October?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA realistic courier simulator - every day is similar to the previous one. Routine. Only addresses and cargo for delivery differ. Everything, as in life.<br />\r\nMinimalistic text interface. Get a check-list with assignments for each day and execute them for income.<br />\r\nA random list of cases for each game day - a lot of combinations of subject-address, there will be almost no repetitions.<br />\r\nMusic written by a neural network is a unique soundtrack for every game week. But you can choose manually in the settings you like the melody, and it will not interrupt during the game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/840170/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1639138116","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/840170/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1639138116","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/840170/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1639138116","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/840170/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1639138116","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You are a courier in the furniture delivery service.<br />\r\nYesterday you drove a chair to Tomato Street, and today - a mirror on Lenin Avenue.<br />\r\nAnd again the car broke down - which means that all the daily earnings will go to repair.<br />\r\nThe only thing that will brighten up these working days is music.
