Give a controller to a non-gamer friend and watch them get caught up in it!  Just move and jump! Great for parties!

Enforce censored mode!</h2>If you'd like your kids to play (as has been requested several times) you can enable &quot;Censored mode&quot; in the menu, and this turns the blood into lollies and fireworks!  But, your kids can easily change this setting back when you're not looking.  So, you can enforce censoring so that it can't even be turned off in the menu!  Just edit the settings.conf file in a text editor and set &quot;kid_safe=true&quot; - now the censored mode will stay enabled, and the option to turn censoring off will be removed from the menu!  The only way to get the blood and guts back is to edit the settings file again and set &quot;kid_safe=false&quot; or just remove the line altogether.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1568760/extras/Candy_censored_24.gif?t=1717817249\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Arcade cabinet people - you are supported!</h2>I'm an arcade cabinet person too.  And a popular solution is to use an IPAC which lets you convert button presses into keyboard key signals.  By default, this game allows for 2 players on the keyboard, but by editing the settings.conf file and setting &quot;keyboard_only=true&quot; will add 2 extra players on the keyboard, controled by the keys YHGJ and P;L'. You can bind these keys in your IPAC settings to your joysticks and buttons, which will allow you 4 players on your home made arcade cabinets.  (Not enabled by default because having 4 players on an actual keyboard is not only impractical but will hit the simultaneous key press limit on standard keyboards.)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">NOTE TO MAC USERS:</h2>Level editing (specifically, saving your edited level) is currently not working in the Mac version, because Apple loves to lock everything down, and who can blame them, it makes their system more stable.  Drop me a message on the Steam forum or the contact page on my website to let me know how much you would like this so I can prioritise it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Why HopSquash! What about Jump 'n Bump?</h2>I love Jump 'n Bump, and I have recently thought that it's a shame it's locked away in its DOS form and is limited to only using 1 gamepad. And as good as that original level is, wouldn't it be cool if there were more levels? And more players possible? And a built in level editor so that pretty much anyone can get in and start making levels without having to learn Photoshop etc?  So I set out to make an expanded version, going full time into game development.<br><br>This was to be called &quot;Super Jump 'n Bump&quot;. I got in touch with one of the original creators, Andreas Brynervall (artist) and his only requirement for me to sell this commercially is to not use the original name or assets, and I can refer to the new game as a &quot;spiritual successor&quot;.
