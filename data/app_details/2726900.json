{"about_the_game":"Frostbiter is a short survival horror where you have to find the exit out of the maze as the sun is setting and nightfall is approaching, while also trying to avoid Frostbiter. You can defend yourself and temporarily stun him by throwing snowballs at his head, but you can only carry one snowball at a time, and they can only be gathered at piles of snow. Also, look out for traps!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2>After a long day of snowball fighting with your friends, it's time to head back home. But on the way you appear to have gotten lost, and you eventually find yourself at the entrance of what seems to be a maze. You decide to not enter and instead find another way, but as you turn around and face the way you came, snowmen seemingly out of nowhere are blocking your path. You have no choice but to wander into the maze...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Note from dev</h2>This is my first game ever and I don't have any education in game development, so please be kind! The game is a bit rough so don't expect too much, but  if you do decide to give it a go, then thank you so much!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Off With Their Hats!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2726900/e363a00bb15ad1734843a858d47463026db8f03e.jpg"},{"name":"A Grey Key?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2726900/e3f977f9a56a3cf430144dbc6c7b20744fbcc486.jpg"},{"name":"What's This For?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2726900/8ba1a13b1912b898218a27ae3a34206489bfbd0e.jpg"},{"name":"Be Free Monkey!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2726900/34bf3719437bb116b224f20da7de8c19fe2f5687.jpg"},{"name":"Red Key?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2726900/34d1e610ce723d562b9fc8917b76d8dd1f024ac2.jpg"},{"name":"What's Behind Door Number One?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2726900/c83b2eb0a6e4abb87d4e44cf0df4a2868e4721d4.jpg"},{"name":"Show Me Door Number Two!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2726900/0f8868694c97e0faf49e65ef7ebb2a5ef3b07803.jpg"},{"name":"Door Number Three!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2726900/dd4dea1b3a7974e03230516fba72c36e5bdf2e07.jpg"},{"name":"Into The Void","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2726900/b5e5c76a1a5789a5fc5b2236bb549e8558ac6abe.jpg"},{"name":"Escape!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2726900/41e0679956078c5116d226cc04b520d37eac9c77.jpg"}],"total":15},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2726900/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730455345","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2726900/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1730455345","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2726900/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730455345","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2726900/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730455345","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Frostbiter is a short survival horror where you have to find the exit out of the maze as the sun is setting and nightfall is approaching, while also trying to avoid Frostbiter.
