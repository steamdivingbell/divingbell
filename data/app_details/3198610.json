{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What Is Your Skin Made Of?</h2><br>You find yourself an unstuck consciousness in a dark room, your attention floating between grimy fabrications of deconstructed biologies. All around you, strange machine assisted life drips and pulses and hums. Soon, the authorities arrive and begin questioning, demanding, threatening, interrogating. But you have no memory and no alibi and no throat with which to protest. Faced with the prospect of a state-sanctioned oblivion, you must play along as best you can, explore and understand how your strange body functions, and find the narrow path between submission and defiance that just might lead to your liberation.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Simulation Of A Strange Anatomy</h2><br>Take direct control of life functions that your real-life human body never trusted you with! Circulate fluid through your venous tubes, turn on or off parts of your brain, and more. Just remember to keep your lung sac pumping.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Surprise Test On A Fallen World </h2><br>Your interrogators will ask you questions in order to discover what you know. Your survival depends on gratifying them. After weathering the cataclysms of the future, new human values and taboos are produced. Your interrogators seek to preserve the world, their satisfaction with you relies on your understanding of their strange remedies to equally strange problems.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Biochemical synthesis</h2><br>Brew up a variety of acids, enzymes, and other fluids to use towards your goal of escape, with a chemical crafting system based on real(ish) science.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3198610/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736187446","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3198610/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1736187446","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3198610/7aa6457cbc39503b1eb0f49fb1c4fd1881e0c2a0/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736187446","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3198610/7aa6457cbc39503b1eb0f49fb1c4fd1881e0c2a0/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736187446","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"This game contains depictions of gore, violent acts, death, and references to suicide throughout."},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What Is Your Skin Made Of?</h2><br>You find yourself an unstuck consciousness in a dark room, your attention floating between grimy fabrications of deconstructed biologies.
