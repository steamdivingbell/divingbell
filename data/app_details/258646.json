{"about_the_game":"Arguably the most useful of first generation diesel multiple units (DMUs), the Class 121 \u2018Bubble Car\u2019 comes to Train Simulator in distinctive Network SouthEast livery.<br><br>The unusual single-car units were manufactured by Pressed Steel Company from 1960 onwards and introduced by British Rail for use mainly on the Western Region and around London on suburban and branch line duties. Their distinctive exhaust pipes designed to fit around a large four-digit headcode indicator box made these units fondly regarded by rail fans for their unpretentious appearance and old-fashioned interior and performance characteristics.<br><br>The \u2018Bubble Cars\u2019 became familiar for running Network SouthEast services and upon privatisation of British Rail, the fleet was operated by only one passenger company \u2013 Silverlink \u2013 with several more units in departmental duties with Railtrack.
