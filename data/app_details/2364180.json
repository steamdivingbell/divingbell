You are invited to spend one summer's month as an honored guest in Fairy's beautiful home. Your only goal is to relax and, if you feel so inclined, to discover your very own magic.  <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2364180/extras/TMF_Decorations_Relax.png?t=1737727823\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2364180/extras/TheMerryFairy_DETAILS.gif?t=1737727823\" /><br><br><strong>The Merry Fairy</strong> is an enchanted cottage that you can visit from afar.

And the best way she knows to explore the depths of one's heart is to journal. This is why she left you a gift - a beautiful, enchanted journal where you can write down your thoughts, and that you can decorate as you wish! Gather whatever you like from Fairyland, and use it to build your scrapbook journal. And when you feel that a chapter in your heart is concluded, you can take your journal home, as a PDF file to store locally. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2364180/extras/TMF_Decorations_Discover.png?t=1737727823\" /><br><br>Fairy's cottage is full of delights and useful tools to discover your magic. As a matter of fact, Fairy's friends are keen to help you, too! They gathered and chatted and agreed on the best way to support you. One of them will check up on you every half an hour. They will come by The Merry Fairy and gently knock on your window. If you are ready for a visit, you may let them in, and talk about magic. Or Fairyland. Or Fairy.
