It is what it is: a prototype for something that could be fun in a future build.<br><br>With enough player interest to continue development, the milestones are (roughly): <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 0.0.0: initial prototype, smash attack only, solo infinite run mode only (&lt;- you are here)<br></li><li> 0.1.0: in-house Slime models, refactor prefabs/code, polish UI, add Steam achievements<br></li><li> 0.2.0: new actions: grapple and ranged<br></li><li> 0.3.0: local multiplayer vs<br></li><li> 0.4.0: local 2v2 co-op<br></li><li> 0.5.0: local 2v2 vs<br></li><li> 0.6.0 through 0.9.0: multiple Slimes, skins, maps, potentially skill point trees, community feedback based updates, patches, and creative direction<br></li><li> 1.0.0: online pvp and 2v2/3v3 vs (&lt;- a legit engineering challenge I'd love to conquer)</li></ul><br>This game sucks, I guarantee it! That said if you can squint and see what I see, any support, wishlists and sharing to friends/communities would help grind through that list of milestones. For the moment this is a solo-dev project, so to reiterate... it is what it is, fun for the sake of itself.
