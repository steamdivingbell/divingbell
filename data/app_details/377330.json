During the course of the game, we explore their complicated history and current mental state in these affairs. The game has another character who writes very explicit notes to the main character, depicting unwanted creepy sexually charged comments and written depictions of violence. Gore is not very frequent in the game, but there is a couple scenes of sudden drawn gore meant to be a bit shocking in a couple of the game's 8 endings.
