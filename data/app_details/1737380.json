You help them with their troubles and make songs about them. As a conflict arises that threatens the entire kingdom and possibly the world, you must team up with your new companions to fight against it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou will have romantic and adult moments with each woman during your interaction with them, as you learn more about their personalities and history.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a bard, you specialize not in combat but in casting a variety of spells to affect the enemy as well as your allies.
