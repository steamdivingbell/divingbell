The demons poured out, infecting the graveyard and the surrounding area. These demons desecrate bodies and steal the souls of the living. As a knight of the Holy See, you must stop the current demon invasion of a mass graveyard. Slay the demons, kill so many that it draws out their leader... then slay the ugly hellspawn to close the Hell portal.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Slash your way through demons in a first person 3D perspective of a Holy See knight. Upgrade your weapon and access spells in the shop area. Slash through multiple enemies at once while you dash around the graveyard, having the demons falter in their attempt to take your soul. Watch out for different demon types as they appear to exploit their weaknesses and avoid their strengths. Survive each night as waves. Once you survive each night, return to the Church shop area to heal, upgrade, and progress to the next wave. Kill enough demons and face their leader, killing him will close the portal and end your quest.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>ABOUT MITCHWARE GAMES</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Hello!
