But the Nether may be yours.</h2>You have died. Your soul, battered, bruised and shattered into pieces, awakes in the Nether, a vast land consumed and transformed by sin and inhabited by spirits and monsters alike. Your only solace: the beam of blue light right in the center of the Nether, said to make whoever reaches it whole again. To make it, you\u2019ll have to build a powerful deck, fight, explore, outwit and barter - and piece yourself together bit by bit.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New strategic depths</h2>Plan ahead with the timeline, a unique concept in the deckbuilding genre.
