{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Shadow of the Demon Lord Monstrous Pack 1 - The Undead</h2>   <br> A collection of four Monstrous Pages based on the theme of the undead. This pack consists of the following Shadow of the Demon Lord products: <br>  <br> <br> <strong> Dread Hauntings</strong> <br> <br> Dread Hauntings delves deep into the spirits haunting the lands of R?l, offering new insights into existing spirits, while presenting a host of new spirit enemies you can use to torment the player characters. Armed with the information in this supplement, spirits can become a truly terrifying threat in your Shadow of the Demon Lord games! <br>  <br> To make the fullest use of this supplement, you need Shadow of the Demon Lord and Demon Lord's Companion. <br>  <br> <br> <strong> Lords of the Barrows</strong> <br> <br> Though the First People have vanished from the face of R?l, their monuments remain. From the Northern Reach to the tangled woodlands of Balgrendia, one can find weathered monoliths scrawled with runes, standing stones arranged in circles, and other ancient markers that hint at the societies that once thrived in these lands. But the darkest and most sinister of these edifices are undoubtedly the barrows, for under these grassy hills sleep the dead. Although these tombs promise riches and relics, they also threaten death, for the dead lie in restless slumber and any intrusion can call their souls back from the Underworld to vex the living in bodies rotted and wrecked. And once roused, these barrow wights remain, eager to punish the living for the crimes of their ancestors. <br>  <br> Lords of the Barrows joins other installments of the Monstrous Pages series and examines the undead most often associated with the First People: the barrow wights and their many horrid minions. In the following pages, you'll find details on these creatures, their legions, and their lairs. Armed with this resource, Game Masters have everything they need to bring ancient evils to the fore in their games.\u00a0 <br>  <br> <br> <strong> Slaves in Death</strong> <br> <br> Slaves in Death sheds light on the secrets of creating and commanding animated corpses, the basest foot soldiers in the armies of the dead. Not only is there more information on how they come into being and the role they play, several variations are included to expand their presence and utility in the game. As well, an assortment of Necromancy spells supplements those in the main rulebook so players can take full advantage of the information contained herein. <br>  <br> <br> <strong> Trapped in Bone and Flesh</strong> <br> <br> Trapped in Bone and Flesh reveals the ghastly details about those accursed undead who can still remember the lives they once lived. Usually found in the service of necromancers, death lords, and other foul practitioners of the dark arts, these vile minions vent all their hatred against the living. As has been done with other creatures in the Monstrous Pages series, this supplement scrutinizes and expands on boneguards and grave thralls, while presenting an additional menagerie of other dark and grotesque undead to help Game Masters populate tombs, lairs, and other places of horror with truly terrible foes. Armed with these pages, you will have everything they need to vex your players and drive their characters to the brink of madness. <br>  <br> Combat encounter maps included: The Barrow <br>  <br> This pack features the following: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> - Over 50 NPC entries, included such iconoclastic undead as the ghost, the banshee, and the boneguard</li></ul> <ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> - NPCs range from Difficulty 1 to 1,000</li></ul> <ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> - Five new spells from the Necromancy tradition</li></ul> <ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> - Detailed explanations about the different ways that undead come into existence</li></ul>   &quot;","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2415900/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1684244400","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2415900/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1684244400","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2415900/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1684244400","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2415900/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1684244400","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Shadow of the Demon Lord Monstrous Pack 1 - The Undead</h2>   <br> A collection of four Monstrous Pages based on the theme of the undead.
