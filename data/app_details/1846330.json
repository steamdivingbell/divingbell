A self-proclaimed &quot;trash human&quot; with a penchant for petty revenge on all rivals, real or imagined. Avoids confronting people she sees as more powerful, but revels in bullying the weak.

Slacks off every chance she gets unless constantly supervised. Hiramatsu is thoroughly apathetic and indifferent, not least when tending to Yamada's needs. She gives off a languid anti-work aura wherever she goes, and takes her sweet time getting anything done. Sports a consistently sloppy and unkempt appearance. About the only time this nurse perks up is when she's been drinking.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1846330/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724914929","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1846330/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1724914929","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1846330/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724914929","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1846330/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724914929","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"Contains mild verbal abuse and violent expressions.
