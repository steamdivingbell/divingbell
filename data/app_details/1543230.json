{"about_the_game":"The soundtrack made by Gamechuck's sound designer and composer Matija Malatestinic perfectly complements the game's chaotic nature and pinpoints what the game is all about: making a perfect run.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile listening to the soundtrack, you always have that feeling of something new happening even if it is the same note pattern.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor this soundtrack, Matija used all the right hardware. Korg Monologue, Behringer Neutron, and a eurorack setup with mainly digital oscillators from Noise Engineering and Harvestman (Industrial Music Electronics). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMatija also used a lot of guitar pedals, mostly distortions, and his favourites are Metasonix TM5, WMD Geiger Counter, and JPTR FX Apokalypse.<br />\r\nKorg Monologue was especially good in creating sub-bass tracks, Behringer Neutron was going through distortion pedals and compressed on lead synth tracks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe sincerely hope you'll enjoy the Speed Limit soundtrack!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1543230/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1613551716","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1543230/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1613551716","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1543230/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1613551716","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1543230/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1613551716","categories":[{"description":"Additional High-Quality Audio","id":50}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The soundtrack made by Gamechuck's sound designer and composer Matija Malatestinic perfectly complements the game's chaotic nature and pinpoints what the game is all about: making a perfect run.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile listening to the soundtrack, you always have that feeling of something new happening even if it is the same note pattern.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor this soundtrack, Matija used all the right hardware.
