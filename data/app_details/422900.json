{"about_the_game":"Build and design your own fleets and stand opposed to the Particulate in this physics/strategy/RTS/fleet hybrid.  Build partially destructible and self repairing ships that interact with enemies less controlled by some scripted logic and more driven by a real time massive physics particle simulation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs Chief Executive Ticon you should have been the Galactic Executive Officer.... but you aren't.  Instead, you and small corporation of dedicated employees have ventured into Redacted Space risking your fortunes and your lives. What you find will challenge your tactical and strategic skills as you adapt to a threat that surrounds and engulfs.  Engage the Particulate, Emergent, Doppels, and much more in this unique strategy game.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"CEO","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/422900/5dbed49a934823d517499adefbd3149944b74e78.jpg"},{"name":"Sacrifice","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/422900/eae6e5e4f50f1491c79d88dd8c25107278a55eac.jpg"},{"name":"Naivety","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/422900/d45d5305440800dc9e3cc0ad2c356115202b0247.jpg"},{"name":"Indelible","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/422900/04b81b0c345006d138b588cf27e7df8f5853b9a2.jpg"},{"name":"Unwise","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/422900/3b7c2d97710cda4e1112715723da39bf5dc9e408.jpg"},{"name":"Insanity","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/422900/49bee7473a6ad295967c136231c42de8fcdee2f0.jpg"},{"name":"Evidence","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/422900/f385c5545bc2f72c779703fd89a5cedb943361e5.jpg"},{"name":"Stretch","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/422900/cae16f8a8d173e4dd37d211a044e154e9bfccfb2.jpg"},{"name":"Brute","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/422900/6894bb00711ecee96cd077bd5f2ee5b84724fbc4.jpg"},{"name":"Potential","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/422900/73d6dd56bdf9c5cc968f7052e60e5f3118b10ad1.jpg"}],"total":20},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/422900/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1688931393","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/422900/page.bg.jpg?t=1688931393","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/422900/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1688931393","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/422900/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1688931393","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Build and design your own fleets and stand opposed to the Particulate in this physics/strategy/RTS/fleet hybrid.
