Carry passengers on a journey of a lifetime along the West Coast Main Line, over the Runcorn Railway Bridge and right into the heart of Merseyside with this express 4-6-0. Additionally, be in charge the hard-working LMS Stanier 8F Class locomotive, its rugged BR Late Black guise and 2-8-0 wheel configuration better suited to hauling lower speed, heavy freight trains.<br><br>Master the art of steam simulation and take on the challenge of the 1950s - with no modern comforts to rely on, the only safety system is your wit! Learn the finesse and rhythm of each locomotive to determine your speed and keep to the timetable.<br><br>Choose how you want to play; drive trains, ride around as a passenger or in the guard\u2019s van, complete the route tasks, or simply pick a vantage point and watch the action unfold. Create your own experiences with the Scenario Planner and Livery Designer and share them with Creators Club.
