{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Grind Rush is an off-road racing game where 16 cars, depicted in low-poly, compete. Cars like quad bikes, buggies, and monster trucks race on tracks such as grasslands, forests, and sandy beaches. In this game, you can destroy obstacles and rival cars, which are key elements to advancing the race in your favor, including developing shortcuts.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Vehicle Weight</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each vehicle type has different builds and weights, which greatly affect the race. For example, a light and small bike is agile and can pass through narrow paths but must avoid obstacles and collisions with rival cars. On the other hand, a heavy and large monster truck is not as agile and struggles on narrow roads, but can destroy obstacles and rival cars. There are also differences in acceleration and top speed, so look for your favorite vehicle.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Satisfying Destruction</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When you destroy obstacles, you can experience an arcade-like satisfaction as signboards\u2019 heads and posts fly apart, and bushes scatter. Some destruction expressions are dynamic enough to alter the track terrain. Cars will also lose parts like doors and bumpers when damaged.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Off-road racing with 16 vehicles</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Different vehicle types participate simultaneously</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Vehicle part loss</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Vehicle destruction</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Obstacle destruction</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Unlimited boost and explosions</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Various AI</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game is inspired by Motor Storm, Burnout, and Split/Second.</p></li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3133950/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730725688","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3133950/page.bg.jpg?t=1730725688","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3133950/61659b3dfbd94d995d00adeba7c212242a6aa89f/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730725688","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3133950/61659b3dfbd94d995d00adeba7c212242a6aa89f/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730725688","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Grind Rush is an off-road racing game where 16 cars, depicted in low-poly, compete.
