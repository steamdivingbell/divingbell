Players will encounter bodies as part of the investigations, but there is no explicit gore or gratuitous graphic violence. The gravity of the acts is conveyed through the atmosphere, dialogues, and clues that are discovered.\r\n\r\nSensitive themes: The plot explores the psyche of a detective tormented by his past and the struggle against his own darkness. Themes such as guilt, psychological trauma, and loss are addressed. While there are no explicit depictions of abuse, past events are implied that could be disturbing to some players.\r\n\r\nOther aspects: The game does not contain nudity, explicit sexual content, or obscene language. The consumption of drugs or alcohol is not encouraged.\r\n\r\nAge recommendation: Taking the above into account, we recommend \"Gloomy Clues\" for players over 16 years old."},"detailed_description":"Immerse yourself in a murky point &amp; click adventure with an anime aesthetic, where you must solve a series of murders while confronting the ghosts of your own past.<br><br>In &quot;Gloomy Clues&quot; you'll step into the shoes of John, a detective tormented by guilt and haunted by a tragedy that pushed him to the brink.
