{"about_the_game":"Mad Farm is VR game where you need to stay alive while a mad crowd of animal zombies run at you. Any day being eaten alive does not seem like a joyous activity, especially when you are up against a reckless animal that can devour you with ease. There are more than enough animals for zombie uprising and this farm dispatched the first of the undead. Chickens will try to suicide on you and bulls stab you with their horns. <br><br>Mad Farm Demo features only training mode. In a complete version of the game it will have Story Mode with 3 episodes and an Arcade mode.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/768160/extras/giphy_Small.jpg?t=1524572204\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/768160/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1524572204","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/768160/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1524572204","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/768160/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1524572204","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/768160/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1524572204","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Mad Farm is VR game where you need to stay alive while a mad crowd of animal zombies run at you.
