{"about_the_game":"Return to the magical world within Moss: Book II, the award-winning sequel to the fan favorite VR game Moss!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe original soundtrack of Moss: Book II is composed by two-time BAFTA award-winning composer Jason Graves, and features 17 in-game tracks and more than 140 minutes of music.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGraves returns to score Quill's new adventure and elevates the player experience with his elegant, heartfelt, and thematic score. The soundtrack features Graves on solo piano, acoustic guitars, and Celtic harp, with additional instrumental performances from Kristin Naigus (Irish whistles, flute, oboe, English horn), Reinoud Ford (cello), and Tom Strahl (bouzouki, oud).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The original Moss holds a very special place in my heart and Moss: Book II is an extremely personal score,&quot; said Graves. &quot;Adding new instruments to the ensemble, I put together a small 'pub band' of soloists to underscore Quill's heroism and heartbreak, and even acquired a beautiful baby grand piano that acts as the heart and soul of the score, performing most cues live on the piano, then adding other instruments to flesh out the themes. I hope this soundtrack takes players back to the magical world of Moss with every listening.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Moss: Book II (Original Game Soundtrack)&quot; was made possible by the following individuals:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJason Graves: Composer, Mixing Engineer, Mastering Engineer, Performer, Celtic Harp, Electric Bass<br />\r\nAlan Atkinson: Performer<br />\r\nStephen Hodde: Mastering Engineer, Producer<br />\r\nKristen Quinn: Producer<br />\r\nKristin Naigus: Irish Whistles, Performer<br />\r\nReinoud Ford: Performer<br />\r\nTom Strahl: Performer<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJason Graves is an Academy Award-winning (BAFTA) composer who has brought his passion for music to projects such as MOSS (POLYARC), FAR CRY PRIMAL (UBISOFT), UNTIL DAWN (SONY), TOMB RAIDER (SQUARE ENIX) and DEAD SPACE (EA).
