{"about_the_game":"From Just Trains: tap into the nostalgic 1980s and run up the most picturesque section of the famed West Coast Main Line in Train Sim World 5; the stunning and immersive 90+ miles of Preston to Carlisle awaits aboard classic British AC electric traction. Embark on InterCity passenger and trundling freight duties, or take a trip to the Morecambe coast, all in TSW\u2019s longest UK route to date! <br><br>Experience the roles of British Rail staff between the cities of Carlisle and Preston amidst a complex 1986/87 timetable. Master the intricacies of the powerful BR Class 87/0. Controlling the tap changer technology is paramount for racing over the famous steep incline of Shap summit on a variety of services. From the non-stop InterCity runs, to the slower cross-country hops serving Lancaster, Oxenholme and Penrith. Haul passengers in true BR comfort with both the venerable Mk2a and the new Mk3a coaches! <br><br>With both the 87 and the ever-versatile Class 47; mingle between passenger services and wait your turn in passing loops on freight services. Gear up for a trip to the seaside too with shuttles along the Morecambe branch, driving the improved classic diesel, the Class 101 DMU.
