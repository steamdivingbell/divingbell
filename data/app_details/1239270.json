Here you can safely practice your magic against the dummies in the practice field, or craft potions and wands at your very own forge.<br><br>Yoren is currently in early access, this means that some parts of the game are still undergoing development. Currently the game mainly serves as an experimental magic sandbox.

In Yoren there are several dungeons and fallen kingdoms. In these areas you can collect area-specific loot, and encounter it's boss. With each dungeon or kingdom you beat, you learn a new rune. Each rune has it's own element for example water, fire and blood. Each element has it's own advantages.
