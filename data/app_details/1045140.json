{"about_the_game":"ESKO assigns the player the role of an intern who is tasked with fixing the computer\u2019s processor and writing code for the machine to read. These tasks are simplified in a manner that is enjoyable for all ages. The gameplay environment was modeled in co-operation with the Museum of Technology to match 1960\u2019s Finland as closely as possible. All of the models were made by in-house graphical artists and reviewed for authenticity by the museums\u2019 history professionals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers are tasked to fix ESKO\u2019s central processor by changing broken electron tubes, writing code on a punched tape and inserting it into a code reader. If the code is written successfully, a miniature cannon will fire upon one of the three targets. The ESKO game incorporates a simplified version of the actual programming, where the players have to pull a lever and play a mini game instead of actually punching holes in a sheet of paper. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe development of ESKO is part of Stories to games project, which is coordinated by the Finnish Museum Association and funded by European Social Fund..","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1045140/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1555505461","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1045140/page.bg.jpg?t=1555505461","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1045140/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1555505461","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1045140/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1555505461","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Supported","id":53}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"ESKO assigns the player the role of an intern who is tasked with fixing the computer\u2019s processor and writing code for the machine to read.
