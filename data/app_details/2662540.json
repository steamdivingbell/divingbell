{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Please Note: This scenario pack is also included in the Train Simulator Classic 2024 Deluxe Edition. If purchasing separately the following routes are required in order to play all of the scenarios: Bahnstrecke Riesa \u2013 Dresden, LGV Marseille Avignon, Mittenwaldbahn, NEC Washington DC, North Wales Coast Line. </strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Celebrate the 15th Anniversary of Train Simulator with this special scenario pack. This pack includes 15 new scenarios and three iconic locomotives. The British steam legend LNER Peppercorn Class A2 \u2018Blue Peter\u2019, the DB BR 411 \u2018ICE-T\u2019 high-speed EMU, and the futuristic looking Pennsylvania Railroad Class GG1 with its striking art deco shell. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With the LNER Peppercorn Class A2 you will prepare the locomotive for a return to the mainline with trial runs between Llandudno and Crewe to make sure the engine is ready for Summer railtours. Then travel back in time to 1966 to recreate the Holyhead &amp; Brymbo special along the picturesque North Wales Coast Line. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Take the controls on the modern DB BR 411 \u2018ICE-T\u2019 as you run services on both Bahnstrecke Riesa \u2013 Dresden and Mittenwaldbahn. The latter of which gives the unique experience of driving an ICE through Austrian mountains. Enjoy the Alpine scenery with snow falling in winter or a bright summer\u2019s day with these scenarios. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The PRR GG1 4935 has been restored for the mainline for rail tours on the Northeast Corridor. Perform a test run with this historic US loco, before running the \u2018Friends of the GG1\u2019 service for local railfans.
