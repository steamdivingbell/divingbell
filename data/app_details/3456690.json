{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You dare to enter my domain? Then prepare to ascend as the supreme Ritual Master under the watch of the Game Master, Shadow myself! Watch as the feeble-minded grovel before your arcane might. You shall weave spells of untold horror, summon the deads from the void, and erect defenses that defy the very laws of nature!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What Lurks Within This Forbidden Demo?</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Mortal, this mere Demo I bestow upon you contains but a glimpse into the full game that awaits. Behold what might be included:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>A Guided Tutorial:</strong> I shall teach you personally how to master your rituals, command your defenses and craft a worthy deck.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Three Combat Levels:</strong> Prove your worth through increasingly challenging trials. Each battle will test whether you deserve to wield such arcane might.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Seven Unique Rooms:</strong> Within my realm lie seven chambers, each holding different powers for you to exploit. Learn their secrets, if you dare.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>A Mysterious Encounter:</strong> Ah yes... someone eagerly awaits your arrival in Level 3. Should you survive that long, of course.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>37 Cards:</strong> I grant you access to 25 spell cards and 12 building cards. Combine their powers wisely, though know this is but a fraction of the full arsenal that awaits in my complete domain.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ritual Deckbuilding</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Hoard corrupted buildings and forbidden incantations as a dragon hoards gold. Craft a deck that reflects the depths of your depravity, raining chaos upon those foolish enough to oppose you.<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3456690/extras/pickPage1.png?t=1738614903\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Duels Between Rituals of Nightmares</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Raise towers surrounding your sacrifice that would make even the bravest hero weep, and summon abominations through blasphemous rituals to aid you in the duels between unholy sanctums. Position them with diabolical precision to crush waves of mewling heretics while bombarding their sacrifice with your unholy attacks.<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3456690/extras/picPage2.png?t=1738614903\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Death is But a Teacher</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Fall and rise again stronger! Each defeat fuels your twisted evolution. Gather profane knowledge, unlock increasingly potent cards, construct vile edifices, and enhance your dark gifts.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A World Bathed in Shadow</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Immerse yourself in a realm where light fears to tread. Unearth the secrets of this accursed land, for knowledge is the key to ultimate dominion. Your rise to power unfolds through the sardonic narrative of mine, Shadow, accompanied by grotesque and mesmerizing illustrations that will sear themselves into your feeble mind!<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3456690/extras/picPage3.png?t=1738614903\" /></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3456690/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738614903","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3456690/page.bg.jpg?t=1738614903","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3456690/2e5546648e3821beb6c6b9e0065abc32ac7cfaef/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738614903","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3456690/2e5546648e3821beb6c6b9e0065abc32ac7cfaef/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738614903","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You dare to enter my domain?
