{"about_the_game":"GROSS is a tower defense / first person shooter hybrid with new exciting and unique mechanics to spice things up.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Demo</h2>This demo includes a tutorial, a sandbox level and two full levels you can play in endless mode.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">100% tower defense</h2>Just like other tower defense games, your goal is to keep your base safe against wave after wave of enemy attackers. Your main line of defense against the enemy hordes are barricades to force them into a maze, and automated turrets that attack them in many different ways.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1926150/extras/Construction.png?t=1677681679\" /><br><br>While you\u2019re in the construction phase, you have almost complete freedom to build whatever you want, wherever you want. GROSS is a true tower defense game. Build elaborate mazes for the enemies, or focus your resources on the turrets. You can even place traps on the ground. They are one use only, but are cheap and powerful.<br><br>The construction phase focuses on giving you all the tools to create an obstacle run that\u2019s as difficult to overcome as possible. There is no time limit, and everything you build can be sold for a full refund until you start the next combat phase.<br><br>After all, figuring out how to use synergies between different turrets and building a maze for the attackers is most of the fun in a tower defense game. Why should it be different for a tower defense/first person shooter hybrid?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">100% first person shooter</h2>Once the combat starts, the game turns into a different beast entirely. Combat is fast paced and requires you to make split second decisions. At your disposal is a big arsenal of guns. All of them feature different firing modes and ammunition types. Full metal jacket rounds can penetrate multiple zombies in a row, and even shoot through objects. Hollow points knock enemies back and give you room to breathe. Incendiary rounds light enemies up and burn them for a while. Grenade and rocket launchers deal massive area damage, but have a chance to destroy the vital cash pickups.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1926150/extras/Combat.png?t=1677681679\" /><br><br>With over a dozen weapons at your disposal, gunplay is fast and rewarding. There is also a number of active abilities you can use. They give you additional tools to kill or distract the baddies, move around more efficient, or manage your cash resources.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Resource management</h2>Cash is the key to succeeding in GROSS. Enemies drop it when they die, but you\u2019re not the only one after this green root of all evil. You have to be quick if you want to secure it. Gathering cash and transferring it to safety is one of your main tasks. Cash is required to buy defensive structures and active abilities. It is also the biggest factor that determines your score.<br><br>GROSS keeps you on your toes at all times. In any given moment, whatever you do or don\u2019t has consequences. If you focus on killing attackers because your defenses are overwhelmed, this might well turn the tide of battle, but it also means loads of precious money gets stolen or destroyed in the meantime. Money that is needed to improve your defenses in the next construction phase.<br><br><br>Please keep in mind that anything you see here is subject to change (hopefully for the better). All footage currently shown is from the level Dead End, which will feature in the demo, and is only one of many levels that will offer a huge variety in looks and gameplay.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Pacifist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1926150/e5e37ad5798a8ae0a5fe7991a8dc5f3bca56f3c1.jpg"},{"name":"The bare minimum","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1926150/37a4d654218d9d221fd8a08ff6462b6c619a5c0f.jpg"},{"name":"Tax break","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1926150/cb6bb745ffb6fa3e056fcaa161006ec458eca26f.jpg"},{"name":"Twenty is plenty","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1926150/2b6591d18349ac960f6a4d734c5e4c5025e31ac3.jpg"},{"name":"Mildly upset","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1926150/4536b92871c73d251570d763e18d76a22db7b8e1.jpg"},{"name":"Easter bunny","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1926150/5b82c0ae9738189921ce3887552ebdb680260019.jpg"},{"name":"Home defense","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1926150/3d627708e69af68c2ccaaf7a63236c11d27a80b8.jpg"}],"total":7},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1926150/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1677681679","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1926150/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1677681679","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1926150/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1677681679","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1926150/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1677681679","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"GROSS is a tower defense / first person shooter hybrid with new exciting and unique mechanics to spice things up.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Demo</h2>This demo includes a tutorial, a sandbox level and two full levels you can play in endless mode.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">100% tower defense</h2>Just like other tower defense games, your goal is to keep your base safe against wave after wave of enemy attackers.
