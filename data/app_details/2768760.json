{"about_the_game":"Hoverkitty in the Hoververse Chapter Three is the third game in the Hoverkitty in the Hoververse series. The Hoververse series is about a robotic cat traveling around a planet called the Hoververse, protecting it and the creatures that live within the world from the clutches of malicious entities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this 3D game, you can explore the land, and soon you will find that there is something amiss, something that could upend the Hoververse. Things are not as they should be, and it is up to our unlikely, yet valiant hero and heroine to put things back in order and bring peace back to the Hoververse. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor the first time in the series, you can discover the mysterys of the Hoververse as either Hoverkitty or Hoverflea, which means you have multiple ways of completing a level. Hoverkitty is a robotic cat that can wield a sword for close combat, and Hoverflea is a robotic flea that shoots lasers for skirmishes that can be fought further away. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA quest that you will find in most levels is Treat collecting. Sometimes you must collect Treats to pass a level.  Hoverkitty and Hoverflea can both collect Treats, but one advantage to playing as Hoverflea is that he is smaller than Hoverkitty, which means he can fit in smaller areas.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis has aspects of an adventure,3D, first-person shooter. You will meet old enemies, such as the Hoverkitty Hunters, and also new allies that can help you in the Battle for the Hoververse.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game also has some lore to it, for all you  Hoverkitty fans out there, so be on the look out for some new an old faces and facts.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2768760/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728393189","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2768760/page.bg.jpg?t=1728393189","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2768760/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728393189","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2768760/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728393189","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Hoverkitty in the Hoververse Chapter Three is the third game in the Hoverkitty in the Hoververse series.
