{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></h2><br>If you've ever wanted to become a pilot in the U.S. military, start here! The U.S. military employs several tests to find the pilots with the best potential, including tests such as the USAF's Test of Basic Aviation Skills (TBAS) or the Navy's Aviation Selection Test Battery (ASTB-E) /  Performance Based Measurement Battery (PBMB). Preparation is always the most important ingredient for success, and testing to become a pilot in the U.S. military is no exception. Use a keyboard and mouse or console controller to practice... or, to get as close as possible to simulating the real TBAS, practice using the supported Thrustmaster T. Flight HOTAS kit! With enough practice, you can shine above all other candidates and secure your new career path.<br><br>This application contains a variety of features to prepare you for your aviation test, including three tests:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>DIRECTIONAL ORIENTATION TEST</strong></h2><br>This test measures and improves your ability to determine your aircraft's heading with nothing but your directional orientation shown on a map. In the test, a map is shown with your aircraft's heading depicted as an arrow. On the right side of the screen is a display showing a top-down visual of buildings from your perspective in the aircraft. Simply select the correct building when prompted based on the directional orientation shown on the map.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2673460/extras/DirectionalOrientationGIFV2.gif?t=1731359177\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>MULTITASKING TEST</strong></h2><br>This test measures and improves your performance under stress, as well as your ability to manage up to four tasks simultaneously:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> MEMORY TEST: A code containing letters is shown briefly, and you must memorize the contents of the code before it disappears. Letters will appear in a box and you must select a &quot;Check&quot; or &quot;X&quot; button based on whether the letter that appears was in the code. You must make an entry before the time expires.<br></li><li> MATH TEST: Addition and Subtraction problems will appear periodically. You must use the number buttons to enter in and submit the answer to the math problem shown before the time runs out.<br></li><li> DIAL TEST: A dial on a gauge will periodically creep to the left or the right. Your job is to make sure that the dial stays in the green or yellow bands, and does not enter the red band.<br></li><li> RADIO TEST (Speakers/Headphones Required): A voice will speak an audible command.

Contains five components that can be practiced either individually or simultaneously:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> [TBAS] PEDAL TRACKING TEST (Rudder Pedals Recommended): An aircraft silhouette travels horizontally from left to right on the bottom of the screen. Rudder pedals, arrow keyboard keys, or gamepad shoulder buttons are used to move a box over the aircraft silhouette. The goal is to raise your &quot;Pedal Accuracy&quot;, which increases when the pedal box is over the aircraft silhouette.<br></li><li> [TBAS and ASTB-E / PBMB] RETICLE TRACKING TEST (Flight Stick Recommended): An aircraft silhouette travels horizontally and vertically around the screen. A flight stick, &quot;WASD&quot; keyboard keys, or gamepad control stick are used to move the reticle on the screen over the aircraft silhouette. The goal is to raise your &quot;Reticle Accuracy&quot;, which increases when the reticle is over the aircraft silhouette.<br></li><li> [ASTB-E / PBMB] THROTTLE TRACKING TEST (Flight Stick/Throttle Combination Recommended): An aircraft silhouette travels vertically from top to bottom on the left side of the screen. Joystick throttle movement, arrow keyboard keys, or gamepadtriggers are used to move a box over the aircraft silhouette. The goal is to raise your &quot;Throttle Accuracy&quot;, which increases when the throttle box is over the aircraft silhouette.<br></li><li> [ASTB-E / PBMB] DICHOTIC LISTENING TEST (Stereo Audio or Headphones Required): A series of numbers and letters are played in the left and right ears. You must listen in specifically one ear to determine if a number was played, and press a button on your joystick, keyboard, or gamepad depending on if the number was even or odd.<br></li><li> [PBMB] EMERGENCY SCENARIO TEST (Audio Required): You must memorize three scenarios and how to adjust two separate gauges for each. Pressing &quot;Reset&quot; will confirm your gauge positions. You will lose points if your gauge positions are incorrect, and you will gain points if they are correct. </li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2673460/extras/PedalGIF.gif?t=1731359177\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2673460/extras/ReticleGIFgif?t=1731359177\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2673460/extras/PedalReticleGIF.gif?t=1731359177\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>ASSESSMENT MODE</strong></h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2673460/extras/AssessmentEndPNGdiv10.png?t=1731359177\" /><br><br>You can practice each test individually or you can try your hand at simulating a real test using the &quot;Assessment Mode&quot;.
