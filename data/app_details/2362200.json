{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2362200/extras/Title_TheGame.png?t=1732119413\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Tactics Unlimited</strong> is a modern 3D football game that brings fresh energy to the genre by combining strategy, management, and on-field action into an immersive experience. With its realistic graphics, players are treated to lifelike depictions of stadiums, players, and in-game dynamics.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Master Tactical Team Management</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Tactics Unlimited, pre-match strategy is as important as in-game execution. Players have full control over team setup, including formations, player roles, and specific tactics. Adjustments can be made during the match, allowing for real-time influence on the outcome. These strategic choices are crucial to outmaneuvering opponents and achieving victory.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Intuitive And Engaging Gameplay</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The controls are designed to be both accessible and responsive, allowing players of all skill levels to enjoy the game. You can move players, pass, shoot, and defend with ease, but there\u2019s a tactical depth that demands careful consideration of individual player skills. This mix of fast-paced action and strategic depth ensures a consistently rewarding gameplay experience.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Surprise Your Opponent With Action Cards</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each Action Card offers unique advantages, enabling players to manipulate key moments in the game. For instance, the Action Card Energy Recovery can be used to restore stamina to an exhausted player, ensuring that your star player stays on the field instead of being substituted. Meanwhile, the Action Card Double Potential boosts the chances of a successful play, increasing the likelihood of critical actions such as goal attempts or defensive maneuvers going in your favor.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This innovative feature adds a dynamic twist to the already strategic gameplay, allowing players to outthink and outmaneuver their opponents with the right cards played at the right time.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2362200/extras/Title_Features.png?t=1732119413\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Tactics Unlimited places you in the role of a focused and strategic trainer, guiding your team to success through precise tactical decisions and player management. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Total Focus On Sporting Success</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As the trainer, your primary responsibility is to lead your team to victory. You can fully focus on tactics, formations, and player management. Your strategic choices directly influence the outcome of matches, placing your focus firmly on outmaneuvering your opponents and mastering the art of football.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Turn-Based, Tactical Match Play </strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The core of Tactics Unlimited lies in its turn-based, tactical match system. This style of play requires careful planning and execution of each move, ensuring that every decision has meaningful consequences. The game challenges you to think ahead, anticipate your opponent\u2019s moves, and adapt your strategies on the fly. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2362200/extras/gif_matchday.gif?t=1732119413\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Simplified Club Management</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">While Tactics Unlimited provides some elements of club management, these aspects are simplified to keep the focus on the sporting and tactical experience. Economic development, facility upgrades, and other managerial tasks are streamlined, so they don\u2019t interfere with your primary goal: winning on the field. This simplified approach ensures that your experience remains engaging and tactically driven. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Comprehensive Player And Tactics Training</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You\u2019ll have access to in-depth player and tactics training, allowing you to fine-tune your team\u2019s performance. Tailor your training sessions to improve specific skills or adapt tactics that suit your style of play. With the right preparation, you\u2019ll be able to mold your team into a winning squad.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2362200/extras/gif_tactics.gif?t=1732119413\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Player Skills &amp; Action Cards</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In addition to tactics, you can also develop your players\u2019 skills to unlock special abilities and moves. For example, teaching a player the Duel Skill increases their chances of winning one-on-one battles, while the Header Skill makes attackers more dangerous in aerial situations. These skills make your team more individualized and effective in various game scenarios.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Action Cards further add to the strategic depth of the game. These cards allow you to create game-changing moments by playing them at critical points. For instance, using the Energy Recovery card can prevent your key player from being substituted, keeping them in the game when it matters most. Meanwhile, the Double Potential card boosts your chances of success for crucial plays.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Transfer Market, Scouting And Youth Management</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Though club management is streamlined, Tactics Unlimited still offers a robust transfer market and scouting system. You can scout for new talent, manage transfers, and develop youth players, ensuring long-term success and growth for your team. Building a strong pipeline of future talent keeps your club competitive over the course of multiple seasons.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2362200/extras/gif_team.gif?t=1732119413\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Infrastructure &amp; Personnel Management</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In addition to team management, you also oversee the development of your club\u2019s infrastructure and personnel. However, this area is intentionally simplified to ensure it doesn\u2019t detract from the focus on tactical gameplay. Nevertheless, it can provide significant advantages, such as hiring more qualified staff.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Sponsors, Marketing, Fans and More</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Even though the focus is on your tactical decisions, the game includes features such as sponsor management, marketing activities, and fan interaction. These aspects contribute to enhancing your club\u2019s reputation and finances without overwhelming you with detailed micromanagement tasks.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2362200/extras/Title_Multiplayer.png?t=1732119413\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Single- &amp; Multiplayer Modes</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Whether you prefer playing against AI teams in solo mode or testing your skills against human opponents in multiplayer, Tactics Unlimited offers both options. Each mode provides a different level of challenge, keeping the gameplay fresh and engaging, no matter how you choose to play.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2362200/extras/Title_Modding.png?t=1732119413\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> <strong>Modding &amp; Editors</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">For players who enjoy customization, Tactics Unlimited offers modding and editing tools.
