{"about_the_game":"The F-4 Phantom II is an American two-seat, twin-engine, all-weather, long- range supersonic jet interceptor and fighter-bomber originally developed by McDonnell Aircraft for the United States Navy. After entering service with the Navy in 1961, it became adopted by the United States Marine Corps and United States Air Force. Due to its high adaptability, versatility and for its time, unparalleled capabilities, it quickly turned into the main workhorse for all 3 branches and spread beyond the borders of the United States, going on to serve and protect 12 nations across the world, with Phantoms still in operation today. Its production ran from 1958 to 1981, and with nigh 5200 Phantoms built, it became the most produced supersonic US military aircraft in the history, solidifying its place as one of the most recognizable and well known aircraft of the cold war era. <br><br>It truly was an iconic and phabulous aircraft that, at its time, had unrivaled power and capabilities. It instilled a sense of wonder and awe, a beast that announced itself only with thunder. Unmatched in character and impression it was without equal, from the first time it took to the skies. A primeval spirit in aircraft form, it delivered shock that rattled to the core and protected many nations across the globe. While both an interceptor and potent air to air fighter, it proved its multirole capabilities as a true air to ground workhorse, and packed a serious punch. This unprecedented mission agility was reason enough for its lifetime to span well over six decades, continuing even today, and will translate to the rendition of DCS: F-4E Phantom II, as you fly and utilize its wide variety of weaponry across a broad spectrum of mission content. <br><br>Outstanding features of the aircraft are the powerful J- 79 twin engines with a dry thrust of 23,810 lbf and a max afterburner thrust of 35,690 lbf, a crew of two, the powerful AN/APQ-120 Radar, the Digital Scan Converter Group (DSCG), the Weapons Release Computer Set (WRCS), the Aircraft Weapons Release Unit (AWRU) and an Altitude Reference and Bombing Computer Set (ARBCS). The DSCG version of the F-4E also comes with the AN/AVQ-23 Pave Spike targeting pod, allowing for precision strikes and the (self-)-employment of laser guided ammunition. Additionally the F-4E can carry the AGM-65 Maverick, a wide array of iron and both TV and laser guided bombs, as well as the capability to carry out Wild Weasel (SEAD) tasks in a limited capacity with the AGM-45 Shrike. <br>Unlike previous Phantom variants, the -E comes equipped with an integrated M61 Vulcan cannon that can be used both in an air to ground and air to air role. It has an optical sight that allows for lead computing optical sighting (LCOS) in air to air, as well as the ability to carry additional Vulcan cannon pods. It can protect itself with the ALR-46 Radar Warning Receiver, the AN/ALE-40 countermeasures suite, the AN/ALQ-131 ECM pod, KY-28 encryption equipment and employs a range of early to modern era AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow missiles for aerial combat that can be also used through the additional specialized CAGED and computer automatic acquisition (CAA) modes.\t\t\t<br>The Heatblur Simulations F-4E Phantom II aims to simulate this iconic aircraft as a high-fidelity module for DCS, being the culmination of several years of research, coding and modeling. \t\t<br>Special points of consideration amongst the many features are the external and internal graphic model created using laser scanning and photogrammetry from real Phantoms at various museums, the detailed External Flight Model (EFM) developed over the past several years and verified by real F-4 pilots and WSOs, the detailed modeling of the AN/APQ- 120 radar and the various systems on board and the ability to fly as a two- crew aircraft in multiplayer, as well as the proprietary JESTER-AI helping you as your AI-WSO in singleplayer. <br><br><strong>Key features of the Heatblur Simulations DCS: F-4E Phantom II include: </strong>\t\t\t\t<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The simulation of both the DSCG and DMAS equipped -E variants, the DMAS version following later during the Early Access period.<br></li><li>Highly-detailed external model that is built using laser scanning and photogrammetry taken of real F-4 Phantoms across the globe.<br></li><li>New weapon models for some of the F-4 Phantom payloads like the AGM-45 Shrike, the AGM-12 Bullpup, the AGM-62 Walleye, and AN/AVQ-23 Pave Spike targeting pod.<br></li><li>Highly-detailed and accurate 6-DOF (Degrees of Freedom) cockpit that is also built using photogrammetry from the F-4 Phantoms preserved at museums, including Heatblur FORGE elements to be added later during Early Access.<br></li><li>Highly-detailed and accurate pilot and WSO models that will eventually match the many liveries and different nations.
