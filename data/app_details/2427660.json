As you progress through the dungeon, you will find new weapons and gear to help you slay the enemies in your path.  Your goal is to discover the next Refuge point which will allow you to upgrade your characters abilities and choose new skills.  Merchants are scattered throughout the dungeon giving you a place to rest, barter for new gear, or upgrade your items at a crafting station.  Upon death, you will lose all your items, but you will keep your characters progress, gold, and respawn at your last Refuge.  Most dungeons in Ruins and Refuge are hand crafted, but there is also a procedurally generated experience that ensures you will always have a fresh run.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2427660/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1721145484","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2427660/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1721145484","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2427660/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1721145484","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2427660/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1721145484","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence, Blood and Gore, Suggestive Themes, Strong Language, and Use of Alcohol."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>Ruins and Refuge</strong> is a first person roguelite dungeon crawler.
