{"about_the_game":"A sunless world of fungi and bugs, sustained by a slow rain of nutritious substance, could use your guidance and cataloging.<br />\r\nEarthTongue is a vivarium sim that places in you limited control over a small ecosystem on a fantastical world. You will spend most of your time watching life grow and eat each other to survive. Your subtle nudges will be required to maintain the balance of this world, but it can handle itself much of the time. Player given goals are limited, aside from maximizing the health of your ecosystem. You may choose to try to create a fungal garden to your liking. You may try your best to breed as many beetles as you can. You might use those beetles instead as food stock for the mantises. You might instead just peacefully watch the story of Earthtongue unfold on its own.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Pink Mold","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/358070/a81b0dae8466e095b4603ee9fe6117f0fca81cbc.jpg"},{"name":"Blue Mold","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/358070/1627f6214e9f85e47a431d1ca77338cb52a61bc1.jpg"},{"name":"Green Mold","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/358070/ca7566fc13f38e642f1f1bf16725e9713590f348.jpg"},{"name":"Yellow Mold","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/358070/6086cd6891356c0a6360823194e7f0f11cb82310.jpg"},{"name":"Sundew Mold","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/358070/dbb082ff05b082e0dc2a3d1183363909e195b6ab.jpg"},{"name":"Brown Pod","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/358070/d9c93f7a0622de409740c08c3904bf6e580eca7e.jpg"},{"name":"Red Pod","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/358070/dd4c597ddbe6ad9bf8efb710351e73cfea8f174e.jpg"},{"name":"Fruit Pod","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/358070/e201969a9e3d56fa4c90ec3e386152078e833b8e.jpg"},{"name":"Hungry Pod","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/358070/2a1066cded8b36dc68ce6c391063149e94bd4b38.jpg"},{"name":"Blue Mushroom","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/358070/7400f28b6fcfb1029bb2b3cb574d98cd16d72b16.jpg"}],"total":35},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/358070?t=1562771118","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/358070?t=1562771118","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/358070/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1562771118","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/358070/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1562771118","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A sunless world of fungi and bugs, sustained by a slow rain of nutritious substance, could use your guidance and cataloging.<br />\r\nEarthTongue is a vivarium sim that places in you limited control over a small ecosystem on a fantastical world.
