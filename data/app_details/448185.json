{"about_the_game":"Take control of the unique UNESCO Branded Ge 4/4 III in this enhancement pack add-on for Train Simulator.<br><br>The opening of the Vereina Tunnel, what would become the longest tunnel on the RhB, was projected to cause a major spike in both passenger and freight traffic across the mountainous network.

The new locomotives would utilise three-phase AC electric technology and GTO Thyristors.<br><br>The original plan to produce a 6 axle variant of the RhB Ge 4/4 II was quickly replaced with a more universally capable 4 axle design. A much more modern bodyshell was used for the new loco, and by the end of 1993, the first Ge 4/4 III, numbered 641, rolled off the production line, entering service on December 3rd of the same year. A further 11 locomotives would enter service between 1994 and 1999.<br><br>The Ge 4/4 III fleet is now the principal motive power for traffic on the Albula Railway, the universal design paid off as they can effortlessly cope with either freight or passengers across the mountains, and also command the Glacier Express, known as the slowest express in the world.

The body was extrusion pressed out of aluminium, to not only reduce weight, but also increase strength.<br><br>The RhB ordered two main variants of the Einheitswagen II, those being \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019, where A denotes First Class seating throughout, and B is purely standard seating. Neither of these Einheitswagen II models are capable of holding any substantial quantity of passenger\u2019s belongings, so RhB also ordered Baggage Cars which could take care of any storage issues.
