{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Description\uff1a</h2>Warklinika is a management strategy game. The player only needs the mouse to operate a war doctor to save lives. The player needs to run a hospital during a war. Where more injured people and soldiers come to seek treatment, even from the enemy. But with limited doctors and supplies, you must decide who will be treated and who will be abandoned. This is my current student work for my Master's degree at RMIT University\uff08Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology\uff09, with significant production done by myself.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Acknowledgement\uff1a</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2975910/extras/RMIT_logo_PNG2__1_.png?t=1727849153\" /><br>I need to thank my friends, teachers, and alumni, especially the MAGI studio at RMIT University. for all the help they have given me.

For this reason, I get the connection with this war. We need to get back time to the 21st of February, 2022. I have been to a physical examination for an Australian student visa in Xi'an City, China. Before the examination, I met my friend Nikolai, who is an international student in China from Ukraine. We hung out with other guys for a home party, which was a memorable time. <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2975910/extras/dinner.png?t=1727849153\" /><br><i>We were having dinner together on the 23rd of February, 2022.</i><br><br>However, historical events cannot be predicted. When the time came to the 24th of February, Putin announced that the Russian Federation had launched a 'special military operation' against Ukraine. My friend Nikolai was so panicked and anxious that he contacted his family in Kyiv by phone and social media. But the night before, we had been happily partying, and his emotions made me feel so close to a war of life and death for the first time. The atmosphere that day was terrifying, and everyone was afraid to speak.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2975910/extras/chat_record.png?t=1727849153\" /><br><i>My chat with Tim.</i><br><br>The early days of the war were awful, and I followed the fighting every day on social media. Meanwhile, I was comforting my Ukrainian friend Tim, a Ukrainian student studying music in China, whom we first met on a tour bus. I asked him for advice on donating to the Ukrainian army and the Red Cross. I initiated donations with my salary to help them through this difficult time.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2975910/extras/donation_red_cross.png?t=1727849153\" /><br><i>My Donations to the Ukrainian Red Cross</i><br><br>Based on my friendship with my Ukrainian friends and my opposition to Russia's invasion war, I hope my students' work will be based on the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. This will be controversial, but I will still support the Ukrainian people's resistance. I wish to use my power to help the Ukrainian people against the aggressor.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2975910/extras/donation_to_UMD.png?t=1727849153\" /><br><i>My Donations to the Ukrainian military defence department</i><br>Indeed, the people of Russia are innocent of this conflict, and they have a life they love as much as I do. I have purposely avoided elements that would offend the Russian and Ukrainian people, and the names of places, persons and props in the game are fictitious. I hope my work will inspire more people to oppose the invasion and help and support those suffering.<br><br>While my single person is weak, I chose to persevere; the development time of this project is long and complex. As I did most of the development work, I got this demo after many failures and doubts, and I hope to use this project to encourage more people to pay attention to the lives of those suffering in the war. If, in the future, I can iterate the project to a final version and make a profit, I hope to donate the profits to the revival of the Ukrainian video game industry.<br><br>\u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f\u043c, \u044f\u043a\u0456 \u0432\u0456\u0434\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0454 \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0442\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u0443 \u0442\u0430 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0443!<br><strong>Glory to the heroes who sacrifice for freedom and Ukraine!</strong></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Description\uff1a</h2>Warklinika is a management strategy game.
