Will you be able to meet the President and discover the secret behind Sabbath incorporated?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGAMEPLAY<br />\r\nThere are no &quot;normal enemies&quot; in Sabbath, but only bosses, represented by the company\u2019s executives , each with his dedicated music track. <br />\r\nTwo different combat systems will allow you to face them:<br />\r\n-The first type consists in moving between four lanes to avoid the opponent attacks.<br />\r\n-The second type allows you to move freely in the battle arena in a shoot em up style battle.<br />\r\nThe controls are really simple, and the battles very short, but also very tough and intense. Don\u2019t worry though, every time you lose it will be just a \u201cclick\u201d to instantly start the battle again and do your best.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome other features:<br />\r\n- Learn new combat techniques on each floor, such as the parry, which will allow you to block pink bullets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Buy beverages at the coffee vending machine to enhance Paul.
