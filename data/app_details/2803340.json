In the normal form, Twilight has a single jump, a dash, and a basic attack pattern. Switch to the shadow dimension for increased movement speed, higher jump height, an additional jump, and three powerful attack patterns with enhanced damage. Choose your form wisely to navigate the intricate levels and overcome challenges.<br><br></li><li> <strong>Strategic Platforming:</strong> Traverse diverse and meticulously designed levels that will test your platforming skills.<br><br></li><li> <strong>Formidable Foes:</strong> Encounter the formidable Knight, your primary adversary in the shadowy realms. Stay on your guard as these enemies will strike if you get too close. Use your dimensional powers to defeat them quickly!<br><br></li><li> <strong>Checkpoint System:</strong> Shadow Touched features a checkpoint system. If Twilight meets her end, she respawns at the last checkpoint touched and you can continue your adventure without losing progress.
