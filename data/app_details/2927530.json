{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> The Story So Far: </h2>HyperPOP is a first-person shooter where you play as R-054, (Rosa), a graffiti artist who is living in the dystopian corporate world of Paradise City - controlled by Corp-OS, a company lead by the man known as Harold Saxman. The main goal of Corp-OS is to keep the citizens of this great city safe, while also secretly testing out new advances in technology on their residents with the money funded by the corporation. After getting nabbed for tagging a building, Rosa is captured by Corp-OS bots and brought to the Corp-OS laboratories for rehabilitation. She is tested on and cybernetically enhanced. After a slight overabundance of electric shock sent through her system, her upgrades, given gracefully by <i>The</i> Harold Saxman, are activated and now Rosa's only goal is escaping to freedom and blasting away any Corp-OS bots that stand in her way.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Use Rosa's New Tech to Blast Through Corp-OS: </h2>Rosa has been equipped with new tech developed within Corp-OS laboratories. This new technology allows Rosa to have finger-guns, a distinct new piece of equipment developed specifically for Resident - 054 that gives her three distinct weapon types, each of them with an alternate fire to give Rosa variability in her attacks. The pistol variant is a standard weapon given to all corporate bots tested upon and has both a base fire mode, with a lock-on targeting system used as a secondary mode. The auto-rifle sacrifices its damage for a faster fire rate but does have a secondary rifle-cannon shot that packs a real punch. Finally, Rosa has been equipped with a rocket launcher, blasting away her foes while also giving her the ability to launch herself through the city if shot at the ground. This rocket launcher also has a secondary shotgun fire to send those bots to the scrapyard. <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2927530/extras/RocketJumpGIF.gif?t=1724179844\" /><br><br>Not only has Corp-OS been generous enough to give Rosa her own finger-gun variants, but they have also equipped her with energy-based enhancements on both her feet and other arm. The left arm has been equipped with an energy-based grappling hook, Rosa must use this grappling hook to swing through the streets and reach those hidden nooks and crannies of Paradise City. Who knows, maybe Corp-OS was nice enough to leave some hidden technology behind for her to find. Don't say your fearless leader Harold Saxman never did anything for you! <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2927530/extras/SecretsGIF.gif?t=1724179844\" /><br><br>Corp-OS has also advanced their technology when it comes to footwear! Introducing the energy-based sawblade leg, (Corp-OS patent pending). Use this sawblade to slide across surfaces, gaining speed and kicking the bots of Corp-OS out of Rosa's way; send them soaring as she slices through the metal bots and leaves them crumpled. Rosa has also learned to use this technology to wall run across certain surfaces. Rosa must use all these new advancements to escape to freedom and the clutches of Corp-OS. <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2927530/extras/WallRunGIF.gif?t=1724179844\" /><br><br>Who better to guide you on the path of freedom than V.I.R.G.I.L!

Living within the domed city citizens are free to experience the beautiful clean-cut nature that is their city.  While within the Corp-OS laboratories secrets are hidden away from the public eyes. Explore the corporate based laboratory and break yourself out to the streets of Paradise City, filled with clean cut greenery and fresh blue water streams. This perfect city scape has multiple alleyways that Rosa will travel through, showing the graffiti filled, neon streets of Paradise that Harold wishes to scrub from existence. Escape this corporate filled city to reach the depths of the under city, the place where the idea of paradise city was born and left behind are the secrets that Harold Saxman has hidden from the residents of Paradise City. What new threats will you find when you travel to the undercity?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Fight Challenging Bosses blocking Rosa's Path: </h2>The Corp-OS bots are not the only challenge that Rosa will face on her journey towards freedom.
