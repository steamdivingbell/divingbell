{"about_the_game":"Retropy brings you relaxing and cozy 3-D object puzzling in an immersive VR or MR space.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRestore everyday objects in a puzzling world that brings together nostalgia and calming puzzling flow. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRetropy is inspired by the meditative state of puzzling, which allows us to complete a familiar object and also strengthen our cognitive function. Perfect for relaxing after a long day, you can play standing or seated for maximum comfort and enjoyment. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nKey Features:<br />\r\nUnique retro objects and customization: Our puzzles are designed with retro qualities in mind, but we have a variety of diverse categories to explore in our virtual environments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCompetitive rewards: As you dive into Retropy, expect to encounter a wide range of puzzle types and difficulties. The game offers endless opportunities to challenge your mind and unlock new levels of creativity, including a competitive tier system that gives weekly rewards based on participation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEndless possibilities: Perhaps the most exciting aspect is a free companion mobile app that will allow users to scan their own objects (in under 5 minutes) and puzzle them in our game. With a real world of objects at your fingertips, the possibilities of what you can collect and share is infinite! The only limit is your imagination.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3127780?t=1738910386","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3127780?t=1738910386","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3127780/5f84844a3a4e47e3f8bddb46b452428d2585c9a8/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738910386","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3127780/5f84844a3a4e47e3f8bddb46b452428d2585c9a8/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738910386","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3293600,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Retropy brings you relaxing and cozy 3-D object puzzling in an immersive VR or MR space.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRestore everyday objects in a puzzling world that brings together nostalgia and calming puzzling flow. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRetropy is inspired by the meditative state of puzzling, which allows us to complete a familiar object and also strengthen our cognitive function.
