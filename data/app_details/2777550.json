{"about_the_game":"<strong>Machines are taking over your world!</strong> Their buildings destroy forests, their factories pollute the earth and water. The air is filled with the hum of drones and ships.

Here is what you will do in a typical mission of the campaign:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Protect your world</strong> - Huge crystals rising from the ground are your source of mana. Protect them and (optionally, if your build includes such spells) build your base around them with spells that summon different types of buildings - mini volcanoes that bombard enemies from afar, or spirit dwellings that spawn powerful sprites to fight for you.<br></li><li> <strong>Cast Epic Spells</strong> - Use your offensive spells to rain down destruction on your enemies - literally! Fire Rain, Thunderstorm, Meteor Storm - all powerful destructive abilities that unleash your wrath upon the machines.<br></li><li> <strong>Control Corruption</strong> - Prevent machines from spreading corruption - either by destroying their terraformers or by cleaning the corruption yourself using various spells or minions. Do not let it get out of control or you will lose!<br></li><li> <strong>Destroy the machines</strong> - destroy enemy buildings to deplete their resources - when they run out, you win!<br></li><li> <strong>Boss Battles</strong> - When all of the machines' resources are used up, one of their commanders will appear - prepare for an epic final battle!<br></li><li> <strong>Reap as many rewards as you can</strong> - the less corruption your world has suffered, the more rewards you will receive! Acquire new spells, add new abilities to existing spells, and use powerful Blessings to improve your build and find game-changing synergies!</li></ul><br>But that is not all! Not only do you have several gods to choose from, each with their own special spells and mechanics, but there is also Gaia, the Mother of Nature. She will help you throughout the campaign and has her own special powers - and you will be able to activate some of them in each run! In addition, the game's roguelite progression is based on Gaia's powers:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Meta Progression</strong> - Each run allows you to upgrade the abilities of Gaia, who will help you throughout the campaign. The more you play, the more powerful Gaia becomes, and the easier it will be for you to progress! Go beyond the normal campaign into the Void Realm - the game's endless mode. How far can you go?<br></li><li> <strong>Synergize your powers with Gaia</strong> - Pick the right Gaia powers to activate and get crazy synergies that are otherwise impossible. Experiment, upgrade, and replay the campaign to get the overpowered build you need to conquer even the Void Realm!</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2777550/extras/steam_page_header_prologue_600x240.png?t=1721108759\" /><br><br>In this free prologue, you can play as two different gods and progress up to level 12 in the campaign.
