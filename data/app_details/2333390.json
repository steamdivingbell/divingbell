{"about_the_game":"Cricket Captain 2023 puts you in control. Create your own legacy. A packed international schedule includes the oldest Test Match rivalry in cricket as Australia tour England, the test championship final and 2023 World Cup. Test Match cricket was shaken up by a new aggressive approach in 2022, nicknamed Bazball, creating some of the most thrilling matches in history. Our new aggression system, inspired by Bazball, uses batting ability and natural aggression based on the current batting tactic, rather than the type of match being played. A generation of cricketers brought up on 20 Over Cricket have naturally aggressive styles that mean many have higher one-day averages than first class. Batting aggressively to match their natural style can improve performance.  Equally, knocking runs off at 12 an over is natural to players in the last overs of a 20 over (or even Test) match.<br><br>Cricket Captain 2023 also includes historical data for international player rankings and player recent form, including recent performances in Test, ODI and 20 Over Internationals.
