{"about_the_game":"Kinese is an experience I primarily wanted to share with the world, hence it being free. The best support you can give is to simply share it with others and recommend it to people you know. However for those that really enjoy it and would like to contribute something back, I decided to make that possible though a 'Tip Jar' DLC.  All that this DLC does in-game is add a thank you message, but out-of-game it is hugely appreciated. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI would love to continue experimenting in VR and making experiences to share, so anything you can offer really does help make that possible. Thank you.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/751310?t=1521206199","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/751310?t=1521206199","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/751310/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1521206199","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/751310/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1521206199","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"VR Supported","id":53}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Kinese is an experience I primarily wanted to share with the world, hence it being free.
