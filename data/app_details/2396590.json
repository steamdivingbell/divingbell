{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You guys like football (soccer)? Of course, you do. It's a beautiful game, right? But what if I told you there's a football game that's not just beautiful, it's freakin' hilarious! I'm talking about Drunken FC, baby! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Picture this: you and your buddies are playing soccer, but you're all drunk as skunks. And not just any old drunk, I'm talking falling-down, can't walk straight, pissing your pants drunk. Sounds like a blast, right? Well, that's exactly what Drunken FC is all about.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You got these sixteen characters that are all goofy and cartoony, with some crazy-ass moves that'll have you rollin' on the floor. And the physics-based gameplay means there's no animation, it's all about real, unpredictable, and hilarious movements. You'll be bumping, crashing, and falling all over the place, trying to score goals on four different levels.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There's no story or anything, just straight-up action and laughs. So, if you're looking for a party game that'll have you and your friends cracking up for hours, Drunken FC is the way to go. Get it now, and let's get drunk on football!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Play <strong>locally</strong>, or <strong>remotely via Steam Remote Play Together</strong>.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396590/extras/forest02.gif?t=1731345754\" /></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396590/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731345754","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396590/page.bg.jpg?t=1731345754","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396590/eb0c5def92422806a096a3b060cdb5dc9fc3973f/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731345754","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396590/eb0c5def92422806a096a3b060cdb5dc9fc3973f/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731345754","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Suggested consumption of alcohol.
