The Typer Island Adventure is packed with so much fun and motivation, kids forget they are learning to type. \u201cBoring\u201d is not a word you\u2019ll hear as kids continue their Adventure in new lands, On the Water, In the Air, Over the Edge, and Under the Sea. Typing Instructor for Kids is the perfect typing solution for parents, too, as kids will not need help as they are guided step-by-step by Toby, a young boy, and his feathered-sidekick, Layfette.
