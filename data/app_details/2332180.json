{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Welcome to Thile!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You are an adventurer, aspiring to become a Cairn Keeper of The Wanderers' Circle, an ancient order established to keep the trails safe.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With the order in decline since the rise of kingdoms and the protective cairns neglected for generations, there is enough to do for a Cairn Keeper! Animals and various hostile beings are encroaching on human land, and once forgotten fears are again becoming very real.     </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Shared World</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You might come across many other players as you fight your way through the shared world. But Treacherous Journeys caters to smaller parties as well as lone wolves, rather than raid groups.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A central campaign, manageable even to individuals, ties everything together; still there will be plenty of opportunities to stray off the beaten path and experience your own adventure! To support this, certain locations such as dungeons are instanced for a more intimate and immersive experience.   </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Thile needs wanderers now more than ever before. When you think you have seen it all there will be plenty more, with an endgame that lets you seek out challenges whereever they might appear in the world!  </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Character Customization</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Create, customize, and equip your adventurer. Increase your reknown within the Wanderers' Circle to gain the trust of masters, learn powerful skills and even choose masteries of your own!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Action Combat</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Say goodbye to tab-targeting. Engage in real-time action combat that relies on your own skills and reflexes. Hunt for rare loot and trade freely with other players. Party up with nearby characters and form or join clans.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Freedom to Choose</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">On release you will not be bound by a single realm, but will be able to play with friends from all over the world.
