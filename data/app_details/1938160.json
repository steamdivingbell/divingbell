{"about_the_game":"Battle Chain is a fast-paced battle arena video game developed by MysticsDen.It is the embodiment of fun and controlled chaos, and the players will constantly respawn to get right back into the fight. Packed with a wide range of features, the game is filled with interesting powerups and mechanics, and it will keep the players always on their toes! The game will feature powerups that will bring characters back into the game if they get too far behind. Currently, the game will be just between you and your friends, but in the coming months, matchmaking to people near and far will be added to complete the competitive side of this game!<br />\r\nThis is the early access version of the future game Battle Chain. The whole game will feature both a story mode and multiplayer mode. The game will be full of unique powerups that players can use to crush their competition across the board. Battle Chain is supposed to put a refreshing spin on how old games used to look and play. This will be the first homage to the way games have changed throughout my lifetime and how the gaming world has improved. The multiplayer mode will be global, hopefully by the full release, and will have a leaderboard to acknowledge all the top players. Meanwhile, the story mode will feature my own unique storyline with a ton of references along the way! My hope for this game is to put me on the radar because this will not be my one and only project, and I would like to build up a community that will enjoy all of the stories I can tell.<br />\r\nThis game will have one very specific feature that I don't think has been added to any game I have ever played and that is a &quot;deathmark&quot; which will be added every time a player dies, currently, there is only one in the game that I call for now BIG TARGET, the deathmarks function is to be both a boon and a bane for the players. One avenue for a way a player can deal damage can be cut off but it makes a different aspect of gameplay more enjoyable/ make it stronger at the very least. I am thinking of other deathmarks but sometimes the bane outways the boon or vice versa so far. I wanted to make a mechanic for it to differ from most other formats of battle arenas and this is the concept I came up with hopefully I am the first one to think of it/ put it in a game!<br />\r\n***WARNING GAME CONTAINS FLASHING LIGHTS***","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1938160?t=1651192202","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1938160?t=1651192202","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1938160/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1651192202","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1938160/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1651192202","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":1938170,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Battle Chain is a fast-paced battle arena video game developed by MysticsDen.It is the embodiment of fun and controlled chaos, and the players will constantly respawn to get right back into the fight.
