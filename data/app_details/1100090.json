{"about_the_game":"&quot;Otawamure&quot; is a Japanese word meaning  &quot;to play around, to fool around or toy with&quot;. This VR experience provides a virtual space where you can feel \u201cotawamure\u201d yourself while playing with tender objects. The space has three activities inside. In one of them, you\u2019ll find yourself carefully cutting eggs using a string, trying to slice them just right. Another will give you a hand fan to blow a set of quirky objects away. And in the last one jiggly, bouncy puddings will drop from the sky for you to catch. None of these experiences has a specific goal or objective, but we hope they can help you experience \u201cotawamure\u201d.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1100090?t=1563495934","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1100090/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1563495934","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1100090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1563495934","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1100090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1563495934","categories":[{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;Otawamure&quot; is a Japanese word meaning  &quot;to play around, to fool around or toy with&quot;.
