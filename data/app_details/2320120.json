He\u2019s twenty-one years old, in his third and final year of university, but his interest in his subject is waning and he doesn\u2019t have any friends to confide in.

Not knowing who to turn to during such a tumultuous time, he eventually decides to ask his cool and competent older cousin, Tavi, for help.<br><br>Tavi is effortlessly cheerful where Yuel is awkwardly withdrawn; outgoing and confident where Yuel is shy and self-conscious; flippant and irreverent where Yuel is stern and serious.<br><br>Tavi takes it upon himself, after seeing the state of his younger cousin, to cheer Yuel up to the best of his abilities. Yuel, however, is unaccustomed to kindness, and his feelings for Tavi soon become startlingly sensuous.<br><br>Yuel\u2019s life is hard enough as it is, what with his turbulent childhood, his non-existent social life, and now his father\u2019s sudden death, but this pushes things to a tipping point.
