It emphasizes precision and handling over speed, with the goal of completing the course as quickly as possible without hitting cones.

We aim for a balance between realism and accessibility, ensuring that both novice and veteran racers can enjoy the gameplay. The focus on procedural track generation and customization ensures endless replay-ability, while the open-world environment allows players to enjoy moments of free driving between races. When you need a break from getting lost in the cones, easily switch up your vehicle's build to take a quick drift around the block, or maybe even rally through the woods.
