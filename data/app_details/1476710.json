The police have so far been unable to track down the killer, but the most recent attack has unveiled an unusual piece of evidence, an antique Ouija board.  You discover that you can use the Ouija board to speak with the victims of the serial killer, and glimpse the final moments of their lives.  Some spirits will request a dying wish be fulfilled before they further cooperate.  Can you gather enough evidence to identify the killer, or will he catch up to you and put a stop to your investigation and your life?<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Use a Ouija board to communicate with the dead<br></li><li>Interact with fully voiced NPCs to hear about their final moments<br></li><li>Investigate crime scenes for additional evidence with the aid of the victims<br></li><li>Explore the town of Grants Shallow to uncover hidden secrets<br></li><li>Keep one step ahead of the killer, or they'll catch up to you.</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1476710/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1619968446","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1476710/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1619968446","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1476710/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1619968446","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1476710/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1619968446","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Drug and alcohol abuse, descriptions of homicide"},"detailed_description":"A serial killer has the small town of Grants Shallow shaken up.
