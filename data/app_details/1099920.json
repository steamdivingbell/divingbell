Now you can!<br><br>Edit every facet of the league as a whole, every team, and every player!  &quot;Quick Set&quot; options let you immediately set all a player's attributes, but it doesn't stop there!  There are also &quot;Quick Set&quot; options to immediately set all attributes for the whole offense, whole defense, even the whole team!<br><br>And with the new COMPLETELY CUSTOMIZABLE RULES, create a league with your favorite college teams!

You can also have multiple Single Season campaigns happening.  Have a career where your team is Dallas and another where you're the Patriots!  No limits!<br><br>For people new to Pro Strategy Football, it's built around a simulation engine rather than arcade play.  In fact, the animation you see is really a choreography of the results that were calculated using ratings, weather, &quot;dice&quot; etc.  Built around a complex and realistic engine, PSF is the most accurate simulation of coaching in American Football.
