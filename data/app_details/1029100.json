In one scene, the player finds another character hanging by her neck from a rope, swaying back and forth. The player never sees a violent act being committed (e.g. you never see someone dying, just the aftermath).\r\n\r\nThough the game got an ESRB descriptor of \"sexual themes,\" these are limited to: allusions to an affair between two characters; one character's confession of possible love for another. No sexual acts are actually depicted. (We've checked \"Sexual content\" here to be honest with the process; we're not sure if what we've described would qualify.)"},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h1>Follow us</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1029100/extras/Steam_-_BancyCo_Publisher_Follow_Button.png?t=1704053540\" /></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1029100/extras/Puzzle_Gameplay.gif?t=1704053540\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A New Horror Adventure from the Creator of <i>Home!</i></h2><i>Worse Than Death</i> is a scary, action-adventure horror game about a high school reunion that goes horribly wrong!
