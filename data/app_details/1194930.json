You will need to manage their attributes, skills, talents, and equip them with the best armor and weapons you can afford. Some of them may exhibit the capacity to become auxiliaries for your crew, such as cooks, healers, drillmasters, blacksmiths, etc.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">2) Claim Your Glory</h2>Send your Gladiators to fight in more than 14 diverse arenas or dispatch them to explore The Freelands for loot and secrets. Challenge champions of other arenas and take over their positions. Strive to become the most powerful arena master in the world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">3) Manage Your Arena</h2>As your gladiators win battles in other arenas, you will gain money and reputation. Winning leads to new slaves, better equipment, and upgrades for your establishment when needed. Reputation is important too, as it highly effects the Arena's income.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2></strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">1) All Gladiators Are Living People</h2>All Gladiators exist dynamically in the world \u2013 not just the ones affiliated with you, but also the gladiators in other Arenas. Gladiators will fight in different competitions held all over the world every day. They can die, get injured, or grow stronger, just as your gladiators do. Whenever you defeat other Gladiators, you can either spare their lives or execute them - which can lead to unexpected outcomes!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">2) RPG Character Development</h2>Blackthorn Arena offers players a cRPG character development system. Choose between multiple major attributes,  weapon types, and combine over 100 combat skills to build a unique Gladiator. Your Gladiators will gain various traits during their Gladiatorial career, which will have a strong impact on competitions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">3) Diverse Equipment</h2>Choose from over 500 pieces of armor and weapons, and not just for combat effectiveness but also for the aesthetic! Each set of armor has a unique appearance and will be reflected in the game\u2019s advanced avatar system. There are also mysterious Legendary Weapons and Armor waiting for players to find and obtain them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">4) Abundant Events and Side Missions</h2>As an arena master, you must deal with several events every day. Some of them may be opportunities while others spell disaster. Thus dealing with all kinds of emergencies also becomes an important and inevitable experience of managing an arena. Meanwhile, there are a large number of side missions in the game. Players can trigger them and send Gladiators to participate in the missions such as highway robberies, exploration of dungeons, beast hunting, and many other quests!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">5) Hold Your Venationes! (beast Show) </h2>Players can dispatch Gladiators to various exploration areas to discover, and capture rare and powerful creatures to put them into the arena as the finale of hosting Venationes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">6) A Variety Of Different Arena Rules</h2> The battle between the arenas is not limited to just 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4. At the same time, there are different battle modes such as venationes, exhibition, tag fight, throne challenge and tournament to challenge players\u2019 ability.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">7) Real-time Combat With A Tactical Pause</h2>The game\u2019s combat is based on real-time, but you can pause it at any moment to issue a command, switch between characters, or apply several other actions.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Millionare","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1194930/12c73142e1466c2538924264444bc9680b6c8717.jpg"},{"name":"Champion","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1194930/034ccc9ef21fcd977c6fcdea50a47df8f9587d96.jpg"},{"name":"Weapon Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1194930/9b6540940c3b4c42cf9d88210f413e6c49196b17.jpg"},{"name":"Auspicious beginning","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1194930/057c44c6dfa9324bfc215fc7ce929fa7cc6d08a6.jpg"},{"name":"Winner of the Spring Game","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1194930/276c10826898aedddb14e0e088bbecd5aa518939.jpg"},{"name":"Master of Venationes","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1194930/fd6b562f81dc10e21cab729c362cab3a95c07374.jpg"},{"name":"The old glory ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1194930/43315d613e422db07ffe28b77bb3ecabab7c7b59.jpg"},{"name":"The ultimate champion","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1194930/835df9c90a0fe149325b5940401b96e0618099d8.jpg"},{"name":"Gambler","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1194930/544d51d7d9c82d39cdd60f2b4008d9e0b9e1d368.jpg"},{"name":"King of Gambler","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1194930/1a1782f2bcc32e4f8da6b5d84b487260c77a57c2.jpg"}],"total":29},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1194930/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733756794","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1194930/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1733756794","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1194930/2b1319498ba170f3f1e9a33c6274bd942317a9f1/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733756794","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1194930/2b1319498ba170f3f1e9a33c6274bd942317a9f1/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733756794","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"This Game contains some gore and violent contents during battle/fight phase.
