{"about_the_game":"Venture into the treacherous regions of Aetherdale - a kingdom ablaze with magic and warfare. Assemble an arsenal of weapons and artifacts, to become an unstoppable force of destruction. Take control of powerful combat forms that defy the limits of natural magic.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A UNIQUE FANTASY WORLD</h2>You are a Wraith - a creature constructed to perform menial tasks. While not impressive in their own right, Wraiths possess a hidden power that will be key to saving Aetherdale from otherwise certain doom - their ability to transform into Idol forms.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">IDOL FORMS</h2>Idols are pure manifestations of one of the six forms of magic that course through Aetherdale. They possess varied and unique abilities, ranging between offensive, defensive, restorative, and other types altogether.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FORM AN ARSENAL</h2>Awaiting your discovery are various weapons and magical trinkets, each with their own unique effects and use cases. Equipped with a weapon, Idol, and a trinket, you will be ready to brave the wilds, face your foes, and discover the secrets of the world you find yourself in.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE MISSION</h2>Beyond the most perilous areas of Aetherdale waits an ancient - and deadly - enemy. Only a Wraith, well equipped and well trained, stands a chance of getting close enough to it to strike, before it heralds the end of all life in Aetherdale.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">REGIONS</h2>The regions of Aetherdale are as much an ally as your actual allies are - and as much an enemy as your enemies are. Understanding how to navigate each one is key to success in your journey.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2958610/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733072733","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2958610/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1733072733","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2958610/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733072733","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2958610/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733072733","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3254770,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Venture into the treacherous regions of Aetherdale - a kingdom ablaze with magic and warfare.
