{"about_the_game":"Redhot Rabbit is a hand drawn, monochrome, 2D platformer with a rich visual style rooted in the silent movie era.<br>WASD, spacebar, and Enter keys control running, jumping, attacking from above, and throwing exploding projectiles. Time is a factor so for the highest possible score make your run a fast one. If you don't die much, a run might take about an hour and produce a decent score if it was a good one. Speed running the game will produce a decent score too due to the time bonus. The <i>highest </i>scores can only be achieved through the player's choice of a balance between the two. You'll have to choose what to speed run past and what to play through for points/health. You'll need health. Some bosses you might get past without a drawn out fight. Some you'll have no choice but to fully engage.<br>Soundtrack features some of the greatest foxtrot and dancehall jazz hits of the late teens and early 1920s. Composers and ensembles include Irving Berlin and the Original Dixieland Jazz Band.<br><br>DEV'S NOTE 9/24/22: We have one report that the game wouldn't play on the Steam Deck. We also have one report that it DOES play well on your Steam Deck. TreeofEmber says, &quot;It runs and looks excellent on the Steam Deck. The controls need to be configured to work. I went with: A as jump, B as slam on the ground, R2 as shoot carrots, and right analog stick as left / right.&quot;","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Fast Run","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2100940/b6e979da42f6400794c193ef17e5f1943c3a5a5f.jpg"},{"name":"Speedy Run","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2100940/da3d38a2cae67aa576a8f9194bd3c002e64d905a.jpg"},{"name":"How did you do that?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2100940/5d15db383b1ed6e9f15442d64e60252cc2cd77c6.jpg"},{"name":"Big Bopper","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2100940/43c0d252f0ce6126a4ce726f47fdd75b009caeb4.jpg"},{"name":"Right In The Eye","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2100940/2c28def88d34e7b2a970d22d8bafe3b71e36a3c2.jpg"},{"name":"Set The World On Fire","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2100940/92d790b6a36dd70c1620e8f46ece39de146bb89f.jpg"},{"name":"Badda Boom","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2100940/114258228e23dfe582adea0074dc459c224a8ddf.jpg"}],"total":7},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2100940/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1683129400","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2100940/page.bg.jpg?t=1683129400","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2100940/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1683129400","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2100940/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1683129400","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Redhot Rabbit is a hand drawn, monochrome, 2D platformer with a rich visual style rooted in the silent movie era.<br>WASD, spacebar, and Enter keys control running, jumping, attacking from above, and throwing exploding projectiles.
