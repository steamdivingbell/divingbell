{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Age of Gladiators Reforged</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> is a REMASTER of the original Age of Gladiators released in 2016. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A Potential Scenario</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You\u2019re almost out of money. Two more days and you will no longer be able to pay your staff or gladiators. The fight scheduled today will draw exceptionally massive crowds, meaning the fight purse will be bountiful and the opportunity to place a large volume of bets will be high. One problem though: your top fighter is fatigued from his last fight and has a nagging shoulder strain. Plus he has a history of concussions, so it\u2019s fair to say he will not be at full strength if you put him in the arena. But he\u2019s the best you\u2019ve got. The rest of your gladiators are rookies yet; still working with your trainers and far too inexperienced to send into the crucible just yet. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The next fight is a week away and poorly hyped. You cannot wait that long. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If you were of an evil disposition, you could execute your top fighter instead and seize his life savings; with the fight purses you have shared with him through his career, he has amassed a lot of gold.

Something to consider.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Or if you find that distasteful, you could go to the money lenders instead. But their interest rates have been high these last few days: 30% or more.

He is bruised up and fatigued \u2013 but he also is ranked 3rd overall by the so-called experts and pundits of Leptis Magnus, the current city you reside in.
