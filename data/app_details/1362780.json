Assemble a party from a growing guild of heroes, each with a unique set of skills. Equip them from an arsenal of hundreds of weapons, each providing a different set of attacks to the wielder. Take on quests in dungeons, caves, forests and villages. To prevail you will need to master the skills of your heroes, position them effectively, and use their abilities in tandem to overwhelm the enemy forces.
