{"about_the_game":"<strong>XURB</strong> throws you into headfirst into an abandoned American suburbia. Society has collapsed, leaving those who remain to fight over what's left. Become a hardened survivor, navigate the desolate remains of once-familiar streets and kill or be killed by those who remain there with you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Raid</h2>You find yourself stranded in a deserted suburban neighborhood: doors are haphazardly thrown open and burning cars block the streets. Any few remaining civilians are thrown into a panic, with the more fortunate survivors quickly converging into hostile factions. You have little time, and with the permadeath format of this game the stakes are high.<br><br>Find whatever you can to defend yourself. If you are fortunate, you may find a handgun left behind by a more-prepared citizen. Be prepared for a shoot out with whoever you encounter, if you manage to survive their loot is yours.<br><br>This may work for a while, but with factions gaining strength, you will need heavier artillery to defend yourself and any of your companions. You heard that there is military bunker nearby, but this area would certainly be very heavily defended\u2026<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Loot</h2>Find the supplies you need in the otherwise vacant houses. At first survival is your main concern: food, clothing, bandages and medication. Next you'll need protection, find a weapon and body armor defend to yourself, or at least stay alive a little longer.<br><br>Getting around on foot is holding you back, but finding a vehicle in working condition won't be easy. Instead, find the tools and parts to repair a car that won't start, it will have to do for now.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Extract</h2>It's getting dark now, you need to rest but it isn't safe here. You know of a quiet spot in the forest, right outside of town. Nobody should be able to find you here. You can rest for a bit, as long as you have the resources to stay alive. Bring your food, weapons, and other resources to your camp; you will need them in the coming days.<br><br>While you\u2019re in camp you rest, restore your energy with some food, and bandage your wounds. Keep items you aren\u2019t using in the raid safe in storage, while you outfit yourself with only the things you need for another venture into the dangerous areas near town.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Recruit</h2>As your stash grows, you know that what you need to survive may no longer be more weapons, but more hands to use them. Some survivors have managed to go unnoticed by the factions, but they will need your help to keep it that way. Find people you can trust, and bring them back to the safety of your camp.<br><br>Your new companions count on you for shelter, food, and protection, but they are willing to help! Some can take care of camp chores, while others are skilled with a weapon. Finally, people to have your back: the factions won\u2019t be able to have all the control much longer.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Rebuild</h2>The initial shock of the falling-out has passed, and it is becoming clear that you will need a long-term survival plan. You have room to grow your camp: establish food plots for growing vegetables, build additional shelters to house survivors, and use resources salvaged in raids to fabricate materials and equipment that you need to keep your camp alive.<br><br>You're in charge. As the group leader, you delegate tasks to members of your camp and organize resources to keep your new society running as long as possible.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2314350/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735229079","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2314350/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1735229079","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2314350/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735229079","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2314350/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735229079","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Xurb includes mature content such as blood, killing and gun violence."},"detailed_description":"<h1>Join Us!</h1><p>Come chat with us on Discord </p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong>XURB</strong> throws you into headfirst into an abandoned American suburbia.
