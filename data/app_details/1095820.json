{"about_the_game":"Boogie Bot is a fast and challenging survival platformer about getting in the zone and finding your groove. Every mechanic in Boogie Bot is designed to keep you moving. Bot-Tom\u2019s battery (health) is constantly draining, so Bot-Tom must keep going and collecting CDs to replenish this fuel. Bot-Tom has an energy supply called the boogie meter, which fills as Bot-Tom runs to the right or drains when he stands still. Bot-Tom is able to use this boogie energy for special abilities like slow motion, air-dash and healing. If the boogie meter reaches a 100% charge then Bot-Tom can BOOGIE DOWN, going invincible for a short time while his speed increases drastically. Bot-Tom can also wave jump, which converts battery life into upward momentum. Many of Bot-Toms abilities shoot sound waves that can harm enemies above, below or behind him.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Beat the game on easy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1095820/0e6713e841fec17cb72aa3dc3112b1a927286ab6.jpg"},{"name":"Beat the game on normal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1095820/eb3d02fdc70c45e180bdd702ca8ede47e0f2985c.jpg"},{"name":"Beat the game on hard","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1095820/5f46af7d61d6a364c8918e4a74d4ecbedd70a35d.jpg"},{"name":"Collect 500 CDs","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1095820/c481d8a7639225be62fa1d3d4554fe30e6ad376a.jpg"},{"name":"Collect 1,000 CDs","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1095820/530181ca36d8ac83129b2ddd12e24d0b53d53901.jpg"},{"name":"Collect 2,500 CDs","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1095820/be34c5f3be5ec36275c138d93a16c962037074e7.jpg"},{"name":"Collect 5,000 CDs","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1095820/4beed5a682e3e02d18e8f577b3c3bc58b545bac2.jpg"},{"name":"Collect 10,000 CDs","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1095820/30900a1121da4e46ac09c5a258d8bf9722311b85.jpg"},{"name":"Unlock all bonus levels","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1095820/1a9f2548ced6e436c7a2e672cea1ddf675abadd8.jpg"},{"name":"Collect every gold record in a run","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1095820/6b90a5049bf374453bbb92c748c0ea39622fe8d6.jpg"}],"total":60},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1095820/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1614961048","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1095820/page.bg.jpg?t=1614961048","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1095820/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1614961048","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1095820/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1614961048","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Boogie Bot is a fast and challenging survival platformer about getting in the zone and finding your groove.
