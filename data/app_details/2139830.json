{"about_the_game":"<strong>ENTER THE WORLD OF PAPERPLANES:</strong><br><br>Somewhere, in what was once a glorious town in Southern India, but now is a mere ghostly shadow of its former self, a young eighteen year old girl, Hope, sets out to answer some questions for herself. En-route a civilisation rebuilt after a climate crisis and the destruction of what everything humankind ever knew, she encounters people,  creatures and stories that will stay with you even after the journey ends. Set in a political backdrop of a conflicted society being forced to part with its own past you help Hope navigate not just an unfamiliar geography in search of answers that have long evaded her but also her own fears and insecurities.<br><br>A CONTEMPORARY INDIA:<br><br>This distinctively unique realm has its own plethora of animals, monsters, and magic, as you walk through the modern Indian civilisation constructed on the remains of the past into the whimsical forests, mountains, and caverns of a fascinating world dominated by bioluminescence.<br><br>MULTI FACETED IMMERSIVE NARRATIVE:<br><br>The game\u2019s evolution is monitored by chapters, where each chapter develops a section of the story\u2019s plot and corresponds to a level.<br><br>ART AND AESTHETICS:<br><br>The art of Paperplanes is driven by an alternative interpretation about the future which is not a technological utopia or an authoritarian dystopia. Even though the story unfolds in parts of India, the visual setting only draws inspiration from the contemporary state of these parts. Rather, the game world draws inspiration from nature and elements of biomimetics. The artistic elements reveal the confluence of a past that is in ruins on account of climate change and a future where the survivors are trying to rebuild a new haven for themselves by improvising on the technology they could salvage. <br><br>AN EXPERIENCE:<br><br>Paperplanes affords a relaxed paced progression with more emphasis on exploration, world building and with lots of content to uncover. This also aligns with the overall introspective experience that the game intends to offer to the player.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2139830/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1676645968","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2139830/page.bg.jpg?t=1676645968","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2139830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1676645968","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2139830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1676645968","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Includes Source SDK","id":16}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>ENTER THE WORLD OF PAPERPLANES:</strong><br><br>Somewhere, in what was once a glorious town in Southern India, but now is a mere ghostly shadow of its former self, a young eighteen year old girl, Hope, sets out to answer some questions for herself.
