{"about_the_game":"Devil in the Pines provides an undeniably nerve wracking experience as you accomplish one simple goal: find the key. As evil and fear works against you, you must steady your hand as much as possible, because when demons find you, a single missed shot is likely fatal. You wield nothing but a crossbow with 6 bolts, a flashlight, and campfires to protect you from the evil supernatural entities that will stalk, intimidate, and attack you without relent. One life, one pull of the trigger, and your daughter's life hangs in the balance.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>Terrifying, Adaptive AI</u><br>Supernatural enemies like you haven't faced before.
