{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Aces Over Airfields</strong> is an intense 2D aerial combat game where you take control of a powerful fighter jet to engage in thrilling dogfights and strategic battles. Set in a retro pixel art environment, you must protect your base's valuable assets, while destroying the enemy's fighter jet and their critical resources. The goal is simple: dominate the skies and achieve victory either by taking down the enemy or decimating their base.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game offers a smooth and responsive flight experience with tight controls for dogfighting maneuvers. Each player must strategically manage their fuel, ammunition, and resources to gain the upper hand. Whether you're launching air-to-air missiles or performing risky bombing runs, <strong>Aces Over Airfields</strong> provides a fast-paced and challenging aerial experience.<br><br>In the near future, I plan to introduce exciting expansions, including local and online multiplayer modes, additional content, and new maps to elevate the gameplay experience. The control scheme is intuitive: press <strong>B</strong> to drop bombs, <strong>M</strong> to fire missiles, <strong>F</strong> to launch flares, and <strong>G</strong> to use the jet's gun. Victory demands strategy and skill, as you must either destroy the enemy jet or all their base assets. Refuel by landing at your airbase, and rearm or repair at designated assets scattered across the map, ensuring each match is a dynamic and tactical showdown in the skies.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3264200/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731950032","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3264200/page.bg.jpg?t=1731950032","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3264200/1d54be0a669885b48cbd2143325e799da6ff1ab4/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731950032","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3264200/1d54be0a669885b48cbd2143325e799da6ff1ab4/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731950032","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Aces Over Airfields</strong> is an intense 2D aerial combat game where you take control of a powerful fighter jet to engage in thrilling dogfights and strategic battles.
