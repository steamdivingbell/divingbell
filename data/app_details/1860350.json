You try to keep your momentum and accelerate while avoiding bumping the monuments. There is <strong>no speed limit</strong>.</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The goal is to <strong>collect as many orbs as possible</strong> within <strong>5 minutes</strong>. You'll see yourself <strong>improving really quickly</strong> as you get used to the mechanics. </li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> There are <strong>multiple game modes</strong> with their own dedicated <strong>Leaderboards</strong>: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Original</strong>: The orbs spawn in the <strong>original positions</strong>. You can <strong>memorize</strong> the positions and perfect your route. All entries in the Leaderboard are equal.<br></li><li> <strong>Random</strong>: The orbs spawn in <strong>random positions</strong>. There is <strong>no memorization</strong> so you need to improve your base <strong>movement skills and strategy</strong>. All entries in the Leaderboard are different. <br></li><li> <strong>Weekly</strong>: Everyone plays with the <strong>same orb positions for the entire week</strong>.

After 40 orbs, your <strong>Kunai</strong> starts changing color and material. At 100 orbs, you get the <strong>Flame Kunai</strong> and above 130, your rope turns into a <strong>lightning beam</strong>. Among the players above 150 orbs collected, only the best one gets the <strong>&quot;Ascendant&quot;</strong> rank.</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The movement mechanic is custom, hand-tailored for <strong>grappling hook</strong> and <strong>air-strafing</strong> like in Team Fortress 2 or Counter-Strike. But it's more <strong>intuitive</strong> because unlike in those games, you hold the forward key while air-strafing, and you can also move in all directions in the air without air-strafing. With this, you can micro-adjust your movement to pick up the orbs easily. There is also <strong>auto-bunnyhopping</strong> when you hold the jump key, so you don't need to focus on timing your jumps. Instead, focus on your route and swings. </li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The <strong>replays</strong> in the leaderboard have video player kinds of controls, like a timeline, play speed, and pause for ease of use. </li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Physics runs at <strong>125 ticks</strong> (8 milliseconds) to make sure the movement is <strong>smooth and detailed</strong>. The replays are recorded as <strong>lossless</strong>, and high quality at the same rate.</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> You can <strong>put your own meme</strong> image to the orbs, and use your own sounds for orb pickup, hook throwing and hook landing to customize your experience.</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The HUD in the game is made clean and <strong>minimalistic</strong> to make sure you see it only when you need to. It's <strong>not blocking your view</strong>. You can also turn specific ones off in the HUD settings, and change the <strong>crosshair and orb outline colors</strong>. </li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> There is a mesmerizing <strong>day and night cycle</strong> in the sky. This creates beautiful dynamic lighting and shadows during the run. You can <strong>customize</strong> the day length and the hour the day starts. </li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> There are lots of fun <strong>lifetime and run-based stats</strong> like <strong>&quot;how many orbs did you collect&quot;</strong>, <strong>&quot;how many times did you bump&quot;</strong> or <strong>&quot;how many kilometers did you travel&quot;</strong> in total. </li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> There is a <strong>guide</strong> within the game, <strong>full of short videos</strong> where you can learn the deeper mechanics. </li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> There are lots of <strong>achievements</strong> to challenge yourself.</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The game is quite <strong>light and optimized</strong> to run smoothly on older machines while still looking pretty. </li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> There is an option, <strong>&quot;Null-Cancelling Movement&quot;</strong> which is a famous script in Source games.
