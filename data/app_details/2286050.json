That's a quite simple and short game - to distract gamers for a bit. Achievable, satisfying, easily rewarding - that's all you could ask for to calm your mind.<br><br><strong>ABOUT GAMEPLAY</strong><br><br>All you gotta do is figuring out how you can get to the princess with at least a ball. In single player mode, beware that you need to do this before timers runs out. Once you initiate a movement, player will continue in that direction until he runs into a void - or runs out of ball. Multiplier tiles will give you more ball while hollow tiles will cause you to lose a ball - balance them. Breakable tiles won't be there once you pass over them. Button tiles will rotate switchable tiles once you pass over them. You can reset yourself in versus mode. Also you can rotate camera in single player mode to have a better perspective. <br>Enjoy the demo &amp; consider buying full version.","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2286050/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1675699512","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2286050/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1675699512","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2286050/extras/gif1.gif?t=1675699512\" /><br><br><strong>LIGHT WEIGHT PUZZLER</strong><br><br>Mostly, you won't struggle to solve puzzles.
