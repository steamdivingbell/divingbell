{"about_the_game":"TrueScale is a groundbreaking interior design tool that can simultaneously create 2D floor plans, 3D mockups, and full room-scale environments in VR. With TrueScale, anyone can design their house, office or apartment in minutes, and then virtually experience it first-hand in real scale. Additionally, this particular version of TrueScale leverages Wayfair\u2019s 3D model API, enabling users to furnish their designs from a robust catalog of actual furniture and d\u00e9cor. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the user creates, the app automatically generates a replicated 3D environment so that they can instantly be transported into their designs using a VR headset. By entering the real scale model, users gain a sense of depth that cannot be achieved through traditional renders, and with Vive\u2019s room-scale technology, users have the freedom to walk around and explore a design space while making changes in real time. Using VR in this stage of the design process allows the user to gain a realistic picture of the final design as opposed to relying on their imagination, blueprints or story boards.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/621500/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1510660223","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/621500/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1510660223","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/621500/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1510660223","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/621500/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1510660223","categories":[{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"TrueScale is a groundbreaking interior design tool that can simultaneously create 2D floor plans, 3D mockups, and full room-scale environments in VR.
