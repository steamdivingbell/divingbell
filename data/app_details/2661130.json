{"about_the_game":"<strong>MINE - KILL - SURVIVE</strong><br>Resources are becoming increasingly scarce, and the federation is utilizing all sources to obtain them.

Uncover the entire story of the underground world, but most importantly, survive. Those caves were sealed for a good reason.<br><br><strong>Gameplay</strong><br>The Shaft is a story-driven horror shooter set in dark caves. It combines resource mining, exploring randomly generated underground areas, buying new equipment, and upgrading weapons. Throughout the game, the story unfolds, and the difficulty increases. You need to be very quiet because noise attracts unwanted attention.<br><br>The generated caves are like a maze where it's easy to get lost. It is crucial to use a limited-length rope for navigation, but the caves hide a wealth of treasures that must be obtained.<br><br><strong>Monsters</strong><br>Most underground monsters are sensitive to noise. Some are primitive, while others show a slight hint of intelligence. Each monster has specific behavior, and you need to be prepared for various attacks that can cause minor or even fatal injuries.<br><br><strong>Weapons</strong><br>Each weapon has its advantages and disadvantages. Some are quiet, some are precise, while others have explosive rounds. Each is suitable for something different. Every weapon can be upgraded, and some can have special attachments. However, it's not wise to rely on just one weapon because when ammunition runs out, you need to know how to use them all.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2661130/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1701445416","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2661130/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1701445416","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2661130/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1701445416","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2661130/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1701445416","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"This game contains brutality, blood, and killing with realistic models and sounds.
