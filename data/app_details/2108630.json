{"about_the_game":"Ashley was taught to leave no stone unturned during her Riftbreaking missions. That\u2019s exactly what she did on Galatea 37. What she found will make her reconsider her training. The Riftbreaker: Into the Dark takes you into the unknown depths of an expansive cavern system below the surface of Galatea 37. Its unique ecosystem hides not only unthinkable riches but also a dark ghost from Ashley\u2019s past. Into the Dark will pose a set of unique challenges and test your adaptation skills as danger lurks around every corner.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About The Expansion:</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2108630/extras/riftbreaker_into_the_dark_gif_1.gif?t=1726148736\" /><br>Into the Dark is the second World Expansion for The Riftbreaker.
