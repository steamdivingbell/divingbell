For Hire</strong> is a gritty, noir-fueled first-person shooter that draws inspiration from the classic cartoons of the 1930s. The monochromatic visual style of hand-drawn rubber hose animation and retro jazz soundtrack are created with the same techniques of the era.

His journey starts with a seemingly clich\u00e9 damsel in distress, but as P.I.

Encounter a mischievous and disturbed cast of big bads as Pepper takes the gritty journey to the dark side of town. Playful weaponry and a distinctive health display, coupled with enemies behaving like cartoon characters, add a lighthearted twist to traditional FPS gameplay. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A CITY OF DANGER </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Explore a diverse city playground, from the dark city streets of Mouseburg, to a noir film studio and casinos, to the Marina port and dock district, vast underground sewers and swamp marshlands.
