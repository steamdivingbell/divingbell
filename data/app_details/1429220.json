{"about_the_game":"We are one of the first studios who decided to make a videogame based on Mark Twain's books. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, we took a chapter from Tom Sawyer's Adventures book, about him escaping to an island with his friends. And decided that this will perfectly fit into a concept of a survival game. But it is not a plotless survival sandbox. As anything with our studio, our games are highly focused on unique experiences, intrinsic motivation,  and player emotions. If we make a survival game - it is going to be unique and most of our time is going to be dedicated to immersing the player and creating a feeling of an authentic teenage adventure inside the player's head. <br />\r\nThe first hour of the game will be dedicated to immersing the player into being Tom, starting with him waking up and going through daily routine, and will be followed by setting up the escape from home, executing it. The game will have a lot of unique mechanics like driving the boat, and generally will be high on dialogues, and include a lot of mini-games and socialization inside it, like &quot;rock paper scissors game&quot; and others.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Be Tom Sawyer, your childhood's favorite character<br />\r\n-Play as alternative, asian Tom Sawyer.
