The player is able to explore, find treasure, solve puzzles and rotate the tiles around your position whenever possible. But be careful! You need to keep track of your Movement and Restart points. Are you out of movement? You will lose a Restart Point and teleport back to the Start position of this floor. Are you out of Restart Points? The run will be over and you will Revert back in Time to the main menu.
