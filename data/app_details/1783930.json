{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What to expect...</h2>The Early Access version of Civatlas has core gameplay mechanics that we plan to expand upon. Included in the game:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Open Your Atlas</h2>Map nerds, rejoice! Civatlas is a game inspired by those iconic lithographic bird\u2019s eye view maps of the Renaissance era created by legendary cartographers including John Speed, Georg Braun and Frans Hogenberg.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Generate a Vast Landscape </h2>Procedural continental landscapes are formed by plate tectonics. Select and build upon 16km^2 map tiles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Select a Culture</h2>Your Culture choice will affect your World\u2019s name with geographic toponyms and affect the names of your Civvies, based upon the primary language of the Culture selected. This feature will be expanded with more global cultures, biomes and architectural styles!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Plot Your Grid </h2>From humble medieval hamlets to bustling Renaissance cities. Unique \u2018Plot\u2019 mechanics parcel your landscape in any way desired. Assign these plots a purpose to discover more upgrades and decorations that lead to unique creations. Civatlas is a game about the freedom to build without the pressures to survive. Escape into a thriving world of your own creation!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Produce Resources</h2>Over 100 resources of various types, from mud to money! Resources are essential for construction and Civvie happiness.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Progression Tree</h2>Grow from a humble hamlet into a thriving Town.

Follow the different narratives of your plots as Civvies move in, live, pass on, give birth, learn, and grow through the seven ages of man, as defined by Shakespeare, and not necessarily in that order.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Connections Matter</h2>Neighbouring plots will provide bonuses such as production rates or happiness for your Civvies, depending on building type or plot purpose.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiple Cities</h2>Create a new Atlas and build on other tiles of your generated World. Establish trade routes and chart the growth of your new nation-state!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Historical Expansion</h2>Expand the cultural content across space and time. From feudal Japan to ancient Rome, we plan to add even more cultures, biomes and architectural styles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Furthermore...</h2><br><i>Hark, travellers and scholars of antiquity! Art thou weary of battling and bloodshed in thy games, and yearn for a tranquil and intellectual pursuit? Then lo, I present to thee Civatlas, a most wondrous simulation game set in the Renaissance and Medieval times.<br><br>In Civatlas, thou shalt engage in the art of governance and management, building and nurturing thy very own city-state. And what better way to showcase thy city than by creating beautiful and intricate maps to be treasured for all eternity in thy personal Atlas?<br><br>Methinks this game shall appeal to those who seek a challenge of the mind, a mastery of resource management, and a thirst for knowledge of the workings of the world. Without the taint of competitive combat, thou mayest build and prosper at thine own pace, crafting a world that is uniquely thine.<br><br>So why delay? Engage thy mind, sharpen thy skills, and immerse thyself in the world of Civatlas.
