{"about_the_game":"AquaPhobia is a first-person game where cooperation &amp; paranoia will be mixed! Work as a team to complete many missions like; killing a horde of sea creatures or drilling a hole to gain access to rare minerals. this might seem easy, but don't forget that some people in your surroundings don't want you to succeed &amp; they will do everything they can to stop you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">AquaPhobia's universe</h2>In the near future, a new planet is discovered at the border of our galaxy. although this planet's surface is mostly made of water and rocks, its center is full of precious minerals. You are among the first colons team sent on this planet. <strong>Your goal: retrieve those minerals! </strong>To do so, you will have access to certain tools and roles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">AquaPhobia, not just another traitor game</h2>Indeed, it is probably not the first time you see a traitor game... So why choose Aquaphobia over another more popular traitor game? Here are some reasons:<br><br><strong>Experience System</strong><br>AquaPhobia has a complex experience system. To begin, there are 3 skills where players can win experience. those are engineering, weapon handling, and medic. The more you repair the electric system and the more your engineering skill will go up, the more you use weapons and the more your weapon handling skill will go up, etc.<br><br><strong>Perma death</strong><br>AquaPhobia has a permadeath system. if you die, you lose your character and all the experience you had with him. You will have to restart from the beginning; create a new character, choose your role, your name, etc.<br><br><strong>Role system</strong><br>AquaPhobia has a role system that gives you a small advantage. In the actual version, Aquaphobia has 3 roles; those are engineer, security, and medic. these roles give you a small advantage for the first missions because like written previously, AquaPhobia has an experience system. so, if you take the medic role, for example, you will start with an experience boost for the medic skill.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1880920/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1652283547","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1880920/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1652283547","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1880920/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1652283547","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1880920/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1652283547","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"There is a traitor in this game & his role is to kill people, so there will be blood & violence like shooting, hitting or pushing people"},"detailed_description":"AquaPhobia is a first-person game where cooperation &amp; paranoia will be mixed!
