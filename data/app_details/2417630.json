Zombies are roaming the streets, attacking humans and turning them into undead creatures. A group of human survivors are holed up in a fortified building, trying to fend off the zombie hordes. But as the sun sets and darkness falls, they hear the howls of werewolves in the distance and the fluttering of bat wings.<br>      The humans are wary, but they realize they need all the help they can get. They agree to work with the vampires and werewolves to fend off the zombie hordes.<br>      The supernatural creatures bring their unique strengths to the fight. The vampires use their speed and agility to evade the zombies, while the werewolves use their strength and ferocity to take them down. The humans use their ingenuity to create weapons and traps to slow down the zombies.<br>      As the battle rages on, the survivors start to gain the upper hand. But then, they hear a new sound. A group of powerful vampires, led by Lilith, has arrived in the city. The survivors and their allies are outnumbered, but they refuse to back down. They fight fiercely against the vampires and their minions, using all their strength and cunning to survive.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2417630/extras/LilithGif.gif?t=1712666517\" /><br><strong>Features</strong><br>*Story driven Adventure<br>*Environment Based Combat<br>*Easy to use Controls<br>*Top-Down Camera with action based switching<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2417630/extras/SkinGif.gif?t=1712666517\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2417630/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1712666517","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2417630/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1712666517","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2417630/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1712666517","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2417630/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1712666517","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2417740,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<h1>Just Updated</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2417630/extras/Screenshot_2023-04-02_003830.png?t=1712666517\" /><br>Thank you to all that have supported us on this journey.
