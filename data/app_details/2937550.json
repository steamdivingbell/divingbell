{"about_the_game":"Icosagon is a unique deck builder tower defense game. Survive against many waves of enemies which create a randomly generated path each wave. Place a variety of different shapes in order to stop the enemies. There are many different shapes to choose from, all having their own unique strengths and abilities. Some shapes generate lines, some are used for attacking enemies, some are used for defending against enemies, and some just give you a quick boost. You can strategically build a deck of cards that will be used in each game, combining shapes that work well together. In order to progress through the game, you have to complete campaigns, which are a series of levels each with different difficulty, gamemode, and restrictions. You can earn more cards by opening packs that you get from either beating a level or buying them from the shop.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2937550/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1716920575","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2937550/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1716920575","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2937550/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1716920575","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2937550/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1716920575","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Icosagon is a unique deck builder tower defense game.
