{"about_the_game":"After experiencing a devastating car crash in the middle of the desert, you awaken stranded at a long-abandoned gas station. A voice on the radio calls out to you, trapped nearby but just out of reach. Together you discover remnants of a missing cult, unholy rituals, a mysterious cavern, and bloodthirsty creatures hunting you both down. With the walls closing in, can you follow in the cultist's footsteps and complete their final ritual -- <i>before it's too late?</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Lose Your Mind</h2>Witnessing horrors will chip away at your psyche, depicted by your Nerve meter. As you slowly lose touch with reality, audiovisual hallucinations and other unforeseen consequences will begin to manifest. The effects of a weakened mind are wide-ranging and completely unscripted - meaning any manner of horrors can happen at any time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fight</h2>Face threats head-on with a wide variety of guns and melee weapons. From hammers, to nailguns, axes, baseball bats, shotguns, and much more. All weapons are able to be upgraded to fit your needs.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Scavenge</h2>Discover valuable supplies hidden away in every corner of the world. Use them at-will, or break them down in to raw materials to be used in arcane transmutation. Collect recipes to unlock the ability to transmute these materials into completely new items.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hide</h2>Avoid dangers by keeping a low profile. Create distractions by making noise, or take to the shadows to remain unseen. Flip switches or shoot out lights to gain the element of surprise, or power them all on to see what's lurking in the darkness.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Run</h2>Escape your pursuers with a mixture of both agility and ingenuity. Vault over barricades, slide under obstacles, and climb anything to put distance between you and imminent death.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Improvise</h2>No key for that door? Find a hole in the wall. Break a window. Crawl through a hatch. Climb up a pipe. Every encounter is designed with numerous solutions in mind, further multiplied by emergent systems allowing for completely new ways to tackle problems.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Safe Room","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1390070/49d761fd97b0218cb245420bce2ea013ff9c498d.jpg"},{"name":"Alchemist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1390070/7f39e852331d05107fee5be5dd70cb5ae5634f28.jpg"},{"name":"Spelunker","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1390070/f5e420ad629195b467e9d4e7efdd7c6717617c62.jpg"},{"name":"Occultist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1390070/b435948d36075991f34e4c4235c317ef41bc9c2b.jpg"},{"name":"Symbology","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1390070/47d4958ab2c4250dc05a215a5915bd6ce51cf821.jpg"},{"name":"Ritualist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1390070/cab26952509f47dfe5c17be745c1fb59887d0f72.jpg"},{"name":"Lamb","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1390070/5e74e0ccae2c6f22d11ac4747318ac57c006718d.jpg"},{"name":"Heretic","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1390070/a1badca81160c61399ab910610ff93fe2b8528c8.jpg"},{"name":"Tourist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1390070/9dc37025021c2f1e843a75511130bbe326af643d.jpg"},{"name":"Ad Infernum","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1390070/c12262a65c103c7f1755225e1176f82c340848b5.jpg"}],"total":17},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1390070/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1709222622","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1390070/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1709222622","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1390070/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1709222622","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1390070/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1709222622","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Ad Infernum features scenes of psychological horror and sporadic violence."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"After experiencing a devastating car crash in the middle of the desert, you awaken stranded at a long-abandoned gas station.
