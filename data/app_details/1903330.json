{"about_the_game":"<strong><i>As the sun emerges from the endless ocean, the villagers pray that the Giant will grace them with good deeds and a helping hand.</i></strong><br><br>The Giant of Torridge Island is a sandbox game in which you can either help or hinder the life on an island. The Giant has the abilty to pick up almost anything and can make the objects interact in a variety of ways by placing them next to each other. These interactions will affect life and nature on the island in both positive and negative ways.<br><br><strong><i>The villagers pray into the night, hoping the Giant will not return tomorrow.</i></strong><br><br>Whether you wish to plant trees or chop them down, help build houses or destroy them, breed animals or hunt them, your influence will be felt by all, and ultimately determine the fate of the island and all the inhabitants of it. Just as The Giant molds the native villages, the villagers mold The Giant, every good deed delivered upon the residents will grant a star, while every bad deed inflicted will grant a tear. Collecting enough of either will make the Giant grow and become more powerful.<br><br><strong><i>The Giant grows through the emotions of the villagers, learning how to further their happiness or misery. The Giant appears unmoved by which of the two is inflicted upon the islanders.</i></strong><br><br>As the joy or torment of those on the island grows, The Giant manifests into that of what the villagers imagine the true nature of the Giant to be: an angel or a demon. As these feelings fester among the population The Giant will learn new abilities which reflect the villagers' notion. <br><br><strong><i>And so another page in the tale of this island comes to a close.
