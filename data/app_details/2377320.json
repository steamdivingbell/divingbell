Choose from many different active and passive abilities to defeat the onslaught of enemies. Collect berries to level up and get new abilities. Collect gold to permanently upgrade your skills between games. Fight your way thorugh the hordes of evil and beat the challenging bossfights to unlock new levels and characters!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2377320/extras/skelly_100.gif?t=1725188805\" /> <strong>Tip</strong><br>All active abilities get a special, very strong upgrade once you level them to level 5! <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2377320/extras/Dentures_100.gif?t=1725188805\" /> <strong>Tip</strong><br>Dentures are a very save but also strong starting ability. Since they have no cooldown they deal damage almost all the time, especially if there are lots of enemies on the screen. They are also largely independent of your position giving you the chance to concentrate on running away and collecting gold and exp berries!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2377320/extras/reroll_v2_100.png?t=1725188805\" /> <strong>Tip</strong><br>You can reroll the abilities in the level up screen by pressing the dice on the right! You can also press R on the keyboard, or the X button on an Xbox Controller, or the Square button on a PlayStation controller. The first reroll is free, but it gets more and more expensive from there.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2377320/extras/Zombie_100.gif?t=1725188805\" /> <strong>Tip</strong><br>Some abilities have scaling. Icebolts for example scale with ice kills. They are weak early on but can become really strong if you get enough kills with (other) ice abilities. On their own they won\u2018t scale much, so make sure you have at least one other ice ability. But don\u2018t get Icebolts too late either, because then they won\u2018t have time to scale!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2377320/extras/Viking_100.gif?t=1725188805\" /> <strong>Tip</strong> <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2377320/extras/Firebolt_100.gif?t=1725188805\" /><br>Your chances of getting certain types of abilities are higher if you already have one or more of that type. If you want the Firebolt it might be a good idea to skill the Firepillar so you\u2018ll have a higher chance of getting it in the level up screen!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2377320/extras/gold_200.gif?t=1725188805\" /> <strong>Tip</strong> <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2377320/extras/Mimic_100.gif?t=1725188805\" /><br>Mimics are special enemies, they are rare and spawn randomly.
