It's a twin stick shooter in which the player must dodge and shoot incoming slamoids while at the same time avoid touching the ever shrinking, growing, and moving red ring that surrounds them. Each time a slamoid crashes into the player, 1 life is lost. If the user touches the red ring, they lose all lives and it\u2019s game over.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/837180/extras/Notes.jpg?t=1533739303\" /><br>Thank you so much for checking out Slamoids!
