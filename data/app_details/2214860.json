{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story Background</h2>We travel through the universe to collect precious treasures. During our journey we enjoy the magnificent scenery of the universe, we will also encounter different enemies, we will create black holes and devour our enemies.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>It is a relaxing game where when you choose two targets of the same color, they are connected by lightning and then destroyed by a black hole. When you destroy 100 targets, you win. <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2214860/extras/GIFyanshi.gif?t=1670630705\" /><br>Of course, you have to finish within the allotted time to win, each game is limited to 5 minutes, and the shorter the time, the higher the rating you get. As I said, it's a simple little game to decompress.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2214860/extras/GIF11.11.gif?t=1670630705\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Features</h2>To make the game more interesting, I made the game into 3D graphics. Unlike traditional 2D graphics, you can control your character to fly freely in the universe without being restricted. You'll need to keep connecting more targets during your flight, and you'll soon find it fun.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">More Game Modes</h2>Obstacle Mode: Add a random number of objects that are the same size and color as the target, but selecting them will not react in any way.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2214860/extras/11.21GIF.gif?t=1670630705\" /><br>Gem Mode: Eliminate 100 targets while collecting a randomly specified number of gems to win.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2214860/extras/11.21GIF_1_.gif?t=1670630705\" /><br>Vanishing Mode: Targets disappear randomly, making it difficult to lock onto them when there are fewer and fewer targets.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2214860/extras/11.21GIF_2_.gif?t=1670630705\" /><br>These game modes interfere with quick target selection, and it's not easy to beat a perfect score.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">More Fun</h2>As you win more and more, new maps are unlocked for you. In the new map, bosses will be spawned with different skills that will attack you at any time. You'll need to dodge boss skills in time, because if you get hit, your character will die instantly and you'll need to challenge again.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2214860/extras/GIF.gif?t=1670630705\" /><br><br>There are currently 4 maps in the game and 800 levels waiting for you to unlock.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Developers Want to Say</h2>This is my first indie game and I hope to make it even better. So I hope that players will be able to comment on this game after the experience, and I will do my best to improve it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">You Can Contact Me</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">QQ\uff1a690845098</h2>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2214860/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1670630705","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2214860/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1670630705","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2214860/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1670630705","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2214860/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1670630705","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story Background</h2>We travel through the universe to collect precious treasures.
