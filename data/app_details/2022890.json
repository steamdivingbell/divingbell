You can fight in a free for all or in a team-based objective game modes. Playing online, you will earn cash and vouchers to unlock and buy new weapons, skins and unlock new technologies.

Movement parts such as wheels, wings and hover blades need to be built with redundancy in mind, as parts can get shot off during the course of a battle. Bots may be built block by block, but will be stronger -and prettier- using advanced build plates. Each bot is centered on a core which has limited HP and must be protected.

To build an effective bot, you must balance your energy budget. Fortunately, there is a system of customizable modules, which let you specialize different systems for efficiency or power.
