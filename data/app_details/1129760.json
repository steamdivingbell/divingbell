{"about_the_game":"I am a music teacher. I have always had an idea to make some of my music knowledge and experience into games. For this reason, I began to learn how to program and make games.

I think a good music game should let players use music materials, build their own style, and create their own music.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo I have integrated the elements of composition and improvisation into the fighting game. I want players to experience the most primitive way of creating music. How to develop from a small inspiration into a complete music process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI will hope that many people can see the charm of this type of game to join me for subsequent development.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt present, the preemptive experience has all the functions I want in this game, including:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1. Play rhythm and add rhythm to melody and chord<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2. Play music with both hands to operate multiple heroes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3. The player creates a motivation and develops it into a complete genre of music<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4. Imitate the works of music masters<br />\r\n<br />\r\n5.
