{"about_the_game":"People say that if you ride far enough into the desert, you'll find a town built off the river known as the Rio de Almas. This river ferries the souls of the recently-deceased. Lately, these souls have been overstepping, manifesting in the world of the living each night. Now, people have flocked to this town to avoid saying goodbye to their loved ones, stealing precious time away from death. In La Enmienda, you don't have to say goodbye forever. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe ghosts have begun lashing out. When the sun sets and the dead greet the living, they are confused and angry, putting the townsfolk in mortal danger. Bounties have been placed on the rowdy spirits, urging someone to put them to rest. It's the perfect job for a daring opportunist like yourself--the kind of job no one else will take. The moon rises over La Enmienda once more, and you are here to collect.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGhost Moon High Noon is an isometric puzzle shooter. You play as the bounty hunter Valentina Sombra, who barely escaped the deadly clutches of the Rio de Almas and is now set on collecting all of the bounties for herself. The job is simple: armed with your spectral revolver, lasso, and recently-acquired semi-corporeal body, you must put down 12 unique restless spirits that have brought hell to earth. Get to know a large cast of unique townsfolk and ghosts, learning their history and quelling their sorrows, before eventually confronting your own. Blaze your trail through a series of complex environments and puzzles, shooting ricochet trick shots, wrangling your environment with your lasso, and phasing through walls to break through the ghosts' defenses one by one.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2936420/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1715718434","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2936420/page.bg.jpg?t=1715718434","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2936420/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1715718434","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2936420/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1715718434","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"People say that if you ride far enough into the desert, you'll find a town built off the river known as the Rio de Almas.
