{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">This demo shows our high-end graphics paired with an open world, which has a size of 16 square kilometers. You can explore the world and immerse yourself in the graphic details, but there is currently no gameplay. The point is to show how the most advanced features of Unreal Engine 5, Nanite and Lumen, can work in VR - even on a seemingly infinite map, where you can reach every place you can see. Please note that the system requirements are extremely high.</h2><br>The reason we are making this demo is to show that production values like this can be achieved by a small team and that you can use the most advanced UE5 features in VR, even if that is not officially supported. For us, the demo is important to judge whether PCVR players are interested at all, and even more importantly, willing to support our approach. Since we only have an RTX 4090 and Meta Quest 3 and Pro for testing, we'd love to hear about your experience. By pressing &quot;F&quot; on the keyboard, you can activate a frame counter. Let us know in a review what your setup is - Headset, GPU, CPU - and how many frames you are getting. And of course what you think about the graphics.
