{"about_the_game":"Build your characters from the ground up with the Time Elements - Character Core Set! Finalbossblues has created new pieces to help you build your perfect heroes! These pixel art pieces are designed to fit a 16x16 pixel grid, meaning that they can be resized to easily work in whichever RPG Maker you want. And with more than 50 pieces, covering hair, shirts, pants, wings, weapons, and more, you have tons of options to fill your game with characters! Fill your game with even more excitement by making use of the animations such as jumping, holding something, swinging a weapon, and sleeping to add in extra movement to cutscenes and dungeon exploration.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaking your own hero can be tough if you\u2019re not used to art programs, so this pack simplifies things by containing a generator! Create your characters with a few clicks of the mouse and then export it in the size you need for Ace or MV/MZ so you can add it right in! Create a bat-winged warrior decked out in red armor, a bearded thief in a green hood, a spear-wielding lady knight, and anyone else your game calls for by choosing the right pieces or hitting the randomize button for new inspiration!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverwhelmed by the generator and not sure what NPCs to make? Don\u2019t worry, since this pack also includes 16 ready-to-use NPC sprites (including children) and 5 prebuilt heroes so you can add them in and get right to the game-making! A PDF guide is also included, just in case you need some help figuring out a specific thing with the generator or character pieces.
