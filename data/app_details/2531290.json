{"about_the_game":"The <strong>EF-24G</strong> <i>&quot;Mischief&quot;</i> is a two-seat, twin-engine, variable-sweep fighter aircraft which has been adapted and equipped to play a major role in electronic warfare (EW). Specialized sensors and advanced multi-mode ECM pods give it the capability to find, target, and wreak havoc on all kinds of enemy transmissions. Smartly managing the various systems can be a complex task, so another player can enter the rear seat as an Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">AN/ALQ-245 Multi-mode Electronic Countermeasure Pod</h2>This special piece of equipment is the pinnacle of ECM technology. It can transmit low, medium, and high frequencies in various modes:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Noise: Barrage the target with noise to reduce its ability to detect meaningful signals. Depending on the frequency, this can affect radar detection, GPS, communications, etc.<br></li><li>DRFM: Digital Radio Frequency Memory is a technique where incoming radar signals are processed and returned to the sender to create false contacts and pull off locks.<br></li><li>SAS: The Signal Augmentation System allows the pod to reshape its radar return in order to appear as a different kind of aircraft on the target's radar.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ADM-160J Air-launched Decoy/Jammer</h2>This jet-powered missile can be deployed to fly orbits around target locations or follow a GPS path. It carries the same signature augmentation system, giving it the ability to appear like a fighter, bomber, or any other aircraft on radar. It can also operate in jamming mode to help suppress enemy air defenses. It maintains a datalink with your aircraft so it can be updated while in-flight with new routes or targets, and share its RWR contacts for triangulation and analysis.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Sensor Fusion and Datalink</h2>The Mischief utilizes 5th generation tactical systems like the F-45, with additions and modifications to help it excel in EW. It automatically links up with teammates to triangulate radar positions, gather information on target frequencies and configurations, and provide you with all the information you need to carry on your mission.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Variable Sweep Wings</h2>The EF-24's swing wings allow it to reach high top speeds while still being able to operate off an aircraft carrier. The ECM pods deploy ram air turbine intakes when necessary to feed power hungry operations, but the aircraft's aerodynamic configuration allows it to maintain supersonic flight even in the draggiest state.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Sensor Displays</h2>Analyze the EM environment in the FRAZ (Frequency/Azimuth) display, and get a read on the general signals being detected in all directions on the TSD. Take full control of the radar while still being able to quickly and easily designate targets on the TSD.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Weapons</h2>Take on radar targets with various types of anti-radiation missiles. Launch a heavy air-to-air payload at long ranges with the AIM-54. Carry high capacity racks of unguided and precision bombs between the engines.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2531290/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1703207197","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2531290/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1703207197","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2531290/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1703207197","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2531290/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1703207197","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The <strong>EF-24G</strong> <i>&quot;Mischief&quot;</i> is a two-seat, twin-engine, variable-sweep fighter aircraft which has been adapted and equipped to play a major role in electronic warfare (EW).
