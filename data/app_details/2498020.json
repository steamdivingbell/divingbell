After an unfortunate result of the large hadron collider experiment our reality is torn open and other parallel dimensions are bleeding in. The Perdition Man instructs the protagonist to close these schisms and endure the horrors that lay within certain dark realms that threaten everything. In this first person shooter you will fight frightening monsters that live on the other side that intend to turn base reality into hell. With a retro style and simple, responsive, and fast paced mechanics, The Perdition Man: Winds of Judgment offers players a tense, action pact adventure into nightmarish levels that are equal part disturbing and exciting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLost and disillusioned after his stint in the military, Jason makes contact with The Perdition Man who claims to know him, however in this timeline, The Perdition Man never existed and your world is as doomed as a result of the experiment. Everything you've known will be gone soon and this is your only time to make a difference.
