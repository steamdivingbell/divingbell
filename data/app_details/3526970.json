Worried about hitting the right button? Any key on the same half of your keyboard will do. Unbelievably fast streams? Just hit them as chords, it's fine.

Too many inputs will fill up the heat gauge, which <i>*checks notes*</i> vastly increases your score...? Who came up with this??</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In this demo version, play 9 songs from GODHAND's base songlist (we're counting the tutorial because it's peak) and maybe even take out a keycap or two<i> for free</i>.
