{"about_the_game":"<strong>The RFVR Demo</strong><br>Welcome to Dogojima. A newly discovered island hundreds of miles from the mainland. It's covered in highly sought after resources, rare ores, exotic wildlife, and it also hides an ancient past. The island is home to a variety of hostile primitive species, some of which have even mastered elemental attack magic.  As the humans began to settle the island and mine its resources, the constant threat of these creatures created a high demand for skilled fighters and adventurers to assist in the expansion and protection of the colonies. You've just arrived on the docks of Dogojima and this is where you begin your journey.<br><br><strong>What Is Inside?</strong>   <br>The RFVR demo consists 1/8th of the worlds map with players level capped at 11. This is essentially the full game which has been locked down to keep you from having too much fun. Not to worry though this demo is HUGE and there are plenty of secrets to uncover. We'll be releasing information about those secrets each week as we get closer to the early access launch. Explore over 18 square miles of the 154 square mile world. Fight against many types of enemies. Craft weapons and upgrade armor. Grow, hunt, and cook your food. Craft and cast elemental spells. Deliver goods around the island by boat. Build merchant structures and guard tents. Upgrade town defenses. Unlock the secrets of the ruins and retrieve ancient relics from the depths of the island. The possibilities are nearly unlimited, and this is just the demo.","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1794080/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1669408499","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1794080/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1669408499","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Contains violence against creatures, animals, and humans."},"detailed_description":"<strong>The RFVR Demo</strong><br>Welcome to Dogojima.
