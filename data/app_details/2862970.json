Along with building, leveling and upgrading your turrets, you are able to control your main character and aid the turrets in killing the enemies. As you gain experience, your character gains levels and skills that you can choose from various choices in the skill tree. Currently playable classes in the full release are Sniper and Engineer.

The subjects started experiencing mutations in their bodies, and over time were found to have experienced a rapid evolution into completely different beings.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This generation was found to be much more aggressive and hostile even to the creators than previous generations, and quickly the specimen, viewing themself as a completely different and superhuman race, started to revolt against humanity and create clones of themselves to achieve superiority and control of the Earth. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In 2325, you as part of mercenaries from Armorion, a private military contractor, were tasked to infiltrate the main research facility of CyTech, to eliminate the rebelling specimens and end the production of new clones. The defense systems of the facility were dismantled and stripped down by the specimens, but the defense network is still connected and you are able to rearm the defenses by building turrets and traps into the existing defense pods. You will need to clear out the facility's sectors one by one and ensure the defenses are able to hold out any hostile specimens.</p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Ready for Action","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2862970/8161f57b2d6fb15f4c3d386669d52c2435fe4c3a.jpg"},{"name":"Completed 5 Missions","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2862970/da34e211d75c60c3a4943c86b403d5eda6700e3f.jpg"},{"name":"Completed 15 Missions","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2862970/1da619afd4d8ee7be16ffc18d1db1c9868dc589c.jpg"},{"name":"Completed 27 Missions","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2862970/ba9a6758bf90d8deb6543b8cbba40365867727df.jpg"},{"name":"Sniper Level 20","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2862970/c66e63f499af85471123c99fbf43cd41f1485565.jpg"},{"name":"Sniper Level 30","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2862970/e232c537156daa165370b0bc076358c4be70e92c.jpg"},{"name":"Sniper Level 50","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2862970/532c99eea138bb4d26fa0e37004f86dc4d95ef6e.jpg"},{"name":"Sniper Level 100","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2862970/e51112b49c48dc4891b6a720f76e4d7aa80e7460.jpg"},{"name":"Engineer Level 20","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2862970/c66e63f499af85471123c99fbf43cd41f1485565.jpg"},{"name":"Engineer Level 30","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2862970/e232c537156daa165370b0bc076358c4be70e92c.jpg"}],"total":61},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2862970?t=1740157283","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2862970/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1740157283","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2862970/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1740157283","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2862970/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1740157283","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Violence, blood and gore in pixel-art form"},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2862970/extras/640x207_wide.png?t=1740157283\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Neural Shock: Total Destruction (v1.1)</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The first major content update designated as Neural Shock: Total Destruction is releasing on <strong>March 7th, 2025</strong>.
