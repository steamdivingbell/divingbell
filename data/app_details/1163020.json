{"about_the_game":"Carefully aim your repeater pistol at a huge mosquito and down the bulging insect with two well-placed shots, jump down the ledge of a dilapidated building reclaimed by arborescent vegetation, dodge acidic slime thrown by a hideous mutant, and bury a blood-red fire axe in its disgusting head. Such is the adrenaline-fueled thrill of The Looter.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1163020/extras/Puffer3.gif?t=1733768721\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>STORY</strong></h2>The world is coming to an end. Everything is lost and destroyed, humanity is in disarray. Somewhere in this world, there is Tortura, a giant forest that devoured the monuments of a past civilization. Tortura is a dangerous place. Not many people decide to live there, and those who dare are hiding behind thick walls and sleeping with their guns by their side. <br><br>The story begins when the protagonist, a nameless looter, and his comrades reach the Watch Tower. It\u2019s an old construction placed at the edge of Tortura, the last safe place with a vague sense of civilization. The pack is to be hired by the emissary of a local magnate hoping to find a cure for his terminal disease. The cure is supposedly in the Monastery,  a place where even the bravest looters don\u2019t dare to venture. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1163020/extras/Slither-gif.gif?t=1733768721\" /><br><br>While making his way through Tortura, the protagonist is attacked and critically wounded by a strange creature. With no signs of life, his pack leaves him, presuming him dead. After some time, the protagonist wakes up fully healed, alone in seclusion. Abandoned and with no other choice, he decides to continue his way to the monastery, hoping to find his friends. While exploring the forest, meeting potentially dangerous strangers, looting everything in sight, and fighting ruthless creatures, the protagonist gets involved in events that will uncover the tragic story of Tortura with great evil lurking in the shadows.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1163020/extras/MachinegunMine2.gif?t=1733768721\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Ranged &gt; Melee</strong></h2>The Looter is all about bringing a gun to a mutant fight. Focused on using firearms such as the handgun, shotgun, and assault rifle you will learn to dispatch all enemies with ease aiming at 360 angles before they get too close. And if they do? Trusty fire axe and a variety of equipment such as frag grenades, flashbangs, and landmines should do the trick.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Secret Gardens</strong></h2>Tortura is full of secrets and hidden places and investigating them is rewarded. You will often have to be cunning, perceptive, and curious to uncover every secret that this world keeps from you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Mood Boards</strong></h2>Tortura is an empty, somber place and you will have a chance to explore this strange yet familiar setting. Get ready to visit dilapidated buildings, deserted bunkers, empty bases while all the time on the lookout for more loot and deadly creatures that are always dangerously close.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Get Crafty</strong></h2>While gathering loot, players can also acquire materials that are used for crafting usable items. As the game progresses, the player will gain new blueprints and recipes for crafting certain items.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Loot</strong></h2>On your journey, you will encounter all sorts of artifacts from the days gone - both carrying sentimental and more practical value.
