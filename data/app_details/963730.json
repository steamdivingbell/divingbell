He just needs a break. Perhaps one good case could help him turn things around. <br><br>Then one evening, he gets a call from a Doctor Offenhauser who wants to hire him.

Quick reflexes and a strategic use of actions can help you to overcome dangerous foes. Weapons include a .38 Special gun which can be a Detective's best friend when in a tough jam. It shoots fast and deals a lot of damage, but ammo is limited so choose to use it wisely. There's also a trusty Combat-Knife used for melee attacks. Plus you'll have skills and items that can also help. <br><br>* Walls in the foreground will become solid as the Player-character moves away from them, and become translucent when nearing them to help you better explore an area. <br><br>* Fitting music and sound-effects used throughout the game. <br><br>* Some sounds (fire in the fireplace, clocks-ticking, etc...) will become louder or softer as the Player-character nears or walks away from the source. <br><br>* A dark story and a creepy manor to explore. <br><br>* A nice looking menu-system. <br><br>* Use of lighting and other cool effects.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/963730/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1674037636","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/963730/page.bg.jpg?t=1674037636","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/963730/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1674037636","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/963730/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1674037636","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/963730/extras/It_Lurks_logo_01.jpg?t=1674037636\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Synopsis:</h2> <br>Meet Nate Hendricks, a Private Detective who's a bit down on his luck. <br><br>Business has been slow and with the bills piling up Nate may have to soon close-up shop.
