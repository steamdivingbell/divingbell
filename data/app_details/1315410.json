Use an arsenal of plastic limbs, wonky tools, rainbow stickers and googly eyes to assemble creations, please demanding clients, and laugh in the face of perfectionism.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Make a thing!</h2>Glue mannequin limbs to robo-parts. Draw on a smiley face. Slap on a few stick-on tattoos to finish it off. Oh, did we mention there's <strong>NO </strong>Undo button? Time to roll with the punches!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Make a living!</h2>Fulfill wacky client requests however you can. From six-armed action figures, to fancy meals served from a toilet seat - any request is (unfortunately) possible. Explore their world and defeat your ultimate enemies: perfectionism and good taste.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fend off haters!</h2>Flying tomatoes, rabid hammers, electrifying eels... Fend off foes in time or ignore them and see what &quot;statement&quot; they leave on your precious thing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Upgrade your toolbox!</h2>Collect cash for your creations and re-invest it in supplies, tools and workshop upgrades. Expand your inventory or risk ending up making yet another armless Venus de Thingy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Couch Collab!</h2>Test the limits of your relationships by playing any challenge in 2-player couch co-op mode.
