This is the perfect wargame for people who normally don't like wargames.\u201d<br />\r\nPC Gamer<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cBATTLE BUGS is nothing if not an enjoyable game to play. The manual and graphic elements of the game are uniformly hilarious, from the radar display running on a \u2018No Entiendo Lame Boy\u2019 to gruff spiders whirling into battle in a Tasmanian-devil-like tornado. BATTLE BUGS manages to achieve that rare fusion, a meaningful tactical game which is funny as well as fun to play. No one will lose their job or spouse to an overdose of BATTLE BUGS playing, but plenty of gamers will have many enjoyable evenings of conquering cheese wedges and slaughtering spiders.\u201d<br />\r\nComputer Gaming World<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201c\u2018Battle Bugs\u2019 delights with sounds and images.
