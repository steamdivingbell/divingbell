Trapped aboard the voidship TRH Rusanov, Samuel Edwards must evade, fight and kill his former crew-mates as an outbreak transforms them into monsters. There's only one way out and an entire ship to cross. Danger lurks around every corner and time is running out. Explore the depths of the Rusanov, pull whatever resources you can out of its guts, and run.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1116390/extras/TreatTheInfectionNeAt.gif?t=1674771557\" /><br>As Chief Medical Officer of the Rusanov, Edwards has a confident, in-depth understanding of medicinal drugs. Routine medication can be repurposed for more creative ideas, or transformed into something more extreme. Whether attempting to save the injured, influence enemies or alter himself, Samuel's medical knowledge will be key to his survival.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1116390/extras/EveryChoiceMattersNeAt.gif?t=1674771557\" /><br>Edwards has beliefs, past experiences and coping mechanisms that players will learn throughout Negative Atmosphere. This means that morality is not just about what you want as a player, as every decision will have an effect on Edwards.
