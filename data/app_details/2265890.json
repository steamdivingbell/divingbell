{"about_the_game":"<strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Raid on Taihoku Art Book Collection</h2></strong><br><br>The art book collection illustrates plenty of development designs of Raid on Taihoku behind the scenes, including main and supporting characters, scenes and props in the game, as well as many delicate art sketches. <br><br>We hope that by reading the book, the players can understand the world view of this game better, and also the core concept of its art design. Our art design group vividly reconstructed Taipei City under Japanese colonial rule with 3D fine art, striking a balance between the historical facts and the visual satisfaction. We will bring you back to Taiwan during the war in 1945, granting you a realistic experience of evading the raid and facing the cruelty of warfare. Sincerely, we dedicate Raid on Taihoku to those players who are touched by the game, and also to those who passionately love our island, Taiwan. <br><br><strong>Contents</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Prologue<br></li><li>Origin<br></li><li>Character Design<br></li><li>Scene Design<br></li><li>Memory<br></li><li>Music<br></li><li>Acknowledgement</li></ul><br>Please read this art book collection after playing the game, or it will influence the playing experience.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2265890/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1676961826","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2265890/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1676961826","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2265890/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1676961826","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2265890/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1676961826","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Some parts of this game may be considered violence or cruel.\r\nThis game contains scenes of explicit violence and gore.\r\nNot appropriate for people with heart diseases."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Raid on Taihoku Art Book Collection</h2></strong><br><br>The art book collection illustrates plenty of development designs of Raid on Taihoku behind the scenes, including main and supporting characters, scenes and props in the game, as well as many delicate art sketches. <br><br>We hope that by reading the book, the players can understand the world view of this game better, and also the core concept of its art design.
