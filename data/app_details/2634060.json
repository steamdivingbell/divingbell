{"about_the_game":"&quot; <br>  <br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Pathfinder(R) for Savage Worlds: Guide to Korvosa</h2>   The city-state of Korvosa, largest in all Varisia, has prospered over the last century since its abandonment by its founding nation of Cheliax. Its port brims with black-and-red-flagged ships--the colors of both Korvosa and Cheliax--endlessly trading fineries from the south for Varisian curiosities and her land's natural bounty. As such, Korvosa rightfully claims to be the most cultured and civilized city in the region, yet visitors might also grant the city-state the titles of most decadent, exploitative, and socially stratified. <br>  Adapted from this 64-page book serves as an exhaustive guide to the city, including details on all major points of interest, profiles on the city's movers and shakers, and countless adventure hooks for enterprising GMs to expand upon. It also includes a full-color poster map of Korvosa. While designed for use with the Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path, this information-packed supplement is useable in any fantasy RPG campaign.  <br> &quot;","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2634060/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1699476247","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2634060/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1699476247","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2634060/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1699476247","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2634060/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1699476247","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot; <br>  <br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Pathfinder(R) for Savage Worlds: Guide to Korvosa</h2>   The city-state of Korvosa, largest in all Varisia, has prospered over the last century since its abandonment by its founding nation of Cheliax.
