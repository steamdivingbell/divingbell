Your mission is to work together to complete the trials of the Lord God while dodging the deadly threats that lurk in the darkness.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Random Trials: Each game generates a different Trial, whether it's solving a puzzle, finding a key item, activating a device, or escaping a terrifying looming monster. Every time you enter the game, it's a new experience!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Character Skills: Choose one of four unique characters, each with unique skills to help your team tackle different challenges.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Voice interaction: Communicate with teammates via close voice chat to strategize and share clues, but be careful - some monsters can hear you, and any word you say can lead to a deadly pursuit.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Teamwork: During trials, teammates may be caught by monsters or put in danger, and you'll need to be brave enough to rescue them. Remember, you can only survive if you stick together!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Terrifying atmosphere: Immersive, dark environments and creepy sound effects will keep you on edge, and every footfoot, every whisper, can mean that danger is approaching.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0 \u00a0This is my first time making a game, and I am likely to encounter bugs in the game, if you encounter bugs or you think it can be improved or unreasonable, I hope you can send me a private message on twitter, if you have any good ideas, you can also send me a private message, I will put your ideas into my game.</p>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3470450?t=1739848492","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3470450?t=1739848492","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3470450/467be6f54eda6ef03e2b19c6c34aa28102e7478b/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739848492","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3470450/467be6f54eda6ef03e2b19c6c34aa28102e7478b/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739848492","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0In this game, you and your friends will be drawn into a deadly game designed by the main god.
