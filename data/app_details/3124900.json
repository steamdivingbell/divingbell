{"about_the_game":"Infiniwar is a real-time tactics game designed from the ground-up to be infinitely replayable. Each battle takes place on a uniquely generated map with a variety of objectives, win conditions, and non-binary outcomes. Enemy forces are led by powerful elite and ace units with unique abilities. You customize your forces with the same freedom as an RPG character, unlocking and selecting the units, abilities, and upgrades to best to complete each mission. Every battle is part of larger operations within a roguelike-inspired campaign, offering an endless variety of strategic choices, tradeoffs, and build-making decisions. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3124900/extras/Battle.gif?t=1725311778\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3124900/extras/Header_In_Development.png?t=1725311778\" /><br><br>Infiniwar is a passion project under active development by a part-time solo developer.
