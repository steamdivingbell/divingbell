{"about_the_game":"Custom Goban is a reinterpretation of the game of Go (also known as Weiqi or Baduk, Go is a classic Asian intellectual board game that rivals chess in terms of strategic thinking and planning complexity, yet its rules are easy to learn). While playing on a classic 19x19 Go board is still exciting for many players, Custom Goban offers the opportunity to create your own territory and divide it playing by traditional Go rules. This is not only fun but also brings more creativity to the game and requires players to think in a new way. To shorten the game time, you can create new boards that are smaller than the traditional 361-point game, and it will not be &quot;another smaller square board.&quot; Whether you are an experienced Go player or just starting out, you'll love it!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FEATURES</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> create your shape of the board: make holes, irregularities<br></li><li> play PvP with other users on our server publicly<br></li><li> play with your friends peer-to-peer or on the same device<br></li><li> fight against the KataGo AI on square boards<br></li><li> connect to the OGS (Online Go Server) to play on square boards<br></li><li> use minimalistic, well-designed UI<br></li><li> play cross-platform: on iOS, Android (in development)</li></ul>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2223570?t=1740318388","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2223570/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1740318388","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2223570/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1740318388","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2223570/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1740318388","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2456380,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Custom Goban is a reinterpretation of the game of Go (also known as Weiqi or Baduk, Go is a classic Asian intellectual board game that rivals chess in terms of strategic thinking and planning complexity, yet its rules are easy to learn).
