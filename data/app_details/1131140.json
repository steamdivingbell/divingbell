{"about_the_game":"Money! If you don't have it, you want it. If you do have it, you want it even more. However, don\u2019t think you can stack it in a safe until you\u2019re able to dive right into it and take a swim. Regardless of the broken bones, money that just sits around is useless money. There is one golden rule: invest! Grow your wealth! Be the fastest, the smartest, the happiest and the most beautiful out of all the elites. Go on a journey across Europe and try to make the most out of it. But be careful. Money attracts envy, burglars and thieves, especially Sir Clepton. To stay at the top, you must always be one step ahead of him and your competitors.
