Fred only ever wanted to get to the finish without falling down. But there is one problem - he is VERY clumsy when it comes to running fast, even the slightest obstacle can make him trip and fall down. Poor guy! Will you help Fred out?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou have a time limit to get to the finish. Be careful of the obstacles, because collision drains your health and, more importantly, costs you time if you fall. If you do not make it in time you have to restart the level.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGo trough each checkpoint, avoiding obstacles, until you reach the finish within the time limit. Upon reaching the finish line you will unlock a new level of the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n*This is a demo version.
