{"about_the_game":"Strap into a souped up farm tractor with an added rocket engine and a huge flipper on the front, engage in a game of super sized football and hunt your opponents with a huge array of dirty tricks. The fast paced action of Tractorball will leave you breathless with endless game changing play variations and test your reactions to the limit, fusing vehicular ball games with a VR cockpit experience. Use shooting skills with the flipper, develop your teamwork and get creative with any of the numerous dirty tricks to sabotage your opponents' play or find a cheap shot on goal. Designed exclusively for VR from the cockpit out, the game will find new ways of challenging your eye-hand coordination and spatial orientation skills.<br><br>Tractorball is a physics based sports-action game and features four course layouts in five game worlds for a total of twenty levels, offering co-op and 2v2 multiplayer as well as unlockable single player leagues and tournaments. The XP based progression system starts you off easy in the minor leagues, but there is plenty of scope for more experienced players to hone their skills against the advanced AI in epic battles for the trophy. There is also a fully customizable single player mode that lets you select what kind of league or knockout tournament you want, the number of opposing teams, number of playoff rounds, difficulty and more.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fully controllable tractors with front flippers<br></li><li>Season mode for a full single player experience<br></li><li>Twenty leagues and tournaments to unlock<br></li><li>XP based progression system<br></li><li>Rocket boost<br></li><li>Twenty unique dirty trick power-ups<br></li><li>Custom leagues and tournaments<br></li><li>Five main arenas with four different setups, for a total of twenty levels<br></li><li>Exhibition mode<br></li><li>Training mode<br></li><li>Multiplayer matches 2v2<br></li><li>Co-op multiplayer (play on the same team as a friend)</li></ul><br>The demo is restricted to Exhibition mode on one course, Training and Tutorial level.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/735400/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1572340140","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/735400/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1572340140","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/735400/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1572340140","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/735400/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1572340140","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Strap into a souped up farm tractor with an added rocket engine and a huge flipper on the front, engage in a game of super sized football and hunt your opponents with a huge array of dirty tricks.
