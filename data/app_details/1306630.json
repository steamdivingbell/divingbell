{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1306630/extras/StorePage_Story_Image.png?t=1699433832\" /><br><br>A young girl wakes up in a dimly lit dungeon without any of her memories. Surrounded by horrible, bloodthirsty monsters, she is rescued by a mysterious magician, Beatrice. With Beatrice\u2019s help, the girl goes on a perilous journey to find answers and unlock the secrets of the Lost Ruins.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1306630/extras/StorePage_Gameplay_Image.png?t=1699433832\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Engage in Combat</h2>Combat in Lost Ruins is both strategic and methodical. Slash away at enemies, burn them to a crisp, or even deflect their projectiles back at them. Arm yourself with a variety of swords, axes and other assorted medieval weaponry, and hack monsters to pieces.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Master Spells</h2>For those with an affinity for magic, Lost Ruins allows you to cast a variety of spells through wands, tonics, and scrolls. Burn monsters, freeze bosses, and heal yourself when in danger. Choose what works for your playstyle and make a magic casting character that\u2019s totally your own.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Choose Your Accessories</h2>The world of Lost Ruins is a dangerous one and being armed to the teeth with awesome weaponry is sometimes not enough. That\u2019s where accessories come in. Accessories are unique pieces of equipment with all manner of effects. One accessory might protect you against fire, while another might heal you when you\u2019re poisoned. The right combination of accessories can create different strategic options for your adventure.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Make Use of the Environment</h2>As you explore the depths of Lost Ruin\u2019s dimly lit dungeons, you will find that while everything around you might bring about your death, you can also use the environment around you to your advantage. Elements within the world will react with other elements realistically. Flammable liquids will be set ablaze when in contact with lit lanterns. Ice magic will freeze bodies of water, making them dangerously cold. The more you understand the environment and how to use it to your advantage, the more dangerous you will become.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1306630/extras/StorePage_Characters_Image.png?t=1699433832\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Main Character</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1306630/extras/PlayerStandIdle2x.gif?t=1699433832\" /> <br>A young school girl who wakes up in a dangerous underground maze with no memory of her past.
