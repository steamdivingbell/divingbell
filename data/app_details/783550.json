{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Fight for your life in Obscurity: Unknown Threat. A sandbox shooter environment where immersive gunplay, gore mechanics and player skill dictate the outcome of a battle.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As an indie title, this game is under active development and has not yet reached release state. Join now to participate and help shape the growth of the game as we realise our vision.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Survive The Obscurity</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/783550/extras/obs.jpg?t=1735825756\" />The Obscurity are relentless, nimble and stealthy with access to various unique technologies to help them get the upper hand against their enemies. They are melee experts with many different stances and abilities, but they can also turn the tide of battle by using their enemies against each other.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Full Loadout Customisation</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/783550/extras/customisation.jpg?t=1735825756\" />Both preset and custom loadouts are available to players, enabling them to make extremely unique soldier builds. Players have access to traits, skills, weapon customisation, gadgets, melee weapons, camo and more. Outfits and headgear also provide unique bonuses. Be mindful though, because loadout weight class plays a major role in gameplay. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gore!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/783550/extras/goresystem.jpg?t=1735825756\" />A fully featured gore system has been created from the ground up to include support for broken bones, dismemberment, wound deformation, and procedurally generated gibs and limb caps. Major wounds and breaks are survivable, but you may not be very effective with a few limbs missing.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Brutal Melee Combat</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/783550/extras/brutalmelee.jpg?t=1735825756\" />Get up close and personal with your foes by bringing some melee weapons to the fight. Blunt, stab, sharp and push melee damage can all be used to bring an end to your enemies if you run out of bullets or feel like getting messy.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">In-Depth Health &amp; Healing system</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/783550/extras/healingsystem.jpg?t=1735825756\" />An in-depth health system has been created so that players can heal both themselves and other friendlies (or enemies) effectively and efficiently provided their loadout is built around healing and support. Healing includes various stages, so that players do not have to commit to healing everything at once. Don't want to worry about healing as much? Hardcore and casual have their own fully realised health systems in place.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dynamic Time &amp; Weather System</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/783550/extras/timeofday.jpg?t=1735825756\" />Each map features a dynamic time of day and weather system. Weather includes fog, rain, storms, overcast and more. Battle can take place from dusk through to dawn, just be prepared when night time hits.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Synchronised Ragdoll &amp; Launching System</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/783550/extras/ragdoll_launches.jpg?t=1735825756\" />The game includes synchronised ragdoll positions to enable characters to be launched by explosions, impacts, falls etc and then get up and continue on with the battle.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Classic Game Modes</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/783550/extras/pvp.jpg?t=1735825756\" />Many classic shooter game modes are available to play in both casual and hardcore. Players are provided with access to asymmetrical and symmetrical game mode options, that can be voted on and chosen at the conclusion of each match.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Progression &amp; Challenge System</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/783550/extras/progression2.jpg?t=1735825756\" />The game features a progressive unlock and challenge system that is tracked as you play through various different class types.
