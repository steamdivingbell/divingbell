Then, all hell breaks loose! Cannon balls fly, stone walls crumble, and your knight takes to the turf, slashing his sword. Once you\u2019ve destroyed your opponent\u2019s base and K.O. the king or queen inside, you win the round. You need three K.O.s to win the match. After each round you can rebuild your castle.<br><br><strong>Story:</strong><br>Play through several levels and defeat enemies as you expand your arsenal. This game mode is singleplayer or co-op. You will start your adventure in Braal Kingdom and travel through other kingdoms as you gain cupcakes after each level to unlock new worlds. It features a cute story with immersive cinematic cutscenes.<br><br><strong>Arcade:</strong><br>Defend your castle against waves of enemies singleplayer or in co-op with your best friends. Compare how you are doing with the rest of the world on our glorious leaderboards. The enemies will drop gold as you defeat them.
