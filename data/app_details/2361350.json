{"about_the_game":"In Hero World, you embark on an exciting adventure to help Tom rescue his sister Lisa. She has been abducted by an unknown force, and now it is up to Tom to free her from the clutches of the unknown. Tom must prove himself in various levels. He must overcome easy and difficult obstacles to get closer to his sister. As Tom gets closer to his sister, the challenges become increasingly demanding. The journey will not be easy, but with patience and calmness, Tom can save his sister Lisa and be celebrated as a hero.<br><br><br><u>Character Description:</u><br><br>In Hero World, you have the freedom to choose which character you want to play with. However, some heroes are locked at the beginning of the game and need to be unlocked. You can purchase them by collecting enough coins, or if you complete the story, you can unlock three additional characters. It is therefore possible to have more heroes available after completing the main story.<br><br><br>Level Description:<br><br>In every level of the game, three stars must be collected to successfully complete it. If you don't collect all three stars, you have to repeat the level. Additionally, you can find coins in every level. These coins can be used not only to unlock new characters, but also to refill your lives (attempts/respawns) in the shop. Lives are crucial to progress in the game. If you have used up all your lives (attempts/respawns), you cannot restart the current level. Instead, you start at a checkpoint that is located every tenth level. If you have used up all your attempts, you cannot start in the current level anymore, but will be reset to the previous checkpoint. To continue, you have to repeat all previous levels until you get back to the level where you previously failed. To avoid this, the shops are placed every 5 levels between checkpoints. There you can refresh your lives (attempts/respawns) to progress in the game.<br><br><br><u>Game Modes:</u><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Tutorial Mode<br></li><li>Story Mode<br></li><li>Challenge Mode</li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"RIP","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2361350/2935b614f10808bc55980079fad4e099e950dacb.jpg"},{"name":"The Adventure Begins","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2361350/7a93839c7d1d050e03619c02fd00b8617bcd67c9.jpg"},{"name":" Save Save Save","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2361350/03534f69eb2fc77e0dbea5be4989a301aa8d789c.jpg"},{"name":"My First Purchase","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2361350/77b1a1c8d959428e3c145f489c8183e6ef77fd2d.jpg"},{"name":"You Saved Her","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2361350/31add78d323b394a38cfa48ee2298b6415d50c10.jpg"},{"name":"Unlocked","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2361350/46fb0b4fc5829a7a2b4cb8258b089e9c8c1de06e.jpg"},{"name":"Welcome to Hero World","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2361350/33e9af8edf83b97b1f413abdc8e1c3bb53e275a9.jpg"},{"name":"The Adventure Begins","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2361350/a0c7de3a0c65d09bc71373baf4dbbe76ca86c70e.jpg"},{"name":"The Adventure Will Not Be Easy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2361350/a0c7de3a0c65d09bc71373baf4dbbe76ca86c70e.jpg"},{"name":"Half The Adventure Is Already Done","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2361350/a0c7de3a0c65d09bc71373baf4dbbe76ca86c70e.jpg"}],"total":16},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2361350?t=1723652527","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2361350?t=1723652527","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2361350/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1723652527","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2361350/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1723652527","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In Hero World, you embark on an exciting adventure to help Tom rescue his sister Lisa.
