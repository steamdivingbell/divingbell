{"about_the_game":"What if a powerful wizard wanted to build a zoo for all kinds of different fantasy animals? In Fantasy Zoo you can build your own zoo for many unique creatures. Instead of normal animals like elephants or lions fill your zoo with monsters like dragons and griffins.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Animals</h2>Keep your animals happy by building good enclosures for them and offer them food and shelter. <br><br>Some animals are dangerous, you need to make their enclosures strong enough. Prevent escape by building strong walls or blocking their access to weak walls with barricades or other objects, use magic to keep flying animals at ground. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1951060/extras/Animals.png?t=1725364795\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Spells</h2><br>Use thematic tools to manage and build the zoo.

Keep your guests happy for gold income. Choose from different workers and think about costs before getting new animals.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mayhem</h2><br>Simple combat mechanic makes the escaping animals dangerous. Stop escaping animals with spells and the zoo staff, or let them rampage and enjoy the mayhem. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1951060/extras/Mayhem.gif?t=1725364795\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Current content and features.</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>17 animals<br></li><li>5 different environments.<br></li><li>Freeform gameplay with different starting money and map size.<br></li><li>Basic researchtree for progression mode.<br></li><li>Simple combat mechanic for escaped animals<br></li><li>Flying and petrifying animals<br></li><li>Multiple pylons for magical effects</li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Learning to play","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1951060/7366658f13fe903d11a1dd805ebe872469914085.jpg"},{"name":"First Animal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1951060/e8a8721ac1c9e587dc4eb6e0af0cb88b07e05773.jpg"},{"name":"Little Diversity","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1951060/98a7be896a117715b2bc624df2e7950c3906fa4a.jpg"},{"name":"Diversity","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1951060/e8edc6cfbfc87e9155d6c02b71c400a2050d4664.jpg"},{"name":"High Diversity","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1951060/1385e75cafd4dff4c8bb51bdce6b378283f8e8f7.jpg"},{"name":"Explorer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1951060/190c6ee7547bf78355fbafd718baa2c5b5d57e28.jpg"},{"name":"PANIC!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1951060/2254f6b09ed457420bbca6ee3f34718eaacf4d05.jpg"},{"name":"Learning the Arcane","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1951060/be59d4345b6ea99d8c315f0dd8d9b90d0750dadd.jpg"},{"name":"Arcane Mastery","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1951060/af4a3470aa4d21a139aea2a4c056b8fc1bc34f39.jpg"},{"name":"Taking up the Challenge","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1951060/05a97f545e064cff8fbc0dead80d73fc4cfa1b5a.jpg"}],"total":18},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1951060/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725364795","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1951060/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1725364795","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1951060/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725364795","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1951060/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725364795","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":1951080,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"What if a powerful wizard wanted to build a zoo for all kinds of different fantasy animals?
