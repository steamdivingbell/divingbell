Allowing you to gain a great deal of speed on flatter surfaces, the bike makes it faster and easier to discover more safe houses and secrets that the world holds, while also providing a means of gaining distance between you and any machines that might spot you along the way. To get your very own bike, all you need to do is to find a vehicle station at your local safe house.
