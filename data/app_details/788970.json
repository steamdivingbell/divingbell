I am always on the lookout for Hidden Object games. Crisp App Studios has become one of my favourite developers in this genre. In their latest game, Captain Nemo, the standard is as sharp as it can be in regards to the hidden objects. The objects are well blended into each of the scenes with over 50 per level. Bear in mind, you have to find around 15 items per level on each of your walkthroughs, which will give you good re-playability.  In this game, Crisp App Studios introduces the 360 degree panoramic levels, which are great fun.\u201d<br>zeepond<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/788970/ss_6a41ef8c81e7f2bc95a73a461d6e5519463ac14f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667640396","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/788970/ss_6a41ef8c81e7f2bc95a73a461d6e5519463ac14f.600x338.jpg?t=1667640396"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/788970/ss_4e0885aca310b49c63f0cc75dd49f3dbc716ee29.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667640396","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/788970/ss_4e0885aca310b49c63f0cc75dd49f3dbc716ee29.600x338.jpg?t=1667640396"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/788970/ss_8af53e951fb323d4687d68778444b6bf96a26af4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667640396","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/788970/ss_8af53e951fb323d4687d68778444b6bf96a26af4.600x338.jpg?t=1667640396"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/788970/ss_0e5ef1ad2ed0742e9fedab056993b19309dc09ff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667640396","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/788970/ss_0e5ef1ad2ed0742e9fedab056993b19309dc09ff.600x338.jpg?t=1667640396"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/788970/ss_03b593732defe207d5cbfca5e055a0f87c43fbb2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1667640396","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/788970/ss_03b593732defe207d5cbfca5e055a0f87c43fbb2.600x338.jpg?t=1667640396"}],"short_description":"Accept Captain Nemo's challenge and complete 20,000 leagues under the sea!
