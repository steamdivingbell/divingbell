He stores up to several missiles to be fired at once and is able to place a rotating laser trap that deals massive damage to anyone unable to escape.

Known for his explosive temper he fought bravely among the Scargi until he actually lost his head while furiously cleaning his rocket launcher during the siege on the arachnid planet Smertzspin. Rocket being a Galspitter, known for their cursing and vulgar language, was given an advanced head prosthetic with profanity filter. But more importantly, he was promoted to Commander of the security detail of the Scarg emperor Pierre Feu Darret AKA \u201cUnstoppable Pierre\u201d. Rehabilitating in the royal court the commander found a new team of misfits to command, who he would train to become the Rocket Renegades.<br><br>That changed in 3584, as that is when disaster struck. The team of four crack military court members was sent to prison by the Scarg Emperor for the audacious crime of planning to salt his dinner. A highly deadly substance for the sensitive snail like Scargos. The renegades were thought to be planning an assassination when they were actually just being caught eating fries they had salted with the salty seals they illegally had been hiding in their quarters.<br><br>During a shift of the guards, the team quickly outsmarted the slow Scarg prison guards and Rocket told them to go \u201cZork\u201d themselves.
