{"about_the_game":"In the 24th century, the last amusement park closed its doors in bankruptcy. Since then, scientists have developed a new technology allowing users to project themselves into an augmented reality; a universe in which their clientele can find TRUE excitement. Welcome to Heavenworld, the virtual zombie RPG amusement park!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Full game creator:</strong></h2>Personalize your gaming experience with over 80 options. The difficulty, your missions, the conditions of survival, your skills, Zombies, Allied and enemy factions, the game master; There is always a new playthrough ready to go. Customize and save your game preferences in one click thanks to a complex story editor that adapts the game to your liking. Create your own trades and companions with a powerful editor. Game customization is unlimited and each playthrough is unique.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Role play, survival and management:</strong></h2>Heavenworld offers a complete skill system to customize your character. Each skill influences your playthrough experience (Combat / Crafting / Negotiations /Construction / Survival/ etc.). Manage your inventory and survival needs such as food, hunger and health. You will also have to hold infection at bay before the zombie virus can take you or your companions. Manage and protect your camp by constructing buildings, using and maintaining your vehicles, and crafting supplies. Recruit your own members and barter with other factions (if they\u2019re willing). Complete quests, manage resources, join a faction or even create your own; the possibilities are endless!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Dynamic game master:</strong></h2>Each game is managed by an AI game master. Each game master has their own personality and ideas of how to manage your game. They control many elements and random events in order to change the difficulty and adapt the game as they see fit. Some are nice, others want to watch you suffer. The personality of the gamemaster will weigh heavily on your journey through Heavenworld.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Factions:</strong></h2>Zombies are not the only threat. Many factions are present in this simulation. Each faction organizes themselves independently, manages their own camp, and competes for resources. Your reputation with the factions will heavily influence their interactions with you. From becoming a faction leader to full out faction WAR, how you conduct yourself will have a big influence on your playthrough.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>NPC 100% dynamic and autonomous:</strong></h2>All NPC survivors are managed by the AI and behave fully autonomously. They organize themselves in groups, seek out undiscovered resources, craft buildings and resources, and serve their own health and nutritional needs. Each NPC is unique and has their own skills, weaknesses, and weapon preferences.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Custom gameplay:</strong></h2>Play with the joystick or mouse / keyboard and alternate between the 1st and 3rd person views. Activate the aiming aid for less experienced players. Sneaking, jumping and climbing over obstacles can mean the difference between life and death.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Unique adventures:</strong></h2>Play as a lawless solitary wolf, create strong alliances with other factions, build a fortified camp, protect your faction members from hordes of zombies, participate in large scale wars, defeat epic enemy Gods; The list goes on. YOU choose the game type you want to play.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Map editor:</strong></h2>Create your own maps with an extremely powerful and easy-to-use editor. Test and export your creations in-game. Share your maps with your friends and the community through steam Workshop.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Steam Workshop</strong></h2>Get the most out of Heavenworld with Steam Workshop. Find and install player-created maps, stories, jobs, companions or create your own and upload it directly to Steam.
