Once you have found all the memory shards you are free to explore the next area.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story mode:</h2>You start in the middle of the ocean, underwater.<br><br>You are a little bird-shaped spirit that moves continuously forward and is free to fly wherever you want. <br><br>After you have played around a little and enjoyed the sensation of flying you start to discover the nearby areas and hidden secrets. You fly towards a giant underwater flower with many decorations. <br><br>Once you come closer you see a bright shining memory shard right in front of you. <br><br>The memory shards are hidden all over the different worlds and contain memories and information about the different worlds and the path into the next area.
