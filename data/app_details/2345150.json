{"about_the_game":"Discarded Empire is a run based action platforming game in a deckbuilding mech. Pay off generational debt by diving deep into an ancient ring station at the Sol Site in search of valuable remnant technology.  Maneuver your mech, down endless shafts full of deadly traps and vile creatures drawn to this ruined station. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n If you want to make a dent in your family's significant debt, you'll need to build and manage the deck installed in your mech. Each deck starts with a number of repurposed entertainment cartridges.  When one of these carts is drawn and activated it may have a number of effects.  Some carts give you credits to buy more carts between stages.  Other carts might give you additional shields, change your weapon, or even change the stage you are falling through.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2345150/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1694628325","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2345150/page.bg.jpg?t=1694628325","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2345150/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1694628325","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2345150/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1694628325","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Discarded Empire is a run based action platforming game in a deckbuilding mech.
