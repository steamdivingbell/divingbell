{"about_the_game":"Prepare to embark on an interstellar adventure like no other in Cosmic Cowabunnies. Step into the shoes of an extraterrestrial legend, known throughout the cosmos as the enigmatic Grey Alien from the binary star system Zeta Reticuli. Your aviator callsign? &quot;Sauce.&quot; And you're piloting a stealthy UFO on a mission of utmost importance: preventing UFO disclosure to the human race before time runs out. Failure is not an option, as the very existence of aliens hangs in the balance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour journey begins with a legacy of extensive military training and an astonishing 3000 years of dedicated combat service, all leading up to this pivotal moment. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to traverse the Milky Way and conceal all evidence of alien presence from humanity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a mission that demands the highest level of top-secret clearance, and it encompasses a range of activities that will test your mettle and cunning. From clandestine cattle mutilations to daring human abductions, from high-stakes alien rescues, including the enigmatic 747 abductions, to the retrieval of crashed UFOs, your skillset will be put to the ultimate test. In the midst of it all, you'll even find yourself mining for precious gold, clearing enigmatic crop circles, and perhaps even offering a prayer to the Mantis for guidance on this extraordinary journey!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut that's not all \u2013 you'll embark on a journey to reactivate lost alien technologies at some of Earth's most mysterious and iconic locations. Commence with the enigmatic Stonehenge, steer clear of the enigma that is Area 51, delve into the secrets concealed within the Great Pyramid of Giza, find respite within the enigmatic Bermuda Triangle, unveil the mysteries held by the Moai Statues of Easter Island, witness the awe-inspiring Nazca Lines from an elevated perspective, and explore the wonders of Chich\u00e9n-Itz\u00e1.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrepare to face formidable adversaries, including the F22 fighter jets, the ever-watchful Big Ear Radio Telescope, the imposing USS Nimitz Aircraft Carrier, the stealthy USS Ohio Nuclear Submarine, the relentless Army Apache Helicopter, the formidable B2 Stealth Bomber soaring through the skies, and the looming specter of Nuclear Radioactive Waste.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you take control of your UFO, you'll find the controls are simple yet effective. Maneuver with precision using the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right), and when it's time to regroup or strategize, press the escape key to exit the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter each exhilarating mission or, inevitably, each heroic demise, you'll have the opportunity to gauge your skills on the bounty hunter leaderboard. Compete against fellow cosmic operatives from across the Universe and see where your prowess ranks in the grand scheme of things.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAre you ready to take on the mantle of &quot;Sauce&quot; and prevent the ultimate disclosure? The fate of intergalactic secrets rests in your hands. Suit up, pilot your UFO, and embark on the adventure of a lifetime in Cosmic Cowabunnies.
