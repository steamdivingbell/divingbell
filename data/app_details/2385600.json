{"about_the_game":"<strong>SLYME BREAKER</strong> is the RPG that hates the genre. Inspired by the early Paper Mario titles and the Shin Megami Tensei series SLYME BREAKER has a core focus on proactive, aggressive combat, deep and involved exploration and meaningful deconstruction of RPG standards. Play as the bandit Gryme after his attempted attack on a lowly Slyme monster for some XP goes wrong and he is devoured by the Slyme!<br><br><strong>BREAK the rules!</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>No party members? No problem! Who needs friends when the action economy is a free market! </li><li> Be proactive on both offense and defense using action commands to block, parry, and even strike back on enemy turns! </li><li>Dealing damage to enemies will eventually STUN them! Denying them their turn and making them vulnerable for more pummeling! </li><li>Strike a stunned enemy or defeat an enemy to claim a BREAKER! Enemies will be so stunned by your display of brutality that you'll get to take an extra turn right then and there! </li><li>Don't think that combat will be a cakewalk though. Whenever an enemy is defeated they'll be absorbed by one of their allies, so the last enemy standing will be just as tough as the group of 6 that you picked a fight with! </li></ul><br><strong>BREAK your limits!</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Since all of the monsters you fight are just constructs within the Slyme, none of them award XP upon defeat! They'll give you cold soft cash, but if you want to spend that on permanent upgrades you'll need to go exploring and find the items for those upgrades out in the world first! </li><li>The world inside the Slyme has secrets around every corner and shortcuts between every area, as long as you can find them!</li></ul><br><strong>BREAK Expectations!</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>SLYME BREAKER doesn't include anything just because other RPGs have done it. Every element of SLYME BREAKER is included because it improves the experience. </li><li>No Need to worry about getting beaten by a random critical hit when random critical hits aren't in the game! </li><li>Don't need to worry about grinding for levels when you can't! </li><li>Tired of running into random encounters? Not in SLYME BREAKER. </li><li>In fact, there's barely any RNG at all! </li><li>You're no chosen one, and certainly no hero.
