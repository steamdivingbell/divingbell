{"about_the_game":"Monument village is a peaceful turn-based medieval city-builder.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>Start on a pristine island, and grow your village, building by building. You can build exactly one building per turn. At the end of each turn, all your buildings produce some resources.<br><strong>The focus of the game is on building placement</strong>. Each building has bonuses and penalties depending on its neighbors, so take your time to choose where to place them and plan ahead.<br><br>As your village produces resources, you will gain knowledge and discover new innovations. Each one gives you a choice of bonuses and/or new buildings to unlock. You cannot get everything, so each playthrough will be different.<br><br>Every now and then, you will receive a request for some resources to be delivered. You have to do it, but you will have some time to adapt and prepare.<br><br>Finally, when your village and your economy has grown enough, you will be able to build your dream monument. Four monuments are available to choose from, each with its unique requirements and resources.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Simple yet deep building placement system</strong>: find the right place for each building to optimize its production and that of its neighbors, present and future<br></li><li> <strong>Innovation system with many choices</strong>: choose unlocked buildings and bonuses from a large pool, making each playthrough unique<br></li><li> <strong>Many game options</strong>: choose from different map types and monuments</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2>You are a talented architect, eager to prove your skills and build the grand monument which sketch has been sitting on your desk for far too long. But you need a place to build it, and land isn't cheap.<br><br><br>After many days of searching, you finally make a deal with a wealthy merchant named Tessa. She owns an island on which there is enough space for your project. You accept her conditions without much thought.<br><br>Maybe you should have read the fine prints:<br>First surprise, the island is remote and pristine. You will have to find a way to attract workers and to gather resources from the island. Guess it's time to learn how to manage a village!<br>Moreover, until the monument is finished, Tessa can request any resource from you, and you will have to comply. Fail to do so and she will kick you out of the island. The longer you take to complete your project, the more you will have to deliver.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Damn Tessa","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2553250/e9a73e68ac9ea8526d033d5de94d7657714d8305.jpg"},{"name":"The roman theater","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2553250/292957c1da999aa9227f83055fe376b272fd0dc5.jpg"},{"name":"The roman theater (normal difficulty)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2553250/78c8ec2b687e7a45e5739fe96f8a5a9181a0cd1b.jpg"},{"name":"The roman theater (hard difficulty)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2553250/f8f49c8511d565027ecae481153acbb6b16a747c.jpg"},{"name":"The library","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2553250/4d65b393a76feeb028eecee48f96c75b5e36466b.jpg"},{"name":"The library (normal difficulty)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2553250/2023e9a072e784d3ffee8aadf7165fe21544da15.jpg"},{"name":"The library (hard difficulty)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2553250/ea09adb47af8b4270799fab20aacb765c9dd81ba.jpg"},{"name":"The fortress","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2553250/4a586d1c9013857cab0ccf945ebc7423a8b1b531.jpg"},{"name":"The fortress (normal difficulty)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2553250/3f2e962c2b384176c1a5772c32cc9110e942d014.jpg"},{"name":"The fortress (hard difficulty)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2553250/67b99ebdb947d57e75e9eaaeeefc1e332ebec16d.jpg"}],"total":14},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2553250?t=1708793928","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2553250/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1708793928","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2553250/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1708793928","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2553250/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1708793928","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2623120,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Monument village is a peaceful turn-based medieval city-builder.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>Start on a pristine island, and grow your village, building by building.
