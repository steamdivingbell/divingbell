{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Jump Dash Soar</h2>...is a frenetic, fast, and fun movement-based FPS. Build incredible speed with a powerful <strong>dash</strong> mechanic combined with <strong>rocket jumping</strong>, <strong>strafe running</strong>, <strong>slope jumps</strong>, and <strong>bounce pads</strong>! But Jump Dash Soar isn't just about going fast. It's about quickly, but smoothly and precisely, directing that speed to traverse maps, solve timed puzzles, and find hard-to-reach collectibles.<br><br>Ready to test your FPS skills with some throw-back Boomer Shooter movement?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2225080/extras/ezgif-5-49b225719a.gif?t=1725376699\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Collectibles</h2>Each level is packed with collectibles. Some are a mere rocket jump away, but others are much trickier, and many might seem downright impossible to reach! Some are over 40 meters high. Some are stashed behind laser speed gates, the kind that'll give you a nasty singe if you don't meet the minimum speed. But the most challenging are locked away behind timed doors: activate the door by shooting a button, watch the countdown start, and go fast!

You can time your rocket jumps down to the millisecond, angle your rocket sprints to a tenth of a degree, and reach ridiculous heights with a slope dash jump all by using information presented clearly on the HUD. You can even check out the view rotation meter to see a real-time readout of how effective your strafe running is at building speed.<br><br><br>Even better, Jump Dash Soar has a <strong>built-in Macro editor</strong> that makes these advanced movement techniques only a key-bind away!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2225080/extras/ezgif-5-9b7280f45c.gif?t=1725376699\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Speedruns</h2>Once you've first figured out how to get all the collectibles, why not try to get them all... but really fast? Jump Dash Soar has a built-in speedrun mode! Continually improve your time by finding new routes, pickup sequences, and work-arounds. Each collectible has an &quot;intended&quot; solution, but any movement technique you can use to reach it is fair game!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Maps</h2><br>Jump Dash Soar is the work of a single developer, and includes three maps:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Sludge Factory</h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2225080/extras/LevelStoreImage-SludgeFactory.png?t=1725376699\" /><br><br>Start your Jump Dash Soar journey in the expansive and intricate Sludge Factory. Learn the basics of dashing, rocket jumping, and slope jumping, and use those skills to reach 48 total collectibles!

You'll need everything you've learned to tackle some of these!
