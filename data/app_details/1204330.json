{"about_the_game":"Hello everyone, I am a college student who just graduated in 2019. After graduation, this game has been independently developed for half a year. Procedures, planning, numerical value, conception, creativity and so on are all completed by myself. Of course, I also want to thank the art students who participated in the production of this project.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirst of all, I'd like to say sorry to you that although all the pictures of this game are hand drawn by art students one by one, there are still many shortcomings in our game pictures. What we do is a kind of Isaac dungeon game. However, because of the funds and other reasons, the pictures are far from Isaac's, which I have to admit It will be improved in the future development. However, this game is very interesting in playing methods. All the players who have played this game say that the mechanism of picking up weapons is very fun.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe core of the game is similar to Isaac, but there are many differences. In this game, players can absorb their weapons by killing the enemies (there is a maximum number of absorption), and can freely combine absorption to define their own attack mode. The combination mode is also changeable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, there are many features in this game:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1.6 roles with different abilities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2. More than 60 different monster types.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3. Various challenging boss<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4. Unique transformation play method, transformation into a variety of magical powerful role system dominating the whole picture.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n5. Summon help to fight together.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n6. Super many props.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n7.More than 1000 room layouts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n8. Various special rooms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n9.The sudden challenge<br />\r\n<br />\r\n10. Funny comics, always too tired to fight, what to do? Players can kill the enemy to collect memory fragments, and unlock the game funny comics, game play tired, just look at comics, easy moment!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe are a few young people with game dreams. If you see this game, you can try it and refund if you don't like it.<br />\r\nSincerely hope that this game can bring you a little pure game fun in your life!!!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1204330/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1669632104","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1204330/page.bg.jpg?t=1669632104","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1204330/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1669632104","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1204330/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1669632104","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Hello everyone, I am a college student who just graduated in 2019.
