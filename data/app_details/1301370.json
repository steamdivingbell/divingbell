{"about_the_game":"Pyro Fighters is a scrolling space shooter with platforming physics. You are equipped with a flamethrower you can use to propel yourself in the air by aiming downward. It is also your primary method of attacking, so don't get too distracted trying to stay airborne. The game pits you against tricky platforming and bullet-hell challenges, so be sure to bring up to four players to better prepare for the challenge ahead!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1301370/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1629424763","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1301370/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1629424763","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1301370/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1629424763","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1301370/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1629424763","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Pyro Fighters is a scrolling space shooter with platforming physics.
