{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Motion Soccer PRO</strong> offers a new way to experience football in virtual reality. Here, you don\u2019t just play a match; you feel it, create it your way, and live it in first-person, third-person, or through a tactical mixed-reality view. All in one game, with the freedom to switch between styles whenever you want.</p>  <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">  <li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Tactical View (Mixed Reality)</strong>:  <br>Imagine placing a miniature football field right in front of you, in your living room or space. Here, you decide your level of involvement in the match. Prefer to observe and let the team play on its own? Or take on the role of coach, adjusting tactics and formations? You can even move players with your hand to direct passes, runs, and shots. For a more classic approach, use the joysticks and aim with your head or controller. In this view, strategy, creativity, and interaction with your real surroundings come together for a unique experience.</p>  <br><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3137350/extras/tactico.gif?t=1737279035\" /></p></li>  <li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Third-Person View</strong>:  <br>If you\u2019re looking for something more familiar, the third-person view offers classic control of a football simulator but with the immersion of virtual reality.
