{"about_the_game":"You are Uligo the slime, the only slime that can change color. You wake up surrounded by your fellow slime. Fascinated by your ability to change color, they have an idea. You could venture through the caverns, over the volcano and beyond the waterfalls to find the old Urik, the first slime, and maybe discover the source of your fabulous power. The world of the Nine is vast and full of dangers. Will you make it through all the traps and obstacles in your journey?<br><br>In your search for Urik, you will have to explore the nine worlds, find countless stars to reform constellations and hats to customize your slime. You will have to use every resource available to navigate the world while protecting your slime core. If spikes, lava or enemies were to hit your slime core, let's just say you would have a bad time. As a slime, you can stick to walls, jump higher than people, dash, grapple to certain objects and most importantly, wear a hat better than anyone.<br><br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1971790/extras/KeyFeature_Stick.png?t=1657747977\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1971790/extras/StickToSurfaces_600x338.gif?t=1657747977\" /><br>As a slime, your stickiness allows you to use walls and even ceilings to move around.
