{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Stay on beat to attack!</h2> <strong>Beats of Betrayal</strong> combines rhythm games with action roguelike dungeon exploration. You can only attack when the soundtrack's kick and snare drums are playing. You can choose from several characters for your adventure, each with a unique skill set. Collect more skills as you progress to stay powerful enough to successfully complete boss encounters and stages. Try different builds to get as far as you can, but be careful with your choices as your skills will stay with you throughout your run.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2761340/extras/animation_1.gif?t=1732840396\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Innovative Rhythm Based Combat:</strong><br>In this game, you have to match the kick drum and snare drum on the soundtrack to launch an attack. This means you have to stay focused and maintain a steady rhythm, even in stressful situations.<br></li><li><strong>Top-Down Bullet-Hell Roguelike:</strong><br>The enemies in this game will try to end your run as quickly as possible. Dodge attacks and quickly defeat your enemies to get through as many stages as possible.<br></li><li><strong>Multiple Characters with Unique Abilities:</strong><br>Each playable character has unique stats, a unique special ability and a unique set of skills. Try out different characters and strategies to see which one suits you best.<br></li><li><strong>Skill System with Decking Mechanics:</strong><br>Depending on the character you choose, you will have a certain deck of skills available to you during your run. It is also possible to manipulate the deck between stages by swapping one of your skills for another character's.<br></li><li><strong>Procedural World Generation:</strong><br>All dungeons are generated from templates and random chance upon entry. This means that each time you enter a dungeon, the layout will change, making each visit a whole new experience.<br></li><li><strong>Striking Text-Based Graphics:</strong><br>Although the game looks like &quot;pixels&quot;, the visuals are actually based on displaying characters (such as letters or numbers) from a font sheet on a 160 x 90 grid. So all of the assets and animations were handmade to create this unique visual effect.<br></li><li><strong>Exciting Selfmade Electronic Soundtrack:</strong><br>In order for the combat system to work with the soundtrack, the music has to meet certain requirements. So all the music in the game is selfmade by us to fit the game.<br></li><li><strong>Challenging Boss Fights:</strong><br>Everyone loves a good boss fight, so naturally our game has several! We want each one to be a unique experience, so they each have their own special attack patterns and soundtracks.</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2761340/extras/taurus.png?t=1732840396\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Planned Content (No Promises)</h2>- Story-Mode with permanent upgrades and Rogue-Lite mechanics<br>- More Challenges for Rogue-Mode<br>- Permanent Upgrades<br>- Achievements<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Motivation</h2>We are a team of two developers and have been working on this title for three years.
