{"about_the_game":"The Crown of Leaves is a hybrid of non-kinetic visual novel and point-n-click adventure, that will tell you a story about mysticism, riddles, constellations, anthro, beasts and ghosts!<br><i>Three chapters are planned for release; The <strong>first chapter</strong> has already been released - and it's here! The rest of the chapters will be released as the paid DLCs.</i><br>There are only two people that work on the game (+ a programmer, composer, and animator), and none of them is professional in game development or programming. This is our very first game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Plot</h2>Roui, a resilient city dandy, a half-educated jeweler, and the author of scientific magic articles, dealt with a colossal failure and had to return to his homeland: Latori. Science isn't a thing here, and local shoddy mystical beliefs are really irritating to Roui. He dreams of returning to his old life... But how can it be possible if you have no money? <br>One day, a prosperous local baron commissioned him for a bracelet, a gift for his lovely bride. Roui, in need of the extra coin, graciously accepted the order... But not long afterward, he faced a new problem - the Mad Rook, a legendary and mysterious spirit, began to meddle in the lives of the locals, including Roui's. This spirit, an entity that plays tricks on mortals once a year, is possessed with strange magic and a dark sense of humor.<br>Despite all the story's strangeness, everyone can find something parallel to their everyday life and see themselves in one of the characters.

This is a place of old magic and new ideas, where science works together with mysticism. You can find glasses and phones, electricity and radio here, but no guns or television. The inhabitants of this world still fight with swords. The continent they live in is surrounded by the boundless ocean.
