{"about_the_game":"Find the right emotional track for your quieter cities and cutscenes with Melancholic! ayato sound create\u2019s latest music pack offers up 23 BGM tracks to fill the pensive moments in between exciting battles and rushed rescues. Give your players a chance to catch their breath and think with jazz-inspired tunes and other haunting tracks that leave out the powerful electric guitars and drums seen in so many energetic battle themes. Instead, let strings like pianos, violins, and cellos take the lead. Accordions are ready to fill a new city with their familiar trill, and pianos can add a wistful mood to the campfire when your heroes have to take a break in the middle of nowhere.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThink your fast-paced game doesn\u2019t have a spot for any of this pack\u2019s tracks? Think again! This pack doesn\u2019t only have slower and softer tunes, it also has a few tracks with darker vibes. Let the deep notes of a double bass warn your players that the alley they entered probably isn\u2019t the safest place, or have almost choir-like strings and a crackle of electronic beats play when your heroes discover a secret that should have stayed buried. Each track comes in multiple file formats, so you can add them right into your favorite engine. Let your heroes take a break while soothing piano plays or explore a city of love to the tunes of an accordion with the Melancholic music pack!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* 23 royalty free songs<br />\r\n* wav, ogg, mp3, m4a and looping ogg formats included<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTerms of Use:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* This pack is for use in RPG Maker Series or the engine of your choice.<br />\r\n* OK to be used in Commercial projects<br />\r\n* Contents can be edited<br />\r\n* OK for use in games with gore<br />\r\n* OK for use in adult-rated games","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2228651/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1681218731","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2228651/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1681218731","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2228651/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1681218731","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2228651/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1681218731","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Find the right emotional track for your quieter cities and cutscenes with Melancholic! ayato sound create\u2019s latest music pack offers up 23 BGM tracks to fill the pensive moments in between exciting battles and rushed rescues.
