Part of the inspiration for the game comes from the setting of &quot;Tianren&quot; in &quot;Gintama,&quot; and the other part comes from the remarkable imagination of foreign people. The story takes place in a fantasy world called Evilia, where peaceful indigenous people - elves and predators from outer space - lizards have fought a life-and-death battle. Fortunately, the invaders failed to defeat the indomitable struggle of the elves; unfortunately, the elves did not have enough power to completely drive out the invaders from their homeland. Players will play as a principal of an interstellar communication college, seizing a strange but rare strategic opportunity period, and striving to balance various forces and ideologies in a treacherous situation. Players can sincerely accept the guidance of the advanced civilization of lizards with open hearts; they can seek peace cautiously, growing in strength while dancing with wolves; or they can shatter this false illusion, defeat the conspiracy of lizards, and reignite the raging flames of war.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2544620/extras/gif5.gif?t=1729564848\" /><br><br>The school run by the player, the Evelia Interstellar Exchange Academy, is a highly sensitive area where various forces converge. Once the fragile balance is broken, the school will be difficult to survive no matter what the outcome is. Players need to control the four values of academics, discipline, favor of foreign races, and economy in the game and keep them within a reasonable range. For example, too low an academic value will cause the school to fail to complete basic teaching tasks, while too high an academic value will cause the Lizard People to be wary and defensive; too low a favor value will prompt the Lizard People to take hostile actions, while too high a favor value will make your fellow elves doubt your position... The game has prepared rich plots, events, and multiple endings, and looks forward to your exploration from the heart.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2544620/extras/PaLuQi.png?t=1729564848\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2544620/extras/MoYueSheng.png?t=1729564848\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2544620/extras/DaNa.png?t=1729564848\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2544620/extras/LiLiAn.png?t=1729564848\" /><br><br>Produced by Jianerdui Production Group, Distributed by LICOGAME<br><strong>\u2193QQ Li Yu Technology Release Group: 469744523    QQ Lizard Learning Group 1: 820720682 \u2193</strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2544620/extras/banner.png?t=1729564848\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2544620/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729564848","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2544620/page.bg.jpg?t=1729564848","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2544620/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729564848","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2544620/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729564848","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"Includes Source SDK","id":16},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The game is in intense development!
