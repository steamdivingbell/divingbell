Build your base up from blocks, form patterns and construct buildings to cover your needs: resource harvesting, unit spawning, influence spreading and more. Find your own path in missions that allow for various endings, from conquering the enemy, expanding your influence to conquer the map or stand your ground and don't allow the enemy to breach your defenses.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2973340/extras/Build_using_patterns.png?t=1737141311\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2973340/extras/BuildUsingPatternsGif.gif?t=1737141311\" /><br>A Byte war provides you with the ability to build your basic building block: a block.
