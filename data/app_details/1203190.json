{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Ascend to the throne of full-contact racing by breaking the rules - and everything else - on your way to victory!

Race in intense head-to-head fights on courses featuring high-speed circuits, crazy courses with obstacles &amp; jumps, intersections and oncoming traffic, or go for demolition domination in derby mode.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">More and more tracks &amp; arenas will be added during the Early Access phase.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Awesome &amp; customizable cars</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Forget pristine supercars: Our cars are old, dented and patched together. Each of them tells a story, and you can tell your own by customizing your ride. Over the course of early access, more and more customization options will be added to the game.

And later during Early Access, you can also share your designs with other racers and wreckers!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fully revamped game modes</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Launching into early access with the base game modes of Racing, Derby and multiplayer mode. During the Early Access phase, we will add a completely revamped career mode that adapts to your individual playstyle and guides you on your journey to become a true champion! For online racers there will be new skill-based matchmaking system and server queues coming as well!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Challenges</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Another highlight during the Early Access phase will be special challenges, putting you behind the steering wheel of unconventional vehicles that were definitely never supposed to end up on a racetrack! Various bite-sized scenarios will keep you hooked as you battle for the highest scores.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tournaments</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Players can also look forward to tournaments that will be implemented during the Early Access phase. Here you can earn unique rewards in special events - events which test more than just your driving skills!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mod Support</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">During the Early Access phase, mod support will be added so you can really mess with this game by installing various mods from the Steam Workshop.</p>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1203190?t=1738684935","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1203190/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1738684935","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1203190/9ce82961e890bbc5551d6faf4b0955f9fc2df83f/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738684935","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1203190/9ce82961e890bbc5551d6faf4b0955f9fc2df83f/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738684935","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Ascend to the throne of full-contact racing by breaking the rules - and everything else - on your way to victory!
