They have to forge a new existence, constructing a base from the moon's resources and mastering the art of producing their sustenance.<br><br>In this alien world, hope rekindled, but the path ahead was a treacherous one, fraught with the unknown, and they were determined to meet it head-on.</i><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1694260/extras/city_building_001.gif?t=1711794786\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2><br>In Moons of Ardan, you'll take charge of a resilient civilization of Axonauts, stranded on a remote moon in the vast expanse of space.

It's simple yet monumental: build a thriving society that spans multiple moons, and ultimately, erect a breathtaking wonder that will stand as a testament to your ingenuity and leadership.<br><br>But achieving this won't be easy.

Balancing their needs against the limited resources of the moon will test your strategic prowess. But fear not!
