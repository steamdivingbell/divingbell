Each campaign is themed around fights between the Lancaster and Yorkist houses during various different periods of the countries rule. Capitalize on strategic advantages to turn the tide of war in your favour; ride down your foes with heavily armoured knights, hold the line with bristling ranks of billmen or strike from afar with the famed English longbow and huge pieces of artillery.
