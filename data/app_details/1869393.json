{"about_the_game":"Go round and round under the heart of Scotland\u2019s most populous city with Thomson Interactive\u2019s authentic rendition of the Glasgow Subway in Train Simulator! <br><br>Dating back to the early 1890s, the Glasgow Subway is the third-oldest system of its kind in the world. The line was constructed as a twin-track circular loop almost entirely underground, apart from the train depot, serving a total of 15 stations spread across both sides of the River Clyde. The line was built to an unusual 4ft narrow gauge, with tunnel bores of just 11ft, making for a very diminutive train appearance. <br><br>Originally built to be cable-driven, third rail was later installed and energised to be 600V, and following major overhauls in the late 1970s, the line has fitted with Automatic Train Operation, which allowed for a radical transformation in service frequency. To align with this upgrade, a brand-new second generation of rolling stock was built for the line; a fleet of 33 railcars which can operate independently, and up to 3-car formations. <br><br>Now ageing, the second generation of stock is due to be replaced, but it is still working hard below the streets of Glasgow day in, day out, and now in Train Simulator you can experience the full Glasgow Subway line, masterfully recreated by Thomson Interactive! <br><br>Featuring full ATO simulation, you have the power to decide how to drive \u2013 manage the line as real drivers do, operating the doors and \u201cready to start\u201d button, or take on the challenge of driving the line manually, where stopping at stations will take all your skill. Shuttle trains in and out of Broomloan depot, using the train wash, and immerse yourself in the detailed passenger view, complete with new passengers that dynamically vary throughout the carriage.  <br><br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2> A selection of authentic and engaging Career scenarios are included, as well as 1 Free Roam scenario: <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li>Tutorial 1 - Entering the system <br></li><li>Tutorial 2 - Returning to the depot <br></li><li>Inner Circle Service <br></li><li>Outer Circle Service <br></li><li>Outer Circle Manual Mode Challenge <br></li><li>Service Disruption <br></li><li>Shunting Shuffle <br></li><li>Broomloan Depot Free Roam </li></ul> More scenarios are available on the Steam Workshop online and in-game.
