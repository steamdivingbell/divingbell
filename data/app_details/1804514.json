{"about_the_game":"All aboard for Austria! Take charge of cross-border passenger &amp; freight traffic with RSSLO\u2019s Salzburg - Rosenheim route for Train Simulator.<br><br>Opened in 1860, the Rosenheim-Salzburg Railway was built following a proposal from as far back as 1828 to link the 2 cities together. The line would be an expansion of the Bavarian main line network which all culminated at Munich, resulting in a great deal of connectivity between Germany and Austria.<br><br>Popularity of the line grew quickly, and by the 1890s the whole route had been upgraded to be fully dual track. In the same decade, it would also play host to the famed Orient Express. The line was used sparingly for passenger traffic during the First World War but was of great strategic importance. Electrification was planned and later implemented throughout the 1920s, following the formation of the Deutsche Reichsbahn. The Second World War saw many stations along the line destroyed, and so much had to be reconstructed, and following the conflict, the line\u2019s signalling systems were also rebuilt and many junctions were upgraded.<br><br>Today, the line plays host to a wide variety of passenger traffic, from local services to cross-border Intercity traffic, operated by both DB and \u00d6BB (including the Railjet). Freight traffic also makes an appearance too, making this historical main line as important as ever.
