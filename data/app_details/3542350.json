{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Grendel\u2019s Cave is a top-down 2D pixel-art adventure game. Its setting is the Old English text Beowulf, Norse mythology, and the historical early 6th century Scandinavian warrior culture. Grendel's Cave is based on the legacy online dotcom game, GrendelsCave, which was one of the first on-line browser-based adventure games. Now Beowulf brings you this adventure as a real-time interactive 2D game for PC and Mac. In Grendel's Cave you create Thanes, kill monsters, increase value, stats and magic, and collect items. You obtain gold rings by selling items or by Singing of Deeds before King Hrothgar. You gain magical abilities by visiting the Witch and by acquiring magical items. This leads you to complete the five quests, earn amulet pieces, and craft a full amulet. Wearing this amulet gives you the power to kill Grendel and win the game.</p>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3542350?t=1740091608","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3542350/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1740091608","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3542350/f50d2e3a2f156c83fe9364ef96e3e8af7d8b4c21/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1740091608","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3542350/f50d2e3a2f156c83fe9364ef96e3e8af7d8b4c21/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1740091608","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Grendel\u2019s Cave is a top-down 2D pixel-art adventure game.
