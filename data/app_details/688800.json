{"about_the_game":"Paralysis is a first person multiplayer horror game. In which survivors must use teamwork to evade a player controlled creature(s). Will the survivors make it out alive? Or will they be hunted down to the last man?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are two game modes currently. The first is a asymmetrical 4 versus 1, where survivors try to escape by searching for items to help them escape. The creature's main goal in this mode is to try and pick off the survivors. The second is a 15 player infection mode where an alpha creature must deceit the human players in order to spread its infection across the game mode. The survivors will be given guns to defend themselves from the infected.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is in first person to allow everyone to get a more realistic experience to create more scares; The horror genre will be much more prevalent. A 3rd person perspective would allow the players to see around corners, so we made it so that they can only see what the survivor would be able to see.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"LIGHT THE WAY","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/688800/fd2c1a0f4b9879f9621310a0ea2ddafcf36b489e.jpg"},{"name":"I GOT THE POWER","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/688800/fd2c1a0f4b9879f9621310a0ea2ddafcf36b489e.jpg"},{"name":"CERTIFIED MEDIC","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/688800/fd2c1a0f4b9879f9621310a0ea2ddafcf36b489e.jpg"},{"name":"IMMORTAL","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/688800/fd2c1a0f4b9879f9621310a0ea2ddafcf36b489e.jpg"},{"name":"AM I GLOWING.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/688800/fd2c1a0f4b9879f9621310a0ea2ddafcf36b489e.jpg"},{"name":"WHO EVEN NEEDS A FLASHLIGHT","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/688800/fd2c1a0f4b9879f9621310a0ea2ddafcf36b489e.jpg"},{"name":"KILLER","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/688800/fd2c1a0f4b9879f9621310a0ea2ddafcf36b489e.jpg"},{"name":"ESCAPE ARTIST","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/688800/fd2c1a0f4b9879f9621310a0ea2ddafcf36b489e.jpg"},{"name":"FOLLOW ME","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/688800/fd2c1a0f4b9879f9621310a0ea2ddafcf36b489e.jpg"}],"total":9},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/688800/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1530410863","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/688800/page.bg.jpg?t=1530410863","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/688800/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1530410863","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/688800/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1530410863","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Paralysis is a first person multiplayer horror game.
