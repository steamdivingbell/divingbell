The Khaaneph often attack in waves and can swiftly disrupt resource operations, flank enemy forces, launch explosive drones, and bombard their prey with a hail of missiles.<br> <br>This fleet pack will add the new playable fleet, Kiith Khaaneph, to multiplayer and skirmish modes in Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak.
