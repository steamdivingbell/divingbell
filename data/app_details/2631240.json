{"about_the_game":"Grog is a First-Person online party game where 2-8 players compete in many Australian-dad-inspired minigames to see who is truly the greatest Aussie dad.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Minigames </h2>Compete in various minigames against your friends to earn points. Whoever has the most points after all minigames are complete, wins! Here are some of the challenges you will compete in:<br><br><br><strong>BBQ off</strong><br>Cook as much meat as possible within the time limit. Make sure you don't burn the meat though!<br><br><strong>Lawnmowing</strong><br>Mow a lawn... More than the others<br><br><strong>Beer Collecting</strong><br>You are in desperate need of some beer. Run around and collect any beer you can find before the other Dads find it!<br><br><strong>Camping</strong><br>Collect important materials located around the map and improve your campsite before it's too dark!<br><br><strong>Surfing</strong><br>Look back to your glory days and bring back your exceptional surfing skills. Use these old-school skills to stay in the water and avoid waves for as long as possible!<br><br><strong>Line Waiting</strong><br>You've been dragged to go shopping with your wife, and now you're waiting in line at the checkout. However, there are still so many cool dad things located around the store, so you'll have to sneak out of line and collect them without your wife knowing!<br><br><strong>Home Improvements</strong><br>Your home is in desperate need of some new improvements, so you're going to build a deck. Scavage through the hardware store and find the items you need to craft the perfect deck for your house.<br><br><strong>Parkour</strong><br>You've just finished camping out in the middle of nowhere, but now you need to make it back home. Parkour your way through the wilderness, hopping over rivers, and weaving through trees to make it back to your beloved home!<br><br><strong>Powerups</strong><br>You need some essential upgrades to help you compete against the other dads, so you go shopping. Use your time and points wisely to select the powerups that will give you the greatest advantage in your next minigames.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Character Customisation </h2>Make your dad look stylish! Create your unique look by customising the colours of your shirt, shoes, skin, shorts, or beard! Also earn shoes, hats, and body accessories while playing Grog to improve your style.
