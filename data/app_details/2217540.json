Failing in \u2018normality\u2019 and living a life without a model, queerness simultaneously demolishes and constructs over and over again. <i>3 Households</i> is a \u2018queer architecture game\u2019 that shows the aesthetics of this double failure.

For them, tending to the house is an act of tearing down what used to be a heteropatriarchal home. It constantly undermines society's demand to \u201cknow one\u2019s place\u201d as well as the notion of a sweet home as a warm, safe and secure place. There is no place more traumatic than a home. In the unstable, queer house built in this game, children also give birth to parents.<br><br>In the game, the player constructs a house by arranging 21 cubes, each with a Korean vowel. Guided by the meditative music of electronic sounds, vowels formed according to the shape of the periodic table travel through space, continuously shifting the composition of the bricks, the location of the rooms, the shape of the house, and the matrix in which the house resides. The movement of the vowel cubes constantly replaces nouns and adjectives with the adjective string indicating the state of mind, occupation and role string, physical condition string, room role string, furniture and equipment string, housework string, and etc., giving birth to queer homes, parents, children, and lovers. The three women form a family. Like a game of musical chairs (except here, the number of chairs remain the same) or Tetris, the position and role of the women endlessly rotate; they transform and stack their bodies, adjusting to one another\u2019s presence. Someone manages the house while someone else despairs and another turns off the lights. Like Bulgasari, an iron-eating creature in Korean mythology, they consume each other's pain and despair, and a sense of loss and mourning ensue. How will the mother, the daughter, and the daughter's girlfriend relate to one another, and what will they inherit from each other? 21 Vowels, 21 boxes, 21 keepsakes, 21 coffins, and 21 shelters\u2026 The people who are homebound encourage the players to hide and seek in order to discover a safe space, and to make and break that space into a place so as to embark on a one-way trip to meditation and healing.
