{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><u>TUG OF WAR STRATEGY ACTION</u></strong></h2><br>Spawn units to move across the map attacking your enemy's along the way. They will capture buildings that will increase your economy, buff your units, and give you a new frontline to spawn reinforcements on. Eventually making it to your enemy's base and destroying it to win.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><u>MULTIPLE DIFFERENT UNITS TO SPAWN</u></strong></h2><br>Spawn units like the Rookie that is a cheap infantry that can overwhelm your enemy. The Runner is a unit that moves fast and in unable to capture buildings so it is perfect for reinforcing a fight that you are losing. All while the Juggernaut is a low damage tank that can soak up tons of damage for a squad of units to back it up.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><u>SHORT MATCHES ON RANDOM MAPS</u></strong></h2><br>5 - 20 minute matches to fill in the small gap in your day were you have a little free time. This is not a game trying to take hundreds of hours of your life. No 2 maps are ever the same. Every time you load one up there will be different buildings in different places. 4 different maps sizes so you can choose how much time you wanna spend on a match.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"First of many","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2650240/02461a0e25a8f5100ceec6e2f9525da97e3763dc.jpg"},{"name":"On a roll","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2650240/667fbc5f336b9314ce63425544b67fcdb68380f9.jpg"},{"name":"Unbeatable","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2650240/19f0a661607cd71e8c282464845d0672d6a89b68.jpg"},{"name":"Investment","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2650240/d7430a56c17f06a78f409556effe558ee7acbc89.jpg"},{"name":"Business Expense","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2650240/9835d240bbd9ab2d18aa5a056808f2ee6d0baa0c.jpg"},{"name":"Was it worth it?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2650240/a537c622f18cf43f400eeeab7317e372ffb11b10.jpg"},{"name":"Saving it for next round","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2650240/bc8140263f86ba87ca1511345f613d083cf76e4a.jpg"},{"name":"Big Paycheck","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2650240/22644a9b44adc3925fc8c5dd5137cd5c9a7eab13.jpg"},{"name":"SEND MORE!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2650240/65ed69142b9a2008d6ea7d27ad62bca928c0db79.jpg"},{"name":"Never know what hit 'em","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2650240/8c30ce25ea33521ff4fb1c7a2fd73ead4487af17.jpg"}],"total":44},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2650240/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1702104046","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2650240/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1702104046","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2650240/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1702104046","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2650240/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1702104046","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><u>TUG OF WAR STRATEGY ACTION</u></strong></h2><br>Spawn units to move across the map attacking your enemy's along the way.
