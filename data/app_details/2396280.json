{"about_the_game":"When the P-47 Thunderbolt first arrived in the European theater of World War II, its rotund fuselage quickly earned it the nickname &quot;The Jug&quot; \u2013 but it wasn't long until that became short for &quot;Juggernaut.&quot; Built like a flying tank, it packed the wallop of eight .50 caliber machine guns and could carry enough bombs plus rockets to wipe a ground target clean off the map. The E-flite\u00ae P-47 Razorback 1.2m is a replica of the venerable warbird that delivers an unmatched scale flying experience. Featuring functional flaps and retracts, it's the perfect first &quot;full-house&quot; taildragger warbird and everyday scale model for a wide variety of pilots.
