Every battle scales based on the number of players involved, so you can easily jump in and out of the game even in the same playthrough!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With a <strong>highly customisable class system</strong>, Stolen Realm allows you to create traditional RPG classes or break the mold to forge a unique champion of your own as you draw from a pool of hundreds of possible skills. Make a spell-slinging assassin, a priest born of frost, or a shadow-infused knight. Further customize your build by earning and reforging <strong>loot that truly changes the way you play</strong>: wield Abbadon the Soul Crusher, a mythic mace that raises slain enemies as skeletal warriors to fight for you, or unsheath the Bloodletter, a cursed sword that grants additional power at the cost of your lifeblood.

After each battle, pick your path between story events, resource gathering, shops and treasure rooms, until you get to the final boss of each <strong>procedurally generated adventure.</strong> If you\u2019re up to a challenge, crank the difficulty up with <strong>6 different difficulty levels</strong> \u2013 or pick <strong>Hardcore Mode with permadeath</strong>, where every battle can be the last!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Also features <strong>Roguelike Mode</strong>, a fast paced version of the game where you can mix and match builds that are simply not possible in the traditional campaign!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Carve a place in history with your sword and magic.
