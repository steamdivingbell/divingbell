{"about_the_game":"An attractive suburban tank locomotive, the Victorian Railways M class locomotives were built in three batches between 1884 and 1886 by the Phoenix Foundry in Ballarat, and were the first suburban tank locomotive ordered by the Victorian railways since 1861. The M class were based on a pattern locomotive supplied by Beyer Peacock in 1879, and were very successful in their role as suburban passenger engines on the south eastern lines, and were also the main motive power on the Kew branchline in the 1890s. However their range was limited due to their small bunkers, later fixed when rebuilt as ME class locomotives. Originally fitted with steam brakes, the class were eventually fitted with the Westinghouse air brake, which became the standard on the Victorian Railways.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack represents the M class locomotives in the earlier more complex 2 tone green livery, with white lining, with highly polished brass and paintwork, and light soot staining as in regular service.
