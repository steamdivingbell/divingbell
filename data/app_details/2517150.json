{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Game!</h2></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2517150/extras/o_jogo.png?t=1729272054\" /><br>Vagneria is a platform game that blends elements of RPG, item crafting, scenario exploration, and village expansion. Here, your goal is to assist in the construction of the village of Vagneria by completing missions for its residents and protecting the inhabitants from threats that may arise throughout the story.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Characters</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2517150/extras/personagens.png?t=1729272054\" /><br>In Vagneria, you encounter various characters who join the village and assist you on your journey. Most of them need to be found in different stages of the game, and each has their own unique traits. While some serve as mere vendors or mission providers, others are more complex and interact with players in stages, aiding them in battles or even requiring protection when being escorted to reach their objective.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong></strong></h2>Village Constructions<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2517150/extras/constru\u00e7\u00f5es.png?t=1729272054\" /><br>As the village expands, new residents construct new structures that can be used by the player throughout the adventure. Among these structures is the furnace, where the ore collected by the player can be melted and transformed into bars, the anvil, where items can be repaired, and the market, where the merchant sells their items.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Game Mechanics</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2517150/extras/mecanicas.png?t=1729272054\" /><br>Although Vagneria is a platformer, the game mechanics go beyond simply defeating enemies and progressing through levels. Players will face various challenges such as collecting food to avoid starvation, chopping trees and mining stones to build equipment, or gathering herbs to create potions.<br><br>The weapons and equipment in the game have durability, so you'll constantly be crafting new items to replace those that have been broken and trying to obtain better ores to build more durable and powerful weapons.<br><br>Since the game also incorporates some RPG elements, players earn gold and experience by defeating monsters, allowing them to level up and become stronger. The player also has an energy bar that enables the use of magical items.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Unfolding of the Story</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2517150/extras/historia.png?t=1729272054\" /><br>Upon starting the game, the main character already finds themselves in the village of Vagneria and encounters its sole inhabitant, the &quot;Village Chief.&quot; From that moment on, the chief gifts the player with an axe and starts requesting various services. Initially, the player is asked to gather wood to construct some structures in the village. Following this, the chief requests the player to find his brother, a blacksmith, who is lost in the forest. Upon successfully locating the blacksmith, he joins the village.<br><br>Subsequently, the village chief asks to be escorted to a nearby merchant to persuade them to move to the village. Thus, the village of Vagneria expands, gaining new members and attracting the attention of neighboring tribes.<br><br>At this point, the course of the story begins to shift slightly, as the focus turns not only to the expansion of the village but also to eliminating aggressive tribes that threaten the peace of Vagneria.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Game Biomes</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2517150/extras/biomas.png?t=1729272054\" /><br>In Vagneria, players will encounter more than one biome, each with its own distinct characteristics. The first biome encountered is the forest, where you'll find trees, herbs, mushrooms, spiders, beehives, bees, bulls, slimes, and pigs. Since it is the initial biome, survival in it is not particularly challenging. However, the game consists of many more biomes, such as caves where players can mine stones and encounter bats and lizards. The 'flodra,' a jungle region inhabited by the masked tribe. Deep caves, a very dark region with bioluminescent creatures, where players need a torch to see around them. Icy lands where players face the cold and encounter creatures typical of the region. The ocean, where players embark on a maritime journey, facing pirates. The volcanic zone, where lava can be a problem, and many others.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Enemy Tribes</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2517150/extras/tribos.png?t=1729272054\" /><br>To achieve the ultimate goal of maintaining peace in Vagneria, the player will need to eliminate the enemy tribes that threaten the lives of its inhabitants. This involves defending the village from their invaders or invading their territory and eliminating the existing threat. The main threats to the village of Vagneria include the Masked Tribe, the Orc Tribe, the Skeleton Tribe, the Furry Tribe, and the Demon Tribe.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Village Siege</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2517150/extras/cerco.png?t=1729272054\" /><br>Vagneria also involves some elements of strategy games. In certain stages of the game, the player will be notified that an enemy tribe is preparing to attack the village. The player must then go to the conflict point and defend the territory. Before the attack, the player has some time to prepare their defenses. They can recruit workers, gather troops, collect resources, build palisades, walls, towers, barracks, and traps. The objective here is to prevent the enemy from destroying the center of your city while simultaneously trying to eliminate the invaders. The distinctive feature of this game mode is that you can control multiple troops and workers at the same time, slightly changing the gameplay dynamics to become more of a strategy game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Game Features</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2517150/extras/caracteristicasl.png?t=1729272054\" /><br>The game features a village where the player always returns after winning or being defeated in a phase. The village is constantly evolving, able to accommodate new residents and structures, serving as the character's home. In the village, there is a travel sign that opens the world map, allowing the player to travel to available locations. Locations on the world map appear as the player interacts with the village residents. Usually, a village resident makes a request to the player, and fulfilling this request involves traveling to a new location, thus unlocking that location on the world map. When the player travels to a location, they start at the beginning of the phase, and to return to the village, they must find the return door to the village at the end of the phase (they also return if they are killed). Getting to the return door to the village may not always be the final objective of a phase. If the player's mission is to collect a certain amount of wood and they return to the village without the wood, it means they have to go back to that location again to fulfill their goal. Except for some exceptions, each level generation occurs randomly, so when visiting the same location more than once, the player will find the scenario changed, although it always maintains the characteristics of the biome, such as the creatures and plants that live there. The game blends adventure and stage exploration elements with structure building and village defense.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Weapons and Equipment</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2517150/extras/armas.png?t=1729272054\" /><br>In Vagneria, players can find and craft a variety of weapons and equipment. They will need an axe to chop trees and collect wood, a pickaxe for mining, and a sword and other weapons to face enemies. The more they progress in the game, the better weapons and equipment they can craft.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Shields and Armor</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2517150/extras/armaduras.png?t=1729272054\" /><br>Shields and armor are the equipment that players use for defense. With a shield, they can block projectiles and defend against attacks, while armor serves to reduce the damage suffered. The more pieces of armor the player wears, the higher their defense will be. Therefore, using a complete set with a helmet, chestplate, pants, and boots can greatly assist the player in their journey.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Queen Bee","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2517150/da4341702ee24eb446913d92d66bcf3239c18984.jpg"},{"name":"Ogre","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2517150/4ecdf25aeb97e89efa3f7fbd66de0862ad556b2b.jpg"},{"name":"Necromancer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2517150/af67180bb98da50182b79c07e16bf8d0c9c9decf.jpg"},{"name":"Giant Slime","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2517150/317adc623a1f7daa19ac3c6447a6a8213646c981.jpg"},{"name":"Bat King","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2517150/e1be00e9ab91e9edd5af5c453f229c8e6f44009d.jpg"},{"name":"Hermit wants gold","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2517150/d2cdc3845839976a97032112ae4191a0e675f42f.jpg"},{"name":"Hermit","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2517150/f9137d6442e5b797e341f8acc803eec7a6f2d071.jpg"},{"name":"Stone Giant","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2517150/b703ffbf6f5dca9d7bd21b5b5367d102bd729ae6.jpg"},{"name":"Blacksmith","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2517150/191e7a28e3f09846ce681b8a2e6393b9058da5e7.jpg"},{"name":"Blacksmith's brother","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2517150/54c062c151ffb560977c910a8586ba0c24da97de.jpg"}],"total":40},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2517150?t=1729272054","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2517150?t=1729272054","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2517150/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729272054","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2517150/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729272054","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Game!</h2></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2517150/extras/o_jogo.png?t=1729272054\" /><br>Vagneria is a platform game that blends elements of RPG, item crafting, scenario exploration, and village expansion.
