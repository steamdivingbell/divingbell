{"about_the_game":"Miasma 2, the sequel to the Xbox Live Indie strategy game, was released in 2012 in the &quot;Indie Games&quot; category and on PC.

With an all-new turn-based tactics/real-time battle system, the action runs fast and thick, and with new units to command - and a whole new graphics engine - this is one adventure not to be missed. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMiasma 2 gives turn-based strategy an unexpected twist as you must plan your entire team's orders at the start of the turn, then hit commit and see how it plays out.
