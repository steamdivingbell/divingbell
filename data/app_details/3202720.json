{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>For the Emperor!\u00a0</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Astra Militarum, the backbone of the Imperium\u2019s might, are ready to fight in Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector. Sixteen new units are available to defend and fight for the Emperor.\u00a0 </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>HQ Commanders</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Endless ranks are commanded by the Cadian Castellan, who moves among their troops issuing orders and directing fire wherever it\u2019s needed. Meanwhile the armored companies are under the Tank Commander\u2019s orders, a veteran of countless battles. They know exactly when and where to direct attacks to maximize damage. Discipline and loyalty are guaranteed by the Commissar, whose role is critical to maintaining the morale of troops.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Countless soldiers for the Emperor!\u00a0</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Holding ground, withstanding enemy assault and preventing enemy forces from advancing, these are the tasks of the Cadian Shock Troops. They will never leave the lines even in the direst of circumstances. If Shock Troops are not enough, their comrades - the Heavy Weapon Squad - are ready to step into the battle. With access to an arsenal of portable armaments, they can offer close fire support with adaptable loadouts of precise or indiscriminate firepower.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Elite forces\u00a0</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Ogryn's are brutes, but no one can question their loyalty and strength. Their straightforward approach and resilience make them potent weapons. Their combat effectiveness is enhanced by the psychic support of the Primaris Psyker. These officers wield powerful psychic abilities that can decimate enemies. The elite forces of Astra Militarum can always count on the Kasrkin, assault specialists who often carry special weapons and serve as a bulwark against enemy forces.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>The Hammer of the Emperor!</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The agile Armoured Sentinels have no trouble moving over challenging terrains where larger vehicles struggle to outmaneuver foes and access vantage points. No enemy is safe if the Basilisk is deployed on the battlefield. Its Earthshaker Cannon allows it to fire its shells high over the battlefield, reaching concealed enemy positions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Smashing enemy positions and anchoring defensive lines is not a problem for the Rogal Dorn Battle Tank. These hulking armored fighting vehicles pound breaches in the enemy's defenses and tear apart infantry. Enemies\u2019 fortifications, tanks and infantry do not stand a chance against the Leman Russ Demolisher, the Leman Russ Vanquisher and the Leman Russ Punisher. Their powerful firepower is a solid solution for the Emperor against all types of enemies.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When the infantry calls, the Chimera always answers. Their heavy weaponry supports infantry squads during assaults, allowing them to engage enemies at point-blank range. If total annihilation is required, the Deathstrike is the answer. The blast from a Deathstrike Missile is capable of vaporizing almost anything within a very large radius. The skies are dominated by the Valkyrie, its durable armour and versatile payload make it a popular choice for a broad spectrum of battlefield roles.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3202720/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733853390","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3202720/page.bg.jpg?t=1733853390","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3202720/fd6e03684cd45619a695e84810741f15510968c6/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733853390","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3202720/fd6e03684cd45619a695e84810741f15510968c6/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733853390","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector contains graphical display of violence and blood."},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>For the Emperor!\u00a0</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Astra Militarum, the backbone of the Imperium\u2019s might, are ready to fight in Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector.
