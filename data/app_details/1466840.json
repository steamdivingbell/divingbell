{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fast paced drone racing and explosive combat</h2><br>Hyperblade is one part racing game, and one part vehicular combat<br><br>Challenge your opponents to a traditional race or amp up the stakes by strapping some weapons to your drone and battling it out in the combat arena or blow your opponents off the track. Hyperblade gives you all the fun of a giant machine gun strapped to a vehicle, but in the air. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1466840/extras/hypergif1.gif?t=1634100337\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Racing</h2><br>You can engage in traditional style, first to the line races against your friends or the AI. Fly through the checkpoints and be the first to cross the finish line. Visit exciting locales like sleepy meadows, train yards and even space stations. Races can be customized by number of laps, and even reversing the course. Supports a high score board made up of your times as well as the times of the people you personally race against. Ghost mode of your best race time is also available to race against. Several pickups on the track make it more challenging. These include pickups to alter your speed, mess with your controls, create signal interference or stop one of you dead in your tracks.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combat</h2><br>If you want something a little different, make the races more exciting by equipping weapons on your drone and eliminating your opponents before they cross the finish line first. Choose from an autocannon, laser, or pulse beam weapon. You can also pick up EMP mines, and missiles on the track. Other combat pickups include shields and armor repairs.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1466840/extras/hypergif2.gif?t=1634100337\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Arena</h2>If you want a real change from the track, you can jump into arena mode and fight it out in classic death match style arena. Available both online and in local split screen. Featuring all the pickups from the race track, including the combat ones, you can blow each other up to see who can get the most kills.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1466840?t=1634100337","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1466840?t=1634100337","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1466840/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1634100337","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1466840/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1634100337","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Supported","id":53},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":1488210,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fast paced drone racing and explosive combat</h2><br>Hyperblade is one part racing game, and one part vehicular combat<br><br>Challenge your opponents to a traditional race or amp up the stakes by strapping some weapons to your drone and battling it out in the combat arena or blow your opponents off the track.
