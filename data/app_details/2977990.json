{"about_the_game":"Spec is a series of classic arcade style game modes that build upon themselves as you progress through the game. With each new level comes a new mechanic to master, if not a whole new mode entirely. There are 66 levels to conquer, secrets to discover along the way, bonus modes to unlock... you'll be surprised how much entertainment can be packed into one little spec.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMain Game:<br />\r\n  Spec contains 66 levels and 11 different game modes. In some levels you'll be dodging the projectiles. In other levels you'll be platforming to the finish. Some levels are puzzles. Some levels require reflexes. Some levels ask for survival. Some levels ask for precision. Your full gaming repertoire will be tested.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBonus Modes:<br />\r\n  There are three bonus modes hidden throughout the game to unlock and enjoy. We hope you find them on your own, but if you can't (or just don't want to), Discord is here to help.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpeedrun Mode:<br />\r\n  After you've completed the main game you'll unlock Speedrun Mode - a built-in game timer with auto-start, auto-stop, and automatic advancement through the stages. Speedrunning the game requires no setup, no overlay, no video editing. If you can record your screen and upload it to YouTube, you can submit a speed run and see where you fall among the masses!","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2977990?t=1718358310","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2977990?t=1718358310","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2977990/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718358310","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2977990/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718358310","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Spec is a series of classic arcade style game modes that build upon themselves as you progress through the game.
