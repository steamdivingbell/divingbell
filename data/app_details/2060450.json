After hearing about this game on the News, I thought it would be a winner, and when it arrived I found I was right. If you liked Manic Miner (is there anyone who doesn\u2019t?) you will love Monty Mole because it\u2019s a classic platform game, more complicated and, in my opinion, better than Manic Miner. [...] I found this game fun to play and certainly addictive this has got to be one of the best games for the Spectrum this year and definitely worth buying.\u201d<br>92% \u2013 Crash!
