{"about_the_game":"In Windmills you play as the last Crimson Cape, a witch - hunter, on his quest to find his missing father. In this combat - focused metroidvania you will face dangerous monsters and devious wizards that will put your skills to the test. You will unlock new abilities that will help you traverse the world and you will absorb the powers of your enemies, allowing you to use them instead. The story unfolds in a unique way, based on the way you progress through the game. Depending on your actions, areas and enemies can change because the narrator will remember things differently, making each narrative unique. Because what is more important, if the windmills were giants or if the story was worth telling?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1803760/extras/thestory.gif?t=1675404296\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1803760/extras/summary.png?t=1675404296\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1803760/extras/gameplay_header.png?t=1675404296\" /><br><br>The combat system is based on suppressing, deflecting, dodging and parrying.
