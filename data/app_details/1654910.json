{"about_the_game":"Rogues is a rogue-lite real-time tactics game in a faraway galaxy. You command a company of colorful space pirates in their quest to become disgustingly wealthy. Raid cargo haulers and ransom their crews - if any survive. Blockade fledgling colonies. Smuggle weapons to rebels. Accept Letters of Marque from unique space-faring empires. Whatever it takes to swell your coffers. Make friends along the way, and enemies too.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut out there, among the stars. Terrors lurk too. On the edges of civilized space, mysteries linger. Abandoned colonies, ruins of great and ancient species, forgotten to time. Strange artifacts, strange worlds, strange peoples with strange beliefs. The edge of civilization promises vast opportunities for wealth - and unimaginable dangers.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1654910/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1650555227","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1654910/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1650555227","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1654910/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1650555227","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1654910/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1650555227","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Rogues is a rogue-lite real-time tactics game in a faraway galaxy.
