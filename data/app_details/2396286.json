{"about_the_game":"The E-flite\u00ae Carbon-Z\u00ae Cub SS 2.1m makes it easier than ever to enjoy a truly unique and versatile giant-scale flying experience. Based on the original Carbon-Z Cub, it's equipped with an abundance of new convenience, capability and flight performance-improving features. An updated wing design with drooped tips adds wing and aileron area for significantly improved slow speed handling, performance and control. The modified flap design allows them to travel both ways for full-span aileron and other mixing options, and thumbscrews make it easier to install and remove the two-piece wing without tools.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArticulated and shock-absorbing landing gear, equipped with even larger oversized tundra-style wheels with softer tires, offers better ground handling that soaks up the bumps of rough surfaces. The push-button released, top-mounted hatch offers convenient and easy access to the battery compartment \u2013 which now holds a quick-release, multi-position battery mounting tray that fits 4S to 6S 3200\u20137000mAh batteries. An improved motor design featuring an additional bearing, plus a propeller molded from material that better maintains balance and stiffness, results in smoother and more reliable power system performance. The composite-reinforced, hollow-core airframe arrives mostly factory-finished and assembled, and the installed digital, metal-geared servos with ball-link equipped linkages deliver crisp and precise control.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo whether you fly it slow and scale, or perform beyond-scale vertical takeoffs and aerobatics, the Carbon-Z Cub SS will offer unexpected levels of versatility, capability and performance you'll enjoy flight after flight!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis model is equipped with Horizon Hobby and Spektrum exclusive AS3X (Artificial Stabilization \u2013 3-aXis) and optional-use SAFE (Sensor Assisted Flight Envelope) Select technologies, and when SAFE Select is turned on using the mode switch (B on the Spektrum InterLink DX controller) it offers:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPitch and Bank Angle Limits<br />\r\nThese envelope limits keep the airplane from rolling or pitching upside down.
