{"about_the_game":"Before it built an empire, the engine behind 3D wrestling brought the revolution to MMA - where real combat challenges you to survive each round! In this game of human chess, a unique control system only lets you have your own way half the time against uncooperative opponents. Feel the resistance in animations that follow your movement in any direction, and then pound the right buttons to strike or transition at any moment. For the first time ever, the original touch-screen concept has been adapted for controllers to allow precise 360 input. Be sure to play through the fully interactive &quot;Training&quot; process to learn how to fight!<br><br>Then embark on a career to climb the ranks at 5 unique promotions with their own weight classes, or become the boss in the sport's 1st fully playable &quot;Promoter&quot; mode. Either way, a whole calendar of fights unfolds before you - including the opportunity to arrange your own to draw in the crowds! Make the right moves backstage as well as in the cage to rise to the top of the sport before it defeats you.<br><br>Just when you think you've seen it all, you can edit every fighter at every promotion to make the world your own! The game's files are even exposed for modders who enjoy replacing the textures and other media.<br><br>* Please note that this game was made before I trained MMA in real life, so it's not exactly the most realistic take on the sport - but there's still plenty of fun to be had by blurring the lines between fighting and wrestling!
