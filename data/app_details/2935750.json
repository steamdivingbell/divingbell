Your goal? Beat every enemy round and defeat the big bosses with your deck. Along the way, you can buy more cards and runes to make your deck stronger. There are different decks to play with, each getting harder as you go. Plus, you can unlock new cards while playing this Roguelike Deckbuilder.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2935750/extras/Desc-UnlockCards.png?t=1730999286\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">While playing Glingdom, you can unlock many units. Some are almost given to you, while others have hard or secret requirements! These cards then can be used during a run, and will start appearing in the shop! There are over <strong>50+ Unique units</strong> you can play!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2935750/extras/Desc-UNIQUE_BOSS_FIGHTS.png?t=1730999286\" /></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Every boss fight requires you to strategize to defeat them, this could be anything from which runes you buy, to what cards and where you place your units.

This allows you to strategize which cards and runes to buy to create synergies</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2935750/extras/Desc-REINFORCEMENTS!.png?t=1730999286\" /></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Every round you are dealt your hand, if you use every card in your hand, and lose, the game isn't over! If you still have cards in your deck, you will draw a new hand to continue where your last group of units left off to finish the fight! However, if you run out of cards in your deck after losing a fight, you lose the whole run, so use your cards wisely!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">GLHF :]</p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Doesn't every game have this achievement","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2935750/24bc79c88c3ea84769f9da067fddc10fb53e1035.jpg"},{"name":"First Win!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2935750/1801a82aba78389e87e2ff537e31bddcb4a0ddfc.jpg"},{"name":"A Fair Fight","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2935750/0b0da246fa01bbf933db0da9852b26f23d778142.jpg"},{"name":"Playing With Fire","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2935750/9d1cfc1aab7f13a50beed85d0041be1d9b51a791.jpg"},{"name":"David Versus Goliath","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2935750/aecbcd88cd3643cd372fcfc62171ada5d551f68f.jpg"},{"name":"Fresh Paper","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2935750/aef4caf3b651e756a8be834f5c3eb7133f1147a1.jpg"},{"name":"Super Snipers","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2935750/985dfe6efb838e35054aa48ab4048e4d198e1347.jpg"},{"name":"Godly Gladiators ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2935750/0172a7dda7b72601f13ccb35a06f27ae5b94ade7.jpg"},{"name":"From The Grave","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2935750/8b9f9d1eb2523d7664da4c1106fcae8e3bcef6fc.jpg"},{"name":"Dangerous Duo ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2935750/97af8044ca082d58fe79a53e2a90a3cbe4dc7658.jpg"}],"total":21},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2935750/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730999286","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2935750/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1730999286","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2935750/82936290e94f9df695261806b1ff5e32eddf80af/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730999286","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2935750/82936290e94f9df695261806b1ff5e32eddf80af/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730999286","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2935750/extras/GlingdomLogoSmaller.png?t=1730999286\" /><br>In Glingdom, you're a hero in a medieval world, battling enemies and bosses using a variety of special decks.
