{"about_the_game":"Bukkaku created by Lukas Reznicek. Experimental horror survival with elements of science fiction and RPG. A story between life and death in a stylized game origami world. The name \u201eBukkaku\u201c has many translations. It kind of makes sense if you think about it. If you are wondering why it sounds similar to bukkake, it's because it comms from the same root word. (bukkake \u6253\u3063\u639b\u3051) First kanji (\u6253) translates to \u201cstrike\u201d or \u201csudden\u201d. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1912840/extras/yotu2.png?t=1725287260\" /><br><br>Mostly it's corresponding with &quot;shattering to pieces&quot; from which comms the graphical style which should be absolutely obvious.

A bit of survival with hints of sci-fi and RPG. I'm still trying to make the game a bit different and with a different approach. I can reveal that it won't be a classic walk on the map with a lot of quests. Don't even expect an explanation of the story or game mechanisms, you'll just be thrown right into the world and have to play as a character yourself without any help. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1912840/extras/001.png?t=1725287260\" /><br><br><br>It's still a game, so there's an emphasis on your character finding peace in a world of darkness and light. The player character has neither lives nor is dead, they're just at a crossroads exploring deep darkness and blinding light that isn't necessarily evil and good. Rather the opposite. The graphic style is very much about contrast. Cute-looking elements with a dark, almost eerie atmosphere at the same time.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1912840/extras/hzzz.png?t=1725287260\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1912840/extras/postere.jpg?t=1725287260\" />","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1912840?t=1725287260","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1912840?t=1725287260","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1912840/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725287260","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1912840/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725287260","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Bukkaku created by Lukas Reznicek.
