You may be familiar with villains who lust after gold, but not so with this guy. He loves silver and despises gold - so much so that he plans to destroy the Golden Gate Bridge!  Even though it's not gold at all!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We previously sent in your partner, Franklin Benjamin, to deal with the situation and protect the bridge. But unfortunately, he's been lost in the line of duty, so this mission now falls to you, Virginia West. Get close to this madman, unravel his scheme, and stop him in his tracks.
