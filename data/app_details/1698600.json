{"about_the_game":"Through the Fog is a third-person rogue-lite exploration role-playing-game where you explore a mysterious abandoned city plagued by a disorienting fog and buildings that change each night. Your goal is to get people back into the city and find out what exactly went wrong. So, you go into the fog each night after the buildings have moved, to map out the city, then sell the populous maps based on the new positions. Along the way, you find secrets and help NPCs with quests to uncover the past, and the nature of the curse that fell upon the once-thriving metropolis.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1698600/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1720483632","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1698600/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1720483632","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1698600/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1720483632","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1698600/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1720483632","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Through the Fog is a third-person rogue-lite exploration role-playing-game where you explore a mysterious abandoned city plagued by a disorienting fog and buildings that change each night.
