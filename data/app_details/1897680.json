But some orbs might be trapped, and you will go boom.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1897680/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1664197737","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1897680/page.bg.jpg?t=1664197737","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1897680/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1664197737","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1897680/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1664197737","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"ToyCar is a game were you race around tracks in small cars either in single player or with your friends in online multiplayer.<br>Use the boost to pass them and leave them in the dust.<br>But be mindful of the temperature and let off the throttle to cool it down a bit before giving it the full beans again, we do not want the engine to go boom do we?<br>Enable weapons to get rockets for those more offensive moments when the throttle is not enough.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">50% Volume</h2>This game start out at 50% volume and not 100% like most others.<br>No need to blast new players with over the top audio IMHO.<br>Head in to the Options and change that if you want or need to.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Car color</h2>And while you are in the options, you might as well choose a car color.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Single player vs. AIs</h2>You can race in single player against AIs to hone those skills.<br>The AIs are are nice and respectful (Sometimes...) but if you are to slow they will make you regret that granny driving.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Online Multiplayer</h2>You can race against your friends and see who REALLY has the racing skills.<br>Up to 8 players can race against each other at once.<br>You can race against players that are not in your friends list using <strong>Click to copy Lobby Code</strong> in the host menu, give that to new friends and they can paste that into the <strong>Lobby Code</strong>.
