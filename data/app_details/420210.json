{"about_the_game":"<strong>KRUM - Edge Of Darkness</strong> is hardcore action RPG set in a fantasy world.

It\u2019s nothing like a click-and-slash button masher. Button mashing will only get you killed. Each weapon has a few easy to execute but brutal combos. <br>The nature of the fights suggests that you will have to wait your turn and plan your timing, in order to strike or parry at the very best moment. <br>The game leans heavily on action, but when the combats are so perilous and gritty you'll often find yourself in what feels like a stand-off. Either battling monsters or common warriors, you will be eagerly waiting for your turn to come. You will face countless fearsome mobs and grotesque beasts, hidden deadly traps, powerful demon knights and dragons.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/420210/extras/story1.png?t=1662990429\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE STORY</h2><i>You are a noble man living in a small and peaceful village. <br>One day you return from the forest with some wood and see your village ravaged and left in ruins.
