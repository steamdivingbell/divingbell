You don\u2019t have much time! The higher level you achieve, the faster time goes and the less time you have to move the containers.<br><br>To make a bigger impression on you, we\u2019ve decided to move our game to virtual reality. You will have an opportunity not only to experience what the crane operator normally does but also to look at the world from the perspective of 72-metres machine. If you have a fear of heights, be careful - you can feel a little bit dizzy.<br><br>Use Vive controllers to control a crane and an elevator that will take you to the top of the vehicle.
