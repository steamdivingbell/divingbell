{"about_the_game":"Divide and Conquer is an abstract strategy board game. As the Commander of a battalion of troops, you plan out and execute troop movements to secure objective regions around the game board. Your opponent\u2019s competing troops will cause you to tangle and engage in the conflict taking on causalities and slowing your pace to victory. You must anticipate the other players\u2019 strategies by moving with precision and seizing the initiative. Sometimes your position is defensive to block an opponent from an objective and other times you are invading occupied regions to weaken the offensive of another player.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game mechanics are based on mathematics and game theory, which provides an additional opponent. If you plan optimally, you will not only defeat the other players, but you will also solve the game with a minimal number of movements.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1422520/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1608659695","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1422520/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1608659695","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1422520/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1608659695","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1422520/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1608659695","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Divide and Conquer is an abstract strategy board game.
