{"about_the_game":"Welcome to KHIRIBI island! An island of a thousand trees, countless exotic birds, and a never ending stream of violence, run by warlord Dalian, whose rise to power was possible with the howling echo of the cold war. He plays two sides, selling arms and weapons to the highest bidder while running slaver rings and poaching safari for the richest of earth's scum. Delegated to shut down his island cartel and free the slaves, your special forces division is dispatched straight to Wipe out Dalian for good. Play with your friends in co-op, fight his bloodthirsty mercenaries, help the villagers return to their homes and bring justice and glory to this land!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Now featuring Voodoo mechanics! </h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><strong>Currently in the game</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Up to 4 players</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Spirit World</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>NPC enemies and allies</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Outpost liberation and missions</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Gun for hire</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Inventory and survival features</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Factions</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/908200/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731138908","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/908200/page.bg.jpg?t=1731138908","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/908200/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731138908","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/908200/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731138908","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"Nudity, guns, animal killing, people killing, grenades."},"detailed_description":"<h1>Discord</h1><p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Welcome to KHIRIBI island!
