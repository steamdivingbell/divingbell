{"about_the_game":"<i><strong>Story:</strong></i><br><br>As a cross-dimensional traveler, \u2014the bravest of your kind\u2014 you arrive at a vast, dystopian wilderness that mysteriously defies the very essence of purity in nature.  These territories are populated by legions of hostile miscreants whose leaders direct them in their constant persecution of a distant civilization that is peaceful.  Although you'll never meet those whom you've been sent to liberate from this tyranny, the consequences of their secured freedom will forever justify your line, and the righteous home that you come from.  This is a saga which highlights a notion of &quot;pre-redemption&quot; through unwavering sacrifice in the face of the unknown.<br><br><br><i><strong>Game Features:</strong></i><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Open-World Navigation/Exploration</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>NPC Guidance/Subtitle Communication</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Day/Night Cycles</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Items Collection</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Numerous Attack Abilities</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fast-Paced Combat (General)</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Boss Fights/Spoils</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1181690/extras/AC_accent.png?t=1735506742\" />","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1181690?t=1735506742","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1181690/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1735506742","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1181690/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735506742","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1181690/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735506742","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<i><strong>Story:</strong></i><br><br>As a cross-dimensional traveler, \u2014the bravest of your kind\u2014 you arrive at a vast, dystopian wilderness that mysteriously defies the very essence of purity in nature.
