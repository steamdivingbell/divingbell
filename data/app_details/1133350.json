{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Gravity Control</strong> is an innovative puzzle platformer where your ability to manipulate gravity is the key to success. Instead of controlling your character directly, you guide them by changing gravity's direction, navigating through 40+ mind-bending levels. Each stage presents unique challenges that will test both your reflexes and puzzle-solving skills.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Avoid moving spikes, dodge rotating lasers, and strategically use crates to unlock doors or deactivate traps. As the levels progress, the puzzles become increasingly complex, requiring more thought and precision. The floaty nature of your astronaut means every gravity shift must be calculated to avoid dangerous obstacles.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With a mix of action-packed and brain-teasing levels, <strong>Gravity Control</strong> offers hours of rewarding gameplay. Master gravity manipulation and guide your astronaut safely to the wormhole that leads to the next challenge. Can you conquer all 60 levels and become a gravity master?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Features</strong>:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">46 diverse levels with increasing difficulty</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Innovative gravity-based mechanics</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Action and puzzle elements combined</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Challenging obstacles like spikes and lasers</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Unlock doors and disable traps using crates</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Intuitive controls and smooth gameplay</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Perfect for fans of puzzle platformers looking for a fresh twist, <strong>Gravity Control</strong> will keep you engaged with its clever mechanics and fun challenges!</p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Level 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1133350/fcc2dd2c9ac73ded7d61a1b96dc54de3d6852bf5.jpg"},{"name":"Level 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1133350/a1f22da181b0918238dab2642d44cc2c33114982.jpg"},{"name":"Level 3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1133350/eb0f3aed829f8a01ef000287c77fd474414832df.jpg"},{"name":"Level 4","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1133350/1b478c1d405f8eaf582be841fcb23f089f635eb9.jpg"},{"name":"Level 5","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1133350/68360b072396fcb59720376e28727ce45fabf7e1.jpg"},{"name":"Level 6","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1133350/bf24153f98fa57ef0362dfcad4136f73992d6d6e.jpg"},{"name":"Level 7","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1133350/e16f36cccc3aa88c3edae1b2e71b1bd90a99ac32.jpg"},{"name":"Level 8","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1133350/ae0817d8ef51713f015a5983a5631e29e77f905a.jpg"},{"name":"Level 9","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1133350/e21b277d2ba1cae0467a89f540760e5175f8f817.jpg"},{"name":"Level 10","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1133350/0df8d9d84fbab8a499b47ea2baa1575042298aec.jpg"}],"total":48},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1133350/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727603768","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1133350/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1727603768","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1133350/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727603768","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1133350/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727603768","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Gravity Control</strong> is an innovative puzzle platformer where your ability to manipulate gravity is the key to success.
