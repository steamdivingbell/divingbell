It leads you to a church where there is already a coffin with an executed witch, over whose body the necessary rituals must be performed for several nights. Every step on the creaking floor causes an echo echoing in the empty halls. There is a feeling of fear and something otherworldly in the air. You feel that you are not alone in this gloomy place. Your main task is to expel the evil spirit inhabiting the body of the deceased witch.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Using the ancient rituals described in the sacred books, you must find a way to expel the spirit from the dead body before it gets stronger and finds a new living body. During the game you will have to study the sacred texts, which are full of riddles and complex rituals. You will face various challenges \u2014 from puzzles to frightening encounters with ghosts and manifestations of dark forces.
