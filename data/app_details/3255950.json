Created by Ariel Castro Garc\u00eda, an award-winning developer from the team that won at PlayStation Talents 2021 (Game of the Year and Best Game for Press), &quot;Whispers of the Past&quot; plunges you into a journey through the ages that begins with an unexpected ending. Amidst the chaos of modern warfare, our protagonist finds themselves on the brink of death. But instead of darkness, they face a mysterious tunnel bathed in ethereal light. This passage traverses not only space but time itself, catapulting the player into a forgotten era of knights and castles. Endowed with abilities to manipulate the flow of time, the protagonist must navigate a medieval world filled with enigmas and dangers. Each step reveals fragments of a past life, connecting two existences separated by centuries. However, the echoes of the past bring with them familiar shadows: fears that have haunted the soul across ages. With a unique blend of time-based puzzle-solving and atmospheric exploration, &quot;Whispers of the Past&quot; challenges players to decipher the mysteries of their own existence. Are today's fears the same ones that lurked in the past? And what secrets lie hidden in the folds of time? Immerse yourself in a captivating narrative where every decision can alter the course of history, and where the greatest mystery might be your own identity. &quot;Whispers of the Past&quot; is not just a game; it's a journey through time, memory, and the soul itself.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3255950/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737842476","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3255950/page.bg.jpg?t=1737842476","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3255950/3b182730fb81032b0844f494531225d7f64dba5a/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737842476","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3255950/3b182730fb81032b0844f494531225d7f64dba5a/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737842476","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Captions available","id":13}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3255950/extras/back2.png?t=1737842476\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">&quot;Whispers of the Past&quot; is an immersive first-person adventure that challenges the limits of time and identity.
