{"about_the_game":"In this game, we define Survival as the state or fact of continuing to live or exist, typically in difficult circumstances. Survival can be threatened by various factors such as environmental factors, starvation, dehydration, monsters/animals, psychological distress, diseases, or lack of sleep. Adventure, on the other hand, involves taking risks, covering distances, encountering animals/monsters, and experiencing a story that includes loss, gain, and new visual things.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you embark on this journey, you will meet Luna, Ray, Davo, Solara, Ember, and Orion, who all met in a tavern and decided to embark on an adventure together. They boarded a ship and set sail towards a new continent, but their journey was cut short when their ship exploded due to a fire caused by the wares they were carrying. They ended up shipwrecked on the shores of the new, wild continent. Despite the setback, they were excited to explore the new land and discover what it had to offer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur game is an RPG with a heavy focus on cooperative play, but it can also be enjoyed as a single-player experience. Unlike other &quot;survival&quot; games, our game is more equipment-driven, giving players greater control over their survival strategies. The combat system is inspired by MOBAs, making for a more engaging and challenging experience. However, instead of PvP elements, our game's combat system is designed entirely for PvE. Our game features stat-driven abilities, adding a layer of complexity to the gameplay and allowing players to customize their characters to suit their preferred playstyle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAre you ready to embark on this adventure and survive the untamed wilderness? Get ready to join Luna, Ray, Davo, Solara, Ember, and Orion and explore the new continent in our exciting RPG game!","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1797370?t=1680041964","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1797370?t=1680041964","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1797370/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1680041964","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1797370/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1680041964","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In this game, we define Survival as the state or fact of continuing to live or exist, typically in difficult circumstances.
