Starting with a simple concept of connecting two blocks, the game quickly expands and becomes a labyrinth of complex puzzles with branching solutions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Progress Through Themed Worlds</h2>Solve your way through an expanding list of thematic worlds, each with a special gameplay gimmick that sets them apart from one another. Find yourself gaining confidence in your puzzle-solving skills as you rack up Bronze, Silver, and Gold trophies throughout your playthrough! You may even find yourself high on the global leaderboard if you find a great solution!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Wide Range of Blocks</h2>Refine your movements and navigate your way around obstacles as you master handling each block's unique mechanics, and expand your way of thinking when you come across an especially difficult level!
