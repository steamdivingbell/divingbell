{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A roguelite game where you overcome countless deaths to reach the final destination of battle.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Combat</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The core of the game is the &quot;fusion of turn-based mechanics with fast-paced action.&quot;</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">While facing enemies, turns progress based on your actions. When the enemy\u2019s turn count reaches zero, they execute their attack. The basic game system revolves around deciding &quot;how to act before the enemy attacks.&quot;</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Take your time to carefully plan your next move and decide what to use and when. Since there are moments where you need to manage resources with foresight, don't rush\u2014approach each situation thoughtfully.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">However, despite being turn-based, the game allows for fast-paced action. With responsive controls, you can parry enemy attacks with perfect timing and counterattack. The action flows so smoothly that it hardly feels like a turn-based system. Sometimes, you might find the enemy's turn count advancing while you're engrossed in the fluid action, but mastering the balance between action and turn-based strategy brings a peak sense of satisfaction.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Roguelite Elements</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">One of the key elements in battle is &quot;choice.&quot;</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Along the way, you\u2019ll be presented with several enhancement options, and you must choose one. There are a wide variety of ways to strengthen your character.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Use the weapons you obtain to efficiently defeat enemies. However, weapons are disposable, so it\u2019s crucial to decide what to use and when. Proper resource management, with an eye to the future, will impact your survival rate. The game consists of a continuous series of these fine-tuned decisions.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">At times, unexpected branching paths will appear. Choose your route based on your current situation, and with the results you gain, survive through hundreds of battles.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">All these elements are governed by &quot;randomness.&quot; In other words, no two battles will ever be the same. Since death is an inherent part of the game, each repeated challenge retains its freshness.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Additionally, an indispensable feature of roguelites is &quot;permanent upgrades.&quot; Although you lose all the abilities you gained during your run when you die, there are also upgrades that have lasting effects, fueling your motivation to continue challenging the game even after death.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2263450/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733848011","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2263450/page.bg.jpg?t=1733848011","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2263450/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733848011","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2263450/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733848011","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A roguelite game where you overcome countless deaths to reach the final destination of battle.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Combat</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The core of the game is the &quot;fusion of turn-based mechanics with fast-paced action.&quot;</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">While facing enemies, turns progress based on your actions.
