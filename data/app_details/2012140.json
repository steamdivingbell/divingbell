{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What is Helicopter Gunship DEX?</h2>Inspired by the great helicopter games of the 90s, Helicopter Gunship D.E.X is a &quot;sim-cade&quot; experience leaning more towards the simulation side rather than the arcade side. <br><br><i>Controls have been optimised for GAMEPADS without sacrificing simulation options via a Sensor/Screen of Interest (SOI) plus modifier button system to expand the number of buttons available.
