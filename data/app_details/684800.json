He was originally killed in a forest fire started by the mayor with illegal fireworks. Now he wants revenge. <br></li><li><strong>Zombie Jack</strong>  - Zombear\u2019s archnemesis. Zombie Jack was in Bateman Hills to chop down some of its legendary border birches when Zombear\u2019s presence pulled him into the competition. <br></li><li><strong>Bruiser Bogartus</strong>  - A strongman obsessed with wood. The mayor promised to fund his business of making wooden exercise equipment\u2014if he can win. <br></li><li><strong>Mayo Monsoon</strong>  - Mayo was once an employee of the Bateman Hills Mayo Company. That is, until he fell from a catwalk into a vat of mayo. The execs worked with the mayor to cover up the accident. Mayo Monsoon is ready to tell the mayor how he really feels.<br></li><li><strong>Ollie Oilsack</strong>  - A local vagrant. Ollie was crushed by logs in an explosion at the Lincoln Timber Company. Ollie knows that the mayor ordered the explosion to rid the town of its hobo population. <br></li><li><strong>Spare Rib Bonaparte</strong>  - An animated skeleton obsessed with partying. Spare Rib was a musician in the 1980s who never stopped rocking out. When his antics destroyed the peace and quiet across the town, the Mayor made sure he found his way out of a hotel window. <br></li><li><strong>Hot Foot Francis</strong>  - The pride and glory of Bateman Hills.
