{"about_the_game":"Dr. Pumpkin Island is shrouded in mystery and intrigue, with its inhabitants being some of the most unusual creatures you'll ever encounter. From the moment you step onto the island, you'll feel like you've entered a different world, with strange noises and peculiar sights around every corner.<br><br>The island is home to a variety of puzzles, ranging from easy to mind-bending difficult. The inhabitants of the island seem to take great pleasure in devising these puzzles and watching outsiders struggle to solve them. Some of the puzzles are physical, requiring you to use your strength and agility to get through, while others are more mental, requiring you to use your wits and intellect to unravel their mysteries.<br><br>As you explore the island, you'll encounter a variety of strange creatures that seem to have evolved in ways that defy explanation. Some are small and nimble, darting around your feet as you walk, while others are massive and lumbering, capable of crushing you with a single swipe of their enormous claws.<br><br>One of the most fascinating aspects of Dr. Pumpkin Island is its flora. The island is covered in lush, vibrant vegetation, but many of the plants seem to possess strange, otherworldly properties. Some plants glow in the dark, while others emit a strange, hypnotic scent that can put you into a trance-like state.<br><br>Despite the many dangers that lurk on Dr. Pumpkin Island, there is something undeniably alluring about the place. Perhaps it's the sense of adventure that comes with exploring uncharted territory, or maybe it's the thrill of solving puzzles and unraveling mysteries. Whatever it is, one thing is for certain: those who dare to venture to this strange and mysterious island will never forget the experience.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2072830/extras/discord.pnghttps://discord.gg/ApHQ7rkTva?t=1683558856\" /><br>[url]<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2072830/extras/discord.png?t=1683558856\" />[/url]<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2072830/extras/capsule.png?t=1683558856\" /><br> - 10+ Steam Achievements for you to collect<br> - Discord Community + support<br> - Events<br> - Public Game Suggestions and more!<br><br>The Goal:<br>Your goal is to find the key as possible before Mr.Pumpkin Man gets more walking pumpkins chasing you.<br><strong><i><u>JOIN THE DISCORD FUN!!!</u></i></strong><br>","achievements":{"total":0},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2072830/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1683558856","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2072830/page.bg.jpg?t=1683558856","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2072830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1683558856","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2072830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1683558856","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Dr. Pumpkin Island is shrouded in mystery and intrigue, with its inhabitants being some of the most unusual creatures you'll ever encounter.
