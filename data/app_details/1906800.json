The game is set up around taking on difficult challenges and overcoming them by skill and improvement!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\u2022 Stylized 3D graphics</h2>The game uses a render method called &quot;sprite stacking&quot; to achieve a unique 2.5D effect with pixel art. This creates a convincing 3D space with a free camera for a look that no other game has!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\u2022 Start your own adventure</h2>The world is open and nonlinear!

This encourages exploration instead of relying on set locations for items and bosses. Finding unique items early can make for interesting character builds too!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\u2022 New Update!</h2>A large update will be coming around the corner to add quality of life changes and a new boss + dungeon in 2023!
