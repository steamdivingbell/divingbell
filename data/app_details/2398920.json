{"about_the_game":"Predators is an all new multiplayer horror experience, where you fight with your friends for your life against the most deadly creatures the earth has ever seen, Dinosaurs. Dinosaurs, long extinct and more terrifying than ever, are back, and they see you as prey. Figure out the secrets of the mysterious 'Mesozoic Corporation' and figure out why they are putting you through these horrific trials. <br><br><strong>Survive the Prehistoric Arena</strong><br>With no clue how you got there, you are forced into a large arena that looks straight from the Jurassic period. Use everything around you to survive as you hear something large in the foliage, and it seems to be getting closer with every second!<br><br><strong>New Dinosaur Horror Experience</strong><br>With a wide range of dinosaurs to survive, you will have to use your wits and anything you can find within the arena to survive. Will you have the giant Tyrannosaurus Rex or the much smaller, water bound Baryonyx as your enemy, each game is different and all dinosaurs are different. You will only survive by adapting to the dinosaur you are up against. <br><br><strong>Entertainment at a cost</strong><br>The arena is full of cameras and an echoing voice can be heard over the tannoy. Somebody is watching this madness, but who? The only way to find the truth is to keep surviving, no matter what is thrown at you. <br><br><strong>Unique Multiplayer Gameplay</strong><br>You will have to use your teammates - and you own - strengths to your advantage to get through the arena. Play with up to 3 other friends and survive the arena and climb the leaderboards. With the promise of great riches if you can make a name for yourself in the arena, will you help the others, or use them to your advantage as you fight for your life?<br><br>You have one life.<br>They have thousands of prisoners.<br>Make it count.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2398920/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724958419","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2398920/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1724958419","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2398920/876d83e1fca558e5801f6687b6f2208ef7a225eb/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724958419","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2398920/876d83e1fca558e5801f6687b6f2208ef7a225eb/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724958419","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Predators is an all new multiplayer horror experience, where you fight with your friends for your life against the most deadly creatures the earth has ever seen, Dinosaurs.
