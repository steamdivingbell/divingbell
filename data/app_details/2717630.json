It is a third person Adventure parkour game. Our main character, Lizz, is interested in science. He develops a device in his room, the purpose of which is to make micro-little creatures grow a little bigger. On Lizz's first attempt, something goes wrong and wreaks havoc on the universe. Its neighbors have disappeared and there is no one in the world except animals, various creatures and plants. It is unknown whether Lizz got smaller or everything in the world got bigger. Lizz quickly looks for ways to go to her room. When she reaches her room, the device is damaged and its parts are scattered to different points of the universe. Lizz goes on an adventure to solve this situation and starts looking for the missing pieces.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2717630/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1716407103","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2717630/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1716407103","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2717630/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1716407103","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2717630/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1716407103","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2717630/extras/aboutgame.jpg?t=1716407103\" /><br>The Last Human: GO!
