No axes or pickaxes required, for the treasures you seek lie hidden amidst the rebel-held territories. Sharpen your wits, as your imagination and intelligence guide you to unearth the elusive resources needed to build your way to sustenance. Tables, abandoned structures, and concealed caches hold the keys to your salvation, and with every carefully fashioned creation, you inch closer to defying the odds. Can you engineer your path to survival, turning the remnants of a war-torn world into tools of hope, or will the challenges crush your aspirations? The journey of resilience and invention awaits, where the genius of your mind will carve the path to your very existence.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2526270/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1708068702","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2526270/page.bg.jpg?t=1708068702","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2526270/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1708068702","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2526270/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1708068702","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2586700,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2526270/extras/fight.gif?t=1708068702\" /><br><br>Embark on an epic journey of bravery and mystery in &quot;Son of Killwa,&quot; an enthralling adventure game that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
