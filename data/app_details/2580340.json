These instanced zones are designed specifically for groups of five and require a tank and a healer. The allure of dungeons go beyond the test of strength and teamwork as they contain some of the rarest loot and treasures in the game, offering rewards that significantly surpass what can be found in the shared world. Adventurers will find not just dungeons to explore but also the chance to gain truly powerful gear, weapons and more!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Quests</h2><br>Grimdoria will contain an array of quests in formats familiar to veterans of the genre. As adventurers traverse through the realm of Grimdoria, they'll encounter fantasy-themed narratives enriched by the added depth of voice acting. Every character they meet and every storyline they unravel has its own unique voice. Players can adventure through the world questing on behalf of the many denizens of the realm as many have come to expect from the genre.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Group Up</h2><br>Adventurers in the realm of Grimdoria are able to party up, allowing them to band together in parties of anywhere from 2 to up to 40 adventurers! Taking advantage of this system is required to conquer Grimdoria\u2019s dungeons, embark on epic raids, or explore the biggest dangers and wonders of the shared world. Adventurers are stronger in numbers and many of the greatest threats the realm of Grimdoria face cannot be conquered alone!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PvP Battlegrounds</h2><br>PvP Battlegrounds are the ultimate test for teams of adventurers seeking the thrill of player-vs-player combat. By enrolling in these instanced battlegrounds, players get to join team-based battles that put their skills, strategies, and cooperation to the test. Victory and besting of fellow adventurers will also reward exclusive PvP currency. This exclusive currency can be used to procure specialized gear and equipment specifically designed for PvP encounters. This is but one of the many spoils of war that await you as you fight against adventurers from all around Grimdoria!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mounts</h2><br>Mounts offer adventurers a stylish and efficient way to traverse the expansive world of Grimdoria. Adventurers can collect a variety of mounts, each with its unique aesthetic. These range from the common and practical to the rare and awe-inspiring epic mounts, the latter serving as a prestigious reward from the most challenging content. These epic mounts aren't just a means of faster travel; they're a symbol of achievement and status, letting the riders stand out in a crowd and display their accomplishments to fellow adventurers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Achievements</h2><br>The achievement system is a testament to an adventurer's journey, capturing memorable milestones and exceptional feats. The system encapsulates a wide spectrum of achievement types that cater to every type of adventurer. Whether it's accomplishing challenging tasks, exploring hidden corners of Grimdoria, or conquering the hardest of raid dungeons, every achievement has its place. What's more, some of the most challenging achievements don't just offer bragging rights, but also bestow unique rewards!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Raids</h2><br>Raids in Grimdoria provide adventurers with challenging dungeons of monumental scale. Raids are instanced large-scale dungeons designed for 10-25 adventurers. Similar to dungeons but with amplified complexity, intensity, and of course rewards. Raids will present unique bosses and mechanics that demand exceptional coordination, strategic planning, and high proficiency from adventurers. Success in these raids will provide adventurers access to some of the most potent and prestigious spoils of battle.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Guilds</h2><br>Guilds offer a communal aspect for adventurers establishing a shared sense of unity among adventurers in Grimdoria. Adventurers can band together under a shared banner, creating named guilds that serve as their adventuring collectives. Every quest completed, dungeon conquered, and raid triumphed by the guild members contribute to the collective reputation and standing of the guild. As guilds rise in prominence through their collective deeds, so do the adventurers within it. They're not just a team; they're a community that grows, thrives, and makes a name for itself in the vast expanses of Grimdoria. Guilds offer a home, a shared identity, and a platform for achieving feats and accomplishments.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Holy Trinity</h2><br>At the heart of Grimdoria's gameplay is the classic MMORPG triad: the Tank, the Healer, and the Damage Dealer. This 'Holy Trinity' forms the backbone of the game's combat mechanics and team dynamics, especially within dungeons and raid content. Tanks bear the brunt of enemy onslaughts. Healers mend wounds. Damage Dealers deliver the offensive punch. Each role is crucial, each interdependent, and the balance between them pivotal. Grimdoria's end-game group content is meticulously designed around this trinity for depthful cooperative group-based gameplay.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Target-based Combat</h2><br>Grimdoria pays homage to the golden era of MMORPGs by featuring a robust target-based combat system. Adventurers target their foes explicitly for most spells. This explicit targeting system harks back to the classic days of MMORPG combat and to this day remains a relevant and engaging gameplay mechanic in almost all popular titles of the genre.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Classes</h2><br>Grimdoria's class system brings a plethora of gameplay options, allowing adventurers to step into unique roles that best suit their playstyle. At its alpha testing stage, Grimdoria offers three main class archetypes: the Warrior, the Mage, and the Priest. Each class represents a distinct style of play. A total of nine classes total are planned for Grimdoria\u2019s full release. Additionally, each class features three subclass specializations. These specializations enable adventurers to fine-tune their chosen class offering depth for their character progression. And with no gender-lock on any class, Grimdoria ensures that every adventurer can choose their path freely, embracing the gameplay experience that resonates with them the most.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Subclassing</h2><br>Grimdoria's subclass system adds a layer of depth to each class for adventurers to further refine their chosen class. With up to three subclass specializations per class, players have the opportunity to tailor their spells, abilities and playstyle for the role or class fantasy that suits them best. As adventurers level up, they accrue specialization points that can be distributed within these subclass trees. Each point spent enhances their specialization, unlocking new abilities, enhancing existing ones, or offering unique passive benefits.
