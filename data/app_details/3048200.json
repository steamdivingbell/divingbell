{"about_the_game":"<strong>Rogue Rollout is a roguelike deckbuilder that challenges you to master the dice and strategically choose your path through an ever-increasing gauntlet of rounds.</strong><br><br>Roll dice, score points, and pick artifacts to enhance your gameplay as you aim to reach the highest round possible. Each round requires you to score a set number of points to advance, with the difficulty ramping up as you progress.
