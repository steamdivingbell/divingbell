{"about_the_game":"Survive the Fog is a fast-paced action rogue-lite, with a lot of different builds for each class. The game is all about fighting massive hordes of enemies while experimenting with different combinations of powers and spells. Different characters provide you with various way to approach the battle. <br><br>A mage generally relies on keeping his distance while showering his enemies with different frost, fire or lightning spells.<br><br>The frost mage is usually controlling the battlefield by slowing and freezing enemies. At the start of a run it could look something like this: <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2180250/extras/Small_Blizzard.gif?t=1696507967\" /><br><br>Whereas towards the end it could be upgraded to something like this:<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2180250/extras/massive_blizzard.gif?t=1696507967\" /><br><br>A fire mage would generally take a more destructive approach and perhaps by summoning a fire dragon<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2180250/extras/Fire_Dragon.gif?t=1696507967\" /><br><br>Opposite of the more distanced approach of the mage is the warrior class. It's more centered around being in the middle of the fight, able to utilize different weapons such as a great sword or a katana. To complement this playstyle the warrior regains health points whenever he slays an enemy, allowing you to remain in melee range.<br><br>If you choose one of your weapons to be the great sword you can expect a heavy hitting wide range area of attacks such as:<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2180250/extras/Greatsword.gif?t=1696507967\" /><br><br>On the other hand, a katana wielding warrior relies on high-speed attacks:<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2180250/extras/Katana.gif?t=1696507967\" /><br><br>Those are just few examples of the many abilities the classes possess, they can be further enhanced and modified by powers you obtain whenever you level up or loot a chest. <br><br>Your character can also be empowered by purchasing permanent upgrades from the in-game shop with gems collected solely from slaying monsters. Increasing the map difficulty provides you with a bigger challenge, the enemies health and damage will be increased, but so will be the rewarded gems.<br><br>To further increase the variety of each run, every minute a random encounter will playout, such as:<br>Massive map-wide meteor shower, damaging you and the enemies if struck.<br>Healing areas could be spawned, regenerating healing points for you if you find and remain inside them.<br>And more, but my favorite are the gluttonous chests which have eaten quite a bit of power chests, they are hasty but if you manage to slay them the reward will help you go further in your run.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2180250/extras/chests.gif?t=1696507967\" /><br><br>To add even further to the fun of randomness, there are kill goals which award a powerful random stacking buff for a duration, that can be extend and the value of the buff increased, by slaying more monsters, so try to keep it up for as long as possible and strengthen it to its maximum to help you advance into the later waves of the game. Some buffs are stronger than others and if you get lucky in the nick of time it could save your run, such as Cooldown reduction, when it's fully stacked the value is 90% allowing you to spam abilities with practically no delay.<br><br>Discover all the different possibilities the fog offers!<br><br>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2180250/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1696507967","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2180250/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1696507967","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2180250/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1696507967","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2180250/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1696507967","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Survive the Fog is a fast-paced action rogue-lite, with a lot of different builds for each class.
