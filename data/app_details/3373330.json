{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">An Arsenal Worth of Creatures</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Pik has to dominate more than 20 species on his journey!

Pik wouldn\u2019t hesitate \u2013 he stirs show-quality combat, no matter who he faces! A strong emphasis goes towards fighting moves, and the combat system\u2019s simple, but rewarding nature to make sure packing a punch never feels wrong.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Strengthen Your Abilities!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Collecting <i>Ooze</i> allows you to gather Skill Points and unlock or develop what Pik and his creatures can pull off!
