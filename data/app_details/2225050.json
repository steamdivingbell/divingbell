Raymond Scott\u2019s pioneering electronic works from the 1950s on radio and TV jingles that sold the American dream proved a strong influence, honing in on a vibe to effectively evoke the innocence of utopian ideologies. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Age of Status follows the survivors who have found the only way to stay above water is to ascend above each other. Dan found an artificial sense of safety in a higher class through the relaxing and glamorous tones of evening dinner jazz piano.
