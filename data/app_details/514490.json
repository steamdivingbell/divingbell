Each matrix contain words that wrap around a 3D-cube going left, right, up and down. There are 24 words to discover and the game includes 84 English word categories featuring random words from a large vocabulary of options. To select a word you touch the first letter of the word. Then touch the last letter of the word. You can and may need to spin the cube in between touching the letters. You can actually touch the last letter first and first last. Words can go left, right, up or down so look for them in reverse order as well. Often, the words you need to find will wrap around the sides of the cube adding to the fun. No game will ever play the same and only true wordsmiths will beat this ultimate word-challenge.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">KEY FEATURES</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>84 different word categories (English)<br></li><li>24 random words to each challenge<br></li><li>Rewarding points- and star-system <br></li><li>Beautiful 3D graphics<br></li><li>Great music and sounds<br></li><li>Intuitive controls</li></ul>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/514490?t=1668821511","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/514490/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1668821511","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/514490/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1668821511","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/514490/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1668821511","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Ultimate Word Search 2: Letter Boxed</strong> takes you into a world of mystery where your task is to locate hidden words in a matrix of letters.
