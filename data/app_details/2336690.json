{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Welcome to Grow the Seed, a deck-building strategy game where you can experience the excitement of growing your own seed into a fruit-bearing tree. Use a set of utility cards to grow, cut certain parts, or even manipulate your surroundings to your advantage.

You can grow the roots to search for water or other sources of nutrients, or cut them loose if they're decaying or the tree doesn't have enough food to maintain its size. You can also grow and cut other parts of the tree, such as the stems, leaves, flowers, or fruits. Moreover, you can even manipulate the surroundings to your tree's advantage. Now, all of these actions are limited to only using cards.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2336690/extras/2.png?t=1735868676\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2336690/extras/Slay_The_Spire_Tree.gif?t=1735868676\" />In combat deck-building games, you use cards to inflict damage, shield yourself, or perform other actions. In Grow the Seed, cards are used to grow your tree. You can plant a root or stem toward a specific direction, grow leaves for photosynthesis, or a flower with the hope that it will bloom into a fruit. Well, even if it fails and begins to wither instead, don't fret \u2013 cut it loose! There are no more soils or water that can provide any nutrients or water for photosynthesis? Say no more, add more soils! With cards, of course.
