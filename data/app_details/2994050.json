Use your double jump to dodge enemies and traps, or to reach certain platforms<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs in Ghost'n Goblins, you can only be hit twice before losing a life. The first time, you lose your armor, but you can continue to fight the forces of evil in UNDIES! (Yes, just like in Ghost'n Goblins). Get hit again, however, and you'll lose your life miserably.
