{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Arcadia Issue 008 - September 2021</h2>  Welcome to ARCADIA! Inspired by old-school tabletop magazines, ARCADIA is MCDM's digital magazine for 5th edition GMs and players. We hope you like it! <br> <br><strong> Subclasses of the Hag</strong> by Jessica Marcrum with art from Grace Cheung. Harness the power of wicked fey and fiends with three new subclasses: the Hag warlock patron, the Wicked Witch sorcerous origin, and the bardic College of Grandmother's Tales. If you're a fan of hags (or just witchy goodness) you're going to enjoy the way these subclasses tap into the titular creature's power. <br> <br><strong> Monstrous Components</strong> by V.J. Harris with art from Nick De Spain. This is easily one of the most robust ARCADIA articles yet. Now you can harvest monster parts and use them in your spellcasting. How does feather fall change when you cast it with an angel feather? What happens when you use an ancient red dragon's breath gland to cast fireball? Get to butchering and find the answers! <br> <br><strong> The Emerald Exchange</strong> by Bianca Bickford with art from Elisa Serio and Miska Fredman. Need to buy some magic items? Emerald can help! Just don't ask how her humble little shop acquired that flametongue and helm of teleportation ... yeah, you got us. It was a secret thieves' guild <br> <br>  &quot;","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2254620/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1673360879","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2254620/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1673360879","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2254620/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1673360879","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2254620/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1673360879","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Arcadia Issue 008 - September 2021</h2>  Welcome to ARCADIA!
