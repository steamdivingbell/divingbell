{"about_the_game":"<strong> This product is not eligible for a PDF discount from Paizo</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Pathfinder Society Quest #2: Unforgiving Fire</h2><strong> A Pathfinder Society Quest designed for levels 1-4 (Subtiers 1-2 and 3-4).</strong><br>Venture-Captain Rashmivati Melipdra has called for a group of Pathfinders to travel to Jalmeray and assist her in retrieving a stolen relic. A former member of the Monastery of Unblinking Flame, Melipdra was in the process of negotiating with the monastery for custody of some of their most ancient and historically significant training devices. Before the deal could be completed, a rogue monk stole one of the relics and fled the monastery for the island of Veedesha. There, the monk seeks to use her training and the stolen devices to create a new competing monastery. As the PCs travel to a lawless island controlled by bandits and martial artists, they must find a way to retrieve the stolen goods from the new master of the Monastery of Unforgiving Fire.<br><i>Written by</i> <strong> Leo Glass</strong> .<br><strong> Scenario Tags</strong> : None<br><i>This product is not a PDF or accessible outside of Fantasy Grounds.
