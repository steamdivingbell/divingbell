The game is fair and offers a great challenge... The fantastic soundtrack and fine-tuned controls far outweigh any graphical issues....  The soundtrack and finely tuned controls elevated the game as a whole, and it\u2019s definitely a solid title for the right audience... New Terra is a very encouraging start for WINTERYEAR Studios.\u201d<br>8.5/10 \u2013 Handheld Gaming Community<br><br>\u201cLong anticipated and worth the wait! Smooth game play, really beautiful poster-ready artwork, great music. Surprising attention to detail and some pretty cool little touches, from the running men graphic to the one liners like &quot;stop touching stuff with your ship.&quot; It's a fun game but challenging - luckily the difficulty settings are your friend, especially when your fuel level is not. Action is kind of reminiscent of traditional arcade games but way cooler.
