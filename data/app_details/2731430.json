{"about_the_game":"Military gliders, as a mass phenomenon, belong almost entirely to the World War II era. The development of this class of airborne equipment began in the pre-war years, and they were used in the war by almost all the major participants. The most significant combat episode involving the use of gliders was, of course, the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied France in June 1944. The use of gliders was massive: more than 800 were used to transport infantry units and their equipment during Operation Overlord, and the main hero of this action was the American CG-4 glider. In total, more than 2000 gliders of this model were delivered to England, but only a little more than 1000 were combat-ready at the beginning of the operation. Still a huge number. A few months later, during the ill-fated airborne Operation Market Garden, more than 1500 gliders were used.<br><br>It is interesting to note that the &quot;large military glider&quot; as a class, as suddenly as it appeared before the Second World War, disappeared almost immediately after it. The disappearance occurred before the aviation epoch had changed forever, when new anti-aircraft weapons or new interceptors would have devalued all the advantages of this type of vehicle, and the development of helicopter technology had not yet reached the level to become an important factor in the capabilities of airborne forces. However, the use of gliders was almost immediately abandoned, most likely due to high losses among the airborne troops which reached 40%. Nevertheless, you have the opportunity to experience this period of history in the world of our simulator.<br><br>In our simulator, the visual model of the glider was restored with great care and our engineers recreated in its new virtual life all the main features of its control and use. It should be noted that this is a new class of objects for our simulator and we have developed a number of technologies to make its realization possible - for example, a flexible towing cable.<br><br>In addition to Quick Mission Builder and Multiplayer modes, you can fly it in its own scenario &quot;Chicago Night&quot; if you have Normandy module and it's planned to add glider flying scenarios to Advanced Quick Mission mode soon. If you have Normandy and/or Bodenplatte modules and C-47 Collector Plane, you can get glider towing missions during major airborne operations - Overlord, Market Garden and Varsity.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Length: 14.63 m<br></li><li>Wingspan: 25,48 m<br></li><li>Wing surface: 79,20 m\u00b2</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Loadouts</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>13 airborne troopers with ammunition (1415 kg).<br></li><li>Willys MB 1\u20444 ton 4x4 utility truck (1630 kg).<br></li><li>1000 kg of military cargo.<br></li><li>Brake chute.<br></li><li>.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Skins (tactical numbers are customizable)</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Default USAAF markings with June 6th - July 6th, 1944 invasion stripes.<br></li><li>Default USAAF markings with August 25th, 1944 - January 3rd, 1945 invasion stripes.</li></ul><br><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Aircraft 3D model developed by Ugra Media studio.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2731430/extras/Ugra600.png?t=1734534564\" /></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2731430/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734534564","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2731430/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1734534564","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2731430/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734534564","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2731430/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734534564","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Military gliders, as a mass phenomenon, belong almost entirely to the World War II era.
