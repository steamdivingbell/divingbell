{"about_the_game":"Experience the delightful, mischievous digital card game, in single-player, that will have you cheering with joy, getting your own back and collecting lots of cute quirky characters. Go Quirk! is a digital card game where you collect your favourite characters, then block, steal and stop your way to victory. Based on the traditional card game rules of Go Fish, with a new and exciting twist.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere's lots going on in a game of Go Quirk!, you'll be memorising where characters are and who's exchanged cards, strategizing your gameplay with action cards and making smart decisions on which cards to play and when! This is your route to winning a game and celebrating with the most Quirks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut it doesn't stop there! All the Quirks you've collected get added to your sticker book for your selected deck. This is where you can set goals and change the way you play the game; seeking out specific Quirks to complete your sticker collection. Once all 13 characters have been unlocked for your deck, you'll unlock the next deck and experience 13 new characters. There are 4 decks to complete. Can you collect them all?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCollect the same character more than once? No problem. Now's your chance to make them bronze, silver and gold in your sticker book!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPart collectathon, part memory game, all card game. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach game takes roughly 5 minutes to play.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe app is based on the real physical card game Quirk! by Gibsons.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"The Non-Exploding Type...","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3062620/5313b7b9f50d964133acaf220a77c4042bdf3269.jpg"},{"name":"I don't want to be a pie...","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3062620/2a799b1d838819be232b1c6d2d021c6706a8055e.jpg"},{"name":"Who let the...","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3062620/255418a8a793ff7d002517a5ed472b323a625a6e.jpg"},{"name":"Should we talk about the elephant in the room?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3062620/28ee9bc73a6751873973ce4715db87ba565976af.jpg"},{"name":"Flamiiiiiingo","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3062620/a7bc4a5a458d3daceff317d3935cae362a171771.jpg"},{"name":"Just can't wait to be king","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3062620/5f2f8bc7bff33e3fb243de8412004e8f4465328b.jpg"},{"name":"There is no evil!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3062620/987f1bc2054950f38d7b00243a7c00a1672165f7.jpg"},{"name":"Smile and wave, boys, smile and wave","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3062620/2fb9a96855f6b38a67235a8651376a0a7008be04.jpg"},{"name":"Got bacon?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3062620/765017290ee320e2173ad2ff452315f18aa5c724.jpg"},{"name":"Pirates of the Quirkibean","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3062620/1761d080186cebf2fb88077af502902a1eca5167.jpg"}],"total":58},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3062620/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724624208","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3062620/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1724624208","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3062620/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724624208","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3062620/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724624208","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Experience the delightful, mischievous digital card game, in single-player, that will have you cheering with joy, getting your own back and collecting lots of cute quirky characters.
