{"about_the_game":"Splice is an experimental and artistic puzzler. Immerse yourself in its microbial world and start splicing! Every level (&quot;strand&quot;) consists of a number of cells that you will need to rearrange into a target structure in several moves (&quot;splices&quot;). Exploration and experimentation are key in determining how the curious little cells react to each other. Predict the sequence of splices you'll have to make in order to successfully arrange each strand. Re-sequence, mutate, and splice your way through this unique puzzle experience, and you'll exercise your ability to visualize sequential series of shapes over time. Solve your way to the final strands and you'll be left with a heady sense of mental accomplishment!  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSplice is the fourth title out of Cipher Prime Studios, and was the Best Puzzle Game winner of the 2011 Intel Level Up contest.","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/212860/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732578357","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/212860/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732578357","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Splice is an experimental and artistic puzzler.
