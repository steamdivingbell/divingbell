They aren\u2019t just from Africa , they\u2019re from Eritrea and Senegal. Iranian immigrants aren\u2019t just Muslims in the US, they\u2019re conflicted about a homeland that expelled their parents and remains very much in transition. The show loves to dwell on the smaller moments, with dialogue that skillfully jumps from banter and sarcasm to bittersweet and touching.\u201d<br>Stareable<br><br>\u201c[The characters] are neither tarted up in glamour drag to make them presentable, nor visualized pathetically. They have the natural beauty of people, and yes, these people are looking good. We meet them in a world made up of moments not long arcs; moving like water from one piece of New York to another, much in the manner of Hal Hartley films. No one asks for our understanding or compassion; they all shimmer invitingly in their personhood. Moreover, they embody what so many have noted about the clarity of perception of \u2018outsider.\u2019\u201d<br>Alliance of Women Film Journalists<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/946350/ss_3392000799acef54a1ca54bdbe9abe75f508979c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1553557422","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/946350/ss_3392000799acef54a1ca54bdbe9abe75f508979c.600x338.jpg?t=1553557422"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/946350/ss_03d7d7e3e4ec954367e708f1a47a1c066fddd52d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1553557422","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/946350/ss_03d7d7e3e4ec954367e708f1a47a1c066fddd52d.600x338.jpg?t=1553557422"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/946350/ss_831120aa686dd74c621ef9eba78d8c71b372bbea.1920x1080.jpg?t=1553557422","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/946350/ss_831120aa686dd74c621ef9eba78d8c71b372bbea.600x338.jpg?t=1553557422"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/946350/ss_06eedd5cdf127ef3475f26c97a0a3ea850ef961f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1553557422","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/946350/ss_06eedd5cdf127ef3475f26c97a0a3ea850ef961f.600x338.jpg?t=1553557422"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/946350/ss_90d56b10aeb0e24c099461d1d5580fcda3b5ce40.1920x1080.jpg?t=1553557422","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/946350/ss_90d56b10aeb0e24c099461d1d5580fcda3b5ce40.600x338.jpg?t=1553557422"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/946350/ss_b3761e429d8e844bb720070b1ccf66d6b206a58e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1553557422","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/946350/ss_b3761e429d8e844bb720070b1ccf66d6b206a58e.600x338.jpg?t=1553557422"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/946350/ss_ae4d8e73d0976fb90977d7dee6a90478ef207339.1920x1080.jpg?t=1553557422","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/946350/ss_ae4d8e73d0976fb90977d7dee6a90478ef207339.600x338.jpg?t=1553557422"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/946350/ss_22c4cef1dbe4c6ec5306e94242118ddf1057effe.1920x1080.jpg?t=1553557422","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/946350/ss_22c4cef1dbe4c6ec5306e94242118ddf1057effe.600x338.jpg?t=1553557422"},{"id":8,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/946350/ss_d040dca55870d880ad52dff08316f86cbf38e54e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1553557422","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/946350/ss_d040dca55870d880ad52dff08316f86cbf38e54e.600x338.jpg?t=1553557422"},{"id":9,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/946350/ss_73025fce1c8a391b962788b6fc9860552a3e7a30.1920x1080.jpg?t=1553557422","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/946350/ss_73025fce1c8a391b962788b6fc9860552a3e7a30.600x338.jpg?t=1553557422"},{"id":10,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/946350/ss_3873f9bf3c0fac73da1f843f58c900debfe4a46e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1553557422","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/946350/ss_3873f9bf3c0fac73da1f843f58c900debfe4a46e.600x338.jpg?t=1553557422"},{"id":11,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/946350/ss_c424784961fd1a9ba05f9484fbbf2e6bab512219.1920x1080.jpg?t=1553557422","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/946350/ss_c424784961fd1a9ba05f9484fbbf2e6bab512219.600x338.jpg?t=1553557422"}],"short_description":"Fiction Webseries.
