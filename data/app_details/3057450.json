You will plunge into the midst of the &quot;Great War&quot;, the day when the world plunged into darkness. You will have to fight with magicians and try to save your life in the chaos that is happening! However... many years will pass, and already your children will be fighting for survival!

There were no conquered and conquered, the sky was covered with the ashes of war for centuries. When people came to the surface again and saw the rays of the sun, they were overtaken by new threats. People were divided into factions, and each had its own philosophy. You are the head of a faction of &quot;Scavengers&quot; - people who are trying in vain to bring back balance to this world, which everyone has long forgotten about. You have a high position among the people, a small army and influence, but this is not enough to prevent the death of mankind. The strongest faction, a huge Horde consisting of magicians and their necromancer brothers, wants to conquer new lands. Everyone will have to unite in the face of a common threat. Go a long way, overcoming many obstacles, making new allies and completing the history of this world!
