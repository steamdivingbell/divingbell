More than a century ago, the Dreadblight consumed the world. Only the Bleaklight, a mysterious everlasting flame, protects Meelu and his friends from the encroaching darkness. But when the Bleaklight's protection wanes, the Dreadblight monsters invade at nightfall. Meelu and the other villagers must defend their home - the last bastion of humanity - or their light will be snuffed out for good.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Defend The Village!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Gather materials in the forest and mines during the day to build a wide selection of Offensive, Defensive, and Utility towers to prevent monsters from reaching the Bleaklight. Each tower can be upgraded and evolved to expand its power. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The towers are built on a grid system, allowing you creative freedom to funnel the monsters as they invade the village at night. Build your fortifications wisely, for the monsters will tear through anything that blocks their path!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2820610/extras/tower_gif-optimize.gif?t=1731537218\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Master Your Powers</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Level up Meelu by spending Mastery Points in four trees - Weapon Mastery, Skill Mastery, Body Mastery, and Mind Mastery. Unlock nodes in these trees to gain powerful upgrades, additional skills, and features that encourage a variety of playstyles. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Meelu can use many different weapons - Swords, Bows, Shields, Fists, Magic Focus, and more to come. Each weapon has a unique Weapon Ability tree that levels up as you fight with the associated weapon. As you get stronger, you'll learn how to swap weapons mid-fight and apply abilities from different trees to your weapons.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Village Life</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Bleaklight Falls is full of villagers with tales to tell.  Use the villagers' skills to craft, upgrade, and alter your gear, and to build powerful defensive structures. Grow your friendship with the villagers through branching dialogue options, questlines, and gifts. If your bonds are strong enough, your friends will join the nightly fight against the monsters. Though Meelu is too young to find love himself, he can play Matchmaker for the adults in the village!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2820610/extras/sheradel-optimize.gif?t=1731537218\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ARPG-Style Loot</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Create your ideal build by collecting loot from enemies, crafting and upgrading gear, and altering their stats to your liking.
