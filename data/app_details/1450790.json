{"about_the_game":"The floor is lava! Relive your childhood dream-races around the house in this fast-paced, action-packed arcade racing game.<br><br>Crazy Wheels is a fast-paced, action-packed arcade racing game. Over a decade ago, I was in the Virgin Megastore in London with my family. Looking through the store aisles for games, we stumbled across 2 isolated machines running a new car game: Micromachine V2 Turbo. The machines were free, so my brother and I decided to give it a try. By the time we finished, a line-up of people had formed behind us waiting for their turn to play. Ever since, our love for the game has been unconditional: we picked it up and played it repeatedly over the years, giving us some unforgettable multiplayer memories.<br><br>After this amazing experience, we played a few other excellent arcade racers, like Ignition and Revolt, to name my favorites. Crazy Wheels was born from the memories of these gaming sessions and the intense fun it provided us, with 4 people playing on the same keyboard.<br><br>If you also fondly remember this golden age of racing games, then Crazy Wheels is for you!
