{"about_the_game":"In this game, players take on the role of Jana, a 10-year-old girl who was sheltered by Yemanj\u00e1 when the actions of men caused a great flood and the end of the first humanity. When humanity resurged and began to grow again, men once again forgot the importance of respecting the forces of nature, and Jana needs to take care of the environment, save the animals, and even the humans themselves from the environmental disasters they cause. This game will take you on a journey through a rich and vibrant world inspired by Afro-Brazilian mythology. Will you help Jana in her mission to protect the earth and its inhabitants?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2400100/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1713221797","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2400100/page.bg.jpg?t=1713221797","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2400100/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1713221797","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2400100/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1713221797","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In this game, players take on the role of Jana, a 10-year-old girl who was sheltered by Yemanj\u00e1 when the actions of men caused a great flood and the end of the first humanity.
