{"about_the_game":"As you experience sleep paralysis in an abandoned setting, upon discovering the truth, you collapse and wake up convinced you've experienced sleep paralysis, unsure if you're still trapped in that state. Until, after being struck by the storm, you regain consciousness and find yourself in a desolate snow-covered forest. You have no idea how you got there or who you are, but you decide to get up and find out what happened. Your amnesia will be your greatest enemy as you try to unravel the secrets of this empty village; only you and your inner strength can guide you through the darkness to face your greatest adversary: fear.<br><br>Suddenly, you realize you remember nothing, but the cold reminds you that you're in mortal danger. You must find shelter before it's too late, before paralysis becomes your new enemy and a beast awakens, intensifying attacks of madness.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1804730/extras/01.jpg?t=1726755678\" /><br><br><strong>Join our community Discord server!</strong> Enjoy exclusive benefits, prizes, and giveaways.
