A motley crew of outrageous playable characters with a vast arsenal of customizable jets and weapons will fly and fight their way through 12 dangerous levels scattered across 4 distinct environments. Multiple enemy aircraft, turrets, tanks, and huge bosses stand in the way, but nothing can stop Punk A.F.!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/889500/extras/text_levels-fs8.png?t=1712992049\" /><br>Battle through exploited English countrysides, tropical island fortresses, deadly toxic mines, and much worse!<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/889500/extras/punkaf_gif_w1.gif?t=1712992049\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/889500/extras/text_bosses-fs8.png?t=1712992049\" /><br>Shoot the fuck out of evil scumbag bosses that truly deserve to die!<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/889500/extras/punkaf_gif_w2.gif?t=1712992049\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/889500/extras/text_storyline-fs8.png?t=1712992049\" /><br>Elaborate and shocking narrative featuring an entire team of degenerate delinquents immersed in a world of grit, grime, betrayal, and recreational drugs.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/889500/extras/banner_description.png?t=1712992049\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/889500/extras/text_enemies-fs8.png?t=1712992049\" /><br>Discover and destroy an army of dangerous sycophants and shitheads.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/889500/extras/punkaf_gif_w3.gif?t=1712992049\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/889500/extras/text_weapons-fs8.png?t=1712992049\" /><br>Uncover all the firepower that street cred can buy, unlock ships with different abilities, and a vast explosive arsenal to equip them with.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/889500/extras/weapons_description.png?t=1712992049\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/889500/extras/text_coop-fs8.png?t=1712992049\" /><br>Be a one jet army or team up with a friend and show what Punk A.F. can do as a squad!<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/889500/extras/punkaf_gif_w4.gif?t=1712992049\" /><br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/889500/extras/text_overview.png?t=1712992049\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> a true to-the-core punk experience<br></li><li> 12 gorgeous levels to explore and fight through<br></li><li> boss battles at the end of each level<br></li><li> 7+ customizable jets and characters<br></li><li> over 42 air and ground weapons to unlock and choose from<br></li><li> intricate bombing system<br></li><li> 30+ different aircraft, tanks, and turrets to defeat<br></li><li> crazy storyline with comic-style panels<br></li><li> 4 biomes to traverse<br></li><li> play solo or with a friend<br></li><li> online highscores, achievements, and statistics<br></li><li> original procedural punk soundtrack</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/889500/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1712992049","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/889500/page.bg.jpg?t=1712992049","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/889500/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1712992049","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/889500/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1712992049","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Cartoon violence, cursing, crude language, mention of illegal drugs, gore."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/889500/extras/text_intro_leftalign.png?t=1712992049\" /><br>Punk A.F. is a gorgeous and brutal hand-drawn old-school vertical-scrolling 2D shooter game currently developed for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
