Hoping to turn the page, Jespar accepts a mysterious invitation into the beautiful but dangerous archipelago of Kilay\u2014and everything changes. Plagued by boiling social tensions and terrorism, the tropical empire is edging ever closer to civil war. Kilay\u2019s merchant king may be the only one able to prevent this catastrophe, but he has fallen into a preternatural coma\u2014and it\u2019s Jespar\u2019s job to figure out who or what caused it.
