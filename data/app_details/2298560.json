{"about_the_game":"Well, you know what it is - to play hockey. A split of second to lift up your eyes and make a decision, splashes of ice into your face, feeling of flight and a great speed... Here it is - welcome! First person mode gives you a full sense of presense, realistic physical puck and only a short moment to escape the colision! You can invite friends, build a team and play online, or try your luck and play alone offline with an AI partner against exstra smart AI guys. <br />\r\nHot Ice was conceived and developed as an alternative to regular classic hockey simulators - presenting you a feeling and comfort of a spectator. You will find nothing of this kind in Hot Ice!) It's overhelmingly swift, tough and live. You control your player and drive the puck with a mouse - giving it the desired velociy and direction - lift it or let it go low, pass it to your partner or shoot. <br />\r\nYou can push, escape collisions by jumping or catch and tumble someone trying to push you.<br />\r\nWe hope you will enjoy our game and have a real fun and a nice time with friends.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2298560/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1680214036","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2298560/page.bg.jpg?t=1680214036","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2298560/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1680214036","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2298560/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1680214036","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Well, you know what it is - to play hockey.
