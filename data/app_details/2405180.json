{"about_the_game":"The Heroes of Orn: Darkness Demo consists of 1 level, which usually takes 1-2 hours to complete. Updates for the demo will be released as the game is further developed.<br><br>Heroes of Orn: Darkness is a fantasy base building RTS with a twist - you cannot directly control your units. Build and manage your kingdom and watch as your heroes explore, fight, and grow stronger.<br><br><br><strong>Game Features</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Build your kingdom.</strong>  You can defend an area with a Guard Tower, increase your gold with a Marketplace, and provide new equipment to heroes with a Blacksmith. Many buildings can be built and upgraded to gain various benefits as you build up your power.<br></li><li><strong>Recruit heroes to fight for you.</strong> Heroes will make their own decisions but can be influenced by you. They will fight, do quests, shop, and take on dungeons. Your heroes will become more powerful in many ways: gaining increased stats, new abilities, new masteries, and more. <br></li><li><strong>Choose between different classes for your heroes.</strong> There are four starting hero classes to choose from, each with their own strengths: the Fighter, a tough and durable melee hero; the Scout, a quick and nimble hero that poisons with each attack; the Evoker, a powerful magic user that deals damage from a distance; and the Healer, a supportive magic user that can heal allies. As your heroes gain experience and level up, they can be upgraded into more powerful classes that are more specialized.<br></li><li><strong>Use quests to influence your heroes.</strong> Quests are a powerful tool for influencing your heroes' actions in Heroes of Orn: Darkness. By paying gold to start a quest, you can influence your heroes to explore an area, kill an enemy, defend a location, or escort a target. Completing these quests will earn your heroes the very gold you spent, which they can use to purchase upgrades. Quests provide a direct and engaging way to interact with your heroes and shape the course of your kingdom's growth.<br></li><li><strong>Research upgrades for your kingdom.</strong> The research system offers a diverse range of possible upgrades to improve your kingdom's economy, defenses, stats of your units, and more. These upgrades provide valuable utility to help your kingdom thrive, and can offer different playstyles depending on the choices you make. Researching upgrades requires mana, but the benefits can be substantial and are crucial to your kingdom's long-term success. Choose your upgrades wisely to shape the strengths of your kingdom and ensure its prosperity.<br></li><li><strong>Use spells to give yourself an advantage.</strong> The spells system allows you to cast a variety of spells to gain an advantage in combat or to aid your kingdom's development. You can purchase and cast spells that deal damage to enemies, buff your units, increase your resource production, and other effects. Using the multicast mechanic, you can quickly cast the same spell multiple times in a row, but at the cost of mana, a valuable resource.</li></ul>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2405180?t=1723528872","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2405180?t=1723528872","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2405180/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1723528872","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2405180/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1723528872","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Heroes of Orn: Darkness Demo consists of 1 level, which usually takes 1-2 hours to complete.
