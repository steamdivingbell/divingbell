{"about_the_game":"<i>Enid</i> is a \u00be perspective, single-player RPG with a retro feel, wherein the player collects objects and completes tasks for their fantastical friend - an anthropomorphic fire named <i>Enid</i>! The core gameplay hearkens back to a nostalgic era, drawing inspiration from classic games (as well as newer indie titles) like <i>Harvest Moon</i>, <i>Pikmin</i>, <i>Stardew Valley</i>,<i> Celeste</i>, and <i>A Short Hike</i>. Imagine a laid-back, lo-fi exploration RPG where the player takes care of their new pal, who reveals bits and pieces of a grander and secret narrative as they help one another move forward - all this in tightly packaged, easy to play minigames! Above all, Enid is a game about exploring, collecting, solving, and progressing through manageable, bite-sized chunks of gameplay and story!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2376470/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1682608632","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2376470/page.bg.jpg?t=1682608632","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2376470/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1682608632","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2376470/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1682608632","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<i>Enid</i> is a \u00be perspective, single-player RPG with a retro feel, wherein the player collects objects and completes tasks for their fantastical friend - an anthropomorphic fire named <i>Enid</i>!
