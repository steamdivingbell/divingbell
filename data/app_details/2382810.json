{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dream Channel Zero tells the tale of a boy named Akira, who one day gets suddenly and inexplicably sucked into the world of a mysterious video game. There, he meets Rumiko\u2014a seemingly normal girl in a teal blue hoodie\u2014and the two team up to conquer whatever perils this strange virtual world might throw at them, and hopefully find a way out.
