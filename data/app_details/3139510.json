{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Wungo Dungo Surprise is a physics based local 1v1 fighting game. There\u2019s no combos or moveset, or roster. There\u2019s no lore or story. The goal is just to win every encounter and see how many times you can win.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There\u2019s a single player mode against a bot, and a local 1v1 mode, first to 3. There are no extra characters or stages. Health isn\u2019t automatically regained at the end of each round so it\u2019s a case of seeing how many rounds you can go for in a row.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">For the gameplay, there\u2019s a punch, a kick, 4 dodges, 3 weapons, and 11 powers. The core of the gameplay is reacting to the punch direction of the enemy, and the other moves are sprinkles of variation/decision making on top of that. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">At the end of each round you get the choice of one of 11 powers, and to regain health/dodges/kicks. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game itself is fully physics based, i.e. every limb of the character is fully controlled by physics and obeys newtons laws, allowing for some interesting interactions, such as being able to ragdoll at any time. As part of the physics system, momentum is conserved, and as such while in the air you\u2019re purely at the whims of momentum and gravity, which means stuff like throwing objects or front flips must be well timed, which can lead to some fun moments and difficulty.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3139510/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736465179","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3139510/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1736465179","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3139510/77f26793d8c2dfc8d68cff862d9e63d474a873ca/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736465179","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3139510/77f26793d8c2dfc8d68cff862d9e63d474a873ca/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736465179","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Wungo Dungo Surprise is a physics based local 1v1 fighting game.
