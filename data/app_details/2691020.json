{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>LIMINOUS</strong> is a first-person survival horror game. An immersive experience meant to flip the book on the genre, with just as many reasons to find danger as there are to avoid it. You'll find yourself in the shoes of resident explorer, Sydney, tasked with exploring unknown gaps in our reality in search of anything worth finding.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>WORLDS BEYOND</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Venture into the unknown, documenting discoveries and solving the mysteries of worlds we can't quite explain. Using the new dimensional portal, you'll find yourself in worlds small and large, familiar and not. Solve puzzles, log your findings, and steer clear of danger while venturing into this untold story. Make no mistake, this is a largely linear story, and remember, you're an intruder in these domains. Not every new face is a friendly one.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>TOOLS OF THE TRADE</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">While you'll be traveling alone, you aren't without help. The boys in the lab are just a long-distance interdimensional transmitter away, always coming up with new tools to help you on your not-so-optional quest. Your discoveries, and anything you can bring back to the lab, will help fund these new tools to aid you on your journey. Best be cautious, however, as the story will continue to be told, whether you're prepared for it or not.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>This is a story and project crafted by a solo developer.
