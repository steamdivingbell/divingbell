To make your wage you will be tasked with digging up graves on the premises and looting them of their valuables. While doing your job, you stumble upon some burnt bones that were buried with a body. You wonder what these are but continue doing your work. While sleeping, you are confronted and made aware that the bones belong to the demonic presence at the church and that it wants them back. You were also told if you find anything of interest to place it on the altar for the reverend.<br><br>Maybe finding all the burnt bones will stop the activity? What is the worst that could happen?<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2818980/extras/Features.png?t=1723473898\" /><br>During your play-through you will be required to dig up 3 graves during the night to be able to sleep and restart the day. In order to win the game, you will need to dig up 6 burnt bones and place them back in the mausoleum or on top of the altar. Each grave you dig up will contain valuables that you will loot and put in a valuables box that will be sold by the reverend and your cut will be given to you the following morning. In addition to the valuables, the graves may also include compartments that need to be unlocked from a lockpick, which may be purchased from the Paranormal Pantry (an in-game website). <br><br>You will need to collect money to be able to purchase items from the Paranormal Pantry website. These items will help defend yourself against the demonic presence that is at the church. You will also be able to purchase items and upgrades that benefit you and help increase your abilities within the game. Items can be purchased to be delivered the next day or for an increased price to have instant delivery. <br><br>While demonic activity is occurring in the church, sometimes the demon will cause part of the church to grow corrupted. Corruption will increase the demonic activity over time and make the demon stronger. If the demon gets too strong, it will be able to manifest itself and kill you. The corruption will grow over time and must be dealt with as soon as you see it by using various items on it which can be purchased through the Paranormal Pantry shop.<br><br>Every night after your 3 digs you will be able to sleep. Sleeping restarts the night and you will be paid for your previous nights plundering. The demon will also grow stronger with each night you sleep. It will be up to you to determine how many graves you wish to dig solely for valuables or graves you dig up to find all of the missing burnt bones. There can be up to 72 grave sites active, so digging up the correct grave will require you to use items purchasable from the Paranormal Pantry and discover clues about which grave sites could potentially contain the desecrated bones.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Saving is only available on the Standard Difficulty.
