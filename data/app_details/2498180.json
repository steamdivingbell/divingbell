{"about_the_game":"Trial edition has been published, let me know if you have any questions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is the story of a college student's whining, a collision between ideals and reality, a story about the trade-off between academics and interests.<br />\r\nWhen I first entered college, I didn't know what my goal was, and my schedule didn't give me time to think. I had to go with the flow, following in the footsteps of most people, trying to get good grades, graduate, and find a job in a major that everyone thought had a &quot;money&quot; future.<br />\r\nAfter one semester, I barely adapted to college life, but at that time I realized that there was an insurmountable gap between me and others. In some things, even if I worked harder than others, I could not surpass their level, and when these things included &quot;academics&quot;, I was at a loss.<br />\r\nI was tired of dealing with the pressure of school work and often thought about what I should do. I found out that what I was going through was not an isolated case, there were hundreds of &quot;me&quot; who were also depressed, and by chance, I became friends with one of them ......<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe core mechanic of this game is to establish a causal link between events based on the description of events. To achieve this, sometimes you need to make different behavioral choices, observe the changes in the description of events, and look for clues. On top of that, you may need to discover hidden events, as well as make the ending events meet specific requirements.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2498180/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1692618620","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2498180/page.bg.jpg?t=1692618620","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2498180/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1692618620","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2498180/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1692618620","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2515090,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Trial edition has been published, let me know if you have any questions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is the story of a college student's whining, a collision between ideals and reality, a story about the trade-off between academics and interests.<br />\r\nWhen I first entered college, I didn't know what my goal was, and my schedule didn't give me time to think.
