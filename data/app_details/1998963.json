{"about_the_game":"Experience the challenge of hauling a nation\u2019s freight industry on the back of your 4000-horsepower shoulders. Tackle stunning mountain ranges and blinding deserts as you tote tonnage through the winding curves of California with Train Sim World 3: Cajon Pass. <br> <br>Climb aboard the masterclass in design that is the ES44C4, a state-of-the-art diesel electric locomotive capable of incredible tractive effort. Operated by BNSF in their hundreds, this beast of a machine makes easy work of any heavy load and is primed to do battle with the fierce grades and harsh conditions of the Cajon Pass. <br> <br>Sit down in the classic cab of the venerable SD40-2, an all-American hero which is nationwide-renowned for its yesteryear mainline service. Now a veteran, the SD40-2 is kept to secondary duties, as such you will be in charge of local working and switching in yards and industries. <br> <br>Haul and interact with a wide variety of freight cars along the way. The world revolves on shipping containers, carry these on rails with the Maxi Stack IV cars. Keep the automotive industry turning over by delivering cars in the Autoracks. Fuel up and bear the responsibility of flammables with tanker cars. Deliver a multitude of loads aboard the Boxcars and Bulkhead Flat Cars. <br> <br>Ride and operate trains in mountains and deserts, complete trackside tasks, or simply go railfanning from your favourite vantage point.
