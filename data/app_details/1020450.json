Ranking up also increases attributes such as stamina, ammo capacity, weapon accuracy, and even how quickly a unit will raise or lower a flag to take over a building. Actions such as running, rolling, and throwing grenades require stamina, and if a unit\u2019s stamina runs out they become exhausted and must wait a short period to catch their breath. Outside of battle, the player can use experience points earned during battle to unlock unit-specific and global training and weapon upgrades as well as HQ abilities like ammo drops, paratroopers, and air strikes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mission Variety</h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1020450/extras/TWBI_Beta502_MissionVariety_Steam.jpg?t=1686009289\" /><br>While some missions see you attack the enemy head on, others involve building up a base using engineers, rescuing prisoners behind enemy lines using a lone sniper, fighting against your own defecting forces, traditional &quot;boss&quot; fights, and even battling it out at sea, at night, or on a ski slope. In addition to the built-in campaign missions, There Will Be Ink includes a map editor to design your own battlefields from scrap. Or, if you're not feeling creative, be sure to check out the &quot;Quick Battle&quot; option, which allows you to choose a few variables using sliders and toggles and then jump into a random map.
