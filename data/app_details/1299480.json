The Fabled Woods is a narrative short story. I designed the game to be comfortably enjoyed in one session without interruptions. Therefore, the average player more than likely won't take longer than 90 minutes to finish it. If that is too short of a game for you, I would recommend not purchasing The Fabled Woods.
