{"about_the_game":"DEATHWATCH is a horror game in which you are tasked to observe haunted locations, log supernatural events and eradicate any potential paranormal threats. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou'll need to keep a keen eye on every camera and even your present location for any supernatural occurences. Possible events vary from Audio to Victims and paranormal sightings, plus many more. Using your computer systems you must log each event to gather enough data to eliminate the entity, before it eliminates you! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDEATHWATCH puts you in a vulnerable state where your only chance of survival is to succesfully log enough supernatural events in order to survive the night. You need to constantly be aware of your own surroundings because you may not be the only one observing.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFull Twitch integration, view your live chat in game while your viewers observe with you and potentially disrupt or even aid your playthrough. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you want to dial up the horror, try DEATHWATCH in VR. Feel like you're really there and truly being watched.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach location contains 100's of events so no two playthroughs are ever the same.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"North Pines Cabin Cleansed","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2165030/2d89eb3275e74fe67caf8cb7752c208967941c98.jpg"},{"name":"Murphy's Farm Cleansed","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2165030/3d0f99a59b04d712327249b4ffee7a726f7cedc6.jpg"},{"name":"Hellbound Hospital Cleansed","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2165030/efc09b6f2e88756a61af8c9d500f1be9f9648561.jpg"},{"name":"UMB Lab Cleansed","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2165030/79c734a4607b75e66d17008f99aabf7159fb09ba.jpg"},{"name":"All Locations Cleansed!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2165030/d51b9b10fd6b2f699160536a2f5450d8c43c66f2.jpg"},{"name":"Once is enough!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2165030/9ec7216d965a6ca8677d7af05d229a281dac6cbf.jpg"},{"name":"Guess it wasn't!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2165030/1789689695158af7842475ea7226d6b20312c93c.jpg"},{"name":"Quick Deliverance","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2165030/1ba4d0db40112956fffbcb714a1d1d05f9431927.jpg"},{"name":"Master Viewer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2165030/a9e62f445990b44899ae4d2824be2bb844ba450c.jpg"},{"name":"Find the tall boy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2165030/e1cb4d81bc8ea2a98b375b0d1d6641beac9759c4.jpg"}],"total":14},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2165030/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1695240102","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2165030/page.bg.jpg?t=1695240102","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2165030/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1695240102","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2165030/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1695240102","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Supported","id":53},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Depicts victims with potential gore, viscera and limb detachment.
