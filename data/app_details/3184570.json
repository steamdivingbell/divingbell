For success, it is important to look for useful items that will help in the fight, as well as to pick up cartridges, because without them the chances of survival decrease dramatically.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game world is full of dangers, so you will have to use all available skills: crouch to remain undetected, run to avoid pursuit, and jump over obstacles on the way to the goal. Collect resources, scavenge for anything that can help you in your battle with the monster, and prepare for the final showdown for the Artifact on which your life depends.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCan you survive this deadly quest and obtain the Artifact that will change your destiny? Embark on a journey full of horror, adrenaline and unforgettable adventures!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The Beast in The Silene Valley&quot; belongs to the horror shooter genre with elements of survival and exploration.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3184570/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737443607","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3184570/page.bg.jpg?t=1737443607","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3184570/ff8b96ddcb097d2adbdc02ae1a0f85cfedcde613/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737443607","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3184570/ff8b96ddcb097d2adbdc02ae1a0f85cfedcde613/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737443607","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In the game &quot;The Beast in The Silene Valley&quot; you find yourself in a post-apocalyptic world where every step you take could be your last.
