Like in the Grimms' Fairy Tales, some are brutal and outspoken. Among the fantasy and adventures, there are hints of harsh language, violence and sexuality. \r\n\r\nNone of the stories include any kind of negative depiction or mistreatment of certain people or cultures. Even though we Finns can sometimes laugh at ourselves. \r\n\r\n"},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"3rd person survival-sneaking and story-driven AITTA will bring<br />\r\nyou the forgotten stories from the deep Scandinavian forests. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main characters in distress, each carrying a heavy past will face their<br />\r\nlimits of Sisu (The Finnish courage) when their lives collide with the ruthless concepts from an ancient book.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn AITTA, you\u2019ll experience these rare tales that can no longer be found even on the dustiest shelves of antiquarian bookshops.
