{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Steam Game Description</h2>Leave No One Behind is a tactical real-time strategy war game. Experience some of the hardest battles fought during the Vietnam War in 1965 between the US Army and the Army of Northern Vietnam to control the X-Ray and Albany landing zones and the Plei Me special forces camp. VR brings an incredible level of immersion and provides an authentic feeling of the Vietnam War from the small unit\u00b4s prospective.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">VR Technology as Atmosphere\u00b4s Multiplier</h2>Leave No One Behind has been developed since the beginning with the intention to make both PC and PC VR versions. VR allows the player to literally fly over the battlefield and see and feel the combat both from the ground and strategic level. Leave No One Behind in VR remains a demanding game of strategy and intense battle management which requires player to learn intensively while fighting for the lives of your men and the success of your mission.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Main Features</h2>Lead American troops to their key engagements in Vietnam, in 1965, the year when the full commitment of US forces started. Inspired by and with respect to playability, the game depicts the battles for control of the X-Ray landing zone, the Albany landing zone and the Plei Me special forces camp. These battles set the tone of the Vietnam War and the strategy of both sides for years to come. Fresh on the battlefield and thousands of miles away from home, American troops must face a tough and determined enemy with superior troop numbers. As their commander, you must confront your enemy with skilful positioning of your units and the use of artillery and air support. Helicopters both in transport and combat roles are a key component to prevail. Every life matters and everyone should be saved. You should leave no one behind!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The game covers the following historical battles:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Battle of LZ X-Ray<br></li><li>Battle of LZ-Albany<br></li><li>Battle for control of the Plei Me special operations camp</li></ul>The battles are divided in multiple missions inspired by true events. Players in the role of an American commander must achieve victory conditions to progress further. The game also includes multiple, purely fictional side missions. The missions take place mainly during the day, but several night-time missions are also included.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Environment</h2>The terrain is modelled based on satellite data and historical maps with respect to playability. In the case of LZ X-Ray, it includes the proverbial terrain features which played a strategic role during the battle: \u00b4dry creek bed\u00b4 as a main line of defense and \u00b4termite hill\u00b4 which served as a command post of the American commander, Lt. Col. Hal Moore. The terrain and flora respect the reality of highlands of central Vietnam where the events of the game take place: plains and hills covered by thick grass and bushes with scattered woody areas.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Infantry Combat</h2>The workhorse of the game which bears the brunt of fighting, conquering, and holding terrain are infantry platoons armed with historical weapons (the M-16 assault rifle, M-79 grenade launcher, Colt 1911 pistol, M-60 machine gun). The player can detach a patrol from a platoon which lacks firepower but is fast and a vigilant observer. The platoons, if not destroyed in battle, collect combat experience, and improve. In the management interface of the game, the player can reinforce platoons with both men and equipment.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Artillery Support</h2>Artillery is an instrumental tool for the American infantry, and it balances the situation when American infantrymen are badly outnumbered, which is the usual case in the game. It can fire classic high-explosive, smoke, or phosphorus ammunition. The aiming of artillery is a critical ability. It takes several seconds before the grenade hits the selected location; the aiming procedure utilizes a grid with coordinates.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Air Support</h2>Bombers are yet another critical asset of support for the hard-fighting American infantrymen. In the game, they are represented by the single engine A1-Skyrider. The armament consists of napalm bombs which are appealing not only for their devastating effect on enemy infantry, but also for the stunning visuals they provide.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Helicopters</h2>Helicopters became the symbol of Vietnam War and rightly so. They provided mobility for the American troops in the conflict without frontlines which was mainly fought in difficult terrain with no road infrastructure. Within the game, Bell UH-1 Iroquois as troop carriers (\u00b4slicks\u00b4) mean the bloodline for reinforcements and ammunition necessary to sustain intensive battle. The same type of helicopters in a different configuration serves as gunships providing flexible and timely fire support. Finally, the player will have the smaller Hughes OH-6 in their arsenal as fast scouts.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Management</h2>The game features a simple economical system where points gained by succeeding on the battlefield serve as currency for the procurement of reinforcements, equipment, artillery, and air support. If the fighting gets intense and the player scores a high enough headcount in a short time, they can enable the option \u00b4broken arrow\u00b4 where air support is free and unlimited.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Leave No One Behind</h2>It is not just the game\u00b4s title but also one of the game\u00b4s mechanics. Dead and wounded soldiers are collected by stretchers and should be airlifted by helicopters back to base. If the player ignores this principle, he will suffer a penalization in point gain. Dead or alive, all American soldiers should return home!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Remark on Historical Accuracy</h2>The game is inspired by the true events of the Vietnam War and employs many principles and mechanics based on real combat tactics. The game was developed with respect to the bravery and sacrifice of soldiers who fought on both sides. The great source of inspiration for developers is the book We Were Soldiers Once\u2026 and Young by Lt. Gen. Harold G. Moore, who led the soldiers of 7th Cavalry to LZ X-Ray, and war journalist Joseph L. Galloway. Whoever is interested in the true history of the events which were the source of inspiration for the game, reading these books is highly recommended.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1990880/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1660224714","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1990880/page.bg.jpg?t=1660224714","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1990880/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1660224714","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1990880/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1660224714","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"The game is a depiction of the Vietnam war.
