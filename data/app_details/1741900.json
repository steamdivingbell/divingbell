But if science took +100 years to unravel how drugs change the brain and produce addiction, can regular children and adults learn such complex topics to foresee the hidden dangers of trying drugs? <strong>Can this be done in a fun and simple way, so that even children/young people can (and want!) to learn them?</strong><br><br>'You VS Drugs' is the world's first adventure saga that takes place inside our brain while keeping the foundations of the way it really works.
