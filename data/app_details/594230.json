Every activity in the game gives experience. Players are free to take on the content they want. Join the Hero Academy, raise bebos, go exploring, or kick back with your party members. No matter what you decide to do, you'll be gaining experience and furthering your story progression. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/594230/extras/aaaaa.png?t=1716567707\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/594230/extras/ges.png?t=1716567707\" /><br>Any time during your adventure, you can talk to Gus. You will learn about each other as you talk about his life, his surroundings, the world of Soren, existence, or whatever random thought pops into his head.

Fights only happen when characters in the world want to make a situation go their way. The story will change based on if you win or lose, so you'll almost never see a game over screen.
