{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You have been living a peaceful life in a small village but once every fortnight these so called \u201cHeroes\u201d come into the village and un-apologetically break in houses and take what does not belong to them. Tired of this rampant menace you have decided to stop it and regain the peaceful life you so yearn. Build traps in and around your house or maybe buy some land on the outskirts of town to keep bloodshed away. Craft weapons, potions, bombs to be launched at the enemy.
