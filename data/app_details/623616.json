{"about_the_game":"The <strong>Airport Southwest Florida International</strong> is located on the south-western coast of Florida and is the second busiest single-runway airport in the U.S. handling around 8 million passengers.<br>The first plans for building this airport date back to 1973; ten years later it opened as \u201cSouthwest Florida Regional Airport\u201d. In 1993 it got its present name. At the same time the runway was expanded from 8,400 ft to 12,000 ft. Since then, the airport has been expanded several times. For example, in 2005 a new terminal building was opened after the old one had exceeded its capacity by factor 2.<br><br>This model of the Southwest Florida Intl Airport for X-Plane 10 offers a highly detailed reproduction of the real airport thanks to its 10cm/pixel aerial image and 1cm/pixel ground layout. The developer made sure to use non-repetitive textures. Baked night illumination and ambient occlusion as well as HDR lighting complete the visual impression, while static aircraft, road traffic and both animated and static apron vehicles create a lively area.
