{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">MatchOOlu is a card matching game based on the age old game of using your memory to find and remove matching cards. There have been many versions of this type of game over the years, but rarely do these games offer more than a basic experience. MatchOOlu aims to surpass all previous entries into this genre by providing more tables, layouts, decks, and modes that have ever been available. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3174770/extras/AnimBlindEx.gif?t=1729785715\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each deck, mode, and layout is designed to challenge your memory and dexterity in different ways. Are you better at memorizing shapes, colors, numbers, or letters? Perhaps it is easy to remember the position of a card in a grid, but what about a layout that is more complex? These are questions that you can explore in MatchOOlu as you test yourself and learn more about how your short-term memory works. You may also learn or discover new methods to memorize things that you can apply to other aspects of your life.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">MatchOOlu is not just a memory game though. The sight match mode will test your speed in recognizing and selecting card matches with all cards face up. This mode rewards sharp eyes as well as fast, accurate fingers and is a great way to show-off your skill with a mouse. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3174770/extras/AnimSightEx.gif?t=1729785715\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">4 Different Match Modes: Blind, Sight, Study, Combo. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">4 Different Match Counts: 2 card, 3 card, 4 card, variable card. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Several Decks: 6 unlockable decks, each with 54 cards.
