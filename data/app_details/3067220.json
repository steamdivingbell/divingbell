{"about_the_game":"&quot;Pathfinder 2 RPG - Season of Ghosts AP 2: Let the Leaves Fall<br> <br> Cut off from the rest of the world by a sinister curse, the people of Willowshore face the daunting possibility of a winter on their own. Stockpiling food, preparing for the change in seasons, and dealing with an increasing number of supernatural events take up the heroes' time as they work to make sure Willowshore is ready to face winter, but the true test lies along the ancient pathway leading west out of town. By taking this so-called Pilgrim's Path, the heroes of Willowshore can travel to an ancient monastery that, they hope, will contain clues as to how to defeat the curse.
