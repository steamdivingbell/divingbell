{"about_the_game":"The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria\u2122 follows the Dwarves as they embark on a new adventure to reclaim their legendary home of Moria beneath the Misty Mountains. Players will join forces to survive, craft, build and explore the iconic, sprawling mines.

Their quest will require fortitude, delving deep into the Mines of Moria to recover its treasures. <br><br>Set in a procedurally generated Dwarven realm of Moria, no two adventures will be alike, and every expedition is traversable either solo or co-op online with companions. Players can mine to craft greater gear and resources, but beware mining makes noise, and noise created in the quiet deep threatens to awaken the dangers below: where there\u2019s clatter, there\u2019s combat. Excavate the mysteries of legendary mountains, extract precious metals, scrape to survive, and battle unspeakable forces to learn the secret of the Shadow that lurks within.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>KEY GAME FEATURES</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2933130/extras/RtM-GIF-Building-620x200.gif?t=1734669069\" /><br>\u2022 <strong>Rebuild and Reshape Moria:</strong> Restore the long-lost ancient kingdom of Khazad-d\u00fbm to its former glory, recovering Dwarven landmarks as the story progresses.
