{"about_the_game":"Andrea and Mandy return to their hometown after 4 years away at college. Reuniting with old friends and fellow survivors of a tragic party night in Lakefield. A night that created and killed the Lakefield Slasher known to the press as Zombie. Now tormented by a stranger who knows what only the original Zombie could, Andrea and her friends have to come to terms that the killer might still be alive. <br><br>Reconnecting with old friends is scary. They know so much and so little about you at the same time. Are they going to like the person you\u2019ve become now? Can they afford to hold years of not communicating against each other while a killer is on the loose?<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2325090/extras/ezgif-2-6ac302d9bb.gif?t=1720282621\" /><br>The world labeled him Zombie, but some of Andrea's friends remembered him as Trip Walinski.
