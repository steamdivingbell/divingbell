{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Enter The Nightmare</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Night Hazard brings you into a tormented world of fright and beauty. The Sun has burned too bright and relinquished its outer shell; sending shards of Unholy Metal plummeting to the Earth. Eons have since passed, and this precious resource has run dry. With humanity as but a whimpering flame, unimaginable horrors now command the realm.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hack N' Slash</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Slay hordes of otherworldy demons as the Unholy Knight Malphas, and become the unforeseen savior of a dying world. Utilize simple but satisfying combo attacks in retro-style action gameplay.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Enchanted Armaments</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Buried in the corners of the world you will find new and exciting weapons to slay your foes; some with powerful abilities attached- such as firing off meteors from the heavens with every sword slash.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Surreal World</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Heaven has fallen asunder, and the realm awaits you to unearth its secrets. Explore detailed and beautiful environments as you progress. Secret weapons and items await you behind breakable walls. Unsettling or charming NPCs are waiting to befriend you- or spit at your feet.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hordes of Chaos</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Battle your way through a massive variety of enemies and bosses, each with their own attack patterns and behaviors. The deeper into the nightmare you trespass, the fiercer the foes become.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3274560/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734295086","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3274560/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1734295086","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3274560/1a6bc30484086443597a56819b1ba89327e98d99/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734295086","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3274560/1a6bc30484086443597a56819b1ba89327e98d99/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734295086","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"Frequent violence against monsters/demons\r\nFrequent blood/slicing sound effects\r\nMild revealing clothing\r\nDark/depressing vibe/uneasy feeling/imagery\r\nMild Language"},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Enter The Nightmare</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Night Hazard brings you into a tormented world of fright and beauty.
