{"about_the_game":"Among the sands of the desert, a settlement is emerging that has a chance to become an empire. Be the ruler and decide on its shape, build a well-functioning kingdom with enormous strength and prestige, or become a ruthless Barbarian conquering previously unconquered lands. What strategy will you choose? Will you create your own kingdom by being a good and gracious ruler who cares for his subjects or a despotic and authoritarian tyrant? Check what your emotions are.<br><br><strong>The Barbarian Kingdom</strong> game will allow you to play the role of a charismatic leader who will transform a settlement into a kingdom, developing it in terms of economy and prosperity for his people. You will be able to build infrastructure, obtain resources, create a trained army fighting against ruthless force of nature. However, that's not all, you will be able to stand on the other side of the barricade, playing as skeletons or orcs. In this campaign, it will be up to you to decide which kingdom will be your target, whether you will conquer it with muscle power, cunning or siege machines. Or maybe you will become a master of diplomacy and make all your enemies into allies, but then watch out for intrigues ...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build your settlement and develop into a mighty kingdom.</h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1675080/extras/Gif_0__2_.gif?t=1734642328\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Protect your subjects and fight the invaders.</h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1675080/extras/Gif_0__3_.gif?t=1734642328\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Conquer and discover unknown lands.</h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1675080/extras/Gif_0__4_.gif?t=1734642328\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Play the role of Orcs or Skeletons, plunder, beat and destroy.</h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1675080/extras/Gif_0__1_.gif?t=1734642328\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1675080/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734642328","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1675080/page.bg.jpg?t=1734642328","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1675080/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734642328","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1675080/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734642328","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h1>More great games</h1><p><br></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Among the sands of the desert, a settlement is emerging that has a chance to become an empire.
