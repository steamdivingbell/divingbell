{"about_the_game":"In the year 3012 A.D., Earth is barely surviving. A decade has passed since an iron-based comet tore through our planet, obliterating over 70% of life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring an expedition, a team of prospectors discovers an enigmatic signal emanating from within a hollow asteroid. They uncover an ancient alien artifact, glowing with an otherworldly light. Upon contact, they are abruptly teleported to an alternate dimension.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStricken with amnesia and scattered, the crew is captured and enslaved on a sinister AI-controlled mining barge. Forced to mine asteroids in mech suits, they must collect resources, craft tools, and devise an escape plan.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpoiler Alert Flashbacks reveal a vibrant Earth of the past and a glimpse of advanced Gaia. Memories of a young girl, eerily similar to a long-lost sister, piloting a mech suit to carry her injured grandfather up a mountain surface. The protagonist must escape the prison, repay their debt as a slave miner, and seek answers about this alien realm. The ultimate goal? To retrieve the alien artifact and return home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUpon escaping the barge, the quest to recover the alien artifact begins.
