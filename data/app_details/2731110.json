{"about_the_game":"Love Kainga and want to see more?<br><br>This official Kainga support pack is a cosmetics-only DLC that allows you to switch the outfits of all 8 Thinkers to newly designed alternatives for that extra bit of flair!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Why have a DLC?</h2><br>I wanted to add an optional DLC that allowed players who enjoy Kainga to further support the game's development and get something nice in return. It was important that those that <i>cannot </i>afford to pay extra can still get the full Kainga experience, so <strong>I've been releasing all gameplay content</strong> for free.<br><br>To create this DLC I drew <strong>over 450</strong> new frames of animations to bring these new Thinker designs to life!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What are the new outfits?</h2><br>Each outfit is imagined to be a parallel design to the current Thinker outfits, but fully unique! The designs were created to follow the <strong>&quot;B-Side&quot;</strong> alternative versions of the Thinkers released in update 1.1 for all. You do NOT need this DLC to play the alternative versions of each Thinker, but it could add some cosmetic flair.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Wait what? You can play alternative versions of each Thinker?</h2><br>That's right! You can unlock the &quot;B-Side&quot; of each Thinker which comes with a new starting loadout, 3 new festivals and a new bonus passive technology.
