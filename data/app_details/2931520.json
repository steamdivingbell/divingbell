{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong><i>Marble Mechanics</i></strong>, an immersive VR experience, invites you to construct a marble run and simulate the mechanics of marbles running on the track. The track consists of elements that are easily customizable by simply grabbing them. From funnels and loops to spirals, splitters, and both vertical and horizontal turns, these track elements can automatically align themselves for a smooth marble run, making construction fast and easy. Group track elements together so you can grab the entire group. You have the ability to duplicate and delete individual track elements or entire groups, and save favorite groups to the Track Box for reuse at any time. Infinite undo/redo functionality is always available. You can save your favorite runs for sharing (through Steam Workshop), restoring, and simulating later. You can also subscribed to items from the Steam Workshop for in game use. Once you finish the four Tutorials and five Puzzles (to unlock two new track elements), we look forward to seeing your Marble Mechanics masterpiece!</p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Dual Rollers","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2931520/e6567a18101226d26b0fd763b0a80264397fc9b1.jpg"},{"name":"Multitasker","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2931520/7818209562c3dc0330fd68f025f2431da6d024fa.jpg"},{"name":"Rock and Roll","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2931520/f9ede3e792a1728066a14e87fb0d0d19e3a2ffd0.jpg"},{"name":"Rolling Thunder","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2931520/ee3b56fca9cc825f8c1811174e920405a7aba948.jpg"},{"name":"Rolling Extravaganza","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2931520/4cdc8b31be211d9ebef05d357f9ab40ff29b742b.jpg"},{"name":"I have arrived","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2931520/7bf6b230ca0f815a523c0762907137b74ddb1651.jpg"},{"name":"Making ends meet","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2931520/97b4613849ae23d8c6f09436064d998d6a61e82e.jpg"},{"name":"Metropolis","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2931520/880734e548f61813628d70f1cadac95484209096.jpg"},{"name":"Megalopolis","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2931520/bf041e5af7c09397d6045b72da4012d7e8cad5d1.jpg"},{"name":"The Architect","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2931520/a0efe04bdceae08fb0366ec17a0f64f8b91e9686.jpg"}],"total":31},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2931520/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735450820","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2931520/page.bg.jpg?t=1735450820","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2931520/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735450820","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2931520/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735450820","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2984930,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong><i>Marble Mechanics</i></strong>, an immersive VR experience, invites you to construct a marble run and simulate the mechanics of marbles running on the track.
