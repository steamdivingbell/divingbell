{"about_the_game":"Night Environment: British Isles for FSX: Steam Edition revolutionizes your British night flying experience. Using a series of databases, this add-on adds appropriate types of lighting to different kinds of roads and other areas. Hundreds of thousands of lights clearly show how highways connect cities and how smaller roads meander into neighbourhoods. Visual navigation at night becomes an absolute joy with this stunning pack. <br><br>The Night Environment database contains an incredible amount of accurate road data, more than default FSX: Steam Edition, so roads will become visible at night where you wouldn\u2019t normally see them during the day. All lights are potentially visible for 60 miles, so large urban areas and highway junctions will illuminate all around you as you fly.
