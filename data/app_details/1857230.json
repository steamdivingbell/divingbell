{"about_the_game":"This is the original soundtrack created for the game Spirits of Light.<br><br>It was totally made in DAW lmms (linux multimedia studio) This is a free DAW that allowed me to create the music for the game. There were several versions of the songs, because when I started production I didn't have quality samples and not all the necessary knowledge to create them. However, days passed and by chance I found a free library called Sonatia Oechestra. It was a great balance in the production of the songs, as it was everything I needed in my proposal. So I decided to redo all the songs I already had. It was the best choice as the quality of the songs went up incredibly and you can hear these epic songs playing Spirits of Light.<br><br>However, if you want to collaborate with the game a little more, buy Ost too. In this material you will have all copyrighted music of the game in addition to past attempts. All this with full quality and enhancements made especially for this package. Below are some comments about the official songs.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">- Sunrise</h2><br>It is the initial menu song. She intends to welcome a new player already with a lot of euphoria and excitement. The marching beats are very reminiscent of this and the Phrygian scales add an extra emotion, besides, in my opinion, they are very reminiscent of the sun. The staccato violins, violas and cellos cause a suspension of emotion so that in the end the bass ends the song with great power. The marching crashes continue as a relief at the end of it all.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">- Green Fields</h2><br>This is a song made to demonstrate the Green Fields at dawn, the first area of the game. 'The calmer pace refers to the tranquility and passivity of the place', as if it were a perfect place to live, without major problems and concerns. In the middle of the song there is an increase in emotion with the violin duets as the player encounters the big square. But soon after, the Phrygian scale kicks in again. In fact Campos Verdes is a beautiful and magnificent place, but in the midst of its beauty there is also some mystery. This mystery takes the music to the Aeolian scale, as these secrets that involve the place implicitly lead to a sad result.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">- In Lost Woods</h2><br>This is a transition song in the game. Made with the intention of being mysterious and addressing the fact that Keryel was lost when she decided to go astray.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">- There Comes A Storm</h2><br>This is the first boss song. Its name has a double meaning, since in fact a storm is on its way and I get a storm figured in the image of a great Beast. Its beginning is calm and doesn't say much what it came from, but soon after the transition it becomes contemplative, intending to audibly demonstrate the power of a storm and with the double meaning, demonstrate the strength of the Beast in front of it. Once the battle starts the song tries to cause some disturbance, being a little more dissonant and frantic with a nice scary chorus. When Keryel is at the vanguard of battle, the music takes on a different tone, with more emotion and a heroic sense of victory.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">- Song of Grove</h2><br>This is ambient music for one of the game's stages. It is intended to keep the player excited about the adventure and fighting beasts. She tends to be more &quot;drier&quot; in her melodies, repeating the base over a single note to cause tension.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">- Song of Confused Trunks</h2><br>This song has the same intent as the Song of Grove, but the use of diminished scales helps to insert the player into the Maze of the Forest.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">- Spring Dance Melian Song</h2><br>This is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever produced. There were several versions of it until it reached what I considered to be true beauty. This is a boss battle song. Its beginning refers to the suffering experienced by the head of the area, Melian. The beginning tends to be uncomfortable and dissonant to represent the mental chaos experienced by the character. But when Melian remembers his loved ones and receives new wings to be able to &quot;dance&quot; one last time. The music becomes much more melodic, with choirs, violins and trumpets working together to retrace the majestic past of the ancient forest rulers. However, the song still has Melian's Riff, which is a melody that in the game's history was created by Melian. The name of the song refers to the spring festivals where Melian performed her dance.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">- Memories of Diel Battles</h2><br>This song is clearly intended to be powerful on its own as it refers to the might of the people of Diel lar of the giant yvar. The beginning of the song sounds like Sunrise but with a melody that reminds the desert, as Diel is a place where the sun shines stronger and what better place than a desert of sand and rocks? In the course of it, it becomes like a walk through the streets of this place with a more exotic beat without the music losing its strength. In the second phase of the song there is a considerable increase in the power and terror of its melody, as Yvar demonstrates some of his old power to Keryel and sounds very contemplative. The Phrygian gives way to the locrium that causes all the attention in the music with moments of scale climbing and breathtaking choirs, not to mention the ringing of bells that create a kind of warning signal for those brave.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">- Celebrate</h2><br>Celebrate, it was a nice personal challenge, as I don't have much affinity with the Doric scale, but I created this song based on it, as it is very reminiscent of celebration and festivities that are the same environment in which the music is played. With a faster and more upbeat beat, this song is a delight to listen to. It has broken sequences of notes that make all the difference in the final result.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">- Eyes in The Shadows</h2><br>This is what it feels like to enter the hidden prison, &quot;eyes in the dark&quot;. A scary, dangerous and unpredictable environment. However, the music has an interesting rhythm to accompany mixed with a softer and more artistic terror. Using locrium with less aggressiveness. In the second moment of the song there is a crescent in the song, as it is the moment to confront the great Beast. The cellos accelerate creating a suspension in the moment and break to the beat of the drums. The song continues in an epic tone with moments of break and climbs in scale, until it reaches its great peak of emotion, to end the last confrontation with a golden key.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">- Credits - A Secret in The House</h2><br>This is the song played in the credits. It is intended to entice the player to want to discover more about the mysteries that surround Campos Verdes and the Forest. In this song I recorded my favorite instrument, my guitar and the result was really cool.<br><br>I hope you can help the game by buying this material and I hope you like it as much as I liked the final result.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1857230/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1643627884","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1857230/page.bg.jpg?t=1643627884","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1857230/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1643627884","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1857230/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1643627884","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This is the original soundtrack created for the game Spirits of Light.<br><br>It was totally made in DAW lmms (linux multimedia studio) This is a free DAW that allowed me to create the music for the game.
