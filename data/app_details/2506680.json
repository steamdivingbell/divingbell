{"about_the_game":"Haunted Station is a multiplayer, online co-op, sci-fi horror-lite game.  You and your team must uncover the secrets of a mysterious space station, after communication with the crew has been lost.  Gather equipment to help you along, evade alien threats, find evidence of what happened, and escape if you can.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore</h2>Navigate a new, procedurally-generated space station each time you play.  Uncover labyrinthine corridors, science labs, living quarters, and other rooms, each housing different items and challenges.  Explore the station in a 3D, first-person view, with a 2D map to get your bearings.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Equip</h2>Find weapons, med kits, keys, cloaking devices, and other items that will help you traverse the hostile environment.  Work together with your team to synergize gear.  Or, face the unknown alone in single-player mode.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Evade</h2>Mutated monsters, deadly security drones, alien plants, radiation leaks, and other hazards will impede your progress.  Face the threats head-on, or just run for your life.  You never know what's behind the next door.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Escape</h2>Once you've found the evidence you're looking for, make your way to the exit as fast as you can.  But don't look back, or you may be the next victim of the haunted station.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2506680/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1696914737","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2506680/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1696914737","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2506680/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1696914737","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2506680/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1696914737","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2639830,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Haunted Station is a multiplayer, online co-op, sci-fi horror-lite game.
