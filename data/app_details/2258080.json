Replayability will be extreme. Trying again will have another meaning in this game.<br>Every play will be a journey to the unknown.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Instant Action! No time to waste!</strong></h2><br>At most famous FPS games these\u00a0days most of the\u00a0time players are just looting around, looking for better weapons, better gears, organizing his inventory, etc, instead of really playing.<br><br>In a 20 min match, most players are wasting at\u00a0least half of the time looking to the floor, which seems more like a street sweeper simulator with some guns fighting for the other's trash.\u00a0In AfterImpaKt the focus will be in the battle, the objectives &amp; the teamplay. The gameplay is the most important in a game, and as an FPS, immersion is also in top priority.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A Different Concept</strong></h2><br>This game will be completly different than any other outhere, also how it will be released.<br><br>In a brief resume, will be several <strong>Worlds</strong> available, in each world will be several <strong>Locations</strong> with several <strong>Experiences</strong>.<br><br>You can buy the full game which will give access to all <strong>Worlds</strong> released and ANY <strong>World</strong> that might be released in future. Or you can buy only the <strong>World</strong> that you want to play, you will not need to buy everything if you just want to play with <strong>BOPE</strong> in <strong>Rio</strong> for example.<br><br>Only the full version will have <strong>ModTools/SDK</strong>. Yes! Players will be able to create <strong>Locations</strong>, <strong>Experiences</strong> and even new <strong>Worlds</strong> in the future.<br><br>These are the versions which you can play singleplayer or create your own adventures to play alone or online. But will have more 2 versions:<br><br><strong>Recruit Version</strong> (FREE) : you can play at any World/Location/Experience for FREE with your friends, but with Matchmaking only or by Invite. Will have few limitations with ranks, weapons, classes and priority to select your classes in the Missions.<br><br><strong>Soldier Version</strong> (Cheap) : same as Recruit but without the limitations but can select Missions online to play.<br><br>With that in mind, to play with your family/friends at home/online you will only need ONE full version of the game. Then each other player will be able to choose to play for free with the <strong>Recruit </strong>version or get the <strong>Soldier </strong>version to get the complete experience.<br><br>I'm planing give away few <strong>Soldier</strong> versions when you buy the full release, but since Steam closed the 4-Packs program I can't say right now if that will be possible.<br><br><strong>Microtransactions/Store in Game</strong> : I hate games that you need to pay more to get stuff that should come with the game, so will NOT have any kind of &quot;pay more to play this new feature&quot; in this game. Any new feature will be ALWAYS for everyone.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Balance</strong></h2><br><strong>Ranks</strong> here are just for status. Your level and your medals will not make any difference in the next battle, you will need to prove your value in every mission, you will die as easily as a recruit in his first mission,\u00a0what would make you better is your own experience. You will really need to evolve by yourself.<br><br>Once evolved, help the new ones to stay alive, fight for yourself, for your mission, but also for your squad. Will be very\u00a0difficult to be able to complete the mission alone. Teamplay is the key. Your actions that really have value here, not what you have in your inventory.<br><br>So in each <strong>Mission</strong>, everyone starts with the same &quot;Chess Pieces&quot;, no one will start with more &quot;Queens&quot; than the others, <strong>META</strong> doesn't exist either or <strong>Pay2Win</strong> options.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Past/Future</strong></h2><br><strong>Call of Duty Frontlines</strong> still is by far the most complete &amp; diverse FPS game ever made with several groundbreaking new features. All of this was achieved despite all the limitations of being a mod. Now my intention is to work for <strong>AfterImpaKt</strong> to overcome it because I won't have any limitations beyond my imagination and the limits of <strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong>, which is extremely more powerful than the one used in <strong>Frontlines</strong>.<br><br>I intend to dedicate myself to this project continuously until the end of my life, because this will be the FPS I always wanted to play, and which I will play with friends and family for a long time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>About the Creator</strong></h2><br>Hajas is making games/mods as a hobby for almost his entire life of over 40 years, and everything has always been done in his spare time and free of charge for everyone.<br><br>His passion for FPS games gave us groundbreaking creations several years before the huge franchises started to use &quot;the same ideas&quot; in the <strong>Call of Duty</strong> series, and after that almost every FPS game released in the last decade has something created by him. <strong>Battlefield</strong> and <strong>Star Wars Battlefront</strong> included to just name a few.<br><br><strong>Call of Duty Frontlines</strong> is one of his most known works, winning the nickname of <i>&quot;EPIC Mod&quot;</i> when it was elected for the first time as the <strong>Call of Duty Mod of the Year 2008</strong> by <strong>BashandSlash</strong>, something repeated two more times at <strong>ModDB</strong> in 2012 and 2018. Another highlight was when in 2009 <strong>LowPings </strong>recommended play <strong>Frontlines </strong>instead of <strong>Modern Warfare 2</strong>, because <i>&quot;Frontlines mod is everything the official sequel isn't&quot;</i>.<br><br>His last project was <strong>Call of Duty Rio</strong>, which also won two more times the title of <strong>Call of Duty Mod of The Year 2021/2022</strong>.
