{"about_the_game":"Xion revives the arcade and shoot \u2019em ups of the 1990\u2019s in a refreshing and unique way with a fully destructible voxel landscape setting and your very own spaceship that you design and upgrade in an infinite number of ways.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Blast your way and explore through multiple randomized levels, such as Cityscape, Red Valley, Island and Volcanoes, Outer Space and much more. <br />\r\n* Everything is destructible. <br />\r\n* Design and build your own ship.<br />\r\n* Defeat the big bad end-bosses of each level. Proving a challenge for even the most seasoned player.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cI think the golden age of gaming just got here :)\u201d<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cYou nailed it when you overhauled the game a couple of releases ago. It's a joy to play, congrats on the full release.\u201d<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cTo be honest this game took me by surprise, I just could not stop playing it.\u201d<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cThe graphic style I must admit I love and the attention to detail is just amazing, one of the things I like the most apart from the game itself is building your own spacecraft it's really, really fun. This game is a must have.\u201d<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cA big thumbs up. Another one of those VR titles that reinvigorates the genre.\u201d<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cThis game takes me back to Gummi Ship building in Kingdom Hearts 1. Mostly the same principle. Spend points to buy ship structure, engine, power generators and weapons. \u201c<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cThe potential here is huge, you play this game and literally dream of where this concept can go.\u201c<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cSimple, fun and exhilarating gameplay, build the best ship your credits can buy to beat the game at the hardest level!\u201d<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cWhat a Great game, i really love the the building system in this game that you can build your own ship and shot your way through levels of levels.
