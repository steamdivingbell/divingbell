{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Star Trek Adventures: Unforseen Consequences</h2>  Sabotage on the space station Minerva leads Starfleet to investigate and ensure the safety of the scientists. Starfleet has directed your vessel to the space station in the Lortano System. The scientists aboard Minerva are studying the system's nebula and its abundance of tachyon particles. Evidence suggests that the station's research has been hampered by sabotage of a nature which indicates it was carried out by station personnel. Your crew has been dispatched to investigate the matter, restore the station to full capacity, and discover who is responsible for sabotaging the research. Interviewing the crew and investigating events on board leads to an action-packed conclusion, although perhaps not one that anyone expects. Although this is a standalone adventure, a one-page mission brief provides inspiration for continuing the mission. Adapted from the 22-page PDF adventure for the <strong><i>Star Trek Adventures</i></strong> Roleplaying Game, written by James M. Spahn, and is set during <i>The Next Generation</i> era with the player characters being the crew of a Starfleet vessel. This adventure also contains advice on adaptation for use in campaigns based in other <i>Star Trek</i> eras. This adventure requires a <strong><i>Star Trek Adventures</i></strong> core rulebook to use.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2282430/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1674585572","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2282430/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1674585572","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2282430/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1674585572","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2282430/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1674585572","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Star Trek Adventures: Unforseen Consequences</h2>  Sabotage on the space station Minerva leads Starfleet to investigate and ensure the safety of the scientists.
