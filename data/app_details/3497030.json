{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Musical Weapons</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Survivors SymphonYs weapons are musical instruments and their attack patterns based on music. Each combination of weapons creates a musical variation \u2013 leading to over 28 million possible scores. The better your Instruments harmonize, the higher the tempo of the music and the more damage you deal. In addition to your musical weapons, you are also able to break bones, activate special attacks, and reflect bullets. Dash to the rhythm of the music for additional strength.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3497030/extras/mus_trans.gif?t=1738529397\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Explore and Defend</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your goal (in the full version) is to survive 4 days, protect the last tree in your base. Will you be able to descent into the well of darkness and face the evil at the bottom of the abyss? Explore 5 hand-crafted levels - filled with more than 150 unique monsters - while listening for new musicians to help your cause. But beware: While carving your path through hordes of enemies, your base will also be attacked by the evil lurking in the well. You\u2018ll have to level up your defenses, sacrifice health, or warp back and forth to defend the tree. This calls for hard decisions to be made: Do you level up your weapons OR the defenders in your base? Do you keep exploring and gain more experience OR warp back to defend? Do you sacrifice HP to clear the base OR will this lead to an even quicker death?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</i><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3497030/extras/golem_new_2.gif?t=1738529397\" /><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Warp back and clear the base (not available in the demo).</i></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Build your Base</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Play all found musicians and assign them to buildings - to defend, raise stats and unlock new abilities!
