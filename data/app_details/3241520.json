Keep it in sight, or it will eliminate you in the blink of an eye.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>SCP-096</strong>: A tall, pale humanoid. While normally docile, if you see its face, it will relentlessly hunt you down. Avoid direct visual contact at all costs.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>SCP-939</strong>: A blind predator with very keen hearing and the ability to mimic human voices, making stealth essential. Move quietly, or risk being hunted down by the pack.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>SCP-106</strong>: A relentless hunter that emerges from the ground to track and eliminate injured players.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Lots of other SCPs lurk in the game, waiting to be discovered by daring players.
