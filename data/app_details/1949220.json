Due to their small tonnage, these submarines seldom conduct far-sea operations.<br><br>U-VIIA (Class 3 submarine of D series): Type 7A is the basic prototype of Type 7 submarine. It is a new generation of medium-sized attack submarines built by the German Navy after World War I. This type of submarine was designed in 1933 and its main technology is based on World War I. The Type 3 submarine was improved. The performance of the Type 7 submarine is very good, and the diving speed is very good.<br><br>U-VIIC (D series 4-class submarine): The 7C type is the most productive type of the 7-type submarine, and it is also one of the main submarines of the German submarine force during World War II. This type of boat is slightly longer than the 7B type, but does not improve the performance of the main engine, so the speed is reduced.<br><br>U-VIIF (D class 5 submarine): As the threat of Allied aircraft to the submarine force was increasing, Germany thought of strengthening the submarine's air defense to counter the threat of air strikes.
