However, plans were changed as the ship was hit by a solar flare, now crashing the ship, scattering the crew, and leaving them light-years from home. Luckily, they have Volt. She's the determined space engineer ready to put her athletic vixen grace to the test to get all the power and materials she needs to fix her ship and go home. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3066680/extras/open_gate.gif?t=1732917499\" /><br><br>Inspired by many games of old, Solar Voltage brings the isometric platformer back, while giving much needed polish to the gameplay to make sure the player feels in control at all times.
