Upgrade and customize your ship on-the-fly to make the best of a terrible situation. Battle enemies, scan planets and upgrade your ship!  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Playful and colorful - who said you can't smack aliens with a huge hammer in space? </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3029210/extras/Steam_Description_Title_Demo.png?t=1729087689\" />In the Demo you will play an extended version of the first Sector. Play through 4 levels and a boss fight, level up and try to make a build work! You'll also be able to use the Science you collect to unlock a few new modules and upgrades as well as adjust some of the difficulty settings to make multiple runs more interesting even in the Demo.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In the final game will have 6+ sectors, many more unlocks and difficulty settings. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3029210/extras/LavaCombatBlue.gif?t=1729087689\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each run through the Gauntlet is unique, offering different challenges. Procedural generation and your choices shape the evolving run, determining the challenges you face.

The building is quick and seamless, just drag and drop new modules to your ship and keep fighting.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3029210/extras/CustomizeRebuildBlue.gif?t=1729087689\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Modules can also be upgraded, take that basic rifle and add fire bullets, or upgrade the hammer to create a massive electric shockwave. Investing in the quality of your modules allows for a lot of different strategies! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In addition to attaching new modules, Space Scavenger also has Gadgets. These are upgrades that last for the rest of the run and will really define your playstyle. Upgrades such as increased projectile range, larger Area of Effect sizes, increased resistance, improved agility and much more.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3029210/extras/Steam_Description_Title_TheVoidborn.png?t=1729087689\" />The Voidborn have trapped you in a quarantine zone until you complete a Galactic Gauntlet of their design.

Use these to unlock new weapons, utility modules, difficulty settings, and visual customizations, making subsequent runs even deeper by unlocking new weapon combinations and builds. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3029210/extras/Steam_Description_Title_coop.png?t=1729087689\" />Playing together is always more fun!
