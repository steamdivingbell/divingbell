{"about_the_game":"General description:<br>Montero is a fantasy mystery with RPG elements. Every game session is a story of a random monster hunter, a dwarf belonging to a special class of fighters trained to deal with rare and dangerous enemies.

The new lands are wild, and many dangers await brave colonists who dare to settle there. The new settlements need to be protected, but it would be too costly to send troops to the borders every time a problem arises. This is why the kingdom needs Monteros, monster hunters who do not possess superpowers or artifacts, but rely on constant training, intellect, and knowledge of their enemies.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/795910/extras/Shop_01.png?t=1573839216\" /><br><br>Gameplay:<br>Every Montero starts the game already as a skilled tracker, craftsman, fighter, and hunter.

You will also have to help the settlers to recover from wounds, poisons, and illnesses.

The newly settled territory is full of wild animals, robbers, poisonous mushrooms and insects. Monteros feel cold and hunger, suffer from poisoning, bleeding wounds, injuries and stress.

A successful mission adds objects to your collection of gear that will always be available for future missions.
