unforgiving environs of Iceland, Gr\u00e9ta Egilsd\u00f3ttir is left to wonder how, exactly, she found herself in such a dire situation.<br><br>Perhaps it began with Steina\u2019s baby, or with Kai agreeing to stay the night, or with that kiss she almost shared with Natan\u00edel.<br><br>Perhaps it began when she journeyed from her home of Reykjahl\u00ed\u00f0 to work as a housemaid in the distant fishing village of M\u00fdrakot...<br><br>Or perhaps it began three years ago, when her grandmother was still alive, and she lived in the small farming village of
