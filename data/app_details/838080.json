As they struggle to their feet under a heavy sensation of vertigo, each of them realizes they have no recollection where they are or how they got here. They remember their own names, and they remember each other and past adventures they\u2019ve had together, their own histories, even what happened yesterday \u2013 but their short-term memory is totally inaccessible.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Um, What Did I Just Drink?</h2>One day, an envelope finds its way to one of your adventurers. It seems that Uncle Erwin has passed away, and his last will and testament bequeaths everything to that character. An address is listed in the will, some street in Thistledown County (Verna), not too far from Hawthorne. The will states, All the accumulation of my worldly goods and accomplishments are under that roof. May they see you to better times.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mind the Gap</h2>It seemed a nice enough day when your adventurers boarded the Tube in the Idlewyld region of Torridaen. Perhaps they\u2019re returning from a well-earned vacation to the copper dust beaches, or just on their way to it. Maybe they\u2019re there on some business. The sounds of shouting interrupt their otherwise pleasant ride, coming from the next car over. No usher is in sight yet, and passengers in your adventurers\u2019 car begin to exchange nervous glances. Your adventurers overhear bits and pieces of an agitated male voice saying, \u201cStop them from... you don\u2019t understand how close... keep it super-heated... going to die!\u201d<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Stealing Time</h2>\u201cHold there!

There are endless permutations of designs, so your adventurers\u2019 options are wide open. Technomagical weaponry and gadgets are not only permitted to be built into the kranks, but encouraged. The crowd loves a good show. There are no size restrictions, so many competitor\u2019s designs have been getting progressively larger over the years.<br><br><strong>A copy of Savage Suzerain is required to use some parts of this product.</strong><br><br><i>Conversion by: </i><strong>Jeannette Jarrar</strong><br><br>Released on March 29, 2018.
