{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> <br>  Exquisite Agony </h2>  <br> <strong> What Wonders You Will See!</strong> <br> <br> Somewhere far below Urth's surface lies a place of shadow and fire, a realm of exquisite agonies and terrible delights. Hell awaits all who bear corruption's stain on their souls, for it is a boundless repository for the damned, a place where every wickedness, every deviance, every sin is on full display along with the consequences for those actions. The devils, Hell's denizens, profit from mortal misdeeds and go to incredible lengths to lead mortals astray. While they readily destroy lives and laugh with glee at the rivers of tears and blood they create, they need the world as much as mortals do--for without it they too would be doomed. A shadow has fallen on Urth, a grim darkness cast by the Voice in the Void, and the devils wring their hands with worry. Some, perhaps, might set aside their appetites for evil to join forces and take a stand against the impossible foe. <br> Exquisite Agony offers a bevy of tools for players and Game Masters to bring Hell into their campaigns.
