Send Engineers to carry out different Actions, such as gathering new Machinery, managing water, building structures, and produce energy, but be careful: Action spaces are limited and shared among all players, so timing is crucial to avoid opponents stealing your next move. <br><br>The game unfolds in turns; each turn, players will be able to pick just one Action at a time. Engineers are few, and the more powerful an Action, the more Engineers it needs, so managing your workers carefully is the fundamental aspect of every gameplay. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2879570/extras/Titoli_versione_A_2.png?t=1728467610\" /><br>Every corporation is unique in its own, and unlocks different rewards as the game progresses.
