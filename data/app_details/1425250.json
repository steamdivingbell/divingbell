The game's minimalist design features cubic rooms containing only essential items that serve specific functions. Players must navigate the walls and ceiling, often utilizing time inversion to solve puzzles of varying degrees of complexity.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1425250/extras/gif1.gif?t=1684657706\" /><br>Gravity Fields are found throughout the game, each with its own gravitational direction, affecting players' movements and reactions inside and outside the field. Along the way, players will encounter closed doors, requiring creative problem-solving skills and the use of cubes, buttons, and connectors to unlock them.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1425250/extras/gif2.gif?t=1684657706\" /><br>The time inversion icon introduces a new level of complexity, allowing players to reverse time for specific objects and solve problems in unique ways. The game lacks a plot, as it is focused on challenging players with increasingly complex puzzles.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1425250/extras/gif3.gif?t=1684657706\" /><br>Gravity Field is a must-play for puzzle enthusiasts, featuring a wide range of levels and tasks that unlock new challenges with each successful completion.
