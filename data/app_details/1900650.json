Although you may not like what you see.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame contains Flashing lights, and loud jumpscares. If either of these things can effect you, please take caution when playing.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1900650/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1667689470","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1900650/page.bg.jpg?t=1667689470","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1900650/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1667689470","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1900650/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1667689470","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Supported","id":53},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A Night With Gigsjaw is a VR survival horror game, where you must survey your surroundings and survive.
