{"about_the_game":"Midnight Renegade is a 2D Platformer. The story revolves around a young lady who seeks to bring justice to a corrupt task force. In order to do this, she must defeat the chief and his subordinates, by means of shooting, attacking, and dodging. Throughout the game, she'll need to manage 6 inventory slots and 4 equipment slots. Enemies drop bread crumbs, which can be consumed to regenerate life. Some enemies have the potential to drop equipment items, which are capable of producing set bonuses when all pieces to a set are collected. Currency, ammo, and restoratives are treated as items and thus take inventory space. She will find herself in ranged combat more often than not, and bullets have a limited carrying capacity, but they easily drop from defeated enemies and staggered bosses.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n20 minutes - 1 hour of gameplay<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3 boss fights (+2 secret fights)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nController support<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSound and brightness settings<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA few interactable NPCs<br />\r\n<br />\r\n6 save slots<br />\r\n<br />\r\nItem drops and an inventory system<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3 different guns<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConsuming bread to stay alive","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"A True Firefighter","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1347360/b39800da62ae4b323d606a1037484ab59be4427f.jpg"},{"name":"Soot Slayer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1347360/df7e39082a455d6ce9394fa5c88b0f2c0d9d1266.jpg"},{"name":"Taking Over","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1347360/5adc95bedc499aad44261903607d070b00b4fd65.jpg"},{"name":"Constant Consumer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1347360/eab37d1de9a13bed3ce869c6c45ad26069158738.jpg"},{"name":"Great Performace","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1347360/fad46e1a09a3fb1de97e615885b42ccaf05b10ca.jpg"}],"total":5},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1347360/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1666726551","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1347360/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1666726551","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1347360/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1666726551","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1347360/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1666726551","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Midnight Renegade is a 2D Platformer.
