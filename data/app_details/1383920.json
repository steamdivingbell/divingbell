Starting out inexperienced and naive, her skills, understanding and power grow throughout her journey. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDesperation and treachery await, as a world slowly dies. But there is always that spark of potential to be found within unknowing heroes. A spark that could ignite the flame of hope. Can you find that spark?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKEY FEATURES:<br />\r\n-Epic, Indie fantasy role-playing adventure in a unique world.<br />\r\n-Experience playing as a Healer and break the heroic mold.<br />\r\n-Uncover the fascinating lore of the Obsidian Tower and the surrounding world.<br />\r\n-Many different endings.
