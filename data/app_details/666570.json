{"about_the_game":"Conquer the world, one bite at a time! Infectonator 3: Apocalypse is a fast-paced simulation-strategy game where your goal is to destroy humanity with your growing army of mutating zombies.

Upgrade your virus, splice DNA, and unlock dozens of undead creatures with unique powers.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/666570/extras/infect-zombiefight.gif?t=1726581066\" /><br><br>Blending pixelart mayhem and arcade action, Infectonator 3: Apocalypse has you lurching across the world map to wipe out humanity before it wipes out you. By causing the most destruction in each area and reaching target goals, you'll be able to jump from one continent to the next. But beware; not only will humans start deploying powerful zombie countermeasures during levels, they'll also begin researching a cure. If that happens, it's game over! The good news is that with hordes of zombies, mutatued monstrosities, and powerful traps and weapons on your side, you're not giving up this apocalypse without a fight.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/666570/extras/infect-newsperfect.gif?t=1726581066\" /><br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2></strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Over 35 Zombies to Discover and Craft</strong> \u2013 Splice DNA to unlock new mutations, from common walking-undead to leaping alien parasites.
