{"about_the_game":"The Rhine Gorge is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites since June 2002 for its unique combination of geological, historical, cultural and industrial features. Now, this area is available in Fernbus Simulator too and you can explore its winding curves along the River Rhine between the new cities of R\u00fcdesheim and Koblenz.<br><br>When driving along the state roads on both sides of the River Rhine, you will come across plenty of small, cosy and quaint villages and their inviting beer gardens and pubs. The Lorelei lies in the centre of the Rhine Gorge and you can visit its remarkable view from atop the 132 meters high, steep slate rock on the right bank of the river. Folklore and myth tell of a siren sitting on top of the cliff, combing her golden hair, unwittingly distracted shipmen with her beauty and song, causing them to crash on the rocks. So, drive carefully and don't become distracted yourself by the beauty of this enchanting landscape.<br><br>You can find this new part of the map in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate between the cities of Mainz and Bonn in the southwest of Germany.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1121090/extras/Features.jpg?t=1603368725\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Two new cities: Koblenz and R\u00fcdesheim am Rhein<br></li><li>New unique sights and landmarks, such as:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The Lorelei rock with its open-air theatre<br></li><li>Deutsches Eck in Koblenz at the merging point of the rivers Rhine and Mosel, a monument to the German unification and reunification<br></li><li>Electoral Palace in Koblenz<br></li><li>Koblenz Main Station<br></li><li>Drosselgasse in R\u00fcdesheim am Rhein, a famous, narrow alleyway with plenty of pubs and restaurants</li></ul></li><li>A new bus stop and depot in the city of Koblenz<br></li><li>A new bus stop at the Lorelei<br></li><li>A new bus stop in the city of R\u00fcdesheim am Rhein<br></li><li>Many old castles and castle ruins along the River Rhine<br></li><li>State roads B9 and B42 follow the entire length of the Rhine Gorge on both sides<br></li><li>Remarkable landscape with a unique combination of geological, historical, cultural and industrial features.<br></li><li>River barges and rivers boats sailing the River Rhine or berthed at its sides.</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1121090/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1603368725","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1121090/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1603368725","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1121090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1603368725","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1121090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1603368725","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Rhine Gorge is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites since June 2002 for its unique combination of geological, historical, cultural and industrial features.
