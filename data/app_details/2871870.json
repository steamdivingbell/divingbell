{"about_the_game":"<strong>Project Rebearth</strong> is a game set in a post-apocalyptic utopia. The world has faced a global collapse many generations ago and whoever survived could only do so by hiding underground. Centuries have passed and the surface appears to be habitable again. It is now up to you, and all other players to rebuild society. Play in a massive online multiplayer where everyone plays on the same exact replica of planet Earth.
