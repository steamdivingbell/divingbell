{"about_the_game":"Sometimes people fail at people. You look at them, and they are just Zombies. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSometimes people with whom you find yourself in the elevator look like zombies. Mind you, these zombies defie the stereotype. They don't attack, they don't bite, they are just dead on the inside. They have that dead zombie look. Day in - day out, they ride the elevator. Hopeless, beaten, exhausted, defeated, discouraged, disgusted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll of that percolates and comes to surface while elevator traveling. No, they will not attack you. Hell, they will not even acknowledge you. They are true zombies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHave company, we'll travel.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1171590/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1570567569","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1171590/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1570567569","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1171590/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1570567569","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1171590/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1570567569","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Sometimes people fail at people.
