A noble has higher expectations and will spend more gold, but won\u2019t appreciate if only beggars are present, which can lead to a lower rating. Be cautious with price increases, as they can bring in more income and higher-ranked guests, but might also deter the lower class from visiting.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With enough influence, you\u2019ll upgrade your tavern\u2019s level and unlock new items and facilities!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Be Creative</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3160880/extras/CreateMeals.gif?t=1738488446\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Design your menu with meals you\u2019ve created yourself.
