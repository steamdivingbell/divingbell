{"about_the_game":"The \u2018Altitude Units\u2019 pack showcases some of the attire soldiers from both sides used to try and cope in the extreme cold of the high alps.

Thousands of feet above sea level, this apparel would prove to be essential for survival, with the conditions every bit as deadly as the most committed enemy. <br><br>Austro-Hungarian soldiers receive a series of fur lined coats, worn over their uniforms, and typically paired with other items necessary for keeping the cold at bay.

The apparel of the war up in the clouds was often not just utilitarian, but also rather stylish. <br><br>Italian troops took the dangers of the cold seriously with extreme cold weather coats. The engineer casts an imposing figure in his enormous sheepskin coat with deep fur-lined pockets and large leather snow boots \u2013 he could almost have stepped straight from stories of myth and legend.
