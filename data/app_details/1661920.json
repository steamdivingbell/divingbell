{"about_the_game":"You find yourself in a world plunged into chaos. Monsters roam this once peaceful land and will hunt down survivors without mercy. Discover shrines to bizarre forgotten gods which can lead to prosperity or annihilation. Even being the survivor that you are, you need not rely only on your agility and skill. Find everything from strange trinkets to powerful relics to give yourself the strength to overcome the obstacles before you.
