{"about_the_game":"<strong>JOIN THE DISCORD TO CHAT AND FIND FRIENDS TO PLAY WITH: </strong><br><br>Step By Step is a platformer where you can't stop running.

In addition, encounter fun modifiers like Powerwalls which allow you to kick off of a wall with a massive boost of speed! Make precise jumps over treacherous areas by yourself or with friends.

The difficulty starts easy and increases over time, meaning the game is available to players of all skill levels! You'll hone your skills near the bottom so that you can overcome the obstacles above.
