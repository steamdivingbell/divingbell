{"about_the_game":"The main character's name is Pixie. She is a young woman who lives in a peaceful city with her mother and younger sister. But when she wakes up one day, she finds her precious garden being invaded by a horde of monsters! Now she must use the powers that her late grandmother passed to her to fight against the monsters and discover who is behind this invasion and save her garden.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPixie Panic Garden is a fun and challenging action game in the style of classic bomberman games from the super nintendo and genesis eras. In PPG, that classic formula is spiced up with the addition of equipable skills for the main character, enemies each with their own set of malicious tricks and behaviour, levels with specific objectives to keep you on your toes and different stages with secrets and hazards that will put your abilities to the test.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPixie Panic Garden also features many 16-bit style, erotic pixel sprite animations for a variety of fetishes, with a unique animation for every enemy in the game, ranging from monsters and creatures to humanoids both male and female, retro style CG's for the bosses with different variations and a gallery mode where you can enjoy all of this content at your leisure, including an option to sync the sprite animations with their respective CG versions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith a catchy soundtrack to keep your spirits up, a mix of strategy and action to suit your gameplay urges and cutely draw, animated and voiced erotic content, PPG will for sure bring entertainment and enjoyment to you! I hope you have a great time playing it!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/943520/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1572365650","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/943520/page.bg.jpg?t=1572365650","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/943520/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1572365650","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/943520/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1572365650","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,3,4,5],"notes":"Contains 2D pixel sprite animations depicting explicit sexual acts.
