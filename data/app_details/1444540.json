It all started with an unfortunate accident in the middle of the Nevada desert. They warped off the road to shorten the route to camping. Unfortunately, their car broke down on the way. They were waiting a long time for any help and then decided to take life into their own hands. Since then, they have been stuck with each other and put to test of survival in extreme conditions. A very hard task awaited Will, who would not only take care of himself but also of his disabled father.  <br><br><strong>Crafting </strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1444540/extras/ognisko-dlugie-fast.gif?t=1667551010\" /><br>You have to be observant in order to survive to protect yourself and your dad.
