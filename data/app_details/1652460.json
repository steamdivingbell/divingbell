{"about_the_game":"Now put yourself in their shoes, we are going to be a zombie trying to survive humans in the 80s. <br><br><strong>Surviving the Humans is a 2D point-and-click adventure-style video game.</strong> Face the humans, who will seek to eliminate you in any way, while you learn what it is to be a zombie, their customs, and the good and bad of being dead. <br><br>It is mainly based on the story of Cooper, a zombie who rises from his grave in the 80s in a cemetery without knowing anything about his past. We accompany him and help him throughout an epic story where he learns what it means to be a zombie, what is the new way they see him and how humans prejudge him. He tries at all times to survive the intolerance of the people. We saw that a story like this was never told, that zombies always have to be bad, murderous and monstrous. We always like to see things from another perspective, and this game seeks that same thing.<br><br><strong>Main Features:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>You have to collect items, use them in the correct places to solve the puzzles and help Cooper in this new adventure.<br></li><li>Hundreds of interactive objects and a few easter eggs with funny descriptions.<br></li><li>Mini-games to test your skills.<br></li><li>A suspenseful and one-of-a-kind story.<br></li><li>Multiple characters, locations, and items.</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1652460/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1679961393","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1652460/page.bg.jpg?t=1679961393","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1652460/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1679961393","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1652460/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1679961393","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"The game contains scenes where you will see dismemberment of Zombies, blood cups and drinks."},"demos":[{"appid":1652470,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Now put yourself in their shoes, we are going to be a zombie trying to survive humans in the 80s. <br><br><strong>Surviving the Humans is a 2D point-and-click adventure-style video game.</strong> Face the humans, who will seek to eliminate you in any way, while you learn what it is to be a zombie, their customs, and the good and bad of being dead. <br><br>It is mainly based on the story of Cooper, a zombie who rises from his grave in the 80s in a cemetery without knowing anything about his past.
