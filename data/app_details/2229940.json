{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Black Iron, a state-of-the-art penitentiary located on Jupiter\u2019s icy moon Callisto, is overrun with hordes of infected inmates. As a modest prison guard your job is simple \u2013 get to the last escape pod and get out alive!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Fight through dozens of unique enemies and challenging environmental hazards as you battle your way out of the prison. But you aren\u2019t the only survivor looking to escape. Your rivals \u2013 a deranged custodian, a violent gangster, a maniacal lunch lady, and more \u2013 can\u2019t wait to step over your corpse and save themselves.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Only one of you can make it off the moon \u2013 <strong>make sure it\u2019s you!</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>FIGHT/DIE/ADAPT</strong> </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each death is a learning experience. Starting fresh each run, build up your loadout with powerful experiments, weapon schematics, and buffs to battle through Black Iron. When you die (and you will die), use your hard-earned loot to purchase new permanent weapons, suits, and skills. Get stronger, experiment with your strategy, and get out!  </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>ROUT YOUR RIVALS</strong> </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You're not the only person to survive the initial outbreak or willing to use a bit of violence to get to the last escape pod. Some prisoners and even your correctional services colleagues are just as eager to escape and will make escaping harder by attacking you remotely or challenging you to a one-on-one duel. Race them, attack them back remotely, and fight them to the death to make it out in one piece. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>FIGHT YOUR LAST CORPSE</strong> </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When you die, you leave more than a coverall-clad carcass. Defeat the reanimated corpse of the last guard to succumb to the prison\u2019s dangers to earn a powerful experiment. But beware, it\u2019s not going to be an easy fight. The semi-alive guard has the same loadout they had when they met an untimely end and a few extra tricks up its sleeve to keep things spicy. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>DO OR DIE</strong> </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You\u2019ve made the perfect build, battled through bosses, ran through rivals, killed your corpse, found all the files, and now you\u2019re standing in front of that last escape pod. Sure, you could leave it all behind for the sweet taste of freedom\u2026 or risk it all in one last hardcore do-or-die run back through the prison. Fail and you lose all your purchased gear, skills, suits, and weapons.  But IF you succeed, you\u2019ll unlock new powerful permanent gear. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>FUTURE PUNK</strong> </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">An irreverent attitude, unique presentation, vivid graphic novel style, and a 180bpm original arcade-punk soundtrack by Mutato Muzika enhance [REDACTED]\u2019s sci-fi setting and fast white-knuckle action.</p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Jailbird","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2229940/8a3782bc2086d7b13ce3eb19a59d739f7c059842.jpg"},{"name":"Waterworks","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2229940/5eb4fddadb07df7dfc13b6df97f0b88710382e77.jpg"},{"name":"A Cold Shoulder","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2229940/f6e0b25a673ebbe294d0763737153400e9eb3cba.jpg"},{"name":"Pod Complex","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2229940/c586288b1d81e108be68f0738b046b08f5f5687c.jpg"},{"name":"Watch This!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2229940/6e92f24f1787d5f4315b36fef3dfcef4e20dbed2.jpg"},{"name":"So Close Yet So Far","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2229940/d2fefbeeb506eb5ce0e15c4c0f99c3dd8d6ea43d.jpg"},{"name":"Reduce, Reuse","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2229940/c855aed004a6036294aaad689ecdbc9d8a1c39a0.jpg"},{"name":"Gotta Go Fast!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2229940/3ecbb30cdffdd3d285f71ed2333d9458ad1eedc6.jpg"},{"name":"Not Gonna Let That Slide","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2229940/c3a557938b855d756e09fa3c75c374626803bd42.jpg"},{"name":"Frugal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2229940/eb92df23bded14cdd896c55f45a58931f852a66b.jpg"}],"total":34},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2229940/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733507672","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2229940/page.bg.jpg?t=1733507672","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2229940/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733507672","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2229940/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733507672","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Black Iron, a state-of-the-art penitentiary located on Jupiter\u2019s icy moon Callisto, is overrun with hordes of infected inmates.
