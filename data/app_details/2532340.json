{"about_the_game":"<strong>Plot</strong> - Take control of a 21 years old woman, design her how you like and then dump her into the heart of a metropolis, known as The City! Decide who she talks to, what place she works at, how she performs her duties, the control is all in your hands- err, hand... Have fun with a dynamic world as conversations and situations change based on your choices, your physique, how you respond and your skills! Everything you do can have a ripple effect. Be prepared for a world that is as uncaring as the one we live in. People won't always treat the main character nice or they may be really helpful, like helping her out of a dress whether she wants to or not!<br><br><strong>Inspiration </strong>- This project was inspired by many games, like Insexsity, Fleeting Iris and oldschool RPGs. I'm primarily focused on blending the Dating Sim and RPG genres in an immersive open-world side-scroller game. As the game expands, it will become increasingly unique.<br><br><strong>Open World</strong> - The action unfolds in a sprawling, modern metropolis known as The City. The main character has the freedom to explore, work, and live wherever she chooses, engaging in various 'activities' at her leisure. This isn't a linear game with a predefined endpoint; instead, it offers a true free-roam experience.<br><br><strong>It's all about the choices</strong> - You can establish relationships with the majority of characters you encounter, each with their own distinct personality and storyline. Throughout the game, you'll encounter various situations where you'll need to make choices, and these decisions may have consequences down the line. However, there's often more than one path to resolve each situation.<br><br><strong>Character Creation &amp; Customization</strong> - Experience a powerful character creation system like never before seen in similar games! Players can customize their character's name, body size, breast size, facial features, hairstyle, skin color, and even choose their moan type! And the options will continue to expand as more choices are added in the future!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2532340/extras/UiTCSteamCharacterCreationPromoCroppedMedium2-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif?t=1732914820\" /><br><br><strong>Backstories, Traits &amp; Perks</strong> - Select from multiple background stories, traits, or even blood types, and unlock more traits or new perks as you play! Background stories offer different starting clothes, items, stats, experiences, unique effects, and some new dialogues. Choose from dozens of positive and negative traits that make certain aspects of the game either easier or harder, depending on your taste and desired playstyle. Unlock numerous perks and gain buffs that award you with various permanent or temporary effects.<br><br><strong>Stats &amp; Skills</strong> - The main character has a few different stats. The two main ones are Charm and Lewdness. These stats measure what kind of person our character is, and more doesn't always mean better. A charming person might have it easier in life and be better at seducing people or getting what she wants, but they might also attract more thugs or molesters. Having too much Lewdness can open some dirty paths for the character, but it can also change how she perceives the world and her dialogue choices. Another two stats are Cleanliness and Energy. These stats can be depleted, and you might face harsh consequences if they reach 0, so it\u2019s always best to pay attention to them and keep them as high as possible. Then we have Luck, which affects literally everything, such as the chance of triggering events or getting tips while working. There are also a few minor stats, like sex skills, that can unlock new sex positions or alter dialogues.<br><br><strong>Dialogues</strong> - I'm aiming for something more ambitious with dialogues and choices, rather than just &quot;let's fuck&quot; and &quot;yes/no&quot;. I won't be throwing tons of text at you; it's not a Visual Novel, after all, although the game (as of v30) has over 15,000 dialogue lines. With 0 Lewdness, your character will act as an innocent girl with no sexual experience, while with 100 Lewdness, she will behave like a slut. All stats, in some way, affect dialogues. Even choices like opting for larger breasts or not wearing panties might prompt certain characters to make remarks about them. Whether the character is a virgin or not also influences existing dialogues and events.<br><br><strong>Reputation &amp; Fame</strong> - Most of the important characters have their own reputation system, which affects how they perceive the player. Actions the player takes affect her Fame, making her either famous or infamous in The City - and whether it's a good or bad thing, it's up to you to decide.<br><br><strong>Animations</strong> - These are really important in these kinds of games, and I try my best to make them as smooth and realistic as possible. So expect something more than typical &quot;left, right, left, right&quot; animations. Additionally, there are bouncing boobs and moving skirts and hair!<br><br><strong>Quality over Quantity</strong> - I prefer to create one big game with lots of content where everyone can find something for themselves, rather than releasing small games every few months. So, expect long-term support!<br><br><strong>Humor &amp; Easter Eggs</strong> - I'm not a very serious person, so you'll see some funny stuff from time to time, but it won't turn into a comedy. You'll encounter references or tributes to games, movies, books, and songs I admire for various reasons.<br><br><strong>Clothes &amp; Items</strong> - Of course, you can dress your character in many ways. There are 8 changeable parts: shirt, bra, pants, panties, shoes, glasses, earrings, and hats. Bras and panties are visible under clothes. Additionally, there are usable items like condoms, vibrators, energy drinks, aphrodisiacs, and more.<br><br><strong>Voice Acting</strong> - Exclusively recorded by <strong>Miss Maia</strong> for this project, featuring moans and expressions! Choose from several moan presets, which adapt based on the current animation speed or whether the character's lips are closed or open!<br><br><strong>Bugs</strong> - As an ambitious open-world project developed by a single person, expect a lot! However, with each update, I'll do my best to minimize bugs and ensure saves remain compatible with previous versions.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2532340/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732914820","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2532340/page.bg.jpg?t=1732914820","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2532340/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732914820","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2532340/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732914820","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,3,4,5],"notes":"Ahegao, Anal Sex, Blackmail, Blowjob, Bukkake, Cheating, Corruption, Creampie, Dilf, Drugs, Exhibitionism, Femdom, Gangbang, Groping, Handjob, Humilation, Masturbation, NTR, Prostitution, Rape, Sex Toys, Sleep Sex, Stripping, Vaginal Sex, Virgin, Voyeurism"},"detailed_description":"<h1>Basic version</h1><p>The <strong>Basic</strong>, stable non-beta version of the game <strong>without</strong> cheats or experimental features.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong>Plot</strong> - Take control of a 21 years old woman, design her how you like and then dump her into the heart of a metropolis, known as The City!
