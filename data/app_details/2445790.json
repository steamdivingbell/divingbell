{"about_the_game":"Bennu Bennu: Protect the Pyramid is a cooperative wave defence game with roguelike elements. The players take control powerful, mythical birds that channel the power of the gods through magical obelisks strewn accross the desert. Their task: Protect the pyramid from hordes of hunders of enemies.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cooperate with your friends!</h2>Bennu Bennu is both fast paced and strategic. Players must cooperate in order to survive the onslaught of enemies. Create mighty explosions by colliding with other players. Choose your upgrades wisely to create complementary playstyles. Help your friends against enemies with resistances to their element. <br>Several of Bennu Bennu's unique spells and upgrades focus on player interaction, including abilities such as connecting birds with lightning, destroying all enemies in its path.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Each run is different!</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>After defeating each wave, pick from one of dozens of unique upgrades, including powerful spells and passives.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Randomly generated maps make for a new challenge every time. </li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fight different sets of enemies each run, selected from a wide variety of possible waves.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">You are the tower!</h2>Bennu Bennu takes inspiration from the tower defense genre, but flips it on its head: In Bennu Bennu, the players ARE the towers. Obelisks grant powerful buffs while occupied, letting you live out the fantasy of mowing down your enemies with fire and lightning from the top of a tower. Players who prefer a more mobile playstyle can invest in upgrading their flying capabilities, zipping across the leylines and breathing down fire on opposing armies.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2445790/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1722445628","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2445790/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1722445628","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2445790/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1722445628","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2445790/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1722445628","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Bennu Bennu: Protect the Pyramid is a cooperative wave defence game with roguelike elements.
