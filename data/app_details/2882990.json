We're dedicated to fostering an inclusive environment and recognize the diversity of our player base. Herein, we outline the mature content you may encounter in the game:\r\n\r\nNudity and Sexual Content:\r\nThe game allows the creation and sharing of pixel art, which may include depictions of nudity in certain contexts. All such content is tagged as NSFW (Not Safe For Work) and can be censored based on player preference. However, it's important to note that while artistic freedom is valued, we strictly prohibit explicit sexual acts or content that depicts sexual violence or non-consensual acts.\r\n\r\nViolence:\r\nPlayers may encounter depictions of violence in pixel art creations. While the pixel art style may abstract these depictions, sensitive players should be aware that themes of conflict or violence can be present.\r\n\r\nSensitive Themes:\r\nOur platform recognizes that certain topics can be particularly sensitive for some players. As such, content that may depict or reference drug and alcohol abuse, self-harm, or other forms of physical or psychological trauma is closely monitored. While our community is encouraged to express a wide range of human experiences, we strive to do so in a way that's respectful and considerate of all players.\r\n\r\nContent Filters and Controls:\r\nWe understand that everyone has different comfort levels and sensitivities. Our platform offers robust content filtering options, including the ability to censor NSFW content or completely avoid specific themes. We encourage players to customize their content preferences for a comfortable gaming experience.\r\n\r\nCommunity Guidelines and Reporting:\r\nOur community guidelines are in place to ensure a safe and welcoming environment for all players. We actively moderate the platform and rely on our community to report any content that may violate our guidelines.
