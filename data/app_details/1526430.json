Their words fell on deaf ears and in one brilliant flash of cosmic light he reduced his siblings to nothing more than shadows of their former selves. With no one left to oppose him, Taernath was consumed by the very evil he once wielded. A darkness fell over <i>Carth</i> that had never been seen before.
