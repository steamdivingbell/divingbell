{"about_the_game":"Reality sets in as you realize you've just made the greatest decision of your LIFE! You're playing the hardest game ever made...I hope. Anyways welcome to &quot;The Jump Man Game,&quot; a game where you're put to the test. Gaton-your character-convinces Ludwig that he's capable of handing the pressures of real missions. Seeing further potential in the young ornyix, Ludwig puts him through training in hopes of seeing Gaton pull through. From levels 1-9, you're tasked with completing all nine challenges to prove yourself to the great Ludwig Hallow. Emerge victorious, and you'll have proven yourself to not only be the ultimate gamer, but to also be the ultimate ornyix! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis 3d platformer takes you to various locations hidden inside of a variety of planets scattered all over the solar system! While persevering, you'll be exposed to various conditions and effects such as: Numerous gravity changes, different speeds, the ability to &quot;Jump,&quot; and most importantly, the element of surprise! Basically, to sum it all up for your teeny tiny little mesh ball rolling inside your skull, every level you get to will become harder and more unpredictable then the last and you must learn how to not only manage each challenge but conquer the beast. Well with all that being said, ENJOY ORNYIX!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2151110/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1696558718","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2151110/page.bg.jpg?t=1696558718","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2151110/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1696558718","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2151110/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1696558718","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Reality sets in as you realize you've just made the greatest decision of your LIFE!
