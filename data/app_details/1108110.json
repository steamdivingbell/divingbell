{"about_the_game":"Embark on a dangerous journey through the dark, labyrinth-like fortress of Neonorn to try to save the light of creation itself from eternal darkness.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaking your way through Neonorn won't be easy though. You only have a limited amount of energy before you too, fade into oblivion. You'll need to use your time and energy wisely, or perish.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnless you solve the ancient puzzles set before you by the builders of the fortress, you won't be getting very far. Some puzzles may reveal a hidden path or mysterious relics and items which could prove useful to you. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe most dangerous part of your journey will be when you face off against several epic guardian bosses in strategic, fast paced combat that will test your mettle as a neon warrior, and your worthiness to gaze upon the shard of creation, Neonorn.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany will try, and many will fail.
