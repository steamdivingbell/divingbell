Some tiles have synergies, offering bonus points when placed together. For example, mills gain additional points for each adjacent farm, and farms also boost each other\u2019s points. However, mills have a negative synergy with other mills, so placing two mills next to each other will cause you to lose points.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3457830/extras/Citybuild2025.01.16-02.35.24.09-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif?t=1737466513\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3457830/extras/unlock.png?t=1737466513\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Once you reach the required points to advance to the next goal, you unlock a new tile type to expand your synergy opportunities.
