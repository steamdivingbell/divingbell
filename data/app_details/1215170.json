The experience features over 9 unique dungeons, and a sprawling overworld linking everything together, filled to the brim with rich characters, subquests, mini-games, and dozens of secrets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers take on the role of a headstrong young archetypal hero who, though from a prosperous time of bounty, has dedicated himself to righting a great wrong committed centuries ago. He comes armed only with fierce will and the promise of youth. Will these alone be enough? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers can expect a roughly 15-20 hour experience, with high replay value and bonus content!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDawnthorn is coming to Windows, Mac, and Linux Platforms on Steam, sometime in 2020!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1215170/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1579911394","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1215170/page.bg.jpg?t=1579911394","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1215170/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1579911394","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1215170/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1579911394","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Dawnthorn is a topdown, pixel-art ARPG with a character and experience firmly rooted in the 8bit era.
