When you gain souls, gain an equal amount of magic power.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Soul Jade<br>Taking a fatal blow while above 50 souls will remove 50 souls and revive you at full health. Can only be triggered once per room and has lower priority than Divine Soul Jade.<br><i>&quot;Dark Zone Research Notes&quot;: &quot;A strange mutation from the old Divine Soul Jade. Unlike its predecessor, this one can be activated repeatedly at the cost of a huge amount of soul. Useful, but has its merits and its drawbacks.&quot;</i><br></li><li>Demon Crystal<br>Casting a spell above 10 souls will remove 10 souls and cast Demon Crystal Tide.<br><i>&quot;Dark Zone Research Notes&quot;: &quot;Demon Crystal is a relic made by mimicking Ajiela's power. When the owner casts a skill, they can expend souls to unleash a Demon Crystal Tide; very powerful indeed.&quot;</i><br></li><li>Soul Hammer<br>Increases attack power by 30%; enemies struck by the owner of this effect staggers and take longer to recover from hits.<br><i>&quot;Dark Zone Research Notes&quot;: &quot;I built this hammer based on forging techniques I learned from the hammer lady. It will allow its user to stagger their opponents for longer.&quot;</i><br></li><li>Soul Blade<br>If your soul is above 0, gain 100% attack but lose 1 soul every 20 seconds.<br><i>&quot;Dark Zone Research Notes&quot;: &quot;Soul Blade is an energy relic that can be applied to the user's weapon. Very powerful but drains a lot of souls.&quot;</i><br></li><li>Soul Ward<br>Each successful Block restores 5 HP while a Perfect Block grants 5 seconds of invincibility.<br><i>&quot;Dark Zone Research Notes&quot;: &quot;Soul Ward is the most successful soul relic yet! Any weapons or shields imbued with it will grant beneficial effects to its user when successfully parrying an attack!&quot;</i><br></li><li>Soul Pupil<br>The target takes 5 additional damage for each soul that they have.<br><i>&quot;Dark Zone Research Notes&quot;: &quot;Soul Pupil is specially crafted for Soul Hunters. It turns anything with souls into juicy prey.&quot;</i><br></li><li>Demonic Soul Converter<br>After using, convert 10 souls into 50 Magic Power.<br><i>&quot;Dark Zone Research Notes&quot;: &quot;Turning souls into useful fuel is something I've wanted to do for a long time. This converter can convert souls into magic power, the results are somewhat unsatisfactory, however.&quot;</i><br></li><li>Sanguine Soul Converter<br>After using, convert 10 HP into 1 soul.<br><i>&quot;Dark Zone Research Notes&quot;: &quot;We usually obtain soul from living things.

When the set is activated, reset the current chapter.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Rampage Magnifier<br>The user becomes gigantic and doubles their Max HP, attack power is increased by 100%, movement is slowed, and can now damage enemies by sprinting into them.<br><i>&quot;Dark Zone Research Notes&quot;: &quot;The Magnifier is a failed experiment that has yielded entertaining results. It does what its name suggests, albeit with very severe side effects.&quot;</i><br></li><li>Unstable Collider<br>Attacking a target has a chance to either instantly kill the target, deal double damage, or deal no damage at all. This effect also affects you and bosses, except the instant death becomes taking triple damage.<br><i>&quot;Dark Zone Research Notes&quot;: &quot;Collider is used to create tunnels in the fabric of space. Its effect is unstable, but who cares? We simply need to spend more resources and test it as much as we can. Or, might be more fun to use it for something entirely different.&quot;</i><br></li><li>Unstable Converter<br>Every 30 seconds, your attributes will be changed to a random number. This includes HP, magic power, movement speed, attack power and different types of elemental damage.<br><i>&quot;Dark Zone Research Notes&quot;: &quot;The converter was initially used to adjust certain data but was later found to be useful for other things.

We have this game where we pick our egg and see which one of our hatchlings is the strongest.&quot;</i><br></li><li>Rampage Morph Potion<br>Attacking a target has a chance to change the target into a random creature.<br><i>&quot;Dark Zone Research Notes&quot;: &quot;No one wants to try the Morph Potion in the fear that they'll turn into something monstrous. So we applied this to weapons and start morphing our enemies, how fun!&quot;</i><br></li><li>Rampage Skill Enhancer<br>Using a skill gives a chance to create a Magic Power Orb, a Magic Potion, or lose some or even all magic power and create a large explosion.<br><i>&quot;Dark Zone Research Notes&quot;: &quot;Skill enhancement has been a rather difficult procedure due to the unpredictable nature of the subject matter. Still, we managed to achieve the impossible, although the effect is still somewhat unsatisfactory.&quot;</i><br></li><li>Rampage Summon Token<br>At any time or place, summon a random boss or challenger. Defeating them offers certain rewards.<br><i>&quot;Dark Zone Research Notes&quot;: &quot;We originally wanted to create a bell that can summon friends.
