Thousands of monsters, ten thousands of bullets on-screen! Action packed with blood and explosions, mixed with the weight of realistic movement to capture the thrill of a fluidly approaching horde, skittering and slumbering in to get you. Steel yourselves for carnage! Steel won\u2019t bleed, but cut through flesh.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3461860/extras/desc_03_2_top_Battle.png?t=1739531098\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3461860/extras/COMBAT-GIF-02.gif?t=1739531098\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3461860/extras/desc_03_2_Battle.png?t=1739531098\" />Fight through massive armies, not only strong in numbers but in variety.
