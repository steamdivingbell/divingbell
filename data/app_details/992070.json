You start as an Apprentice, and are able to choose various Classes (12 total, with 6 powerful Hybrid classes later in the game), from classic fantasy-inspired sorcerers to more unique magic-wielders. Classes use different mechanics to gain profit, are equipped with unique spells and items tailored for their use.
