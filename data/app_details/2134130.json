{"about_the_game":"&quot;I have decided to undertake a significant transformation of Magus Pocus, elevating it from a more simplified 2D platformer to its original 2D RPG format. After over a year since its initial release, I am excited to announce the launch of a comprehensive DLC (Magus Pocus: Arcane Essence). As a solo developer, I initially hesitated to embrace the complexity of an RPG, opting for a simpler approach. However, after reflecting on the game's potential, I have decided to return to the original idea.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt this early stage of the project, I am releasing a prototype (demo) to the community. I want players to experience it and share their feedback to shape the essence of Magus Pocus: Arcane Essence. The base game will still be a simpler 2D platformer, and what we are developing will be a DLC with its own pricing. The intention of releasing it as DLC is so that if a player decides to play a casual 2D platformer, they can simply disable the DLC and be good to go.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI appreciate in advance everyone who decides to download the demo and contribute their opinions. This process is vital to creating the most engaging and fun game possible.
