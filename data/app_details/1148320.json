{"about_the_game":"Warp into a busy galaxy with nothing but your wits and a tiny ship. Explore sectors, mine asteroids, take on faction missions, sell resources and upgrade your loadout. Earn the respect of a faction to unlock new weapons and ships. Attack other ships and steal their resources but beware: factions won't tolerate hostility for long without retaliation. Masteroid is an atmospheric, indie 2D space game with procedurally-generated sectors and casual, relaxed gameplay.<br><br>Key Features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Procedurally Generated Game World</strong>: Masteroid randomly generates up to six sectors for two unique factions at the start of every game so every new game is unique.<br></li><li><strong>Upgrade Your Ship</strong>: Every ship you see in space can be purchased and outfitted, provided you have the faction reputation!<br></li><li><strong>Upgrade Your Weapons</strong>: Ships have one or more turrets. Buy and equip weapons but make sure your ship has the energy to fire them!<br></li><li><strong>Relaxed Gameplay</strong>: No permadeath here. Death results in a loss of any cargo and a small cash penalty. You can play the game as passively or aggressively as you like.<br></li><li><strong>Faction Reputation</strong>: Sell mined resources, kill enemy ships or run missions to earn reputation points for a faction.
