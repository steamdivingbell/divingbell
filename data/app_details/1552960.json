On his journey, he will need to face obstacles and enemies who want to keep these people in the prison of sin.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n To win and see the lives freed, he will use the armor of God, the knowledge of the Word acquired during the walk, the prayer and the power of the Holy Spirit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n Standing firmly, girded with the belt of truth, wearing the breastplate of justice and having his feet shod with the readiness of the gospel of peace, young John will continue his journey in preaching the message of deliverance.
