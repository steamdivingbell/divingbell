{"about_the_game":"<strong>Classified: France \u201844 is a new turn-based strategy game, set in World War II during the desperate months leading up to the Allied invasion of France in June 1944.</strong><br> <br>Take charge of a special-ops team of Allied commandos and French resistance fighters. Recruit elite operatives to build your squad, then engage in a sweeping campaign of sabotage and destruction. Deal with competing factions to build the resistance network and strike at German targets deep in occupied territory. However, the more chaos you cause, the more you\u2019ll draw the merciless attention of the Gestapo secret police.<br> <br>In exciting missions inspired by the exploits of the Allies and French, the game expands on turn-based tactical concepts, bringing authentic World War 2 combat to life.
