{"about_the_game":"You are a lowly employee of a gigantic trading company, and you have a simple task.

Plan, negotiate, and trade your way through the Free Cities, and you might not only finish your task, but even make a little money in the process. Fail to manage your time or budget, however, and you'll find yourself stranded in a foreign city without a penny in your name. Or even find yourself at the wrong end of a brigand's sword.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour companions are the young accountant Emily de Vries, and the veteran mercenary captain &quot;Lucky&quot;.
