Pick three Reapers, the aspects of death, and fight your opponent in real-time, cooldown-based combat. You'll control all three characters at once, sequencing their abilities and setting up explosive combos to decimate your opponent. But be careful - every time a Reaper dies, they come back stronger, so moving closer to victory will make your opponent even more deadly.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/582460/extras/Divider_Gameplay_2.png?t=1603983862\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong><i>Fast-Paced Tactical Combat:</i></strong><br>Epitaph\u2019s combat is a unique mix of strategy and timing - think <i>Darkest Dungeon\u2019s</i> abilities mixed with <i>Final Fantasy\u2019s</i> Active Time Battle System.

Will you take Becilla, the Commander, who charges into battle and calls her allies to her side, or Ezzim the Executioner, who relentlessly hunts down his victims with his mighty ax?
