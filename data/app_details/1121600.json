{"about_the_game":"This DLC (add-on) from eSail helps you practise your man overboard (MOB) drill. It includes tutorials, challenges and random triggering of MOB during normal sailing. Developed with Keith Colwell (RYA Sea Survival Handbook), the drill includes heaving-to, deploying equipment and recovery of the MOB under power and sail.  <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> MOB Quick Stop Method (Under Power).  This tutorial takes you through the process of MOB recovery including heaving-to, triggering a DSC distress alert, deploying the danbuoy &amp; horseshoe lifebuoy, starting the engine and returning to the casualty under power. <br><br></li><li> MOB Quick Stop Method (Under Sail). This tutorial begins with heaving-to but when you try to start the engine it fails.  The lesson then follows through the process of making a figure-of-eigth turn then stopping and recovering the MOB under sail.<br><br></li><li> Live Sailing mode.  In Live Sailing you can opt to randomly trigger man overboard.  This is a great way of building your ability to react in the correct way during an emergency.  You can change the frequency of the random MOB as well as how often the engine should fail.<br><br></li><li> Challenges are provided for man overboard where you can pit your skills against other eSail users. There is a choice of 'Under Power' and 'Under Sail'.</li></ul><br><strong>WARNING. eSail Man Overboard is not a replacement for training with a qualified instructor. Man Overboard recovery MUST be practiced on a real boat with a qualified instructor. Never take a sailing boat out unless you are properly trained and qualified. Sailing in the real world can be physically and mentally demanding. These aspects cannot be replicated in a simulator. In addition the physics in any simulator cannot always replicate real life or any particular boat.</strong><br><br><strong>IMPORTANT NOTES</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The technique used is the Quick Stop/Heaving-to method, followed by a figure-of-eight (when under sail) then picking up the MOB on the leeward side of the boat. <br></li><li> For consistency with real world training, the man overboard is represented by a fender and bucket. Recovery is by using a boathook. The training does not cover recovery methods likely to be used to bring a real person back on board as these are very boat specific.
