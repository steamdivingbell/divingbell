{"about_the_game":"Build yacht-sized space combat drones in a fully-integrated drone builder. With the help of a modular design system, just about any spaceship-looking shape can be built, relying on real physics principles to determine flight characteristics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExperience smooth zero-g flight mechanics that capture the disorienting thrills of space dogfighting while keeping the controls intuitive, simple and accessible as pure keyboard + mouse. The environment is dusty and atmospheric, which has a profound impact on the space physics involved - drones never come to a stop and are limited in speed only by how hard they can accelerate for their size.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDrone building is engineered with simplicity in mind without compromising player creativity. A Drone design consists of modules and hulls. Modules offer a variety of behavior, such as thrusters and autocannons, that give a drone its basic abilities. The shape of a drone arises from the way its modules are arranged and how they're connected together with hulls.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2099060/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1664564601","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2099060/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1664564601","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2099060/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1664564601","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2099060/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1664564601","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Build yacht-sized space combat drones in a fully-integrated drone builder.
