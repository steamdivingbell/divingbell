However, deep within the mine, an ancient and powerful entity, the Patron, has awakened. This being has created a labyrinth filled with powerful creatures and deadly traps to guard the mine's riches.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As Aras ventures deeper, he finds notes and tools left behind by the old miners.
