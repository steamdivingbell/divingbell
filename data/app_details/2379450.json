Players use pistols, machine guns, and explosives to kill mutant creatures and alien parasites, cleansing containment zones throughout each city. Battles are frenetic, with realistic gunfire, screams of pain, and large explosions. Squad members emit large splashes of blood when attacked and killed; large blood stains are depicted in some environments. A handful of scenes depict marijuana plants and a drug lab with packets of drugs and white powder. The words \u201cf**k\u201d and \u201csh*t\u201d are heard in the game."},"detailed_description":"Enhance your Tom Clancy\u2019s Rainbow Six\u00ae Extraction experience with the REACT Strike Pack, including:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Frontline Cosmetic Pack (includes Spectrum headgear, uniform and weapon skin, plus the REACT Lockjaw charm)<br />\r\n- XP Boosters for postlaunch events<br />\r\n- 10% discount on the in-game store<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis content is also available by purchasing Tom Clancy\u2019s Rainbow Six\u00ae  Extraction Deluxe Edition.","developers":["Ubisoft Montreal"],"fullgame":{"appid":"2379390","name":"Tom Clancy\u2019s Rainbow Six\u00ae Extraction"},"genres":[{"description":"Action","id":"1"}],"header_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2379450/header.jpg?t=1686850062","is_free":false,"legal_notice":"Offer and dates subject to change.
