Every day, hundreds, even thousands of eyes wait for her to return to the screen, bringing new stories that send shivers down the spine. In her new home, which has become a haven for creativity, Dara feels at ease. A warm cup of coffee, the soft clicks of a mouse on the desk, and the view outside her window that constantly sparks inspiration have become integral parts of her life. There is something captivating about the quiet of the night and the mystical world she explores on her computer, as if fear itself has become her closest companion.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">But as time goes by, that comfort starts to shift. An unusual fatigue creeps through her body, as if something unseen is slowly draining her energy. Even though she continues to smile in front of the camera, delivering captivating horror tales, behind the screen, her body often feels heavy. There are moments when she senses she\u2019s being watched\u2014not by her audience, but by something beyond sight. Every time she glances back, there\u2019s only emptiness behind her.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Comment after comment from her fans starts to appear, voicing the same concerns. Something isn\u2019t right. The unease she had long ignored now becomes impossible to dismiss. She knows the time has come to step out of the comfort of her virtual world. The IRL (In Real Life) stream she plans becomes her way to search for answers\u2014answers to what she\u2019s been feeling but unable to explain. Perhaps, out there, something is waiting to be found. Something more terrifying than just an ordinary horror story.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2616680/extras/R2G_FeaturesHeadline.png?t=1730214059\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Khodam: The Contract</i> is a True FPS Psychological Horror game that immerses players in the world of Dara, a horror streamer in Southeast Asia.
