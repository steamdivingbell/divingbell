By combining our favorite mechanics from traditional fighters with the fluid movement and wealth of options from platform fighters, we created a unique experience that you wont want to miss! Power up your moves using your meter, cover your approaches with a well placed assist or weave your own combos with unprecedented freedom by tagging in your other character mid combo! <br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2302620/extras/Key_Features_copy.png?t=1701737009\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Meter</strong> Your meter will build throughout the fight whether you're hitting or being hit. With one extra button, spend your meter to super power your character's moves or tag in your teammate mid combo.

Choose their assists from multiple options to customize and express your playstyle. You can even team up with a friend in tag team mode for a brand new doubles experience!<br></li><li><strong>More Ways to Play</strong> Whether you're a hardcore ranked player or just want to break some targets with friends, we have plenty of ways to enjoy the game.

We made these mechanics easy to utilize with simple inputs so that you don't have to spend hours in training mode just to do a simple combo. However, for those that are more competitive minded, there is plenty to explore and using these mechanics properly will allow you to climb the ranks to your heart's content!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2302620/extras/Full_Tag_Fighter_Experience_copy.png?t=1701737009\" /><br><br>Everything you want in your tag-team fighting experience is included. Your 2-man team will be made up of 2 full kit characters with their own stocks and health. You can utilize their assists, tag out a damaged character to save their life, and even freely weave combos together using BOTH characters! But don't get too comfortable in the lead because the threat of a Happy Birthday combo is ever present.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2302620/extras/Rollback_Netcode_copy.png?t=1701737009\" /><br><br>As is the new standard, Rollback Netcode will be the center of our experience.
