{"about_the_game":"Taking Root is a cosy game about caring for houseplants and watching them thrive. Care for your houseplants in real time in this realistic simulation game and create your own urban jungle. <br><br>Water and prune your plants to keep them healthy, and give them their ideal conditions in order to ensure maximum growth. Plants grow in real time, so you can recreate the joy of watching your plants grow from a small cutting to a mature plant, and seeing your living space come alive. Healthy plants will begin to grow offshoots, which you can propagate to create even more plants! Sell your cuttings, and use the profits to buy furniture and items to decorate your room any way you want.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2556750/extras/ezgif-4-3955b6ae91.gif?t=1719261293\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Many unique plant species to choose from, each with different needs and requirements<br></li><li>80+ different items and furniture pieces to decorate your room<br></li><li>Customise the appearance of your furniture and your room</li></ul>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2556750?t=1719261293","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2556750?t=1719261293","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2556750/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1719261293","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2556750/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1719261293","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Taking Root is a cosy game about caring for houseplants and watching them thrive.
