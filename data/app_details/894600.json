{"about_the_game":"Having explored the idyllic Layton Lake District, roamed the hills of Hirschfelden and hunted in the ice-cold forests of Medved-Taiga National Park, it\u2019s time to head south to the Cradle of Life. Vurhonga Savanna is in need of your assistance, and it is up to you to answer the call. Traverse the scrublands, discover the riverlands and venture out into the lush savanna as you assume the role of a Warden and protect the lands from poachers and other potential misfortunes. Opportunities like this are few and far between, so pack your suitcase.

On these thriving grounds you will be able to watch the Blue Wildebeest herds passing, chase after Lesser Kudus, catch a Springbok pronking, a Scrub Hare, and Warthogs grazing by the waterholes. In the late hours of the day you might catch the shrill cries of a Side-Striped Jackal. You must also watch your back for the respected and feared widowmaker - the Cape Buffalo. <br>As Vurhonga Savanna continues to thrive, Grandfather Njabulo has decided that it is time to reintroduce the largest native carnivore and King of the Beasts - the Lion. Embodying the symbols of royalty and poise in human culture around the world, the Lion is the second-largest of the cats, surpassed only by the tiger. With a muscular and deep chest, the density of their muscles severely complicates shot placement and penetration during a hunt. The lions of Vurhonga Savanna are in their prime and will not take kindly to trespassers on their territory. As a hunter, remain steadfast in your resolve, and keep your wits about you as you venture into the wild to hunt the King of the Jungle.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DIVERSE AND BEAUTIFUL FLORA</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/894600/extras/Reserve_variations3.png?t=1732104905\" /><br>Vurhonga Savanna introduces striking new environments to explore and hunt within.
