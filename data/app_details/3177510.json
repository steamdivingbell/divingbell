{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Summary</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Embark on a thrilling journey as the Cardstronaut in this 2.5D roguelike deck-building adventure! You wake up as an astronaut from a cloning bay without any memory of where you are or what you are doing. The base AI tells you that you must find a way to defeat the aliens in the base and rescue your colleagues, but you have no memory of this - how much do you trust it? You don't have many weapons, so you must utilize strategy and tactics to activate the flame throwers installed on the ceiling\u00a0throughout the base to defeat the aliens and uncover what's actually going on.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Play fuel cards to get fuel in green zone</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3177510/extras/cardstronaut-fuel.gif?t=1739753545\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The gameplay is a 1D tactics game where the enemies move left/right and you must balance fuel and keep it in the exact range before you end your turn to activate the flame throwers.
