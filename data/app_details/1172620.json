From traversal tactics and silent strikes to deceptive disguises and tricky traps, there\u2019s a lot to explore in Season 14\u2026</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172620/extras/Content_HR.png?t=1729267948\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172620/extras/s14_gunpose.jpg?t=1729267948\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Get Around with a Grapple Gun</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your Armoury expands again! The Grapple Gun has been added to your loadout options, offering a new method of traversal to help adventurous pirates explore the Sea of Thieves. With five reloadable shots, you\u2019ll be able to move loot, enemies and even yourself at greater speed than ever before.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172620/extras/s14_grapple.jpg?t=1729267948\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Bring It All Back</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Extend your reach to pull in loot, crewmates and even enemies from afar!

Firing the Grapple Gun at a solid surface will propel you after it at speed, allowing you to scramble up cliffs, hop along beaches and close the distance to enemy vessels with a swiftness and agility usually reserved for particularly sure-footed mountain goats.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172620/extras/s14_blowdart.jpg?t=1729267948\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong> Strike in Silence with a Blowpipe </strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Pirates aren\u2019t usually known for their subtlety, but going in quietly can sometimes be a more effective strategy than open warfare. Now, with a practically soundless blowpipe in your Armoury, you can go on the prowl equipped with four of each different dart type to cause chaos from the shadows!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172620/extras/s14_hide.jpg?t=1729267948\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Be a Master of Disguise</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Hide in plain sight using a range of new disguises! Pirates aiming to go unnoticed can now fold themselves into chests and barrels to blend into their environment, with more elaborate disguises on offer for completing certain Commendations. You can even move while disguised to hustle yourself into the perfect position. Just be aware that an enemy pirate trying to interact with you will quickly uncover your cunning ruse\u2026 </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Merfruit</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Crouching and hiding will help when boarding an enemy vessel, but a mermaid looking to be helpful could still give you away. Fortunately, strange Merfruit has started appearing in barrels across the seas \u2013 a new food item that can restore a little health and, when cooked to perfection, temporarily dismiss any Merfolk waiting around to transport you back to your own ship.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172620/extras/s13_rewards.jpg?t=1729267948\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>New Seasonal Rewards</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A new Season means a brand new set of rewards, unlocked by climbing through 100 levels of Renown!
