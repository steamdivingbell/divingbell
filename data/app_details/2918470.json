{"about_the_game":"Game rules<br />\r\n<br />\r\nForm families of dogs in the window so that they can go and live together in a home without being separated. As long as there's room in the showcase, the game continues. If the window is too full, the game ends.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFamilies  ( + 5 pts )<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreate families from the 6 dog breeds. Each family includes at least one puppy, one adult male and one adult female. Families are validated when the 3 bubbles of the different dogs touch each other, form a chain or when several bubbles form a group. The family then disappears from the table to make way for the next one.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHEART ( 1 pt )<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGenerally, when dogs go to the kennel, hearts are released and fly away. 1 heart off the screen earns 1 point.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBIG LOVE<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the bottom left of the screen, you'll notice a heart counter. When you reach each level, you trigger the great love, which allows all the lonely dogs in the window to leave. That is, those who don't form a duo. The number of points you earn each time is equal to the number of levels reached.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPOWER DOGS ( 50 pts )<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe POWER DOGS is triggered when you manage to create all 6 families of each dog breed. It lets all the dog pairs in the showcase go, and a Golden Kibble appears.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGOLD KIBBLES ( 150 pts )<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you trigger a POWER DOGS, a GOLD KIBBLE appears on the launcher. You can then choose where to release it. Note that if the display window is almost full, the GOLD KIBBLE will fall out by itself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf a puppy of any breed touches a GOLD KIBBLE, it evolves into an adult dog of the same breed, male or female, at random. This will give you an advantage when you have too many puppies. But beware: it can also lead to unpleasant surprises if you don't master its use. When 2 GOLD KIBBLES touch, a golden paw appears.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGOLDEN PAWS ( 500 pts )<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen the GOLDEN PAWS appears, it drops vertically where 2 GOLDEN KIBBLES have met. For 5 seconds, it sends any dog it touches to the kennel, yielding 10 pts/dog hit. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen 2 GOLDEN PAWS touch, a bone falls vertically from that point.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBONE ( 1000 pts )<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen a bone appears, it falls vertically where 2 GOLDEN PAWS have met. It tends to bounce. To retrieve it, simply touch it with a GOLDEN PAW within the first 5 seconds of its appearance. This frees up space in the display case.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2918470/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1717916864","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2918470/page.bg.jpg?t=1717916864","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2918470/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1717916864","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2918470/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1717916864","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Game rules<br />\r\n<br />\r\nForm families of dogs in the window so that they can go and live together in a home without being separated.
