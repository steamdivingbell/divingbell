Battle hordes of monsters by weaving around their attacks and hitting them with your ever-rotating flails. Draft a unique arsenal of weapons and gear each attempt, combining them to achieve powerful synergies. Collect treasure, cast spells, and go into debt in a refreshingly simple yet familiarly challenging dungeon crawling experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Equipment: +1 Flail of Orbiting</h2><br>Tired of having to \u2018always be shooting\u2019? Say no more! Your flails will do the talking for you, spinning across the battlefield and taking down enemies in a cyclical pattern around you. That\u2019s not to say that combat is hands-off, though--you\u2019ll have to jump and strafe around enemy attacks to get into position. Then, you can dish out some satisfying flail carnage.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Helm of the Decisive</h2><br>Flail Faster\u2019s unique brand of item drafting breathes new life into the roguelike genre. Each flail, gear, upgrade, or item you choose will also determine the next set of options available, meaning each decision brings with it a host of consequences. Forge your own path by drafting, shopping, and using rerolls to shape your run however you see fit.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Horns of the Big Bad Boss</h2><br>Get up close and personal with several gnarly bosses! Each boss has a variety of attacks and tricks that will keep you on your toes, and over the course of several runs they\u2019ll grow more powerful and learn new moves that will have you shaking in your armored boots. They\u2019ll also throw out cheesy quips while you fight, if you\u2019re into that sort of thing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cape of Commune with Dragons</h2><br>The dragon perched outside the castle walls is no mere backdrop! He\u2019s an inconceivably powerful evil force bent on world domination! \u2026Maybe.
