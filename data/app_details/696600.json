{"about_the_game":"&quot;Between Planets&quot; is a survival-based sandbox game based on exploration.

There are land and sea on the planet, you can explore underwater, or you can find other civilized buildings on land.<br><br>\u00a0\u00a0<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Future update:</h2>\u00a0\u00a0Because the current scene of the game is a complete planet, the map is relatively large, and there are several large oceans that have not yet been laid out. Later, the buildings and vegetation that can be explored on the planet will be slowly improved. I can promise that the game will be updated regularly after it is released. The features that can be guaranteed will be satellite systems, vehicle systems, rocket launch systems, and smarter AI. Some of these features are already in production and I believe they will be available soon. The game currently has several celestial satellites that have already been installed, but it may not be able to land on it for the time being, because the game story has not yet developed into outer space.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/696600/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1587951670","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/696600/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1587951670","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/696600/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1587951670","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/696600/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1587951670","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;Between Planets&quot; is a survival-based sandbox game based on exploration.
