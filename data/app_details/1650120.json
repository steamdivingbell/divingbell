{"about_the_game":"<strong>PLEASE NOTE: The Manager's Journey expansion is only available to players who own the main game and the Football Stars expansion!</strong><br><br>You are no longer tied to a single club. You develop as a manager, raise your reputation, earn experience, discover new abilities and move to increasingly famous clubs. But even if you like managing just one club, this expansion gives you new ways to manage \u2014 from motivating footballers to the ability to get the footballer of needed class from the youth academy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MANAGER\u2019S CAREER</h2>We have added a whole layer of new mechanics to help you write your own story as a manager. Clubs from different countries will send you job offers and give you objectives depending on their ambitions and positions in tournaments, while you earn reputation for completing tasks and the club management reacts to your successes.  You will look at the game from a completely different angle and every new campaign will create a unique story just for you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MANAGER LEVELING</h2>You will earn experience as a manager. When you get new levels, you will be able to choose manager abilities such as footballer motivation, individual training sessions, more influence on the youth academy and more.

This is expressed in the strength of the teams and the talent of the young footballers that appear in the youth academies of that continent. You can change the football level settings for different continents the way you like before beginning the campaign.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CLUB WORLD CUP</h2>Every year, the champions of the main continental cups of Europe, America, Asia and Africa meet to determine the best team in the world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">OTHER NEW FEATURES</h2>There will be other new features in the expansion as well.
