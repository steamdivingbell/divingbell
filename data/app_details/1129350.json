{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Catch and Train Murgles</h2><br><strong>Murgles is a short RPG about catching, training and battling Murgles.</strong> After starting with your first Murgle, you can go out and catch more rare and powerful ones in the world.  <br><br>Explore a rich medieval fantasy world, as you fight your way to becoming a powerful Murgle Summoner.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Customize Your Squad</h2><br><strong>Murgles come from 5 different elements: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fire<br></li><li>Hydro<br></li><li>Nature<br></li><li>Light <br></li><li>Darkness</li></ul></strong><br>Each element has it's own strategic playstyle. Across each of the elements, you will also find Murgles that fill various combat roles.<br><br><strong>Each role brings unique tools to the fight: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Tanks <br></li><li>Healers<br></li><li>Damage</li></ul></strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Progress Through Difficult Content</h2><br>Murgles is not an easy game. You will have to get creative with your strategy to win 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4 fights. As you explore the world, you will find dungeons full of loot and rare Murgles. These timed dungeons can be repeated in increasing difficulty, allowing you to push for the best rewards possible.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Development Disclaimer:</h2><br>Please note: Murgles is only about 3-4 hours of game play, and the game's full 20-30 hours vision was never completed. While fans of monster catching RPG's will hopefully get an evening or two of enjoyment from this title, please keep the scope of this game in mind when making your purchase decision. As of March 2020, the solo developer of Murgles has since expanded Jumping Pound Games and started on a MOBA project with several new teammates.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1129350/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1586539662","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1129350/page.bg.jpg?t=1586539662","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1129350/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1586539662","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1129350/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1586539662","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Catch and Train Murgles</h2><br><strong>Murgles is a short RPG about catching, training and battling Murgles.</strong> After starting with your first Murgle, you can go out and catch more rare and powerful ones in the world.  <br><br>Explore a rich medieval fantasy world, as you fight your way to becoming a powerful Murgle Summoner.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Customize Your Squad</h2><br><strong>Murgles come from 5 different elements: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fire<br></li><li>Hydro<br></li><li>Nature<br></li><li>Light <br></li><li>Darkness</li></ul></strong><br>Each element has it's own strategic playstyle.
