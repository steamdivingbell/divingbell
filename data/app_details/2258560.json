{"about_the_game":"Step into the dark and dangerous world of Viral Complex, a sci-fi dystopian future where time and space have twisted into a nightmare of inter-dimensional horror. Stranded in a mysterious sector of space, you must survive against all odds as you and your friends face off against the most terrifying creatures imaginable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this cyberpunk world, your only hope for survival is to scavenge resources from the unknown planet that looms nearby. But beware, as the temporal anomalies that warp reality will cause time to act in strange and unpredictable ways, turning even the most routine tasks into a deadly game of chance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith an intense tactical gameplay system, powerful nano-magic at your fingertips, and an arsenal of weapons, you'll need to use every trick in the book to outsmart your enemies and stay alive. Outside of combat, utilize your personal terminal with hacking capabilities to gain the upper hand and turn the tide of any situation in your favor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut survival won't be easy. The combination crafting system allows you to create powerful weapons and equipment, but you'll need to scavenge and loot for materials first. And as you venture further into the darkness, you'll encounter the most twisted and horrific creatures you've ever seen - nightmares from beyond the veil of reality itself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWill you be able to survive and thrive in this roguelike adventure, with randomized loot and player versus player combat? Or will you fall prey to the dangers that lurk around every corner? The fate of the Viral Complex is in your hands - choose your path wisely.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2258560?t=1677189452","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2258560?t=1677189452","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2258560/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1677189452","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2258560/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1677189452","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Violence, horror, drug and alcohol abuse."},"detailed_description":"Step into the dark and dangerous world of Viral Complex, a sci-fi dystopian future where time and space have twisted into a nightmare of inter-dimensional horror.
