{"about_the_game":"Solace Crafting is a relaxed open-world RPG allowing infinite travel in all directions. As you explore, monsters and resources will increase their difficulty at a rate of one level per kilometer (0.6 miles) from the start. You'll need a base with refining and crafting facilities to craft proper equipment to push into increasingly difficult content, build your own fast travel network, and seek out rare materials.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/670260/extras/SC_Steam01.gif?t=1710424571\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Exploration</h2>Traversing an infinite fantasy realm is not intended to be difficult. Player built teleporters can fling you off into unknown territory, and player built <strong>solaces</strong> can travel freely to and from any other solace in your world. With a visible range of over 48 kilometers (30 miles) you can plot a route to whatever biome suits your needs. Resource scanners can be setup to help locate rare materials from distant locations, and the map will draw points of interest within a generous range around places you've visited.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/670260/extras/SC_Steam02.gif?t=1710424571\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Adventuring</h2>With no &quot;starting classes&quot;, you're free to build your own adventuring class from 240 skill nodes. Four Archetype skill trees branch into eight Job skill trees complimenting a wide variety of play styles. Mix and match skill trees and assign your attribute points however you see fit.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/670260/extras/SC_Steam04.gif?t=1710424571\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Harvesting</h2>Major resources increase in <strong>tier</strong> once every 5 levels producing stronger and stronger equipment. Rare resources can be spotted from afar, especially at night, by the colored sparkle they give off. Other more complicated resources will require you to build towns to gather them, or require you attain magical underwear to delve into both the hottest and the coldest places in order to find them. Ctrl+F engages auto-harvesting for when you're just starting out, but level up your harvesting skills and soon enough you'll be one-shotting resource nodes like a pro.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Crafting</h2>Recipes in Solace Crafting are not predefined. A boots recipe creates boots, but the level, tier, rarity, material, and color are up to you to define, limited only by your resources, facilities, and skills. As you push further and find increasingly powerful materials, upgrading your equipment is paramount to survival. Attain <strong>schematics</strong> from monsters to create extraordinary gear. Unlock powerful <strong>enchants</strong> to socket into your equipment.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/670260/extras/SC_Steam03.gif?t=1710424571\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Building</h2>Our unique building system is faster than any other letting you use the WASD keys along with the spacebar to rapidly place floors and walls even if you can't see or reach them. For more complicated designs you can switch into free placement mode and control building part positioning and rotation down to the centimeter with no collision restrictions. Build staircases to reach gems on cave ceilings, or ladders to climb tower ruins and other procedural points of interest.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/670260/extras/SC_Steam05.gif?t=1710424571\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Towns</h2>Town buildings can be placed within the upgradable power range of a solace, allowing you to summon villagers of various professions. Harvesters can harvest resources over time including several town specific resources important to upgrading your materials. Crafters can teach you new recipes and craft special materials required for upgrading your towns.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiplayer</h2>Network code can be a beast, but multiplayer now successfully supports 95% of the content single-player does. Dedicated servers are highly recommended over player hosting, though work continues to improve the player hosting experience as well. Big Kitty Games runs a public server and two community servers have long been running strong to help support both beta development and live patches alike.<br><br><br><strong><u>Developed by a gamer</u></strong><br>After being repeatedly let down by big franchises I grew up on, I decided that I need to do my part to make better games for the world.
