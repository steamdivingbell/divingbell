Can the heroes find a way to make peace with the warlike clans of the lonely hills and quell the frightening powers of nature that threaten to rise up and devour scattered clan and nascent frontier kingdoms alike? With triumph and tragedy in the balance, do they dare ascend Cold Mountain?</i><br><br>Cold Mountain is a 5th Edition adventure for 4th-level characters that takes the heroes past the reach of civilization, coming face to face with strange and primitive folkways and faerie powers.
