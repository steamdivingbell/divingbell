It's one of the most iconic aircraft ever developed due to its unique characteristics as a result of its supersonic capabilities, traveling at over twice the speed of sound (Mach 2.04, 1354 mph (or 2180 kph) at cruise altitude). Typically seating 92 to 128 passengers, the Concorde flew regular transatlantic flights between airports such as LHR (Heathrow Airport), JFK (John F. Kennedy International Airport), CDG (Charles de Gaulle Airport) and IAD (Dulles International Airport) as well as many other destinations.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1525630/extras/concorde.png?t=1696852174\" /><br><br>The Tupolev Tu-144 is a Soviet supersonic passenger airliner and in fact the world's first such as its maiden voyage in 1968 occurred two months ahead of the Concorde.
