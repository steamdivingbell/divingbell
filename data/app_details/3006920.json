{"about_the_game":"<strong>A gorgeous world. </strong><br><br>Even without light, the desert and the ruins scattered around it are beautiful, and are an incredible setting to soar and spin through as you progress. Explore the meticulously designed levels and art direction in a world inspired by Jean Giraud. Marvel at the scale and depth of the architecture while contemplating what calamity could have brought such a mighty civilization low. <br><br><strong>Exciting flight mechanics.</strong><br><br>Master your hovercraft, being careful not to crash into the endless dunes or expansive buildings. As you find more light fragments, your hovercraft will gain speed. This will be key to getting to the end of each level, as even the light powering your hovercraft is fading, and if it runs out you will be lost in the desert. Flying close to the dunes and the buildings will keep your light alive for longer, but you must find a balance between risk and efficiency. <br><br><strong>Plan your path. </strong><br><br>Some light fragments will be easier to reach than others, so plan carefully before attempting to reach the fragments ahead of you. A poorly planned attempt or risky maneuver could cost you more light than it gains, or result in a disastrous crash that will see the light snuffed out forever.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3006920/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1720838193","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3006920/page.bg.jpg?t=1720838193","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3006920/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1720838193","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3006920/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1720838193","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>A gorgeous world. </strong><br><br>Even without light, the desert and the ruins scattered around it are beautiful, and are an incredible setting to soar and spin through as you progress.
