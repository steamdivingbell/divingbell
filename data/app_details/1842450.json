{"about_the_game":"Go on a quest to obtain a hotdog!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExplore over seven realms in search of the elusive cylindrical meats, from the heights of Mustard Mountain to the ominous caverns of the Underdark.<br />\r\nIn the course of your journey you will uncover secrets both hilarious and unnerving, as well as a plethora of inscrutable video game references.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAcross the many realms you will encounter friendly NPCs and challenging platforming.  <br />\r\nNPCs have small side-quests for you to complete within their realm, such as finding a cowboy's lost cow or helping to harvest grapes in a vineyard.<br />\r\nHelp people with their problems and they will help you back, whether it is with information, powerups or coins.<br />\r\nCoins can also be collected in the world, encouraging exploration off the main path and giving a helping hand if you can't figure out the way to go.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs well as running and jumping, you're also able to drive vehicles such as cars and planes to reach areas you wouldn't be able to on foot!<br />\r\nPlay with powerups such as double jump, dash, and glide.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is highly stylised, with a low-res low-framerate look and a reduced color palette. Adding to this is a retro soundtrack and bit crushed dialogue audio.<br />\r\nThis stylisation can be turned off in the settings, and NPC dialogue is shown in a subtitle box at the bottom of the screen.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Mustard Mountain","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1842450/668523bbe19d24b501fed39596ecde095c23661c.jpg"},{"name":"Tomato Tree","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1842450/89c1d50e60d0d5a1e7c10bc4229b9a853047b2cb.jpg"},{"name":"Air Time","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1842450/d8f2b30908b502ecd8d21d3aca84036af6426ca7.jpg"},{"name":"Gotta Dash","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1842450/e9fd72b2594f6fb03ae2335f3eb9398dd8ee4fe9.jpg"},{"name":"Bright","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1842450/9e6e3f087b32393377cf25ae743c284ef40ba158.jpg"},{"name":"Jumpy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1842450/c5a988e9ec7fb88094a58197ba32828befa1bc12.jpg"},{"name":"Glide","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1842450/4e04997dfd31f85e2ed2a87a807443c17cfbd246.jpg"},{"name":"Hotdog Humanoid","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1842450/9a19a6dd1ce452a0ca251d0ba73423aa5fd4f52a.jpg"},{"name":"Hotdog Haver","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1842450/443ad46c296c77c380849d83b7acbd0e66c3c178.jpg"},{"name":"Heptahotdog","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1842450/ba781527e2bd4c4403d6e23a40b2d7343aed767d.jpg"}],"total":10},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1842450/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733275716","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1842450/page.bg.jpg?t=1733275716","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1842450/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733275716","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1842450/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733275716","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Go on a quest to obtain a hotdog!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExplore over seven realms in search of the elusive cylindrical meats, from the heights of Mustard Mountain to the ominous caverns of the Underdark.<br />\r\nIn the course of your journey you will uncover secrets both hilarious and unnerving, as well as a plethora of inscrutable video game references.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAcross the many realms you will encounter friendly NPCs and challenging platforming.  <br />\r\nNPCs have small side-quests for you to complete within their realm, such as finding a cowboy's lost cow or helping to harvest grapes in a vineyard.<br />\r\nHelp people with their problems and they will help you back, whether it is with information, powerups or coins.<br />\r\nCoins can also be collected in the world, encouraging exploration off the main path and giving a helping hand if you can't figure out the way to go.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs well as running and jumping, you're also able to drive vehicles such as cars and planes to reach areas you wouldn't be able to on foot!<br />\r\nPlay with powerups such as double jump, dash, and glide.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is highly stylised, with a low-res low-framerate look and a reduced color palette.
