{"about_the_game":"<strong>True Mining Simulator</strong> will teach you to mine. We\u2019re not talking copper, iron or coal. We\u2019re talking money. Real money, made straight out of nowh\u2026 out of electricity. You will like it. <br><br>What do you even mean? <br><strong>Cryptocurrency</strong>. Cryptocurrency is the kind of currency that exists only in the digital realm, arousing controversies around it and is constantly on a drastic rise (or fall). You\u2019ve heard all about it. Everybody\u2019s heard about it, yet few know what\u2019s what. Basically that\u2019s the reason we are making this game. <br><br>True Mining Simulator is a full fletched simulator of a miner. A miner is a person who mines <strong>cryptocurrency</strong>. Miners purchase video cards, assemble stands and use those to earn valuable coins, which they then sell. Or keep them, hoping to get a better exchange rate. This is what you are going to be doing. Buy hardware, farm coins, sell coins, buy more hardware. <br><br>And that\u2019s it? Doesn\u2019t look too \u2026 Ain\u2019t it too simple? Oh yeah? Think about this for a moment: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>hardware must at least pay off; <br></li><li>it must not become outdated while being delivered; <br></li><li>8 graphics cards in one stand must not overheat; <br></li><li>these stands must be assembled properly; <br></li><li>you must choose you farming station correctly, and there are plenty to choose from; <br></li><li>if you spend all your money on hardware, what are you going to eat? </li></ul>Basically, this is the reason we are making this game. Mining is like chess: simple on the outside, complicated on the inside. And we suggest you figure out all mining intricacies on your own, without having to buy 10 video cards, $500 each. <br><br>Okay, what else do you have in the simulator? Everything you need for a full immersion: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>farms must be assembled with your own hands; <br></li><li>hunger (must eat); <br></li><li>you have a unique chance to forget your wallet password and lose everything.</li></ul>And our plans for upcoming updates included:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>day\\night cycles, respective division of events; <br></li><li>fatigue (must rest); <br></li><li>ability to get employed (trust us, you will need it); <br></li><li>you can move to a more spacious place, if you wish to do so \u2026 and if you can afford it; <br></li><li>you can be burglarized, your house can burn down (nice, right?);</li></ul><br>Sounds interesting! When will the game be out? As soon as possible. The game is in its active development stage. You can facilitate the process by supporting us.
