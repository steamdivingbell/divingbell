{"about_the_game":"Explore the surreal archipelago of the celtic otherworld Annwn (ann-oon), evading the sweeping gaze of the Watchmen. Hurl your soul from one totem to another in search of answers. Manipulate the environment to progress, but beware of disrupting the balance of light and darkness...<br><br>Annwn is an abstract stealth strategy game about making decisions under pressure, played across a series of bleak and lonely procedural islands.<br><br>You are a disembodied soul, able to dissolve and recreate elements of this mist-shrouded archipelago. Absorb the energy of trees and rocks, and use it to create totems which you can possess...anywhere that you can see the floor. Pump more energy into a totem to raise it higher before transferring your soul to it. Ascend the hills but watch out for the slowly revolving Watcher, who will try to redistribute your precious energy across the landscape. Consume what life you can find on the landscape before ascending to absorb the Watcher itself and move on.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Tense, fast-paced gameplay<br></li><li>Infinite variety of procedural islands<br></li><li>Improve your abilities by absorbing Watchers<br></li><li>Other, undocumented mysteries await in the Otherworld...</li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Houndkeeper","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/770860/08433b318ec121512f5dad4ce01c4eb37fb8259a.jpg"},{"name":"Shores of Annwn","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/770860/0c005a0450865b3cb1b6164178e832fd5bff2747.jpg"},{"name":"Visitor to Annwn","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/770860/04f91d05f8c1a9215fa4263c98ada19ef9dfa036.jpg"},{"name":"Explorer of Annwn","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/770860/4cd6e6f4a15f2c6eb21a084c1e6afedc2d518260.jpg"},{"name":"Sage of Annwn","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/770860/0e7a2174064a4fe39ff3d5bd37e5744561fcf250.jpg"},{"name":"Hungry Soul","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/770860/9cbd576c042581bde6301c0549a6e251c1d2dafd.jpg"},{"name":"Generous Soul","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/770860/c87e6502fad5431713e700d074d04490ef269a2a.jpg"},{"name":"Powerful Soul","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/770860/0a3934464c4747ae7438b005e5518d4fea192c6f.jpg"},{"name":"Completionist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/770860/3d6e2d67748e9ea6e3047e2ffd06622ec640ed22.jpg"},{"name":"Conqueror of Annwn","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/770860/2d49789e1f3565cf67f8395680e4e90edbb4b87a.jpg"}],"total":13},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/770860/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1670087532","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/770860/page.bg.jpg?t=1670087532","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/770860/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1670087532","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/770860/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1670087532","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":819000,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Explore the surreal archipelago of the celtic otherworld Annwn (ann-oon), evading the sweeping gaze of the Watchmen.
