There is no health or lives to worry about, only time, as you slowly ascend to unknown heights. Don't go too fast though, or you may fall and be set back! This game was made with fans of speed running in mind, but not too difficult for all fans of platformers or time-attack challenges!<br><br>- Energy gained from collectables that enable quick bursts of speed, or a super jump, that can save you those precious seconds.<br>- Progress autosaves when you leave the game, allowing you to rage quit in peace!<br>- Your current run time and your fastest time are recorded and saved, allowing speed runners an easy method to track progress.<br>- Resetting a run is as simple as pressing a button, allowing for a quick reset if you butcher your run.<br>- Future updates based on community feedback<br><br>You will also have several optional cheats and gameplay enhancements such as Big Head Mode, Slippery Surfaces, and an optional Hardcore mode. Hardcore mode disables autosaving and energy pickups. You only have the energy you start with... make it count! This mode also adds health as an additional challenge that decreases when you fall from high up! If you really want to show your mastery of the course, Hardcore Mode also adds extra achievements! <br><br>Are you ready to get...<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2541320/extras/Steam_Logo_Small.png?t=1692601317\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Breakthrough!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2541320/0b9638d667f483496c9d27b7bec9be0ab84574d6.jpg"},{"name":"Speedrunner!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2541320/0b9638d667f483496c9d27b7bec9be0ab84574d6.jpg"},{"name":"Casual!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2541320/0b9638d667f483496c9d27b7bec9be0ab84574d6.jpg"},{"name":"Relaxed!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2541320/0b9638d667f483496c9d27b7bec9be0ab84574d6.jpg"},{"name":"Overachiever!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2541320/0b9638d667f483496c9d27b7bec9be0ab84574d6.jpg"},{"name":"Haxx!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2541320/0b9638d667f483496c9d27b7bec9be0ab84574d6.jpg"},{"name":"Adrenaline!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2541320/0b9638d667f483496c9d27b7bec9be0ab84574d6.jpg"},{"name":"Hardcore!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2541320/0b9638d667f483496c9d27b7bec9be0ab84574d6.jpg"},{"name":"Seeing Things","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2541320/0b9638d667f483496c9d27b7bec9be0ab84574d6.jpg"},{"name":"Camoflauge","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2541320/0b9638d667f483496c9d27b7bec9be0ab84574d6.jpg"}],"total":10},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2541320/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1692601317","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2541320/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1692601317","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2541320/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1692601317","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2541320/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1692601317","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2541320/extras/Steam_Page_GIF.gif?t=1692601317\" /><br><br>Tilted is a psychedelic platformer with abstract visuals that's accessible to all fans of the genre.
