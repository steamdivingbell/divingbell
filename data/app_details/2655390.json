{"about_the_game":"The Strapmar Archipelago. A place of great beauty and infinite riches. The kingdoms of humans, dwarves, and elves formed an alliance in order to extract gold and precious crystals in this remote place.

The elves, experts in the art of war and magic, designed weapons and spells to protect the valuable finds.<br><br>But the mighty Orc kingdom, who also coveted the riches of Strapmar, has assembled an incredible fleet of ships, flying monsters, and siege machinery, and they have surrounded the archipelago.

The siege has begun!<br><br>Welcome to Siege Island, a modern twist on the classic arcade game Rampart, by Atari Games and Midway Games. Get ready for an exhilarating 3D action/puzzle experience that will challenge your strategic skills and reflexes. The Orcish fleet is closing in, and it's up to you to defend your island from their attacks.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2655390/extras/ABOUT_THE_GAME.png?t=1721768174\" /><br><br>In Siege Island, players take command of the defense of several castles, fending off waves of adversaries that assail from both air and sea. To accomplish this, they must erect protective walls around neutral castles, asserting dominion over the territory inside. Once secured, they can position cannons and ballistas within the controlled area to repel enemy attacks during the attack phase. Afterward, players must reconstruct the walls using Tetris-like sections during the building phase.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2655390/extras/Building.gif?t=1721768174\" /><br> <br>Ownership of a castle is only secured if it is entirely encircled and shielded by walls. Failure to accomplish this by the end of the building phase results in losing the castle, along with the weapons in it. Each controlled castle augments your firepower with three additional cannons. The more castles you control, the sturdier your defenses become. Endure as many waves as possible, defeat foes to earn gold and brilliants, and enhance your skills to venture deeper into the challenge.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2655390/extras/battle.gif?t=1721768174\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2655390/extras/EA_FEATURES.png?t=1721768174\" /><br>These features are already available in the current version:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Four Unique Settings:</strong> Explore four distinct island settings - Beach, Forest, Winter, and Volcano.<br></li><li> <strong>Three Different Enemies:</strong> Small ships, Medium ships &amp; Zeppelins.<br></li><li> <strong>One Dangerous Boss:</strong> We have currently one huge boss ship.<br></li><li> <strong>Choose Your Race:</strong> Select your path as a Human, Dwarf, or Elf, each with unique attributes and magic, impacting your gameplay.<br></li><li> <strong>One Island Grid Available:</strong> Currently, we have one island design with the same position for the castles and amount of cells.<br></li><li> <strong>Skill Management:</strong> Invest your hard-earned gold in skill upgrades, choosing between Defense, Attack, and Magic skills, each subsequent level is more expensive than the last.<br></li><li> <strong>Three Different Magic Spells:</strong> One per race.
