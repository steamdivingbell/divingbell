{"about_the_game":"CURSE is a point-and-click horror game that throws the player into the world of paranormal investigations.

Expect to read lots of notes and dialogue. This game is intended for those who enjoy a fun, spooky, tale that provides a more 'on rails' experience.<br><br>Linear Gameplay: CURSE is a linear experience with some light branching that gives players some determination of events. The game is linear at a high level to tell a cohesive story.<br><br>Ghost Chase: The ghost chase feature is tense. It's supposed to be tense. The ghosts will arrive at random points within the Manor to attack you. Did we mention that the lights go out when they attack?<br><br>Point and Click Navigation: CURSE does NOT allow free movement. We intend to create an experience more like a theme park ride where we control aspects of what you see and don't see. If you give in to this type of storytelling, you should have a rollicking good time. If you prefer actively moving through the game space, CURSE may not be for you.<br><br>Jump Scares: Although the game does not rely on jump scares to entertain the player, it does include more than a few. <br><br>Horror Elements: The horror of CURSE is geared towards a PG-13 vibe than R or MA ratings. We strive for atmosphere over gore and graphic violence. However, there are adult themes and blood within the game.<br><br><strong>Sound Good?</strong><br><br>If the above descriptions interest you, then welcome to Atherton Manor!<br><br>CURSE provides 2-4 hours of gameplay in most cases. To collect all the achievements, you must play it a few times to experience the branching elements and optional difficulty settings.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Junior Investigator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/510570/a0224e904f3c1e1913bf4632936e37c6d9c17524.jpg"},{"name":"Paranormal Investigator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/510570/82da75e0ea624f553c7b365118ae8c30d1d79742.jpg"},{"name":"Elite Investigator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/510570/4f0cd586262deaadff2f5ed5a97e805ec1a12745.jpg"},{"name":"Legendary Investigator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/510570/df90b02b19fa9f2704649dbc40bea47cf16c40b2.jpg"},{"name":"Unscathed","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/510570/2cc05771d1baa8e3dffdf9ed15bea925c3f5fcdf.jpg"},{"name":"Unshaken","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/510570/0d1cc0ab00ab76d3d7b41c3aa7e3786eb049bd0d.jpg"},{"name":"Unbeatable","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/510570/de7c8d168f06526e847486b4dd46da4ac29593c9.jpg"},{"name":"Ghostbuster","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/510570/70d5b333e79f7880d293026196e978dd50c9a333.jpg"},{"name":"You see Dead People","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/510570/bf7a7df05bafbbcfd5d520c98e80074fb77a21a9.jpg"},{"name":"Bloody Mary","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/510570/6969cdecb77bfe12bce5b1ab3a0e6e065ac009e1.jpg"}],"total":25},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/510570/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1691330901","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/510570/page.bg.jpg?t=1691330901","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/510570/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1691330901","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/510570/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1691330901","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":515050,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"CURSE is a point-and-click horror game that throws the player into the world of paranormal investigations.
