{"about_the_game":"On a dark and stormy Halloween night, you find yourself standing before the gothic gates of Arcana Manor, the castle home of Doctor Arcana, the world famous magician who vanished several years ago. A strange force compels you to find a way in, but as soon as you set foot inside the mansion, the door slams shut behind you, sealing you inside the eerie manor house. A ghostly vision appears before you, presenting you with a challenge: Resolve a maze of riddles and perplexing puzzles, or be doomed to spend eternity locked inside the inescapable mansion. Do you dare accept the deadly challenge to discover the secrets that lie within The Cabinets of Doctor Arcana? Once you begin, there's no turning back.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>    A captivating mystery set in the shadowy realm of magic and illusion.<br></li><li>    Over 50 perplexing puzzles, mind-bending mazes, and confounding conundrums.<br></li><li>    Original soundtrack by Nox Arcana.<br></li><li>    In-game art gallery featuring dozens of eerie works of art by Joseph Vargo.<br></li><li>    Detailed walkthrough from Doctor Arcana himself.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The origins of Doctor Arcana</h2><i>The Cabinets of Doctor Arcana</i> is a throwback to the early computer puzzle games like <i>The 7th Guest, Shivers</i> and <i>Jewels of the Oracle.</i> <i>The Cabinets of Doctor Arcana</i> was designed to have a very retro look and feel within a simple framework with minimal mouse controls.

In the game, players must explore this shadowy realm of magic and illusion and resolve a variety of devious puzzles to unlock Doctor Arcana's darkest secrets. The gauntlet of confounding conundrums consists of more than 50 logic puzzles, word puzzles, mazes, riddles and codes. For those seeking something more mentally stimulating than the usual arcade game or hidden object adventure, this is the game for you.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/831070/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1723931708","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/831070/page.bg.jpg?t=1723931708","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/831070/27d3bb59118ad2016c5f4e5a6a5d8152d0c9d299/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1723931708","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/831070/27d3bb59118ad2016c5f4e5a6a5d8152d0c9d299/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1723931708","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"On a dark and stormy Halloween night, you find yourself standing before the gothic gates of Arcana Manor, the castle home of Doctor Arcana, the world famous magician who vanished several years ago.
