The regiment earned its bloody reputation after the Siege of Carroburg in 1865, where its soldiers successfully defended the walls of their city against the count of Middenland's vast army. Despite the horrific casualties and many wounds they suffered during the battle, the Greatswords fought on resolutely and, by battle's end, their white Reikland uniforms were drenched in blood. From that moment onwards, the Carroburg Greatswords have worn dark red uniforms in remembrance of that bloody battle.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/463797/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1499876853","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/463797/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1499876853","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/463797/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1499876853","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/463797/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1499876853","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Experience the End Times in style!
