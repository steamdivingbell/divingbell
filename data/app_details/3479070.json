{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Inspired by the skeuomorphic design in the early 2000s, I developed this 2048 - like game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game not only contains the traditional mechanism of adding two equal numbers, but also adopts the mechanism that numbers in a geometric sequence can all be added together. If the first two numbers in a row, after being added, result in the whole row of numbers forming a geometric sequence, then all the numbers in that row can be added. If there are an even number of completely equal numbers in a row, they can also be added together, and then scored according to the number of additions.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game includes four different scenes, and each scene has two different edge lengths. The game contains a subtraction mode and a countdown mode. In the subtraction mode, each operation will add one or two numbers. In the countdown mode, players can extend the time by scoring points.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Seven different skills are also added to the game. As the player's score increases, they can obtain the right to use these skills. The skills can be used by clicking the button on the right side of the game grid. The skills are as follows: randomly subtract one number, go back one step, randomly readjust the positions, add most of the numbers at once, use the mouse to delete one number, use the mouse to freeze one number (this number can be unfrozen when added to or subtracted by other numbers), and use the mouse to swap the positions of two numbers.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game supports customizing keyboard keys. Players can change the key settings in the options. The mouse wheel can be used to adjust the camera distance. Pressing the right - mouse button and dragging the mouse can change the perspective.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3479070/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738684845","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3479070/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1738684845","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3479070/90a80747595758485145d84cfebe9534bb4bc7c5/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738684845","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3479070/90a80747595758485145d84cfebe9534bb4bc7c5/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738684845","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Inspired by the skeuomorphic design in the early 2000s, I developed this 2048 - like game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game not only contains the traditional mechanism of adding two equal numbers, but also adopts the mechanism that numbers in a geometric sequence can all be added together.
