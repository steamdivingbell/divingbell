{"about_the_game":"Eschalon: Book I is an old-school role-playing game that will take you across massive outdoor environments and deep into dozens of sprawling dungeons as you seek to uncover the mystery of who you are. It features a tile-built, turn-based game world where the result of absolutely every action is rolled, calculated or statistically determined. Hundreds of items and dozens of creatures await your discovery in this classically inspired RPG.                    <br>\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A tile-built, turn-based game world where the result of absolutely every action is rolled, calculated or statistically determined.
