It is text based content without violent images or graphic description, but it can be done through button clicking. Example is following:\r\n\r\nPlayer clicks on the Button \"Discover Historic District\", Then clicks on the button \"Lonely Citizen\" and then options include \"Attack (with an attempt to kill)\". This is the most criminal act a player can conduct and read about the result in a simple statement whether it was successful attack or not (no description). There are some other criminal acts player can conduct, such as Pickpocket Someone. All criminal acts are marked at the start of the button with [C], described in the tutorial as a mark for Criminal actions.
