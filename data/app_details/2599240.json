{"about_the_game":"Corvos Dynasty is an homage to classic RPGs from the 90's. There are three ways to enjoy Corvos Dynasty. There is an adventure mode for the classic experience of following the story linearly with a few side quests sprinkled along the way. Arcade offers a rogue-like experience where you see how far you can get in randomly generated dungeons. Finally, there is Conquest mode, which is an open-world experience with minimal story.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>3 different game modes</strong> - Corvos Dynasty has many different game modes to try. In addition to these 3 different game modes, you can customize the gameplay to your liking. Some of the choices you can make for your gameplay are: visible enemy encounters, enemy leveling, and random loot. You can also set up a randomized playthrough in which you can speed run with your friends for the fastest completion time.<br></li><li><strong>30 Hours of playtime</strong> - Completion of the adventure mode takes about 30 hours without doing any side quests. There are many other things you can do to prolong your journey such as completing guild quests and character quests. Arcade mode and Conquest mode are shorter than the story averaging around 6 hours each.<br></li><li><strong>Fast turn-based combat</strong> - Build your characters with a selection of over 500 skills. Along with skills, every character has a unique trait that puts a twist on combat. You will need to utilize these skills and traits to overcome the punishing foes you will meet along your journey.<br></li><li><strong>Over 45 playable characters</strong> - In addition to the 10 main characters, you will be able to recruit most of the merchants you chat with, as long as you do a favor for them first. You can also play as non-humans: certain characters have the ability to summon monsters that can make your party even more lively.<br></li><li><strong>Tons of unlockables</strong> - Between all the characters and loot scattered around. There is a ton of stuff to unlock and find. Corvos Dynasty rewards players who explore every nook and cranny.<br></li><li><strong>Seasons and weather</strong> - The weather is not just cosmetic! Storms can power up shock magic and heatwaves can make your party more vulnerable to burns. Most areas will also change depending on the season. Thus making the area reveal different treasures and foes depending on the time of year.<br></li><li><strong>Changing economy based on your actions</strong> - The economy changes based on the players actions, giving you a creative way to manipulate the market. Kill all the monsters outside of town, making the demand for weapons plummet or the act of breaking into houses makes for a sketchy neighborhood and affordable housing.</li></ul>","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2599240/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718030162","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2599240/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718030162","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"- Use of addictions is depicted\r\n- Crude language may be used\r\n- Minor violence"},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Corvos Dynasty is an homage to classic RPGs from the 90's.
