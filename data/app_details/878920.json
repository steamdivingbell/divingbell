{"about_the_game":"Coming in hot and fresh from a distant galaxy to the digital media platform of your choice, it\u2019s Hiveswap Friendsim Vol. 5! Now with two new trolls to friend and be friended by. Delve deeper into the hostile urban landscape of an alien world as you brush up on your Alternian culture. Experience thrills, chills, and perhaps even a little something extra as you swim the murky waters of troll romance. Bet you didn\u2019t see that coming, huh? Romance, in a friendship simulator? Unheard of. People don\u2019t romance their friends, that\u2019s crazy talk. <br><br>Though it might not be what you\u2019d expect\u2014this romance you weren\u2019t expecting, that is. So it might just be what you expected after all. <br>Sufficiently confused? Good. Throw down that dollar and allow us to explain.<br><br>---<br><br>You just crash-landed on Alternia, and you\u2019re <strong>DESPERATE</strong> for friendship! Anyone will do...wait, who are those two trolls approaching you?<br><br>The <i>Hiveswap Friendsim</i> is a quick, loosely-canonical visual novel adventure following the efforts of the unnamed protagonist (that\u2019s you!) to survive and maybe even thrive on the harsh surface of ALTERNIA. Set in the time of <i>Hiveswap: Act 1</i>, this episodic visual novel\u2019s opening volume, written by <i>Homestuck</i> creator <strong>Andrew Hussie</strong>, is sure to satisfy <i>Homestuck</i> and <i>Hiveswap</i> fans who are eager for a darker stroll across the Alternian landscape. <br><br>Future episodes will arrive regularly as DLC.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/878920/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1564506845","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/878920/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1564506845","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/878920/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1564506845","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/878920/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1564506845","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Coming in hot and fresh from a distant galaxy to the digital media platform of your choice, it\u2019s Hiveswap Friendsim Vol. 5!
