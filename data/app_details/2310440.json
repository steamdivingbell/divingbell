Fresh out of college, you decide to make an account on the new social media platform. Upon joining, your lifelong friend, Paul Meyer, adds you, and invites you to a house party. Could this be your chance to live the &quot;college lifestyle&quot; you always dreamed of?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If only it were that simple. You may have had enough drinks to feel confident at that party, enough to the point where you could even ask out Sam, someone you've had a crush on for quite a while, but Paul's nowhere to be found.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Making your way upstairs in your search, you're met with a frightening scene. Paul is being pressed by a man, Jordan Myra, who happens to be the ex-boyfriend of Paul's current girlfriend, Crystal Mendez. He's threatening violence against Paul, seemingly out of pure jealousy. Will you call the cops on him? Take on the fight for yourself? Maybe you decide to leave the party and not get involved at all?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The choice is yours. In this game of tense and fragile relationships, the fate of your friend group and new relationship rests purely in your hands. Will you be able to secure a future for yourself and your significant other? What's really going on behind the scenes in Paul's relationship with Crystal? With countless branching paths, over seventy different endings, and a narrative where rising conflicts are always around the corner, your critical thinking and ability to empathize will be tested thoroughly. One misstep may be all it takes for everything to come crashing down.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">INFINITE CUSTOMIZATION</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2310440/extras/no_compression.gif?t=1733112439\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Make Cryspace your own with many settings available to make the site look just the way you like it.
