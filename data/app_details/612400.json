It offers a cross-section of society, mapping the human condition within a fractured city shaped by the rise of AI.\r\n\r\nThe story touches on mature themes that may not be suitable for all players, depending on their sensibilities. Drama is tastefully suggested rather than depicted raw.\r\n\r\nGameplay includes using a 3D-printed weapon to influence dialogues, intimidate characters, and defend against drones and humans when necessary. Players will take part in stealth sequences involving breaking into apartments while residents sleep, stealing materials, following and trapping individuals, lying, and blackmailing\u2014sometimes for ambiguous or conflicted motives. Explosives are used in scenes that may result in harm to innocent victims, and the narrative explores themes of terrorism and radicalization.\r\n\r\nThe game\u2019s pixel art style and distant camera perspective create a stylized, atmospheric experience, avoiding graphic realism while maintaining emotional weight."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/612400/extras/TLN_NewWorld_01_compressed.png?t=1668780207\" /><br>Humans first knew the era of survival.
