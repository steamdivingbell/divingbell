{"about_the_game":"<strong>Machines are taking over your world!</strong> Their buildings destroy forests, their factories pollute the earth and water. The air is filled with the hum of drones and ships. Your home is dying!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2207470/extras/gom_corruption.gif?t=1726408965\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2207470/extras/steam_page_header_gameplay_600x240.png?t=1726408965\" /><br><br>Gods Against Machines is an <strong>action-packed roguelite strategy</strong> where every run is different thanks to a wide variety of spells and blessings, as well as procedurally generated maps. Here is what you will do in a typical mission of the campaign:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Protect your world</strong> - Huge crystals rising from the ground are your source of mana. Protect them and (optionally, if your build includes such spells) build your base around them with spells that summon different types of buildings - mini volcanoes that bombard enemies from afar, or spirit dwellings that spawn powerful sprites to fight for you.<br></li><li> <strong>Cast Epic Spells</strong> - Use your offensive spells to rain down destruction on your enemies - literally! Fire Rain, Thunderstorm, Meteor Storm - all powerful destructive abilities that unleash your wrath upon the machines.<br></li><li> <strong>Control Corruption</strong> - Prevent machines from spreading corruption - either by destroying their terraformers or by cleaning the corruption yourself using various spells or minions. Do not let it get out of control or you will lose!<br></li><li> <strong>Destroy the machines</strong> - destroy enemy buildings to deplete their resources - when they run out, you win!<br></li><li> <strong>Boss Battles</strong> - When all of the machines' resources are used up, one of their commanders will appear - prepare for an epic final battle!<br></li><li> <strong>Reap as many rewards as you can</strong> - the less corruption your world has suffered, the more rewards you will receive! Acquire new spells, add new abilities to existing spells, and use powerful Blessings to improve your build and find game-changing synergies!</li></ul><br>But that is not all! Not only do you have several gods to choose from, each with their own special spells and mechanics, but there is also Gaia, the Mother of Nature. She will help you throughout the campaign and has her own special powers - and you will be able to activate some of them in each run! In addition, the game's roguelite progression is based on Gaia's powers:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Meta Progression</strong> - Each run allows you to upgrade the abilities of Gaia, who will help you throughout the campaign. The more you play, the more powerful Gaia becomes, and the easier it will be for you to progress! Go beyond the normal campaign into the Void Realm - the game's endless mode. How far can you go?<br></li><li> <strong>Synergize your powers with Gaia</strong> - Pick the right Gaia powers to activate and get crazy synergies that are otherwise impossible. Experiment, upgrade, and replay the campaign to get the overpowered build you need to conquer even the Void Realm!</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2207470/extras/steam_page_header_god_600x240.png?t=1726408965\" /><br><br>Choose the god that best suits your play style! Will it be <strong>Azzinoth, God of Fire and Destruction</strong>? Or perhaps <strong>Nadea, Goddess of Water and Life</strong>? Each god has specific strengths and weaknesses, as well as unique mechanics - for example, if you cast powerful and expensive spells as Nadea, you will cause the sea to rise and slowly but surely drown all your enemies in its depths!<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Azzinoth</strong> - the god of fire focuses on raw destructive power. With spells like <strong>Meteor Storm</strong> or <strong>Volcano</strong>, he can wipe out an entire enemy outpost with a single cast.<br></li><li><strong>Nadea</strong> - the goddess of water does not have the powerful spells of Azzinoth, but she is more in tune with nature. Her tactics usually revolve around slowing down the corruption while building up her powers, then striking with powerful spells and her special power - the <strong>Rising Tide</strong>, which eventually drowns all who oppose her.<br></li><li><strong>Urus</strong> - the god of earth is the lord of spirits and as such can summon them to aid him in battle. Call upon massive <strong>Earth giants</strong> or spirits of the animal kingdom and let them tear your enemies apart!<br></li><li><strong>Zafira</strong> - the goddess of the wind is a tricky one. Her arsenal is a mystery even to the other gods. She likes to borrow their powers and break the rules - casting spells without mana or in places where others cannot. Whether it is pure destruction with the <strong>Void Beam</strong> or taking control of enemies with <strong>Confusion</strong>, she has something for every situation!</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2207470/extras/steam_page_header_features_600x240.png?t=1726408965\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Dynamic spellbook creation:</strong> Choose core spells, add powers to them, and upgrade their properties to create a unique spellbook. Pick powers that complement each other and quickly eliminate your enemies to limit the amount of corruption they can spread across the world.<br></li><li> <strong>Ever-changing world:</strong> Each time you are born, you live in a new world. You will face different enemies in different environments that offer different amounts and quality of prizes.
