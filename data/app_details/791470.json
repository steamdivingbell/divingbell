Each Minotaur is trapped in their half of the split screen \u2013 but only in a combined effort can they escape the cursed labyrinth.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/791470/extras/gifUnderworldP.jpg?t=1574539650\" /><br><br>In this impossible maze, you can merge both halves of the split screen into one and thus hop from one side of the screen over to the other. Use this ability to your advantage! It\u2019s up to you to rearrange and manipulate the level structures of 30 carefully crafted levels in order to carve out a path to the exit. Many have tried to figure out the numerous mind-boggling challenges hidden in the depths of this cursed labyrinth. Will you be the first to solve them?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/791470/extras/gifBlockP.jpg?t=1574539650\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Team DYO</h2>DYO started out as a holiday project of four Game Design students in 2014.
