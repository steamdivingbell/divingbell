{"about_the_game":"Hello. It's a me, Sebio (pls don't sue me Nintendo) and I'm happy to present to you my first game. It's a 2D platformer built by me in Unity that centres around difficulty first, but along the way rewards the player in kind. Be it with it's two storylines or your spending spree in the tavern, where you can use coins collected through your adventure to buy the game's soundtrack or customise your character however you see fit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI imagine now that you are wondering what I meant when I said two storylines. Well, one of them is the single player campaign that's centred around the titular character's adventure be it in The Aran Mountains, The Golden Hills, The Everbloom or high above. The other storyline, is for the ones that want to play with someone else in local co-op, be that your funny dad, brother, sister or whoever you might like to join you in this adventure. Both give the player different perspectives on the world they now inhabit. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the story is nice and dandy, that's not what is at the centre of the experience. Instead I wanted to build a platformer that is centred around the freedom to create your own path. You just have a point A and a point B, the path in-between is your business, let your curiosity guide you through the levels. Who knows what secrets you might find. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI deeply hope that you'll enjoy your time in my game. Good luck and may your path be ever golden!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nP.S. In case you would like to try it, before you buy the full version, there is a demo available that lets you enjoy the first two levels on your own or with a friend by your side.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3189190/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726837627","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3189190/page.bg.jpg?t=1726837627","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3189190/fd5c90b2b8736c22ba95fb05baff1ee835033ea3/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726837627","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3189190/fd5c90b2b8736c22ba95fb05baff1ee835033ea3/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726837627","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3219310,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Hello.
