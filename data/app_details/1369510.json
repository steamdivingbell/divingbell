{"about_the_game":"Patagon is a first person open world VR Steam Punk adventure shooter. It's fun and easy to play. The game takes place in an alternate steampunk reality where the British empire has never ended. Battle giant monsters and dinosaurs while you explore an unmapped island. The gameplay involves, stealth, action, puzzles, and trying to outwit an extremely dangerous environment. But don't worry, you'll have steam punk weapons by your side like the Steam Rifle, and the Tesla Gun, as well as explosive traps. The game begins with you landing on Sand Dollar island. You are looking for the map that will lead you to Patagon. To get the map you will have to explore an entire island filled with wild animals looking to make you their next lunch. You'll have to use all your cunning to make it back in one piece.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1369510/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1670825267","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1369510/page.bg.jpg?t=1670825267","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1369510/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1670825267","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1369510/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1670825267","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"There is shooting and attacks by dinosaurs and other large predators.
