{"about_the_game":"Will The Man Get Frog is a semi-random writing game in which you compose haikus (japanese short poems) in a cute and soothing atmosphere. Carefully crafted constraints will help you be creative regardless of your writing skills. The minimal design gives you space to focus, explore and express yourself. No achievements, no scoring, no leaderboard. It's about you and the words spending quality time together.<br><br>A game session can take from 5 minutes to... well, hours. It all depends on how carried away you get. Sometimes you just want a little distraction, and sometimes it gets more introspective.
