{"about_the_game":"This is a national style light meat pigeon casual game, no need for complex operation, just need to control the positioning and choose to upgrade the skills to experience a sound experience of killing monsters.<br />\r\nThe game prepares 8 hero characters with different characteristics and 8 different challenge maps.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach character gains realm advancement by fighting or reading secret books. Each time you level up, you will receive a large number of attribute points. Attribute points can bring the ability of life value/attack power/movement speed/strike/evasion/immunity etc. to strengthen. The free distribution of points allows you to create a hero character with unique combat characteristics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach basic skill has 3 enhancement directions<br />\r\n        Enhancement of the initial state of the skill increases the attack power and range of the skill.<br />\r\n        When the basic skills reach the mastery achievement, you will automatically understand the mastery, of course, you can also unlock the mastery by reading the related secret books.<br />\r\n        When the mastery achievement of the Jedi Technique is reached, the lost version of the martial arts will automatically be realised, and you can also read the related secret manuals to realise the lost martial arts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEight maps with different styles and terrains, randomly generated statues and monuments, as well as altars, are the key points for you to find and explore. Because it will give you a Chance-like boost. So if the encounter point is too far away, will you arrive at it quickly or will you develop along the way, maybe because you don't have enough growth to realise a powerful skill, or maybe you can't break out of the sea of monsters by swimming in the sea of monsters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDo you regret not choosing the ability to return blood, the ability to be extremely fast, or the skill breakthrough for the encounter you just had? Will you regret that you were too eager to enter the encounter point and were besieged, or too hesitant to survive the difficulty? Whether you will be in the boss control can not move complacently, suddenly by a swarm of small monsters swarmed through the away. All in all, it's a world full of adventure that you can explore over and over again without getting bored.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur  QQ group: 215399722","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"A small taste of the action.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2873100/44b1298562abc636fccb60145a5c490c1de7c6e4.jpg"},{"name":"Legend of the Snowy Mountains","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2873100/97e84e880d14e0c22686e6f197483da5fba28a82.jpg"},{"name":"The Legend of Mori Ridge","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2873100/b9057b9e909f7d63c216dbf45b7368c293190454.jpg"},{"name":"Desert Saga","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2873100/32a58bb996ed1d6c80b108a0c22c874dca1c1445.jpg"},{"name":"Flagfall","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2873100/8414d5419051b9034b05bc35f4813561971d952a.jpg"},{"name":"Legend of the Swamp","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2873100/8dff24b9fb0f545e6ab8ba80fc31429a36fc8003.jpg"},{"name":"Legend of the Canyon","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2873100/7559949fa36fc8d3288109f478fa4b0767c63c8d.jpg"},{"name":"Legend of the Grasslands","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2873100/36481648b0bb038a3cf2d80dd0c3a4ad992f4e3a.jpg"},{"name":"Legend of Tianshan","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2873100/c3ea4b6871f3708b82849b9e89b4f670a3b2c8ff.jpg"},{"name":"Wind Shadow Sword Saint","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2873100/cffa898bb90f9763c097f089e366e7ad4615c434.jpg"}],"total":47},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2873100/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1739114644","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2873100/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1739114644","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2873100/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739114644","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2873100/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739114644","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3019690,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"This is a national style light meat pigeon casual game, no need for complex operation, just need to control the positioning and choose to upgrade the skills to experience a sound experience of killing monsters.<br />\r\nThe game prepares 8 hero characters with different characteristics and 8 different challenge maps.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach character gains realm advancement by fighting or reading secret books.
