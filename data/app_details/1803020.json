{"about_the_game":"<i>Put your boots on, we're heading to the fields! Your job: managing farm plots to feed a village that grows surprisingly fast. Plow, seed and harvest your crops, but be careful: all your actions have a real impact on soil. You're going to need some patience and ingenuity to contend with the weather and seasons. Learn to master this interconnected and everchanging environment in a colorful and fantasy world.</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">You have time</h2>In AgriLife, you decide when to move forward. Week after week, watch your crops grow until harvest. Satisfy their needs thanks to every tool at your disposal. When you've consumed all of your action points, move on to the next week and find out if your choices were the right ones.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A systemic environment\u2026</h2>Your tools allow you to tame nature. But don't forget it has its own rules: the soil is full of life and evolves turn after turn. The weather impacts the ground and varies with the seasons.You will have to analyze the type of land in the map's different regions, and understand how nutrients, humidity, and in the longer term erosion risks, are applicable there.<br><br>Your crops are at the center of this ecosystem, interacting with everything else: they draw the necessary resources from the soil, suffer the weather hazards and influence the nearby plants and the land in which they take root.<br>The needs and interactions are species-specific, and each species belongs to a family.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\u2026 and mouths to feed</h2>Population is the crux of AgriLife. If its satisfaction falls to zero, it's over! In order to avoid that, keep an eye on food supplies by continuously selling your crops to the village. But the size of the village will increase at each turn and production will have to keep up! People will also ask for specific types of food. Fulfilling their demands - or not - is up to you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Become a master farmer</h2>The more the population grows, the more you have to produce. But fortunately, there are many elements to unlock throughout the game. Get new tools and unlock tips on how to use them. Expand your land with new plots to till. Unlock valuable strategy advice in the encyclopedia.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Permadeath</h2>Mother Nature doesn't forgive mistakes easily. If you lose the game, you have to start again from the beginning! But don't panic, you keep everything you\u2018ve unlocked. You simply start over with new plots and the initial village, ready to go further than before.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">It's your choice</h2>The ability to start over again and again allows you to try any strategy you want, without any clear-cut path. But it's also a double-edged sword, because you're not safe from completely depleted soil or bankruptcy due to unnecessary purchases. You face nature alone, and it fights back.
