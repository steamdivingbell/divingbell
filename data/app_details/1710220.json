{"about_the_game":"Walking into Walls is a 3D Escape Maze.  The game is comprised of three different mazes, each with a different theme.  Players enter the mazes and work their ways to an exit.  Along the way there could be objects or clues to find, there could be actions to complete, or there could be puzzles to solve.  In any case, getting through the mazes is one thing, getting out is something else entirely.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCaution:  This game is not for the impatient or the weak minded.  If you are spatially challenged, do not buy this game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1710220/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1689003829","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1710220/page.bg.jpg?t=1689003829","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1710220/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1689003829","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1710220/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1689003829","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":1712520,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Walking into Walls is a 3D Escape Maze.
