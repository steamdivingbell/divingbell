{"about_the_game":"Music-making is at its best a collaborative process and the music to Farewell North is a definite example of that. Therefore, there are a number of people to thank for making this score possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirstly a huge thank you goes to all the wonderful musicians whose musical sensitivity and dedication brought this score to life. Kostantina Ventouri Roussou (flute/alto flute/piccolo), Maria Skandali (cello), Mislav Rezic (guitar), Sandro Friedrich (pipes), Siobhan Miller (vocals), and of course, Dan Safford (fiddle/violins/viola), who had a particularly outsized impact on this score. It is safe to say that without their involvement and commitment to this music and story, Farewell North would have been a lot poorer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI also want to thank Joel for bearing with me through the (seemingly never-ending) process of producing a 3-hour long score, helping me realise my vision through those hundreds (of thousands) of tiny iterations that make all the difference, and delivering an end result that sounds better than I could ever have imagined.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, the most important thank you of all goes to Kyle, who kindly trusted me with this very special, touching game and gifted me with what has been one of the deepest, most meaningful and gratifying collaborations I have had the pleasure of being a part of. Knowing how important this project is to him, it is unbelievable how creatively open and welcoming was to me these past few years. His beautiful story alone was more than enough to make this a dream game to work on, but it was his passion and unwavering support of my deep involvement in the development process that left me most wanting to rise to the occasion and try to capture the emotional core of this story as earnestly as I possibly could. And, having spent a few cherished years living in Edinburgh myself, visiting the Highlands and sharing a flat with a little pal, Farewell North hit quite close to home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMusic by John Konsolakis<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMixed &amp; Mastered by Jo\u00ebl Dolli\u00e9<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFiddle / Violins / Viola: Dan Safford<br />\r\nCello: Maria Skandali<br />\r\nUilleann Pipes / Scottish Highland Pipes: Sandro Friedrich<br />\r\nFlute / Alto Flute / Piccolo: Kostantina Ventouri Roussou<br />\r\nAcoustic Guitar: Mislav Rezic<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cMy Heart\u2019s in the Highlands\u201d vocals performed by Siobhan Miller<br />\r\nOriginal lyrics by Robert Burns<br />\r\nEngineered by Euan Burton<br />\r\nSupported by National Lottery funding through Creative Scotland<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpecial Thanks:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMarietta Kandilaki<br />\r\nHarry Andre Katsillis<br />\r\nHumphrey<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u2026 and to all of you for listening<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u00a9 all rights reserved","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3154100/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724149766","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3154100/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1724149766","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3154100/c01aed43448a4b409b87dbec265c4b49cad8c8ad/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724149766","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3154100/c01aed43448a4b409b87dbec265c4b49cad8c8ad/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724149766","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Music-making is at its best a collaborative process and the music to Farewell North is a definite example of that.
