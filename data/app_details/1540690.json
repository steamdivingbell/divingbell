{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">UPDATE as of 12/14/2024: We have decided to change the format of the navigation for the game. It was previously static screens that you moved through using the mini-map icons but now it will be a first-person grid-based movement system (paying homage to 90s era Dungeon Crawlers). There will still be some static screens (for townspeople you visit, etc.) but most exploration will be on the grid map. Battle will also be on the grid-based map. A basic gameplay trailer has been released to show the new layout (UI, grid-based, etc.) The old screenshots are gone now. Don't be surprised to see the screenshots changing as time goes by. - Matthew </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This RPG is partially inspired by the classic Sleeping Beauty story. Fate of Persephone attempts to give a new spin on role playing games: a predominately female cast of characters, a 'magic only' battle structure, and a focus on alternative ways to advance in the game. The game awards experience points not only for fighting but also for acquiring wisdom through puzzle solving, lore studying, secret area finding, etc.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A full digital audio music score in high-quality stereo WAV format is also included to allow us to more accurately help the player to become engrossed in the game; as we feel that music is one of the most powerful forms of art available to games.
