{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Immerse yourself in a haunting journey that challenges your sanity, where every level is a riddle waiting to be solved and every moment is filled with unsettling uncertainty.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>You find yourself trapped in a dark, twisted dreamscape, an endless maze of dimly lit hallways and desolate rooms that seem to stretch on forever. Each step forward is hesitant, as the very environment feels alive, intent on confusing and disorienting you. The oppressive atmosphere weighs heavily, with shadows that flicker and dance, and every creak and whisper echoing from unseen corners fills you with unease. It's a world where even the air seems to pulse with dread, and the question is not only where you are but whether you can truly escape.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Inspired by the eerie mystery of the classic backrooms, this game turns every door into a gamble and every room into a potential nightmare. There is a constant, unshakable feeling that something is watching, always lurking just out of sight. The silence is broken only by the occasional distant sound\u2014a reminder that you're not alone. The only way to survive is to stay calm, think clearly, and press forward, but each decision feels like a step deeper into the unknown. Beware, because you won\u2019t always know where you're heading, and sometimes, turning back might not be an option.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Can you uncover the hidden secrets of these shifting levels before it\u2019s too late?
