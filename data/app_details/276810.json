{"about_the_game":"<strong>Mordheim: City of the Damned </strong>is the first video game adaptation of Games Workshop's cult classic tabletop game Mordheim. Set in the Warhammer World's decimated Empire city, Mordheim: City of the Damned is a turn-based tactical game where you lead warbands into bloody and lethal skirmishes. The game blends RPG elements, fast-paced tactical combat and intricate unit customization in a time wrought by chaos and rivalry where only the strongest survive. <br><br>After a twin tailed comet crashed on Mordheim, the City of Damned turned into a terrifying battlefield where rival warbands fight fiercely for the control of key neighborhoods, looking for glory and fortune by acquiring the very valuable Wyrdstone fragments. <br><br>Choose from iconic Mordheim warbands - Sisters of Sigmar, the Cult of the Possessed, Skaven, Mercenaries from the Empire - and lead your troops to battle. Recruit new units, equip them with enhanced gear. Evolve and customize your warband with the experience gained from each successful mission, transforming them into a terrifying force on the battlefield. <br><br>Devise the best strategy to annihilate your rivals. If you fail, some of your units might lose a limb... or worse. Keep in mind that in Mordheim: City of the Damned, a dead unit is lost forever! Consider the environment when formulating your battle strategy, exploiting the unique buildings, ruins or the layout of the streets. Deploy your troops carefully and anticipate the actions of your adversaries to set up ambushes! Organize ingenious battle plans where the talents of your units will be as important as your own luck during key moments of combat. <br><br>Loot items and weapons hidden in the ruins, or steal those of fallen opponents. Survive the dangers that abound in the City of the Damned and collect as many Wyrdstones as you can, but remain ever vigilant. Mordheim is one of the most treacherous places in the Warhammer World! <br><br>In these epic battles where fame and glory await, your strategy will definitely be your best ally! Visit the four corners of the City of the Damned to complete multiple missions in the solo campaign, or challenge other players in enthralling multiplayer modes.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fully customize your warbands<br></li><li>Choose from a multitude of classes with unique abilities to create unique strategies<br></li><li>Take your troops to battle and test their synergy on the field<br></li><li>Gain experience to unlock Player's special abilities<br></li><li>Spend the Wyrdstones to acquire powerful items and unlock more choices and features<br></li><li>Face other Player's Warbands in head to head skirmishes</li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Skaven - Act 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/276810/dac92c07475081a0d318f65ad523a1e5063f36f0.jpg"},{"name":"Mercenaries - Act 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/276810/d93ece0f557b2dcd263ec89de7e78e0dc8397e59.jpg"},{"name":"Cult of the Possessed - Act 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/276810/2c765e6be56c769eec4b49718007ff8ef6e8208f.jpg"},{"name":"Sisters of Sigmar - Act 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/276810/641611c32d500380b11785b25b244372038abcf5.jpg"},{"name":"No Allegiance","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/276810/e32c13861ce9f875b73afdb2799bc55cfc0537c3.jpg"},{"name":"Skaven - Act 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/276810/596fd09d7d9c8871c47b1c68b696ba5176c0a0ed.jpg"},{"name":"Mercenaries - Act 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/276810/302ab06675b10ceb5325b3df0836bc749a141d1f.jpg"},{"name":"Cult of the Possessed - Act 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/276810/4c53f75e10ecd7133360f75db61cd4a3b77a7fa7.jpg"},{"name":"Sisters of Sigmar - Act 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/276810/82ced83e8db3e93f9de5f06814859abf0a695b44.jpg"},{"name":"Completionist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/276810/1ada08d64699022af76c1caa7feb3febb412cf7a.jpg"}],"total":109},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/276810/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726153222","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/276810/page.bg.jpg?t=1726153222","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/276810/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726153222","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/276810/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726153222","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Mordheim: City of the Damned </strong>is the first video game adaptation of Games Workshop's cult classic tabletop game Mordheim.
