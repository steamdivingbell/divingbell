Discussions of these events may be uncomfortable or upsetting for some readers. \r\n\r\nVampire Therapist does not take a dismissive or trivializing approach to these topics, but rather seeks to comment on them in a way that is engaging, thought-provoking, and often humorous as a way to process trauma. However, due to the sensitive nature of the topics covered, some readers may find the content difficult to process.\r\n\r\nIf you have a history of trauma related to any of these topics, please approach Vampire Therapist with caution and take care of yourself.\r\n\r\nNaturally, a game about vampires will also involve blood and sexual themes (though nothing explicit is shown). Strong language is also present.\r\n\r\nIf you have any personal concerns about the content of Vampire Therapist, we encourage you to seek the advice of a mental health professional or support group before playing."},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":2986250,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2481020/extras/storyheader.jpg?t=1737467207\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Vampire Therapist is a narrative adventure / therapy simulator in the vein (get it) of <i>What We Do in the Shadows, Young Frankenstein, My Dinner with Andr\u00e9</i>, and <i>Horrible Histories</i> where you play as a reformed bloodsucker helping other vampires find inner peace.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This isn't your typical visual novel \u2014 featuring a fangtastic cast (such as Matthew Mercer, Sarah Grayson, and Cyrus Nemati), Vampire Therapist teaches <strong>real therapy concepts</strong> with a story that explores what it means to live, die, live again, and maybe even how to feel alive.
