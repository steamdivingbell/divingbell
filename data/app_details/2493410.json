{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Shadow of the Demon Lord Freeport Trilogy</h2>   <br> The Classic Freeport Adventure for Shadow of the Demon Lord! <br>  <br> The story begins with the award-winning adventure Death in Freeport. In this adventure, designed for novice characters, the characters find themselves stranded in Freeport, the great trading city on the Pirate Isles, and recruited to perform a simple job for a decent reward. However, the deeper they dig into the mystery, the stranger the tale becomes until uncover a terrible conspiracy and secrets worth dying for. <br>  <br> The story continues with the Terror in Freeport, intended for expert characters. Having uncovered a vile cult in the first adventure, the player characters learn that not all cultists lurk beneath the streets, and not all serpent people are agents of evil. Terror in Freeport brings the thrilling second chapter to life and gives you everything you need to unravel the tangled plot that represents the greatest danger the City of Adventure has ever faced. <br>  <br> The story concludes with Madness in Freeport, intended for master characters. The unveiling of Milton's Folly draws near, and the player characters must uncover its sinister secrets before time runs out.
