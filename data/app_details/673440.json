{"about_the_game":"Revisit the original <i>Stronghold</i> with this cosmetic DLC! It's 1492 and The Wolf has somehow both lived for several hundred years and made it to the land of opportunity! Medieval England can wait, because it's up to you to journey west and make America great again.<br><br>The 'USA Campaign Map Skin' DLC changes the in-game single player campaign map from medieval England to the United States, allowing you to replay the original 'castle sim' as if you were somehow driving The Wolf out of the USA! While this DLC changes nothing about the missions themselves, that shouldn't take away from the pride one can and should take from reclaiming the colonies.<br><br><strong>Please Note</strong> - This is a free DLC released to celebrate Independence Day 2017.
