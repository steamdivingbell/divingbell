Your goal is clear: defeat all the monsters and unmask the dark figure behind the necromancer\u2019s alias. To defeat him, you will need to collect all the Necrocat\u2019s amulets that hold fragments of his dark soul.

As monsters are defeated, more powerful monsters appear, and more rewards are given upon defeating them. Each region of the game will have a number of amulets that are acquired by reaching soul fragment goals collected after defeating each monster. Whenever you reach a goal that you had previously achieved, instead of earning the same amulet, you will receive corrupted souls, which will be used to further enhance the power of the amulets. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Play Strategically!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each region or map will have different quantities of enemies and items, as well as different sizes and shapes of battlefields.
