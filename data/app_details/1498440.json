{"about_the_game":"About:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Experimental is an old-school 3D platformer where you have to complete levels in order to unlock new levels. Some levels have different unlock requirements like time, score collected or attempts needed. If you fail to unlock a level you can always try again, but you cannot save the game inside a level. Your best attempts are saved so you can always try to improve your results.<br></li><li>Use various items scattered throughout the levels. Keys are needed to unlock some doors. Score items are sometimes required to unlock new levels. Weapons are sometimes necessary to survive the onslaught of enemies some of which can respawn just like you. Armor can give you an advantage by making you take less damage or sometimes even nullifying the damage done by weak enemies. Explosives can be used to take quick care of large amount of enemies, but be careful as explosions affect everything around. Some objects can be moved or destroyed when they block your path forward. However, be careful when moving heavy objects as they may end up on top of you.<br></li><li>Not all robots you encounter are enemies. Some robots can help you by throwing items to you that you wouldn\u2019t be able to reach otherwise. You may even try to give these robots some spare weapons and armor and see what happens.</li></ul><br>About workshop:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>If you know how to use Blender, 3ds Max or some other 3d modeling software, you can try to make your own custom levels and if you want to, you can share them with other players through workshop.
