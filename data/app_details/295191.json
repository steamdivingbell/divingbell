By the time the class was retired, they had been repainted from their original green livery to BR Corporate Blue, which this add-on recreates. As with many classes of shunter, many found subsequent employment with private owners after withdrawal by British Rail, and no less than seven examples have survived into preservation. The Class 07s on heritage railways still fulfil their primary functions of yard work and assembling trains.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/295191/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1447361471","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/295191/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1447361471","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/295191/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1447361471","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/295191/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1447361471","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"*NOTE* This pack is available in the in-game store under the Marketplace tab.
