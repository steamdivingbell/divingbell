{"about_the_game":"When Honor Dies is an action-based singleplayer, hack and slash adventure game with story-telling elements. Its main focus is its combat, which includes sword skills and combos, combined with magic abilities. Fight your way through hordes of enemies, gather orbs, unlock new skills and abilities, and take your revenge.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen Honor Dies is both an action and an adventure game at the same time. What does this mean? It means that the story element is not neglected. Thus, players can get more attached to characters, as well as the world of When Honor Dies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA master swordsman. Renjiro is not simply a swordsman but a prodigy with unfathomable skills. His expertise shows in combat, when he unleashes powerful combos with dexterous movement against his enemies. With the dark spirit's powers, Renjiro's already prodigious abilities will reach new heights.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA novice spell weaver. Speaking of the dark spirit, Renjiro is also slowly learning new magical powers that will assist him in his cause. The more enemies he kills, the more acquainted he becomes with his newborn self, discovering more powerful spells and tricks to aid him.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA combination of the two. You do not have to choose between the two. Both magical and physical skills will be permanently available to the player once unlocked. This means that there is no limitation in how you approach the game. On the contrary, you can choose to focus on a single one if that is your cup of tea or you could use both simultaneously and become an unstoppable force of destruction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnique bosses. Unlike other games, bosses in this game are unique. This means that every single boss will have its own mechanics, strengths, and weaknesses, and the player will have to figure out how to tackle them best on their own. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe controls of the game are very well-known to people that have played the games-inspirations. The game is played with the use of a keyboard and a mouse; the keyboard is used for movement and magical abilities and the mouse is used for camera handling and sword techniques. There will be no deviations from that norm as this game is not intended to confuse people how are only now discovering this genre. It is as new-user friendly as possible and its main aim is fun, rather than tedious planning and keyboard bindings allocation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs far as the action part of the game is concerned, it is fast-paced and energetic. Enemies will pop out often and they will try to kill you. The player is called to utilize everything in their arsenal to defeat the enemies as efficiently as possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, action is not the only thing going on! As the player progresses the game, they will slowly but surely discover more and more as to why you were betrayed, who was the mastermind, what led them to do that, and so on and so forth. Together with this, the player will eventually discover the Dark Spirit's true intentions, its drive, and also its true power. Finally, the world of When Honor Dies, has its own secrets hidden in plain sight for the player to discover. If one is perceptive enough, they may earn more background and world information or maybe even discover new hidden areas. So, partial exploration is encouraged, even though it is not mandatory.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1694170?t=1682599418","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1694170?t=1682599418","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1694170/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1682599418","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1694170/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1682599418","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"blood, strong language"},"demos":[{"appid":1694900,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"When Honor Dies is an action-based singleplayer, hack and slash adventure game with story-telling elements.
