Games like Centipede or Marble Madness that use that giant trackball. In fact, this game was originally created and placed in an arcade machine to promote a local game festival. If you\u2019d like to try out that classic arcade feel, the game has been setup to work with the default setup on an X-Arcade Tankstick With a Trackball.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Six Levels</h2>There are just 6 levels in Marble Muse Arcade. This is intentional as many of the classic arcade games had a similar number. Each time you complete all 6, you will start back at the beginning, but the difficulty will be ramped up.
