{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Welcome to Dream &amp; Sugar, a wholesome visual novel exploring relationships, love, and the transition to adulthood. You are a recent art college graduate who dreams of becoming an independent artist with their very own art gallery installation. Reconnect with your college bestie Riley, hit it off with dashing musician Hugo, and befriend thoughtful author Bennett. You decide which relationships to pursue! Will you find love in unexpected places? Or maybe you'd like to take things slower and focus on Nora's art goals instead? The choice is up to you!  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Features</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Branching Dialogue!<br>Dream &amp; Sugar features branching dialogue purposefully written to let you create your own story. Each scene is individually written, with no two paths being exactly the same. You'll get to see the full dialogue of your choices before you choose, so the surprises will come from the twists and turns as you speak to your friends and lovers. Will you be brash? Funny? Empathetic? Or mix and match your responses unpredictably!</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Unique Endings!<br>Find love or heartbreak as you navigate through a variety of social situations. Make choices about where to go for dates, who to flirt with, and how to respond to social encounters. Your choices can lead you to one of more than ten unique endings! Will you make friends or lovers? Will you focus on your relationships? Your career? Or yourself? Only you can decide!</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">LGBTQ+ Friendly!<br>Dream &amp; Sugar is proud to offer an all-inclusive romance experience. During character creation, you can change your character's name, choose your physical gender presentation, and your pronouns (including non-binary!). Your character choices do not prevent you from pursuing any of the game's romantic options, and even include an option to play the game completely aromatically! Receive different dialogue reflecting your choices, without being prohibited from experiencing the full scope of the game!</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Interactive Art Minigame!<br>Have a creative vision? During the story you'll be given the option to draw in our art minigame! These images can be saved to your computer to share with your friends and family. If illustration isn't your strong suit or you just really want to get back to the story, you won't be forced to look at blank canvases. Dream &amp; Sugar does come with default images drawn by our staff and demo team for those who would prefer to move past the minigame. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Human Made!<br>CouchLionStudios did not use AI during the production of Dream &amp; Sugar. We're proud to encourage our talented staff to show off what they can do!</p></li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Rich Cappuccino","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2875990/d3431bb831a69c2e1256d02bf8fef90937a64ba8.jpg"},{"name":"Flat White","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2875990/079804bcc621a718cedef6579115875dcb4a1c0f.jpg"},{"name":"Watery Americano","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2875990/0853f8c67f93f58f3bf42d0542669bac79f87867.jpg"},{"name":"Macchiato","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2875990/b7a8e1bcb78aa206562bcda17477021e6d957ccd.jpg"},{"name":"Espresso","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2875990/9659e23fe6b713b0509c04660275dda78fb361ee.jpg"},{"name":"Latte","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2875990/5b97a3a80abe76846a44cf02564e0c5936f7407c.jpg"},{"name":"Mocha","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2875990/a2d19d0c43dc5810be3cb2d3988e4eeb3049d268.jpg"},{"name":"Dark Roast","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2875990/0598925883776943979dc49732ce615012cada55.jpg"},{"name":"Boiled Foam","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2875990/f7e8bea5f76fce7258bff08f35328ec13d9588f5.jpg"},{"name":"Burned Coffee","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2875990/a680f10cf6fc22b70ab3b85109b956bc0f52e29b.jpg"}],"total":25},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2875990/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736383187","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2875990/page.bg.jpg?t=1736383187","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2875990/90979fac505ed2472cb66d7a681db03459f635ed/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736383187","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2875990/90979fac505ed2472cb66d7a681db03459f635ed/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736383187","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Welcome to Dream &amp; Sugar, a wholesome visual novel exploring relationships, love, and the transition to adulthood.
