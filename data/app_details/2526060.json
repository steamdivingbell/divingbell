The world has taken a nosedive into complete madness, not that it was ever sane to begin with. But hey, this is your golden opportunity, right? Embrace the chaos, because who needs normalcy anyway?  In times of crisis, people talk about taking bold actions and decisive steps. But let's be real \u2013 that's terrifying!
