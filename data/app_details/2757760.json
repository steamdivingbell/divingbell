{"about_the_game":"After drifting apart for several years, a chance encounter brings four best friends back together for the journey of a lifetime. For Summer Nansen (CV: Angel Haven Rey), this trip is not only a chance to rekindle old friendships, but also to discover what it is she wants out of life. Alongside a new robot friend named Curiosity, the four friends travel from planet to planet, exploring the natural wonders and diverse alien cultures that they come across. Their journey culminates at the borderline of existence itself: the very edge of the universe.<br><br>Summer at the Edge of the Universe contains two routes with romantic endings and one route with a platonic ending. Each route takes the gang to 4 different planets, meeting the locals and making memories that will last for a lifetime.<br><br>This demo is approximately 18,000 words long and contains the game's first chapter. It is expected to take 2-4 hours to complete, depending on reading speed.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Characters</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2757760/extras/steam_summer.png?t=1722193438\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2757760/extras/steam_quinn.png?t=1722193438\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2757760/extras/steam_izzy.png?t=1722193438\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2757760/extras/steam_hanna.png?t=1722193438\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2>From the creators of Please Be Happy and Twofold:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Three routes, two romantic and one platonic<br></li><li>Expansive original soundtrack by Sarah Mancuso<br></li><li>Beautiful character art by adirosa<br></li><li>A really good robot<br></li><li>Full English voice acting</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2757760/extras/it_s_curio2.png?t=1722193438\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2757760/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1722193438","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2757760/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1722193438","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2757760/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1722193438","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2757760/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1722193438","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Captions available","id":13}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"After drifting apart for several years, a chance encounter brings four best friends back together for the journey of a lifetime.
