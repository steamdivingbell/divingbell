{"about_the_game":"<strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Bull3000VRTS</h2></strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Category:</h2> A competitive VR <strong>RTS-shooter hybrid</strong>.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>What is &quot;Bull3000VRTS&quot;?</strong></h2>Bull3000VRTS is a competitive VR game that combines the thrill of a shooter with the strategic depth of an RTS. The exhilarating tension between precise aiming skills and tactical leadership sets it apart from other games in the genre. In Bull3000VRTS, it's not just about knowing which units counter each other \u2014 it's also about gauging your aiming prowess and understanding how to effectively engage in combat with a mix of unit strengths and weaknesses.<br><br>But that's not all! The game also shines when it comes to macro strategy, such as resource planning, managing large-scale unit movements, and controlling the map. These aspects create a rich and immersive strategic experience that will captivate both seasoned and new players alike.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Mechanics and Differences from Other Games</h2></strong><br>Unlike classic RTS games with free base building, Bull3000VRTS features yellow boxes, typically found in cities, that must be activated with logistics units. Players can then choose a building to construct in that specific slot. This innovative approach encourages and rewards map control and strategic contesting of areas with building slots.<br><br>The game also introduces a unique 3-resource system, requiring Oil for driving tanks, Ammo for firing weapons, and of course, Money for purchasing Units and Buildings \u2014 similar to what you would expect in other RTS games.<br><br>Designed exclusively for 1v1 and 2v2 PvP gameplay, Bull3000VRTS offers an intense and competitive experience. Though PvE modes may be considered for the distant future, the game currently focuses on thrilling player-versus-player action.<br><br>Another standout feature is the ability to move your VR player in any direction, adjusting height and position, allowing you to view the battlefield from any angle, whether far away or close to units, high above or down at ground level. This truly showcases the immersive benefits of VR technology.<br>One of the innovative features developed specifically for VR is the Ghost system for unit movement. Players can grab the Ghost with their VR hands and move it to the desired location, with units following along. While the game offers complete information, allowing you to see where your enemy is planning to move their units, it also adds a layer of complexity. It can be challenging to remember which Ghost belongs to which unit if you don't keep track. Players can toggle the display of Ghosts on their VR controller, hiding or showing them as desired.<br><br>Additionally, players can customize their experience by toggling team colors\u2014green and blue\u2014on or off. If you prefer to see more natural colors for units and buildings, you can disable team colors.
