{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/640780/extras/Headlines_Sumary.png?t=1580316252\" /><br><br>Battle Mech Frontier is a turn-based artillery game where two teams face each-other over a fully-destructible terrain and try to knock each other out (either by damaging or by overthrowing) until only one side is standing. To do that, they must aim their shots accurately by calculating the initial speed and angle the projectile needs in order for its trajectory to hit nothing but their target, all that while accounting for the wind, gravity, and other player\u2019s abilities. Strategy is key, communication is essential, and explosions are a lot of fun. So, do you have what it takes to rule the Battle Frontier?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/640780/extras/Headlines_Loadout.png?t=1580316252\" /><br><br>An ever-exponentially-growing number of different loadouts will ensure not only that your gameplay feels right to you, and that you don\u2019t always know what to expect from your enemies!<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Classes</h2>4 completely different roles can be played strategically to ensure victory upon even the toughest enemies. Be you a Shooter, Digger, Tank or Healer, your team will be relying upon you to be as awesome as we know you are! Each class also comes with their own skills and abilities and different damage types, creating even more possibilities!<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Skills</h2>There are 3 skill slots plus 1 special ability slot. You can put whichever combination of skills you want in them! Furthermore, higher slot numbers cause your shots to have more power and higher costs.

However, be aware that you can never increase any stat without decreasing another in return. This balanced system ensures NO PAY-TO-WIN will ever be possible! Since no player can be directly stronger than another, may the best team win!<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Consumables</h2>6 slots, endless possibilities. In need of healing, some extra damage, or even greater mobility? Consumable Items are what you\u2019re looking for!
