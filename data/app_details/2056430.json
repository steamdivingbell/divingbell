{"about_the_game":"What Has Come Before is a perspective-driven puzzle game set in an eerie and stylish black and white Lynchian world. Stuck in limbo with only hearing and vision to guide, players must utilize clever changes in perspective to move forward.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo progress through levels, players must clearly grasp what they're looking at, moving camera or following ambient cues to change their circumstances - or their entire outlook. Doing more with less, the game hones its gameplay by presenting different puzzles that involve only simple movement, sight, and hearing while still posing a genuine challenge. Combining this with striking black and white visuals and immersive sound, What Has Come Before endeavors to provide an original take on the puzzle genre.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2056430/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731559410","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2056430/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1731559410","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2056430/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731559410","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2056430/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731559410","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"What Has Come Before is a perspective-driven puzzle game set in an eerie and stylish black and white Lynchian world.
