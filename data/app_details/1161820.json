He has no choice but to escape to the ward and get out of the ward. Outside the door is a mutant named Ashley. Ashley has a tragic past. She married a rich family, but did not live a rich life. She was tortured by domestic violence and cruelty until her mental disorder. In order to escape the law, her husband bought Hopkins'psychiatrist Rogan and thought through it.
