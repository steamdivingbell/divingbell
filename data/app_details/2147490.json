{"about_the_game":"<i>Requires Open beta</i><br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DCS: MB-339</h2></strong><br>The MB-339 is a single engine, twin seat, Italian jet trainer and light ground support aircraft derived from the legendary MB-326 and designed during the Cold War. The aircraft entered service in the early 80\u2019s becoming the main training platform of the Italian Air Force.<br><br>The MB-339 was exported in several foreign countries in which some specimens are still operative. This aircraft also took part in the Falklands-Malvinas war with the Armada de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina (Argentina Navy) and was also used by the Eritrean Air Force in various roles, against rebels, smugglers, and even against the Ethiopian Air Force.<br><br>Historical operators of this aircraft in its A version were the Italian Air Force, Malaysia, Nigeria, Peru, United Arabs Emirates, Argentina and Ghana. Thanks to its superb flying qualities, the MB-339 in its aerobatic version (PAN) is also used by two great national aerobatic teams: the \u201cFrecce Tricolori\u201d (Italian Air Force) and the \u201cAl Fursan\u201d (\u201cThe Knights\u201d \u2013 UAE Air Force).<br><br>The MB-339 is the only jet aircraft capable of performing the famous Lomcov\u00e1k manoeuvre. The DCS: MB-339 aims to be the most realistic simulation of this aircraft ever made for PC, not only in terms of system functionalities but especially flight performances.<br><br>The MB-339 will be available in an almost complete state. The External Flight Model (EFM) is based on performance and engineering data of the real aircraft. Furthermore, the flight model has been tested by real MB-339 pilots including former Frecce Tricolori.
