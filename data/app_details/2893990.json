{"about_the_game":"What if ninjas fought in a trampoline park, but with paint? Ninjas on Trampolines is a two-to-four player platform fighter where players are ninjas that splatter their opponents on the battlefield. Use trampolines to fight for aerial superiority. Having the most paint on the battlefield will make you victorious, but be careful because your opponents can paint over what you have already. The person with the most paint at the end of a match is declared the winner.<br><br><br><strong>Trampolines:</strong><br>Trampolines are an essential aspect of this game, hence the name. Using them allows you to get higher on maps and outmaneuver your opponents. They are completely physics-based; the higher your velocity, the higher you bounce off them.<br><br><u>Standstill Jump:</u><br>While standing on a trampoline with no vertical velocity, you can press and hold the jump button to bounce off it.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2893990/extras/standstill_jump.gif?t=1731616894\" /><br><br><u>Using Momentum:</u><br>If you are airborne, you can fall onto a trampoline to keep your momentum.

This can be achieved by attacking opponents, using items, interacting with game mode objects, and spraying tags onto the background.<br><br><u>Attacking:</u><br>Attacking opponents will splatter paint of your color on the stage.
