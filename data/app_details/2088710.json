True, there are platforms around, but they are really there to create a simple form of maze. The game is simple too, flap or walk your way round until you find a randomly hidden pudding, eat it and another will appear somewhere else in the maze of interlinked screens. Keep you energy up by eating flying things, whilst avoiding eating anything else as that just decreases your energy. As a result the game is very playable [...] Graphically it is very good with nice animation and the large maze characters add to the atmosphere. Sound, too, is good, with a powerful synthesiser tune at the start. I enjoyed it\u201d<br>Crash!
