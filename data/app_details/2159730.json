It is thanks to their contributions that the game was able to be released before Labor Day. <br>We would also like to thank fate for introducing us to two passionate voice directors, over 60 voice actors , and numerous volunteers . Despite the large amount of dialogue, and the lack of sufficient funds to dub every word, they persevered and completed nearly 100,000 words of the script through multiple recording sessions. <br>We are grateful that you have taken an interest in &quot;The Forgotten Concluder&quot;. <br>Although it is not a perfect game, it possesses a retro charm that is not representative of the times, and the character model and action design are also outdated compared to other games of the same genre.<br>We hope that players can gradually experience the changes in the protagonist's mentality and the various events he experienced along the way in the slow-burning plot, and gain insights at the end. <br>The revenue generated from the game's release will be used to optimize the game for a better gaming experience. <br>We thank you for your understanding and for patiently waiting. <br>If you encounter any problems during the game, please feel free to join the player group and provide feedback QQ Group :772611363 or Facebook\uff1a\u9738\u528d\u9704\u96f2\u9304<br>Gameplay strategies can be found on the fan strategy group's Weibo: \u9738\u5251\u9704\u4e91\u5f55\u653b\u7565\u7ec4</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>&quot;A covenant for enternity, A sword to succeed.&quot;<br><br>In the high of Mount Taishan, there is a deep valley that never been known, isolated to the motral world.
