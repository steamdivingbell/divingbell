{"about_the_game":"A virtual reality hunting game. Choose between shooting flying ducks in random patterns, hunting a deer or a boar in the open. Every score point you'll get the animals become harder to hit. It's a bit of a relaxing &quot;outdoors&quot; game with low poly graphics. Wildlife VR is perfect for first-time-vr-experience since it's not hard to jump straight into. Choose between three different weapons; Revolver, Shotgun or Sniper-rifle.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/500140?t=1469813395","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/500140/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1469813395","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/500140/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1469813395","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/500140/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1469813395","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Update Notes</h1><p><strong>Wildlife update 2.0</strong><br><br>We've been busy, real busy.
