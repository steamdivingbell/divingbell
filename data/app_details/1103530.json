{"about_the_game":"Cascadia Quest is a reboot of the classic adventure games from the mid eighties. You'll take on the role of an eager but incompetent junior ranger in the lush forests surrounding Foreboding Spire. You'll be sent on a wild adventure into deep forest, up snowy mountains, into mysterious caverns, all the while trying to uncover a mysterious plot to sabotage the wilderness. The game is infused with lore from the Pacific Northwest region of the USA.<br><br>Before point-and-click games came along, adventure game characters were controlled by typing. Frustrating? By today's standards, yes it was!
