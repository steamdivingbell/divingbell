Along with the 5 levels it adds, in The Croaker 1.1 (So an update from now), you will be able to create levels in the level editor using Ice and upload them for other Ice DLC members to play. Also, when you complete the Ice DLC, you unlock a new Ice variant of the Frog skin.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2953420?t=1714072931","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2953420/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1714072931","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2953420/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714072931","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2953420/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714072931","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to the Ice DLC!
