{"about_the_game":"<strong>Flora and the Ceibo Seeds</strong> is a 3D adventure game. The player will join Flora in her path while she immerses herself in tales and legends of indigenous people from Argentina. These stories are our key to dive into eco-environmental issues.<br><br>Flora (8) is an adventurous girl who loves to hear the legends that her grandmother Juana (70) tells her every night. One day, a particularly bored Flora goes adventuring in her backyard when she suddenly runs into Killa, the moon in human form. She has lost her shine and has come down to the earth in search of Inti, the sun. From this point on Flora will be the helper of mythical characters in need of her aid. Each level involves a climate imbalance that conditions the world Flora inhabits and a legend that contains the key to restore order.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2600260/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724264213","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2600260/page.bg.jpg?t=1724264213","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2600260/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724264213","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2600260/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724264213","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>Flora and the Ceibo Seeds</strong> is a 3D adventure game.
