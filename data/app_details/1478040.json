{"about_the_game":"<br><br>Vienna, 1925. The night drips on the windows of a barely-lit studio. A man walks nervously on the dusty Persian carpet, gripped by a confused monologue and wrapped up in the dense fumes of his beloved cigar. The critics are tearing him down on the newspapers, his family relationships are tense, there are instincts to keep at bay and then some cryptic anonymous letters were sent in... enough reasons to be insomniac!<br><br>Sigmund Freud, torn by doubts about his work and his future, is about to be get shoked. A voice breaks his thoughts, tearing the silence. That voice belongs to his demon: YOU.<br><br>You can be his angel or his Lucifer, you can drag him into nightclubs and force him to face his repressed desires, or make him the greatest psychoanalyst in history!<br><br>Remember, each patient is a crime scene, killer, victim and murder weapon at the same time.
