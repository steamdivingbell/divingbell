You will need to manage a base camp, chop trees and pick ores, manage your hunger and energy, as you navigate the island. From dangerous jungle creatures, treants, giant wasps, raptors, orcs, goblins, trolls, fairies, and demons, you will meet both friend and foe. You will even meet beautiful women and be able to romance them, help them with their troubles, and have them fight alongside you as you find your place on the island.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is a survival RPG, where you have to manage base stats like health and hunger through cooking and foraging. You will mine resources to craft weapons and armors, collect recipes to learn to create powerful accessories, and spec your party to suit your play style.
