{"about_the_game":"Duel Timers is a local multiplayer FPS Platformer. Fight against a friend with On-the-Couch Local Multiplayer or through Steam Remote Play (All multiplayer requires a Bluetooth Gamepad). Jump from platform to platform on a vertical arena to avoid enemy players and the impending void! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaster Jump Charging, Quick Falling, and Double Jumping to maximize your movement. Collect Ammo Boxes and Med Kits to keep the fight going! Activate Power-Ups to annoy your friends or give yourself an advantage! Duel Timers is a unique take on two classic genres!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nImportant Note: Duel Timers requires both a Controller and Keyboard and Mouse. Player 1 will always play on Keyboard, and Player 2 will always play on Controller. This also applies for players using Remote Play Together. Remote Play Together also works across platforms, but a controller is still needed for Player 2, as is the case for all Remote Play Together games with multiple independent players.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2380830/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1685479631","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2380830/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1685479631","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2380830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1685479631","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2380830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1685479631","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Duel Timers is a local multiplayer FPS Platformer.
