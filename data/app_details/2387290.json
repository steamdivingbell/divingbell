{"about_the_game":"A new category of video game: Struggling Simulator! A simple, fun, FPS where you take on waves of evil robots. Try to inch ahead on a landscape populated with mechanized meanies that are out to fry your hide. The only way to get out alive is to keep moving on, dodging and blasting, until you can escape the battlefield. Make careful use of your energy weapons. Be sure to not waste what little health you have.
