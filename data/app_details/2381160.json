{"about_the_game":"<strong>Quest for the Golden Candelabra</strong> is a 2D turn-based tactics game based on the rules of PF2E, the second edition of a powerful tabletop OGL ruleset. You lead a group of four colorful characters through a series of encounters, fighting against monsters, acquiring loot and eventually -- hopefully -- recovering the ancient artifact that's the object of your quest. <br><br>For an experienced player of tabletop roleplaying games, the entire game takes about 40 minutes to play through, from beginning to end.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Five difficult encounters in varied locations against varied monsters<br></li><li> Four interesting characters to play as (an honorable orc fighter, a silent rogue, a well-spoken sorcerer, and an excitable cleric)<br></li><li> A complex OGL-based rule system which makes for strong strategic gameplay</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cut straight into the gameplay</h2>This game is a cinematic experience, where you fight one combat encounter after another, and these fights are interspersed only with (voiced!) cinematic cutscenes. The game doesn't waste your time: animations are lightning fast, cutscenes skippable, and you can really focus on the engaging combat experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Powerful rule system</h2>Each turn, you get three actions to spend on moving, attacking, casting spells, taking combat maneuvers, drinking potions and defensive or other actions. <br><br>You can preview the effects and success probability of all actions before you commit and weigh your options. All combat encounters are balanced but difficult: To win the game reliably and consistently, you will need to make use of almost all of your options.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story of the Dawnsbury Four</h2>Experience the first steps of an up-and-coming party of young adventurers as they take on their first quest and attempt to recover an artifact that has once protected their beloved home town.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A taste of Dawnsbury Days</h2>This game is greatly expanded upon in the follow-up game, Dawnsbury Days, which contains the content from Quest for the Golden Candelabra but also allows you to create and customize your own characters, enhances art and rules fidelity and otherwise greatly improves upon this game, and most importantly, adds additional combat encounters and additional character levels. You don't need to play this game first. Dawnsbury Days contains the full story that's contained in this game.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Your First Quest","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2381160/5f1d0226c221e56a1dab0730009143f30d2f6ac3.jpg"},{"name":"A Forest Ambush","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2381160/fffab64cab822167ef9030a7ef62de7434efba0c.jpg"},{"name":"Ruins","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2381160/eef73995055b7731e639b5c233d416bdb4a061c6.jpg"},{"name":"Skeletal Champion","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2381160/7e38a81465fd9b436bce7831e944e5a3d6fe7c82.jpg"},{"name":"The Golden Candelabra","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2381160/24de80518972d58ee3713b49c82f66ab957d96b6.jpg"}],"total":5},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2381160/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729293172","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2381160/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1729293172","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2381160/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729293172","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2381160/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729293172","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Quest for the Golden Candelabra</strong> is a 2D turn-based tactics game based on the rules of PF2E, the second edition of a powerful tabletop OGL ruleset.
