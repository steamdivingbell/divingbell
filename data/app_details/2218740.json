The ice quickly spreads through their bodies, inflicting physical damage.<br><br>-Cryo Vortex<br>The vortex lifts the enemy into the air and deals magic damage. Smaller enemies are helpless against this assault, but larger ones cannot be hoisted up by the vortex. Consequently, they are only damaged by the magic, not lifted into the air.<br><br>-Blizzard<br>This ability deploys a localized snowstorm at the target location. The storm lasts for a certain amount of time and inflicts continuous magical damage to enemies who step into it. This makes it a great way to deal damage to multiple enemies at once and can be very helpful in crowded areas.<br><br>-Frost Breath<br>Exhale a breath of frost. It inflicts freezing damage to enemies caught in it. Enemies who stay in it for too long are frozen. It is powerful but has a short range.<br><br>-Chilling Aura<br>A  spell of ultra-low temperature, creating an aura of freezing cold.  She can maintain the aura for a certain period of time, dealing freezing damage to any enemies who enter it.

The more proficient wizards can travel longer distances for extended periods of time, but they use up more Mana.

The witch, who used to make snowmen by hand, tried to create them with her magical powers and an ice doll was born. Since then it has been a reassuring companion who supports her long spell chanting.<br><br>-Ice Wall<br>Sturdiness is key when it comes to defending yourself. So a little ingenuity on the ice spikes is essential to keeping those pesky enemies at bay. Walls that emit cold air can freeze nearby enemies, but they don't seem to cause any damage. However, the frigid temperature is enough to made them extremely uncomfortable.<br><br>-Spell Chain<br>You will be caught off guard if you think chanting is the only way to release your magic.  there are many other ways to release your magic. Chanting is just one method. This snow witch seems to be particularly good at planting the next spell in the one she has unleashed. It's as if she has a special talent for it.
