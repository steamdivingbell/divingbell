The sea of \u200b\u200benemies, obstacles and spent ammunition will not be frightened off by the brave, old farmer who wants to eliminate the impending threat, because for such cases he has a dusty, rusty gun in the pantry. With the help of your weapon you will have to clean the area from the threat. Overcome obstacles, discover new types of ammunition for weapons, look for secrets and do not forget that you still need to save the whole planet.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"As fragile as crystal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1305540/f434b194064d609134216e3c23da316c57ddaa1a.jpg"},{"name":"Secret number 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1305540/20b09271de41db8044bd89f6fdc3307f4b9a18a8.jpg"},{"name":"Secret number 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1305540/694c1c8eec87b69c482d8a67c45d047e418590c3.jpg"},{"name":"Secret number 3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1305540/7904fc1012a531731138ff622faec7b69e89e982.jpg"},{"name":"Secret number 4","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1305540/e47de0b17a427570a2aaeded5233ed7500c43a2e.jpg"},{"name":"Secret number 5","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1305540/9c76282c84632ec81f31aab93b47b4d7c030cd3a.jpg"},{"name":"Secret number 6","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1305540/3699b0c2a453f0648c00885b3a12db9ecfe01801.jpg"},{"name":"Secret number 7","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1305540/2371ab90f059c3c7fa683a4767d429d007e76041.jpg"},{"name":"Secret number 8","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1305540/3d80406db4e9dd526a3bd3f042386baa1d6deb40.jpg"},{"name":"Collector","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1305540/e2764d391e4bc21ddaadafc8deb6f5f68bc796bc.jpg"}],"total":18},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1305540/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1667018655","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1305540/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1667018655","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1305540/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1667018655","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1305540/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1667018655","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"violence, blood"},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1305540/extras/\u0434\u0435\u0434_bynhj2.gif?t=1667018655\" /><br>Rusty gun - a two-dimensional platformer with a side view in which we have to repel an extraterrestrial attack and restore order to the world.
