{"about_the_game":"Medieval Engineers is a sandbox game about engineering, construction and the maintenance of architectural works and mechanical equipment using medieval technology. Players build cities, castles and fortifications; construct mechanical devices and engines; perform landscaping and underground mining. There is an entire planet to explore!<br><br>The game is inspired by real medieval technology and the way people built architectural works and mechanical equipment using medieval technology. Medieval Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and history and doesn't use any technologies that were not available in the 5th to 15th centuries.<br><br>Medieval Engineers concentrates on construction aspects, but can be played as a survival game too. We expect players to use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines, fortifications, and creations we have yet to imagine! <br><br>Medieval Engineers is the second \u201cengineering\u201d game developed by Keen Software House.
