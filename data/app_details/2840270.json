{"about_the_game":"Your hunt is your rules.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou must fight your way through crowds of vile monsters. They came to our world from different dimensions and realities, they know no mercy and are driven by one goal - to sow fear, destruction and death. Move, shoot, use magic, do everything to survive in this old-school boomer shooter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Survivors in Blood, you choose how you fight. Use only firearms or combine them with magic. Collect experience crystals from fallen enemies to improve the characteristics of your character. With each new level, you will have access to new destructive and defensive spells.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Survivors in Blood you will face huge armies of enemies, act efficiently, move, use cover. Enemies are varied, some prefer close combat, some use the environment for their attacks, and others use magic. You must survive and fulfill your destiny at any cost!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSurvivors in Blood is a tribute to the shooters of the past, a return to the days when gameplay was interesting and fun.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2840270/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725376578","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2840270/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1725376578","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2840270/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725376578","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2840270/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725376578","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Your hunt is your rules.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou must fight your way through crowds of vile monsters.
