{"about_the_game":"Welcome to another boring game! The highly anticipated sequel to The Most Boring Game Ever is here! Do you miss life pre covid? The fantastic yet boring 9-5 of our existence? Then this is the game for you. This boring game involves you clicking your way through the day as they go by living life from getting out of bed to going to work to finally coming back home with no end in sight in this endless experience. Think this is going to be a fun game? NOPE. The game comes with a message about life and death along with the routine we all go through in life. We hope you play the experience and come away with that message. Thank you.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"WELCOME!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1586090/6fd03f8a2778ea5c770f69928873108e6328fdf2.jpg"},{"name":"3 days?
