Featuring over 100 characters, the player will interact with a nightmarish range of hateful worldviews and morally bankrupt business opportunities to survive Tucson and pay back their loanshark.

The player must struggle to keep their finances in the black over a 12 month period by making astute investments in the truly sickening schemes of the darkest of minds. Over the year, you will encounter a varied array of viewpoints on the current affairs that affected mid-2010s society. You can choose a political position. Become a red-faced socialist. A milquetoast liberal. A rotten fascist. Perhaps you don't want to choose a position. Perhaps you would like to be positioned wherever that bag is. It's all up to you. <br><br>Bad Credit, above all else, is characterized by its characters. Build your relationships and tear them down where you see fit. Find out their deepest, darkest secrets. Treat them like sidewalk trash. Make them your charity cases. The choice is yours. <br><br>Will you resist the unease of the information age?
