The informant has managed to gain access to schematics of classified naval ships, including those of the Federal Navy. But with the galaxy on the brink of war and no way to directly transmit the huge quantity of data, the informant has opted to leak the schematics to an organization of black market traders. While dealings with such organizations is usually the purview of criminal enterprises, the Dominion high council has given you complete autonomy to ensure victory for the Dominion by any means.<br><br>Prior to the great Imperial war, the Federation was the largest unified faction in the galaxy. Consisting of tens of thousands of partially self-governing interstellar republics, with it's combined territories spanning nearly half of all colonized space.

The ships of the Federal Navy were truly built to withstand the test of time, prioritizing armor, simplicity and reliability above all. Their armaments consisted mainly of battle proven traditional kinetic, explosive and guided munitions.

When the Imperial invasion began in earnest, the Federal Navy held steadfast to it's duties of protecting all the worlds of the Federation. And while the advancement of Imperial fleets had been successfully halted in most systems, the dawn of the Empire's strategic subspace warheads, would see the age of great navies come to it's end. The courage of man never stood a chance against this terrifying new breed of weapon, capable of collapsing the very fabric of space itself. Each strike would shred thousands of stars and planets alike, collapsing all, into a single massive dark sun at the center. Only it's edges would gleam with brilliant light from the matter surrounding it, yet to be devoured by the newly born void star.<br><br>In less than ten years, the Federation had lost almost half of it's territories and three quarters of it's entire navy, to the unimaginable power of the Empire's new weapons. With nearly all of the Federation's remaining member systems crying out for peace, terrified that their worlds could suffer the same fate at any moment, an unconditional surrender was broadcast on all subspace frequencies. Nearly two millennia after it's original founding, the Federation submitted to Imperial rule. With no great powers remaining to challenge the Imperial military conquest in any meaningful way, historians cite this moment as the true birth of the Galactic Empire.
