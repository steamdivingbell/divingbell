Most abilities have various effects that scale from different attributes.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Every piece of armor grants attributes. Craft and equip armor pieces that grant attributes that suit your playstyle.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Armor pieces may also grant <strong>stats</strong> (such as <i>critical strike chance</i>, <i>health regeneration</i>, and <strong>over 60 more</strong>).

Using a <i>slam</i> skill empowers your next <i>strike</i> skill to regenerate 10 additional stamina, stacking up to 3 times.<br><strong>2)</strong> Gain 40% more health regeneration from all sources. This effect is doubled when below 35% health. Applying a hard crowd-control effect on an enemy grants X health regeneration for 12 seconds, stacking up to 3 times. <br><strong>3)</strong> Using an ability increases your size and area of effect by 8%, stacking up to 5 times. At 5 stacks, your next ability deals 70% more damage, consuming all stacks.</p></li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3084450/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737149870","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3084450/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1737149870","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3084450/470703cefaf85fee34b3954f94a740e4ed04a71c/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737149870","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3084450/470703cefaf85fee34b3954f94a740e4ed04a71c/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737149870","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Contains mild violence and mild undead/demonic themes."},"detailed_description":"<h1>Feature List</h1><p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Play solo or with up to 8 players in online co-op on player-hosted worlds.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Explore a massive, procedurally generated open world.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Discover randomly generated dungeons and caves located throughout the world.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Choose from multiple fantasy RPG classes such as Cleric, Colossus, Executioner, Paladin, Pyromancer, and more.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Experience a deep and engaging character-gearing system with <strong>attributes</strong> (<i>strength</i>, <i>dexterity</i>, <i>intelligence</i>, <i>constitution</i>, <i>spirit</i>) and <strong>stats</strong> (such as <i>critical strike chance</i>, <i>health regeneration</i>, <i>chance to apply ailments</i>, <i>poise</i>, and <strong>over 60 more</strong>).</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Enjoy classic isometric ARPG combat featuring a dual-resource system with <i>stamina</i> and <i>mana</i>, along with additional combat mechanics such as active blocking and sprinting.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Encounter a variety of hostile creatures with both creature-specific and world loot table drops, providing an engaging <strong>item-crafting</strong> experience.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Engage in epic <strong>boss battles</strong> accompanied by themed orchestral soundtracks.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Relax with non-combat RPG activities such as fishing, mining, blacksmithing, cooking, and more.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Discover villages to gain access to various gameplay features, such as item crafting and storage.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Choose between WASD movement or the traditional click-to-move, depending on your preference.</p></li></ul></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Taigania</strong> combines classic isometric <strong>action RPG</strong> mechanics, inspired by previous titles such as Diablo and Path of Exile, with co-operative, <strong>procedurally generated open-world</strong> exploration reminiscent of games like Valheim and Minecraft.
