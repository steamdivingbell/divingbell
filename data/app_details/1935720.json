{"about_the_game":"Take command of Mara and her group of mercenaries as they battle their way across the land. Mara leaves everything behind to find her missing husband after he is possessed by a mysterious artifact and attacks her, leaving her for dead. On her quest to find her missing husband, Mara soon finds herself intertwined in a much larger scale conflict involving a kidnapped prince and an ancient monster. Guide Mara and her party of mercenaries across 20 levels of combat against enemy soldiers, orc troops, undead forces, and more in this turn-based isometric strategy game. Grow your party size up to 14 characters all with their own 6 unique abilities and roles. Equip them with over 320 different weapons, 40 sets of armor, and 30 trinkets. When not playing through the campaign, create your own maps from scratch using the map editor. Share your maps with other players and play through other player created maps.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1935720/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736388625","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1935720/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1736388625","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1935720/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736388625","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1935720/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736388625","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Take command of Mara and her group of mercenaries as they battle their way across the land.
