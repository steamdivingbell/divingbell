He had the wiry strength of a sidewinder and he never, ever let his target get away.

Pure and simple, he enjoyed the hunt.  <br>Life changed for Stringfellow in the spring of 1891. After coming down with a hacking cough, he went to see a sawbones for a cure. The doctor had bad news. He\u2019d managed to contract tuberculosis, and the best he could do to preserve his life would be to find a sanitarium in the mountains where the clean air would do him good.  <br><br>Stringfellow rejected the diagnosis, but after a coughing fit gave away his position to a band of train robbers he was tracking, he was shot up and left for dead. As he lay there, bleeding and feverish, he had visions of a fear-shadowed mountain, with inhuman things moving through the woods on its slopes.  <br>Eventually he was found by a friendly local, who nursed him back to something approximating health. Stringfellow repaid the man by stealing his horse and heading for the Rockies. He searched high and low for the mountain of his vision. There, too, he found the monstrous shapes he had dreamed of, and it was an easy transition to start hunting them for Bounties instead of\u2014or in addition to\u2014men.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3037030/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727456397","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3037030/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1727456397","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3037030/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727456397","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3037030/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727456397","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Remote Play on Tablet","id":42},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"This DLC contains one Hunter, two Weapons skins, and one Tool skin:  <br> <br>- Silver Spur (Hunter)  <br>- Yawning Grave (Mako 1895 Carbine)  <br>- Dry Bones (Caldwell Conversion Uppercut Precision)  <br>- Grave Robber (Weak Vitality Shot)  <br><br><strong><u>Silver Spur\u00a0</u></strong><br><br>A walking dead man they call Silver Spur, Ezekiel Stringfellow has hunted his fellow man all his life.
