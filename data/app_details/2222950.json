{"about_the_game":"How do you conquer your anxiety or fears? Damien escapes to his imagination and transforms into \u201cCaptain Velvet Meteor\u201d to defeat them in battle in this cute, tactical adventure enjoyable for players of all ages and skill levels. Welcome to the Jump+ Dimensions!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A MEANINGFUL, CROSS-DIMENSIONAL STORY</strong></h2>Damien's life flips upside-down when his family moves him from France to Japan to live with his Grandmother against his wishes. As a shy boy, he struggles with the sudden change and must face his fear of the unknown. Everything Damien sees and touches in his new Japanese home is full of worrying elements, such as their pet dog growing aggressive from the stress of changing homes, being served unknown Japanese dishes during meals, and encountering unfamiliar insects during bathtime!<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2222950/extras/img1.gif?t=1722833798\" /><br>To cope with his newfound loneliness, he uses the power of his infinite imagination to become the mighty hero, Captain Velvet Meteor! With guidance from his trusty robot companion Jay-P, Damien sets off on a series of imaginary mini-adventures across the unknown terrain of his Grandmother\u2019s home alongside his favorite Jump+ heroes and fights to adjust to his new home and find himself. Can Captain Velvet Meteor and his manga companions pass their challenges and find emotional comfort amidst the cultural turmoil?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>EXPLORE AN UNKNOWN HOME AND A VIBRANT IMAGINARY WORLD</strong></h2><br>In the exploration phase, Damien freely explores his new Japanese home. When he encounters various cultural elements that make him anxious, such as neighbors and his late grandfather\u2019s portrait, he journeys to a vibrant, imaginary world to become Captain Velvet Meteor to fight through epic battles and overcome his anxiety. The worlds Damien visits as Captain Velvet Meteor are determined by the various obstacles he encounters in the real world, providing an interesting dynamic of defeating bosses inspired by real-world elements, such as the family dog, Lucien, appearing as the fearsome DogZilla!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2222950/extras/img4.gif?t=1722833798\" /><br><br>While in the Jump+ Dimensions, players can revisit previously explored areas to achieve a higher completion rating or gather missed tokens.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>TACTICAL, TURN-BASED COMBAT FOR ALL SKILL LEVELS</strong></h2>Battles take place on a turn-based, tactical grid and include unique puzzles that require manipulating the environment to meet mission objectives. Damien and the Jump+ characters have unique individual attacks, including a range of melee, ranged, and charged skills. Combine forces with the Jump+ heroes to unleash signature attacks through Power and Assist Combos to deliver massive damage on hordes of enemies and bosses!<br><br><br>Combat mechanics are easy to understand and the variety of foes to defeat provide an approachable amount of tactical puzzle challenge that is both satisfying and forgiving for players of all ages.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2222950/extras/midashi_cvm3_en.gif?t=1722833798\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>QUIRKY CHARACTERS AND COMPANIONS</strong></h2><br>Aside from Damien, aka Captain Velvet Meteor, players will encounter eight Jump+ heroes and heroines to team up with throughout the adventures!
