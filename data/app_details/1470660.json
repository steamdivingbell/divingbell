{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1470660/extras/AmborettioGIF-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif?t=1714371401\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Story:</strong> Step into the immersive world of Amborettio, where you awaken as a C.A.N. inhabitant with a vital mission: to gather resources for the enigmatic faction known as the Peace Keepers. As you delve deeper into Amborettio's secrets, each resource you procure unlocks a piece of a cryptic puzzle. With every milestone you reach, a single letter is unveiled, gradually forming sentences that hold the key to unlocking the truth shrouded in mystery. Experience the thrill of discovery as you collect more of these elusive letters, piecing together the narrative bit by bit. And when the final pieces fall into place, the breathtaking convergence of the introduction and epilogue will leave you spellbound, revealing a revelation that will redefine your entire perception of the game.<br><br></li><li><strong>Deep Leveling:</strong> Amborettio features an expansive leveling system that rewards you constantly for your progress. As you gain experience, you will receive S.E.L.F. points. These points can be allocated to your Strength, Endurance, Longevity, and Fortune - which all affect your character's abilities. Strength allows you to carry more weight, Endurance allows you to regenerate HP faster, Longevity allows you to regenerate SP faster, and Fortune allows you to obtain Mystery Ore Bags more frequently and in higher quantity - which provide random batches of ore for smelting.<br><br></li><li><strong>Exploration:</strong> Amborettio takes place in the post-apocalyptic caverns of the United States. These caverns are rife with mutants, ore, and treasure troves of loot such as Power Cells, Torches, Repair Kits, and S.E.L.F. tabs (which provide permanent stat boosts).<br><br></li><li><strong>Crafting Stations:</strong> In order to craft certain items, you must first build specific workstations pertaining to those items, such as the Synthesizer. The Synthesizer allows you to trade Cola Tabs, the in-game currency, for Nutritious Paste and Hydrating Paste. The player will always start with a Workbench, which allows them to craft most items with ease. The player will also start with a Particle Relay, which allows the player to travel to a new cavern, with new ores to mine and treasures to find. The stations that can be built as follows: Smelter, Synthesizer, Storage, Stasis Chamber, Scanner, and Transmitter. For more information on these stations and what they do, informational tooltips within the game describe what each of these do in great detail.<br><br></li><li><strong>Crafting:</strong> In Amborettio, you can craft a lot of different items to help you complete your mission. These items typically require variations of smelted ore and combinations of higher-grade components that you must craft. Items that can be crafted are as follows: Electrical Component, Gunpowder, Power Cell, Torch, Repair Kit, Weapon Upgrade Part, Tool Upgrade Part, High-Tech Component, Scavenger Robot, and Miner Robot. For more information on these items and what they do, informational tooltips within the game describe what each of these do in great detail.<br><br></li><li><strong>Smelting:</strong> To craft most items, smelted ingots are required. The player must utilize the Smelter and combine Iron, Copper, Lead, or Sulphur ore with Coal to create their respective ingots. Initially, the player's smelting efficiency is low. As the player smelts more ingots, they gain more experience with smelting and their ore consumption gradually decreases.<br><br></li><li><strong>Nutrition and Hydration:</strong> In order to sustain HP and SP regeneration, the player must remain nourished throughout the game. If the player's Nutrition falls to 0, their HP will stop regenerating. This rule also applies to Hydration - if the player's Hydration falls to 0, their SP will stop regenerating. In order to stay nourished, the player can exchange Cola Tabs at the Synthesizer for Nutritious Paste and Hydrating Paste.<br><br></li><li><strong>Boss Fights:</strong> When the player consumes a Cursed Soul (dropped by enemies), the spawn rate of enemies will increase tremendously and bosses will begin to spawn. These bosses are tough to kill, but drop massive loot and grant large amounts of XP.<br><br></li><li><strong>Unique Equipment:</strong> Amborettio features an apparel-based equipment system. Rather simply, changing jumpsuits will change the bonuses that the character receives. The player's default jumpsuit provides no bonuses, the C.A.N. Opener Jumpsuit grants 2x combat XP when equipped, and the Peace Keeper jumpsuit grants 2x mining XP when equipped.<br><br></li><li><strong>Invasion:</strong> The player and their C.A.N. unit are constantly under siege from invading mutants. While the player's turrets dispel these enemies easily, the C.A.N. is susceptible to damage. If the C.A.N. receives too much damage, the turrets will be rendered inoperable and all C.A.N. doors will be forced open, making the player and his base extremely vulnerable to attack. If the player uses the Particle Relay, C.A.N. Openers will follow them into their new cavern, and will launch a surprise attack on the player - attacking from all sides while exploiting the player's vulnerable state.<br><br></li><li><strong>Upgrades:</strong> The player can obtain a variety of upgrades such as Weapon Upgrade Parts, Tool Upgrade Parts, and Turret Upgrades. Weapon Upgrade Parts increase weapon damage, Tool Upgrade Parts increase the quantity of resources mined, and Turret Upgrades increase the damage and fire rate of all turrets.<br><br></li><li><strong>Trading:</strong> The player can enter a trading hub that allows for alternate methods of obtaining some crafted items. By trading Cola Tabs, the player can save some time and effort while conserving resources by purchasing items such as Torch, Power Cell, Repair Kit, and Rare Cola Tabs - which give +10 to a random S.E.L.F. attribute. In addition, the player can hire up to 4 bodyguards that protect them when C.A.N. Openers attack. It is here that the player may also choose to sell enemy souls in exchange for Cola Tabs.<br><br></li><li><strong>Mining:</strong> The player can mine a variety of ores such as Iron, Copper, Lead, and Sulphur. The player can also mine Coal, which is required for smelting. Stone can also be obtained, and is a vital resource to trade for Cola Tabs and to donate to the Peace Keepers as it is found in high quantity. The player receives XP each time they mine, and this can be increased if the player is wearing the Peace Keeper Jumpsuit. </li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Tutorial Complete","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1470660/55e8bd17d0a94fe1391f08aa73c4758e35b4076e.jpg"},{"name":"Reached 10 Strength","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1470660/eb91fe204eecaccde3ecd016d1884ffef2187deb.jpg"},{"name":"Reached 10 Endurance","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1470660/ff7a3f4eb52123370ea3c022821eafec0f025622.jpg"},{"name":"Reached 10 Longevity","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1470660/109fd6ef4328d3f0dab3d5768dfbff7837b2bd70.jpg"},{"name":"Reached 10 Fortune","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1470660/930cef3df3d6308bb91e78d2ab752a41916de0fe.jpg"},{"name":"Solved Puzzle 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1470660/ca94a97ce2de27108e863b94fe2102052b85b7fd.jpg"},{"name":"Solved Puzzle 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1470660/44bb09fbbcba76a0c1d6f464c0ffbfb2e5fb919c.jpg"},{"name":"Solved Puzzle 3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1470660/80e76ea629bcc8ae5aa1831f28aec68554c1d9e3.jpg"},{"name":"Became Grand Leader","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1470660/eba02d5c2a3d2010c75c36144ff363336c1425fb.jpg"},{"name":"Reached 100 Strength","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1470660/eb91fe204eecaccde3ecd016d1884ffef2187deb.jpg"}],"total":51},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1470660/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714371401","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1470660/page.bg.jpg?t=1714371401","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1470660/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714371401","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1470660/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714371401","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"When projectiles hit their mark, you'll witness realistic blood effects and hear intense death sounds for an immersive gaming experience."},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1470660/extras/AmborettioGIF-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif?t=1714371401\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Story:</strong> Step into the immersive world of Amborettio, where you awaken as a C.A.N. inhabitant with a vital mission: to gather resources for the enigmatic faction known as the Peace Keepers.
