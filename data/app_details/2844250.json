{"about_the_game":"Travel through an ancient puzzle-filled pyramid as the ghost of Aaru, a man who has been denied entry into the Egyptian afterlife for being neither good nor bad. The gods of the afterlife, Anubis and Osiris, have charged you with the task of reflecting on the life you led when you were alive to balance your soul on the Scales of Justice and gain entrance into the Field of Reeds, a place of eternal rest. You must investigate your tomb while thinking about your human life and the choices you made when you were alive in the hope that this act of reflection will lead to eternal peace. As a ghost, you cannot physically touch objects and thus must possess specific items, such as boxes and statues, to move them around and solve the puzzles. The fate of your soul hangs in the balance. Will you be able to earn your way into the afterlife?<br />\r\nExplore an Egyptian pyramid filled with ancient statues and walls decorated with hieroglyphs. <br />\r\nSolve puzzles based on various stages of your life and discover artifacts that may have meant something to you when you were alive. <br />\r\nPlay as a ghost and possess things like rotating statues and boxes and manipulate them to solve puzzles in an immersive environment. <br />\r\nEnjoy a touching and reflective story with fully-voiced dialogue and multiple characters. <br />\r\nInvestigate your human life and ponder how the choices you made may have impacted the lives of others.<br />\r\nBalance your soul on the Scales of Justice and earn entrance into the Field of Reeds where eternal peace and a restful afterlife await you.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2844250/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1716169886","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2844250/page.bg.jpg?t=1716169886","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2844250/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1716169886","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2844250/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1716169886","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Travel through an ancient puzzle-filled pyramid as the ghost of Aaru, a man who has been denied entry into the Egyptian afterlife for being neither good nor bad.
