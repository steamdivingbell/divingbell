{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Gisselle's Adventure</strong></h2>A serious video game about social anxiety, narrated from the perspective of Gisselle, a young student who, after years of homeschooling, must face the real world and her own fears. Through a blend of visual novel elements, RPG, and platforming, the player will accompany Gisselle in her struggle to overcome her social phobia in a story that fuses the everyday with the surreal.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Story</strong></h2>The story is set in a fictional country and is narrated from the perspective of a young student named Gisselle, who suffers from a severe social anxiety disorder. After spending most of her life receiving education at home without interacting with anyone, she must face the real world for the first time when she is accepted into Harvest Imperial Academy, one of the world\u2019s top educational institutions that holds many secrets. In this setting, Gisselle has to adapt to survive in a hostile school environment where every interaction is a major battle for her and every friendship is an achievement.<br><br>The everyday life of Gisselle at school is severely impacted by her mental disorder, which causes serious dissociations from reality, turning her mind into chaos. Her progress, though tangible, is sometimes overshadowed by these mysterious events that make Gisselle question whether what she\u2019s experiencing is real or just hallucinations caused by extreme anxiety attacks.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Game Features</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 4 main characters<br></li><li> 1 protagonist<br></li><li> Power-ups<br></li><li> Inventory<br></li><li> Map<br></li><li> Mini-map<br></li><li> 15 levels<br></li><li> Side quests<br></li><li> Collectibles/Trophies<br></li><li> Various enemies<br></li><li> 4 endings<br></li><li> Multiple scenes<br></li><li> Mini-games<br></li><li> Multiple main maps<br></li><li> Original music</li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Mimiendo","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3196400/59c526ee5baf2525c08fbd4f78ac37c01c97fce7.jpg"},{"name":"Vogatnett's ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3196400/189934cad85c6f708d64b985f0ada3e49e63914c.jpg"},{"name":"Me?
