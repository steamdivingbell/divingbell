{"about_the_game":"In this Euro-screwball comedy, which plays with multiple genres and narrative styles, Florian Steinbiss tells the story of a Neanderthal Man who mysteriously rematerializes in modern day Germany and seeks sanctuary in the garden of Barbara van Schmerling, a 23-year-old student of Environmental Planning. To save and protect this 'last living evidence of former humanity and naturalness' from exploitation by a P.T. Barnum wannabe and a power-crazed media savvy anthropologist, Barbara takes him under her wing. Failing to protect him from the corrupting influences of Western Civilization, her altruistic feelings turn romantic, threatening either to compromise her ethics, or lose the only person - or primitive - she ever truly loved. Meanwhile, the Neanderthal must choose between Barbara, the only person who loves him for what he really is, and the siren call of fame, suitcases of money, and easy access to gummy bears.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/900190/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1552348186","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/900190/page.bg.jpg?t=1552348186","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/900190/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1552348186","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/900190/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1552348186","categories":[{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Native Steam Controller Support","id":33}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h1>Steam Video</h1><p>This content is only available in an online streaming format.
