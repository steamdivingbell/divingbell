You play as a soldier of the British Expeditionary Force, choosing one of three main specializations: <strong>assault trooper</strong>, <strong>machine gunner</strong>, or <strong>sniper</strong>. Each role defines your equipment and the way you approach missions.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Specializations offer unique tasks and routes, providing diverse gameplay experiences. The locations and gameplay are tailored to different playstyles \u2014 from CQB and mid-range firefights to sniping, stealth runs, and battles against the horrors of darkness.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Realism of Weapon\u00a0and Equipment  <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3304800/extras/All_New.gif?t=1736585435\" /></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The weapon system in <strong>F-20 Eclipse</strong> is meticulously crafted to ensure absolute authenticity.

For example:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With a rifle, you\u2019ll move slower, tire faster, and find it harder to aim while standing. However, its firepower and reliability make it ideal for mid-range combat. Additionally, you can attach a bayonet to use it for hand-to-hand combat.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Submachine guns, carbines, and pistols excel in trench assaults due to their lighter weight, compact size, and mobility, paired with higher fire rates. However, they trade off firepower and reliability compared to rifles.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The attention to realism extends beyond weapons. The equipment and uniforms of the soldiers are painstakingly recreated using archival records, reenactor references, online sources, and historical documentation. Even the chevrons and unit emblems precisely match those of the actual units that fought in World War I.
