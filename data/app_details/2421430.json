You have a choice: be friends with your neighbors or make them your source of power. Attacking the planets of other players, you cannot completely destroy or conquer them, but you can destroy the enemy's fleet and defenses, take away his resources - the most valuable thing in the galaxy. Before attacking, send scout ships to the planet and think over a strategy.<br><br>Attention! Fights in the game do not happen instantly. The flight to the target takes some time, and the farther away the enemy planet is from your star system, the longer the fleet will fly. However, sometimes you may even run out of fuel and then you will have to develop a new strategy.<br><br>When the fleet reaches its destination, you will receive an alert on the bridge about the start of the battle. You can personally take command of the flotilla \u2028and influence the outcome of the battle. By choosing the right targets and using the special skills of the ships, you can inflict more damage on ships and enemy defenses.
