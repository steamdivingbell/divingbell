The player embodies Sunset Isles\u2019 newest resident: WizKid (pronouns: they/them), who can perform radical magic by using skate trick combos! The day is nearly over, but Wizkid wants to explore the town and meet their new neighbors before calling it a day. The twilight adventure begins at the skate park to hone their skills with skateboarding legend, Tony the Hawk. Tony teaches the player skating tricks ranging from a simple ollie to a gnarly backflip, while Wizkid\u2019s magic allows the player to perform incredible feats such as skating at super speed, spawning a ramp from thin air, and flying to the top of the sky. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1394320/extras/descShot2.png?t=1621041139\" /><br><br>The world is the player\u2019s skatepark, with ramps and grind rails ready to be shredded!

Once Wizkid is ready to call it a day, the player can skate back home to the suburbs and celebrate with all their new friends.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"learn to skate","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1394320/2468ddb79e40aea5e841b7fa8b5669c98148fe47.jpg"},{"name":"a spark of magic","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1394320/f753a705f0c5243f4007356a2d4544ad8a81fce1.jpg"},{"name":"cat in a tree","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1394320/e709b3b6f425ccb9addbffc0d629838643ad92ef.jpg"},{"name":"racing rabbit","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1394320/b31f43392cc50c63e177c38fe4d4d75f5c383b7e.jpg"},{"name":"paint the town","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1394320/c43c0676b68e30f75d59ab263a0ee6e83a5d18a5.jpg"},{"name":"sheepish message","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1394320/54bf73c73a649510bd790d22fce1f79fb728bce3.jpg"},{"name":"a skate cooked meal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1394320/29fe0c0efae690f20fc9d40fdff828ed04ccf94c.jpg"},{"name":"posters for the band","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1394320/bd23f8ef64f5f9c4ab37bf0a532014b57574ffef.jpg"},{"name":"pigeon party","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1394320/0ac73333f4c8f2444e81d2ffc1be5e05bd7aa460.jpg"},{"name":"card collector","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1394320/bb97f230249d8d3c596dbef602cb4235ed95a9ba.jpg"}],"total":13},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1394320/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1621041139","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1394320/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1621041139","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1394320/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1621041139","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1394320/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1621041139","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1394320/extras/descShot3.png?t=1621041139\" /><br><br>Magic Trick is a magical skateboarding adventure game, featuring expressive skating movement and trick combos, a totally explorable whimsical sunset world, and adorable townsfolk offering quests and companionship.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1394320/extras/descShot1.png?t=1621041139\" /><br><br>Magic Trick seeks to fulfill everyone\u2019s greatest desire: being a skateboarding magician.
