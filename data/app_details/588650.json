From a side-scrolling perspective, players explore platform environments while engaging in frenetic melee-style combat against fantastical creatures (e.g., skeletons, giant leeches, goblins). Players use punches, kicks, and gadgets (e.g., flame-thrower traps, grenades, arrow turrets) to kill enemies. Enemies emit large splatters of blood when injured/killed and sometimes break apart into bloody pieces; blood also stains the floors and walls of some areas.
