Over the years we have seen our players create some fantastic cities, the scale and scope of which is staggering. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Whether it is the painstaking re-creation of 100 km\u00b2 real-life cities, or imaginative sprawling utopias, A-Train has always allowed the player to use their imagination. The latest version increases the scale and scope of the game 100%. Twice as many vehicles can be placed on landscapes with twice as many art assets. More road and track-side features with new levels of flexibility in the way that road and rail are built. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The player can now use these tools to create more realistic and involved cities either from real-life or from their imagination. This extra realism is balanced by some great new control options which work at both the individual vehicle level and the management control level of the game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Become the Driver</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Have you ever wondered what it might be like to actually drive one of your trains? To actually experience the challenges the engineers may face in keeping to the speed limit, providing a comfortable ride, and delivering the goods and passengers on time? Well, in A-Train 9 V4 Japan Rail Simulator, it's now possible to step on the footplate and take control. Either from the first-person engineers point of view, or from a bird\u2019s-eye 3rd person viewpoint, experience your cities like never before. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">It\u2019s not just trains. Jump on board a car or boat and see your creations from whole new perspectives. Ever wondered what it would be like to be a citizen or a worker in your city? While now you can find out.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Double the Vehicles</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Doubling the number of vehicles in the game adds a massive amount of scope and scale to the game, and that brings with it its own challenges. It might be overwhelming to have 200 trains running simultaneously. Understanding what they are all doing and how to optimize their timetables and routes with so much going on would be a challenge for anyone. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Plan Your Routes</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A-Train 9 V4 Japan Rail Simulator adds new features that bring you control from the transport planner level. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">It's now possible to sort and filter your vehicles by type and group them into color-coded teams. How you use these features is up to the player. You may want to group your trains by the routes they travel, or perhaps separate them into long distance and commuter trains. It might certainly be a good idea to color code passenger and freight trains separately, but that choice is yours and with the filter and sort options it\u2019s very easy to set up.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The control is there, and the choices are yours. Experiment and develop your own system using the new tools provided, and then see at a glance how your network is operating. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Precise Layout Control</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The new version of A-Train offers more control than ever. Track laying has been improved, trains can now have their own custom consist and speed settings, land can be raised and flattened within the game itself (at a cost).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">It's your world, creating the perfect rail and road transport system has never been more satisfying.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Assets to Create Realistic Environments</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Hundreds of new art assets are included in the game. From roadside elements such as post boxes and bus stands right up to suspension bridges, landmarks airports. You can now create detailed and interesting worlds alive with detail.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Realistic or Model Scaling</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Massive areas of land to expand in to. View it all in 4K resolution (with a suitable monitor) and decide whether you want to use the new 1:1 scale modelling in the game which adds a new level of realism. Whether it's the big image or the fine details, A-Train 9 V4 Japan Rail Simulator has scale covered.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>KOMODO \u2013 Here To Support You</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">KOMODO brings a new level of support to the worldwide release of A-Train.

Each train has its own strengths and weaknesses. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Should you choose the slow powerful work-horse capable of pulling large numbers of carriages over long distances economically?
