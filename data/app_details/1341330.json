Consider carefully what to bring with you on the expedition, as no one really knows what  awaits on the other side of the Gate.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TEAM SURVIVAL</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1341330/extras/Team_Survival-600x200.gif?t=1683829817\" /><br>Surviving alone in an unknown world is really hard. But with teammates at your side, you at least stand a chance. Share the responsibilities: start a fire to let others warm up, build a tent to let your mates rest, warn them about the dangers lurking in the night. The key to surviving is cooperation between you and your team.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SKILL BASED COMBAT</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1341330/extras/Skill-based_Combat-600x200.gif?t=1683829817\" /><br>Isometric skill-based combat without auto targeting.

Each item gives you a unique set of skills, so try tinkering with different builds. Take heavy armor and a healing staff to support your mates in the front line by tanking and restoring health.
