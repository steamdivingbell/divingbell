{"about_the_game":"Between Two Cities is a partnership-driven tile-drafting game in which each tile represents part of a city: factory, shop, park, landmarks, etc. You work with the player on your left to design the heart of one city, and with the player on your right to design the heart of another city. On each turn you select two tiles from hand, reveal them, then work with your partners separately to place one of those tiles into each of your two cities before passing the remaining hand of tiles around the table.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the end of the game, each city is scored for its livability. Your final score is the lower of the livability scores of the two cities you helped design. To win, you have to share your attention and your devotion between two cities. The player with the highest final score wins the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game features play for 3-7 players.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1711930/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1678980656","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1711930/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1678980656","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1711930/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1678980656","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1711930/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1678980656","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Between Two Cities is a partnership-driven tile-drafting game in which each tile represents part of a city: factory, shop, park, landmarks, etc. You work with the player on your left to design the heart of one city, and with the player on your right to design the heart of another city.
