{"about_the_game":"Battle the twisted creatures that call sludgy swamps and dark woods home with the Cursed Kingdoms Monster Pack 2! Michael Galefire\u2019s latest static monster battler pack is here with 20 images to challenge your heroes with curved claws, ethereal flames, and spittle-covered fangs that could easily end someone if they\u2019re not careful!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTeach your players to avoid bites whenever possible by having them fight a green-tinged wolf that can breathe poisonous gas or a snarling wolf with flames coating its tail and a mouth as hot as a furnace. Or have them learn quickly to always carry antidotes and potions with them when delving into dungeons where spike-covered mutated bears and decaying zombies are simply a warm up for a boss battle against an undead dragon! Create a creepy insect-based cave filled with pot-bellied bloodsuckers and armored worms bursting from the floor, where the final challenge is against an enormous spider queen and her armored servants that are an arachnophobes worst nightmare. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nNot even the forests are safe! Large dead trees could be living creatures in disguise, just waiting for an unlucky adventurer to stumble too close to its roots, and loose dirt on the path could hide and a buried monster that grabs its prey with clawed tentacles. Skull-headed aquatic creatures could dive during battles, changing to a different battler image, to avoid your players\u2019 normal attacks and a heavily armored undead knight astride its undead mount is ready to teach your players\u2019 to think before attacking a secret side boss.
