Choose different path, evolve your towers to give you more advantage in your endless fight with monsters trying to break your defense. 54(!) upgrade types is a lot. Choose the right one that suits your TD game style.  Defense games is not only about shooting it is about planning. <br />\r\nIn this defense game your ability to plan ahead decides whether you will prevail and achieve long-wanted TD game victory or fail greatly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTowers themselves have a lot of Unique effects and interactions. <br />\r\nYou can disintegrate, turn to ice, slow burn and pierce your enemies.
