Somehow unaffected by the unknown phenomena, Mari is guided by an ethereal voice and gains the ability to transform into Lilium, a heroine with the power to face the monsters head-on and send them packing. However, saving her home won't be as simple as clobbering her former friends and neighbors... The reality is that the door to another world has opened, and miasma is pouring out through the cracks, turning the town she knows and loves into an unrecognizable hellscape.
