{"about_the_game":"Welcome to All the Stars \u2013 a retro-inspired space adventure combining thrilling combat, awe-inspiring cosmic exploration, and a choice.

If you play remote play co-op you must first both have controllers connected.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Story: Humanity stands on the brink of war with a mysterious alien race, and your mission is clear: reach their homeworld and deploy the ultimate weapon, a 100-gigaton bomb\u2014AKA the &quot;supernova-in-a-can.&quot; Along the way, you\u2019ll face powerful alien horrors, endless waves of enemy ships, and the haunting emptiness of space. The fate of an entire species rests in your hands.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGameplay: All the Stars delivers classic, fast-paced, arcade-style action, enhanced with modern mechanics. Master your ship's movement, dodge enemy fire, and use five unique power-ups, with 12 power-ups and upgrades total, to dominate the battlefield. The game also features endless waves of enemies, with dynamically increasing difficulty. AI-controlled ships offer tactical challenges, while the power-ups give players a chance to turn the tide of battle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnique Features:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRetro-inspired Combat: Arcade-style shooting meets modern game design.<br />\r\nMultiple Endings: It's not just humanity's fate that hangs in the balance.<br />\r\nEpic Boss Battles: Face three powerful, Lovecraftian-inspired alien bosses.<br />\r\nCustom Art and Music: MS Paint-inspired visuals and original retro tunes create a nostalgic, vibrant experience.<br />\r\nEndless Mode: Difficulty increases endlessly, pushing your skills to the limit.<br />\r\nColorblind Mode: Added for enhanced accessibility.<br />\r\nWhy You Should Play:<br />\r\nAll the Stars is the first game made by an amateur developer, created with passion and dedication. Though it may not be perfect, the game is a tribute to classic arcade titles, blending strategic gameplay with narrative depth.
