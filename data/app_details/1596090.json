{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Journey Starts</strong></h2>ClashingBlades is A Free-to-play Classic 3D MMORPG. it features Fantasy-themed gameplay reminiscent of your favorite games from the early to mid-2000s. Make a character and begin your quest in an open world with no guidance.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>It Gets Better</strong></h2>Invite your friends, create Guilds and Parties, Wage wars against other Guilds, or Participate in tournaments and weekly Siege wars for the ownership of one of Ethernia's cities. <br><br>If your Guild controls a city, your Guild master can impose a tax on every token that falls within the city's boundaries or every good that is bought or sold there; the money collected from these taxes goes into your Guild's treasury. The tokens can be taken out by the Guild Master or distributed among the Guild members.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Something about classes?</h2></strong><br>ClashingBlades uses a unique class system where you are what you wear. You don't choose a class at character creation. You select a weapon, and as you level up, you will be able to learn masteries and skills unique to your weapon, or you can switch it for another and learn a completely different mastery from what you selected on character creation. <br><br>You could only master two masteries per character, which allows you to use two different weapons. You could be a Warrior and an Archer or a Cleric and a Warrior. <br><br>That allows players to create a creative combination of skills and a brilliant PvP experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Game Features &amp; Missing Features</strong></h2><strong>EA currently offers the following features: </strong>\u00a0<br>Authentication\u00a0<br>Character Creation.\u00a0<br>PvE, PvP, quests, inventory, and all the standard MMORPG features.\u00a0<br>Social Features: Parties &amp; Guilds, World Chat\u00a0<br>A large starter map (1024x1024)\u00a0<br>For the time being, a single instance server can handle up to 2000 concurrent players.\u00a0<br>optimized client for low-end computers.<br><br><strong>Features missing: </strong>\u00a0<br>Siege battles\u00a0<br>City ownership (one guild owning a city).\u00a0<br>Battle arena for competitive PvP.\u00a0<br>Shops (buying and selling items).\u00a0<br>Player Trading\u00a0<br>Player Shops\u00a0<br>Marketplace\u00a0<br>Quest Chains\u00a0<br>Item Enchantment.\u00a0<br>Quest Items<br><br>The missing features list will be updated.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1596090/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1678031528","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1596090/page.bg.jpg?t=1678031528","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1596090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1678031528","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1596090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1678031528","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Journey Starts</strong></h2>ClashingBlades is A Free-to-play Classic 3D MMORPG. it features Fantasy-themed gameplay reminiscent of your favorite games from the early to mid-2000s.
