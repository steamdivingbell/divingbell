{"about_the_game":"Witness the events preceding the story of Diluvian Ultra in this free, stand-alone FPS. Embody a young Diluvian Knight, Qasar, and face the brutal Myrmidon invasion of your tomb-ship. Find and protect the sarcophagus of Attila, your Lord, and ensure he survives to set in motion the events of Diluvian Ultra. <br><br>Featuring a brand-new level, new characters, story and dialogues, Diluvian Ultra: Awakening is an excellent introduction for new explorers of the game\u2019s universe, as well as an interesting new addition to veterans who have already completed the first chapter of Diluvian Ultra.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Strategic combat</strong></h2>Diluvian Ultra\u2019s combat is built around a dual-damage system where you have to combine weapons to be effective. Armour absorbs damage, but some weapons are designed to quickly strip it off your targets - unable to kill them, but exposing them for a single lethal blow. You have to be careful though, as enemies will mix their attacks in the same way. Collect and consume blood to upgrade your weapons and pick up various power-ups at the opportune moment, to become vengeance incarnate - if only for a while!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Keep it moving</strong></h2>Surviving in Diluvian Ultra is all about mobility. Dodge enemy fire while you chain together ranged attacks with close combat blows and devastating ground slams. Double-jump, dash, find cover and even deflect projectiles with your sword, but never stay in one place for too long!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Organic philosophy</strong></h2>Your spaceship home is a living combination of flesh and stone, and so it is with your arsenal of weapons; use both traditional Tech weapons as well as grotesque, living Organic armaments, and don\u2019t forget to take good care of your closest companion, your sentient Squire Gun.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Epic story</strong></h2>Diluvian Ultra may be an over the top retro FPS filled with frenetic action, but all that carnage is set on a background of an epic, tragic story tackling the themes of fanaticism, trauma, betrayal and hope for redemption, playing out in neo-gothic architectural set pieces and immense, cathedral-like spaceships.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Neonate","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3225260/1f7138045fc965fd5061bbed7d2be6c3571345ad.jpg"}],"total":1},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3225260/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727269339","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3225260/page.bg.jpg?t=1727269339","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3225260/557c35c6f60d0cd9436ecad6035a8231b37bab8a/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727269339","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3225260/557c35c6f60d0cd9436ecad6035a8231b37bab8a/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727269339","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Continue your adventure in Diluvian Ultra!</h1><p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Witness the events preceding the story of Diluvian Ultra in this free, stand-alone FPS.
