{"about_the_game":"Florida Rail Road Museum Model Railroad presented by CDE Trainz<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis route is built with TRS19 SP3. The route includes two sessions. A Tour session and an unlocked Base session. 10% of CDE Trainz net revenue for this route will will be donated to the Florida Railroad Museum or FRRM.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe real model is located at the FRRM in Parrish Florida USA. It is built inside UP #5642. Built in 1954 for Union Pacific by American Car &amp; Foundry, the car was sold to a private collector in 1999. In 2010, the FRRM acquired it, and in 2015-2016, reintroduced it as UP5642 Florida Railroad Museum - Model Railroad Division. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe original is built in G scale and runs O scale trains. This re-creation utilizes HO scale in the same space and formatted for Trainz, which allows for additional scenery to be refitted into the space (possible real life upgrade in the future?), so the layout is not a prototypical representation, but rather an expansion of the real route. The map is 4 x 1 baseboards with multiple industries like Tropicana, lumber industries, passenger stations and the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1696360/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1627454671","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1696360/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1627454671","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1696360/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1627454671","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1696360/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1627454671","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Florida Rail Road Museum Model Railroad presented by CDE Trainz<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis route is built with TRS19 SP3.
