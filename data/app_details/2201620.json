{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">After crash-landing on a deserted planetoid deep in uncharted space, your job is to keep your crew of four distinct explorers alive long enough to figure a way back home. Adaptory combines deep physics-based simulation with base building and discovery. As your team digs below the surface, relationships develop, challenges appear, and rebuilding the ship might eventually take a backseat to unraveling the mysteries of this seemingly dead rock. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2201620/extras/ADAP-steam-description_header-lead.png?t=1736880838\" />Each crew member is a distinct individual, generated procedurally at the start of each game. Your goal is to keep them alive: breathing, fed, warm, healthy, and happy. Each explorer has their own set of skills, traits, and opinions they will not hesitate to share with other crew members. Their conversations and diaries are an integral part of the story and the gameplay, helping you figure out how to best utilize their skills in a challenging environment.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2201620/extras/digging_gif_160h_2.gif?t=1736880838\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2201620/extras/ADAP-steam-description_header-build__1_.png?t=1736880838\" />The crashed ship provides shelter and will keep your crew alive for a time. But to survive, you'll have to build a proper base and form a resilient community capable of facing any dangers. Your crew needs somewhere to sleep, eat, wash, heal, and hang out to keep morale up. Manage temperature, connections, plumbing - and that\u2019s just the beginning. Complexity grows over time. Eventually, you\u2019ll have to automate the base, because while it grows, and so does your list of tasks, your crew size does not.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2201620/extras/power.gif?t=1736880838\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2201620/extras/ADAP-steam-description_header-explore.png?t=1736880838\" />Adaptory runs on sophisticated physics and chemistry systems, simulating gravity, temperature, density, viscosity, and even phase transitions with nearly fifty different materials to learn about and experiment with.

Random meteor showers, solar flares, earthquakes can damage your base - but also provide unexpected opportunities in the form of rare materials or uncovering new veins and artifacts, if your explorers survive them. Even if your base weathers it without a problem, it might push one of your crew members to the breaking point or sever a relationship. How will you adapt and survive?
