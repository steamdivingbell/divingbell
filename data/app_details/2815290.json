{"about_the_game":"Peel back the veil to uncover the secret to richer Sim lives and beyond in The Sims 4 Life &amp; Death Expansion Pack*. Achieve your dreams in life by ticking items off your Bucket List, or pursue them as a Ghost with Unfinished Business. There is a ghastly new world to haunt, a career that\u2019ll bring you closer to Grim, Wills to write, Crypts to explore, and even ghostly skills to master. There are no real endings \u2014 only transitions \u2014 as you move between life, afterlife, and even rebirth.<br><br><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>An Endless Journey</strong> \u2014 Build your Bucket List by collecting goals throughout your Sim\u2019s life, starting as a Young Adult. Items will appear on your list based on your Sim\u2019s traits and family relations, and you can also choose your own. Removing items is possible, but completing them yields powerful rewards. If a Sim\u2019s life ends with items still on their list, they can devote their afterlife to completing their Unfinished Business. The ultimate reward for experiencing everything on their list is the option to be Reborn, though you can still choose to Move On or remain on this plane as a Ghost.<br><br></li><li><strong>A Ghastly, Gorgeous Life</strong> \u2014 Make death your life\u2019s work with a career of reaping souls, helping Ghosts, dispersing hauntings, and more as a member of Grim\u2019s team. Or, you could become a Mortician and deal with death more from the perspective of the living. Outside of work, you might spend your days exploring Crypts and building your Thanatology skill for the new Ghost Historian Aspiration. These things \u2014 among other dark diversions, like bonding with your Pet Crow (careful, provoking it could be deadly) or collecting and reading the lost Tarot Cards of Lady Ravendancer Goth \u2014 will have a special appeal to Sims who are Macabre, one of 3 new traits.<br><br></li><li><strong>Goodbye (For Now)</strong> \u2014 Different Sims will grieve in different ways. There are 4 types that will tie in with both Sims\u2019 personalities and their relationships with the deceased. Grieving Rituals are customizable and unscripted, allowing you to hold whatever type of event (or events) fits your story. In life, Sims can create Wills that can be used to pass down Heirlooms, assign guardians for surviving dependents, distribute their Simoleons, and more. Sims can honor the departed with a memorial display featuring their portrait and by interring their urns in Crypts or with Custom Caskets and Gravesites.<br><br></li><li><strong>Friendly or Fiendish?</strong> \u2014 Linger on as a Ghost, and spend your afterlife helping or terrorizing the living. Ghosts will grow in their abilities as they do everything from assisting with household chores to levitating living Sims and hanging them upside down (fun AND profitable \u2014 they may drop Simoleons!). Their interactions with the living can earn them Fear or Goodwill essences, which can both be sold for Simoleons. There\u2019s a lot to do after death; Ghosts can even pair up for a special spectral Woohoo.<br><br></li><li><strong>A Town Worth Haunting</strong> \u2014 The veil between life and death is thin in Ravenwood, a 3-neighborhood town. Visit the countryside and perhaps take a swim by the mysterious face in the cliffs. Or, head into the village where you\u2019ll find some odd goods for purchase near the old Specter cemetery, a haunted house to brave, or a festival to attend. The residents of these first 2 neighborhoods are (mostly) alive, but it\u2019s Ghosts who will feel most at home in the third, where you\u2019ll find 2 more festivals and a spectral support group. Living Sims can use its Baleful Bog to have an out-of-body experience and try their hands at being temporary Ghosts. Well, it\u2019s usually temporary. Don\u2019t overdo it.</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2815290/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737020514","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2815290/page.bg.jpg?t=1737020514","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2815290/f5c49493ef13a2c5438dc36e11a2b04a3def2593/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737020514","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2815290/f5c49493ef13a2c5438dc36e11a2b04a3def2593/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737020514","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Remote Play on Tablet","id":42}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>What's included in this pack</h1><p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2815290/extras/PDPEP17_ALL.png?t=1737020514\" /></p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Peel back the veil to uncover the secret to richer Sim lives and beyond in The Sims 4 Life &amp; Death Expansion Pack*.
