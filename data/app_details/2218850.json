{"about_the_game":"You woke up in a hospital ward in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. Your task is to survive the first day and get out of the zombie hospital.

Every level can be completed without fighting (see Walkthroughs on Youtube), player just need to think a little and try the alternative way. Every level can be completed in many ways - throwing cans, switch on/off light, drive zombie to food, etc. In few levels zombie have the key and you need to kill him, but his health reduced to make kill easy.<br><br>Hints:<br>1) Standard hearing radius of zombie is equal to the distance to which the zombie sees. This value is multiplied by the noise volume that you produced = whether zombie will hear you or not. Noise volume can be determined intuitively or on the noise bar on the left. For example, when running in flip-flops, the volume is 1.1. When walking - 0.55. Running in sneakers - 0.9, walking - 0.45. Gunshot noise volume of shotgun is 5.0, revolver - 4.0, with a silencer 1.66 and 1.33 accordingly. The volume of moving furniture depends on its size and weight.

All zombies in the dark hibernate, if the zombie does not have some light, e.g. a flashlight on the helmet (but they see player's flashlight and still go to sounds!).
