Only two buttons guide you on this journey A click on the right/left (Mouse And Keyboard Controls) or two buttons on your favorite controller. A right sided button click with apply angular force to the square you are controlling pushing in to the right and vice versa for the left sided button. Sounds simple right? well yes but actually no. With this little control it can be <u>EXTREMELY</u> hard to avoid all obstacles and reach the end of each level unharmed. Every level is sure to require hundreds of rage filled attempts as your skill level increases. Mastery of controls will make you feel as if you have achieved greatness so what do you say will you play Speed or is it just too hard for you?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1577630/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1617422478","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1577630/page.bg.jpg?t=1617422478","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1577630/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1617422478","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1577630/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1617422478","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1577630/extras/unnamed_1.jpg?t=1617422478\" /> Speed is a fast paced action game requiring the player to constantly think on their feet.
