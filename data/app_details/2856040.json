The challenge lies in finding the right sequence of moves that bumps all the pieces into the ocean. As you play, the island shrinks around the pieces that are left, and when there is only one cube left, the level is complete. As you progress through the chapters new pieces are introduced, adding layers of strategy which require increasingly clever moves.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2856040/extras/store_page_header_04.png?t=1715173906\" /><br>Zink is developed by a passionate but small team of one person.
