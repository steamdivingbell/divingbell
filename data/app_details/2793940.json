{"about_the_game":"In the 22nd century, humanity reached new heights in space exploration, colonizing distant worlds and exploring countless star systems. However, relentless expansion and the endless search for resources pushed Earth to the brink of exhaustion. To save themselves, humanity united under the Galactic Alliance and began a desperate search for new sources of energy and vital materials.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeacon of Salvation puts you in the role of a lone captain of a research starship tasked with exploring uncharted planets and deploying energy beacons\u2014humanity\u2019s last hope for survival. These beacons provide communication with the mothership and generate protective fields to fend off local predators. However, activating a beacon also attracts the attention of dangerous and mysterious creatures that inhabit these hostile worlds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSurvival on Hostile Planets: Protect your beacon from relentless waves of monsters over a 7-day period by using the resources and technologies available on the planet. Your survival depends on your ability to adapt to the dynamic threats and diverse biomes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBase Building and Defense: Construct defenses, set up turrets, and manage limited resources. Each core harvested from defeated monsters unlocks new upgrades, powerful weapons, and enhanced defensive structures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExploration and Progression: Once you successfully defend one planet, return to your ship and set course for the next, more challenging planet with unique environments and threats. Each planet offers new challenges, resources, and hidden secrets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvolving Threats: Enemies not only grow stronger with each wave but also adapt to your strategies. Various monster types have special abilities, requiring tactical planning and resourceful defense.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2793940/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727259545","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2793940/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1727259545","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2793940/b4b3bf21e063b95d9514401538919a1a1417cef3/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727259545","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2793940/b4b3bf21e063b95d9514401538919a1a1417cef3/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727259545","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In the 22nd century, humanity reached new heights in space exploration, colonizing distant worlds and exploring countless star systems.
