Because there's no cap to the speed, it will inevitably be impossible to keep going, just as it will inevitably be impossible to keep chasing perfection.","achievements":{"total":0},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/786720/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1520551967","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/786720/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1520551967","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/786720/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1520551967","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/786720/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1520551967","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 5,000 unlockable achievements<br></li><li> Lowest price possible<br></li><li> Guarantee that achievements will work<br></li><li> Future trading cards</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Story</h2><br>This is the story of Charles. <br><br>He was once an ordinary man, with a simple life and simpler goals.
