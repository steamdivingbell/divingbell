{"about_the_game":"Build a cozy village for your heroes to live in and explore with the Krachware Fantasy Town Exterior Tileset! Bring your hero\u2019s childhood home to life with this pack of tiles, be it a farming village, rustic port town, or even an abandoned village forgotten by the kingdom! A1, A2, A3, and A4 autotiles are ready to help you create an adorable little town. Fill the tiny farming village with dirt paths and rustic wooden homes and let your heroes walk down stone paths between brick and stucco storefronts. Create small wood-lined waterways in a small forest village, while larger towns rely on brick canals flowing alongside the stone streets. Angled roof tiles make it easy to add variations to your buildings, so they don\u2019t all have to look like cookie-cutter squares! Wooden barrels and crates, clay pots, benches, row boats, and other tiles are ready to decorate your village streets and alleys, or keep things natural with flowers and shrubberies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf all those tiles weren\u2019t enough, there are also destroyed options to let your players see the wear and tear of time on an unlucky town! Damaged signs, cracked roof tiles, shattered windows, and web-filled crates can make any town look down on its luck. Will your players be able to save the poor villagers from total destruction? This pack also includes 12 wooden door sprites to give your players access to the village buildings! Give tiled-roof homes doors with matched tiles on their overhang, and make it easy for people to enter the local tavern by giving them arched two-tile wide doors! Create a cozy wooden town for your heroes to grow up in or have a broken down village that your players need to repair with the Krachware Fantasy Town Exterior Tileset!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Tiles A1-5, C, C2 C3<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTerms of Use:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* This pack is for use in RPG Maker Series or the engine of your choice.<br />\r\n* OK to be used in Commercial projects<br />\r\n* Contents can be edited<br />\r\n* OK for use in games with gore<br />\r\n* OK for use in adult-rated games","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2228551/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1682023443","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2228551/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1682023443","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2228551/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1682023443","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2228551/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1682023443","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Build a cozy village for your heroes to live in and explore with the Krachware Fantasy Town Exterior Tileset!
