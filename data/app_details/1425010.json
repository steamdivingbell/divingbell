{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> <br>ForkJump is a single-player, third-person exploration game that combines 3D platforming with a captivating, horror-themed adventure set in an open-world sci-fi environment. Players must be cautious of disturbed jumping fork monsters and other hazards such as hidden fork-jump-scare traps. Amidst this atmospheric, dark and fork-obsessed playground governed by physics mechanisms, players navigate through lands filled with mysterious robots, unexpected characters, formidable enemies, challenges, complex structures, and many forks. Players are encouraged to harness swift parkour movements and utilize the innovative &quot;ForkJump Gun&quot; to teleport and navigate the world, where mastering momentum physics is crucial. In ForkJump, players can expect to spend considerable time at high altitudes, jumping, teleporting, and soaring through the air, leveraging the game's unique physics mechanisms. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1425010/extras/nr1_gif_4.gif?t=1734958020\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Gameplay Highlights:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">ForkJump Gun in Action: Utilize the ForkJump Gun to retrieve Fork \u201ckeys\u201d, unveiling areas and pathways previously deemed unreachable. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1425010/extras/nr2_gif_1_1.gif?t=1734958020\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Cybernetic Adversaries &amp; Allies: Encounter unique robots and aliens, each adding a piece to the story puzzle.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1425010/extras/nr5_gif_3.gif?t=1734958020\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Select Character Appearance: Make your mark in this cyberworld.
