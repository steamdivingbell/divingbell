Like in any roleplaying game, each champion will evolve over time. In the island, you can find 12 different champions with thousands of different evolution paths. <br><br>In your journey to Enardem you will have to create a deck with 10 action cards to defeat your opponents. Each action card can be played several times throughout a match and can evolve through multiple specialisations. With hundreds of different cards, you have an infinite amount of ways to play your adventure. <br><br>As a trading card game, each Malkyrs card has a rarity.
