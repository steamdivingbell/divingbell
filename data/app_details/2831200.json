{"about_the_game":"A Witch's Game is a tactical card game on a hexagonal grid which focuses on displacement in a turn-based combat system. The goal is to destroy the enemies resources before they destroy yours.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Displacement</h2>Enemy moves are telegraphed one turn before they occur, allowing the player to act upon the enemy's plans. Because the game focuses on displacement, this means that much of the tactics comes from displacing units to avoid damage or redirect damage to other units. The enemy does not readjust its attack after displacement, so its possible to make an enemy accidentally attack its own friendly unit through displacement.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2831200/extras/v0.6.9-Displacement_640x360.gif?t=1719333356\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Undo/Redo</h2>To encourage experimentation and discovery, any move/engagement can be undone or redone as the player sees fit.
