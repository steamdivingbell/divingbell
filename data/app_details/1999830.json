{"about_the_game":"<strong>About this Game</strong><br>Pin City is a bowling game unlike any other bowling game you\u2019ve played before. We strove to bring the spirit of mini-golf into the world of bowling. We\u2019ve taken the standard bowling setup (straight lane, 10 pins, 1 ball) and expanded, transformed, and evolved it. We wanted to give people a chance to bowl in ways that would be impossible, illegal, or extremely impractical.<br><br><strong>Scoring / Structure</strong><br>At its core, Pin City is a bowling game. That means two throws per frame (three on the last frame), and standard spare and strike scoring apply. That being said, there may not always be the same amount of pins!<br><br><strong>Levels</strong><br>Pin City will have 50+ handcrafted levels spanning a wide range of mechanics to really challenge your bowling arm.
