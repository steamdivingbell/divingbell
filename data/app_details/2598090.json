{"about_the_game":"A modern Naval warfare game with optional air strikes from allied planes. The Player controls a military ship on the open ocean.  Once the game begins, an enemy ship will appear on the horizon.  The goal of the game is for the Player to sink as many enemy ships as possible.  When the Player successfully sinks an enemy ship, a new enemy ship will appear on the horizon.  To sink an enemy ship, the Player can either send missiles from his ship, or engage an allied plan from the sky above.  The pressure is on as all this time, the enemy ship is sending missiles towards the Player's ship, in an attempt to sink it.  Every time the Player sinks an enemy ship, he gains a point.  The Player's points are saved and tallied in the top left corner of the screen.  When the Player's ship is sunk by an enemy ship, the game ends and the Player can either restart the game or quit.  In either case, the Player's high score is saved and appears at the top left of the screen.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2598090/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1696508571","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2598090/page.bg.jpg?t=1696508571","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2598090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1696508571","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2598090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1696508571","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"This game contains no sexual content or physical violence.
