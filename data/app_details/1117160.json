{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">1. Statecraft and Reincarnation</h2><br>How Does Reincarnation Affect Statecraft?<br>How would a soul that has lived 100 lives be different than one which is living his first life affect the community?<br>How do you survive and prosper both spiritually and materially? <br>How do you work spiritual ideals with the reality of violence?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">2. Governance As Questions and Answers.</h2><br>Many times, we get upset with legislation without trying to give an alternative answer to the underlying question the aforementioned law tries to solve. <br>In Minds of Nations, you can give your own custom answers or choose from a predefined set of answers to each question the state needs answered.<br><br>\u201cHow Do We Choose Leadership ?\u201d<br>\u201cHow Do We Motivate Your Soldiers ?\u201d<br>\u201cHow do we keep institutions from gaining too much power ?\u201d<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">3. Complex Algorithms</h2><br>&gt;200 Variables<br><br>Opportunities for women, economic promise, family values and grandparent support, immigration, food variety, state support and interventions, chronic diseases, infectious diseases, infant mortality, and accidents. <br>These are just the variables involved in population growth.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">4. Economic Externalities </h2><br>Tobacco production &amp; sugary drinks affect chronic diseases which reduce manpower. But, they yield great revenues. <br><br>5. Religion as the development of methods for transformation<br><br>In Minds of Nations, the focus is on developing meditation techniques, prayers, austerities, and other inner transformation techniques.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">6. Diplomacy &amp; Meta-ethnic Frontiers</h2><br>Relationships with A.I. Nations are based on a shared ideological identity: theistic position [polytheism/monotheism/transtheism / etc ], leadership choice [elected / hereditary / sortition/exams, etc ], family composition, and migrant laws. With human players, you have more leeway to work.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">7. Prestige Products</h2><br>States can invest in the development of their own high-quality products [ Japanese Sushi / Belgian Chocolate / Han Ceramics / etc ]. Perfect for trade republics that look to dominate trade.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">8. Selective Breeding </h2><br>You can adapt far-away resources to your own climate or increase the production of something you already own. Thus, you can overcome geographical determinism.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">9. Incarnate Great Heroes</h2><br>&gt;150 Heroes.<br><br>The game takes part on another planet. But that does not mean that great talents from Terra cannot come and help us. Some souls can travel to other planets and take birth there.<br><br>You can get a mathematician from the Pythagorean school to come to help us develop math or a former Egyptian Embalmer to help us with medical research.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">10. War, Expansion, Lies &amp; propaganda</h2><br>Overpopulation or environmental damage may limit your population growth. You'll have a choice to make. Stay within your borders or expand militarily and/or diplomatically [ with A.I. Nations ]. Then, the political work begins. Territorial Claims. Casus Belli. Domestic Propaganda. <br><br>Careful though, big lies may motivate your populace but may yield penalties in the future.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">11. Elite Military Corps</h2><br>If fortune runs out, and the country goes to war, you'll need to rely on a veteran, hard-drilled corps. Think Numidian Cavalry, Japanese Samurai, Swiss Pikeman, etc. There are many avenues to develop your State, so be careful not to neglect this aspect during peacetime.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">12. Spiritual Growth</h2><br>Over time, souls that incarnate in your nation grow. Their desires change and they produce more ideas for your state.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">13. Afterlife Options</h2><br>You have a set of options to manage the spiritual community in the afterlife as well!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">14. Charity &amp; Investments</h2><br>As our industry grows and our stockpiles increase, you'll have another choice to make. How to invest in the surplus? Charity? Investment? Both actions yield certain benefits.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">15. Climate Change</h2><br>The game simulates the effect that large, monocultural, agrarian societies have had on the environment.<br><br>Just as some ancient civilizations had fallen on Terra due to bad soil management, your state will be at risk if you ignore the issue.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">16. Multiple Effect Packs</h2><br>To avoid any political bias with the ideological options in the game and to avoid repetition, there's a second pack with random effects.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">17. Custom Wonders </h2><br>There are new wonders in this game. No \u201cEiffel Tower\u201d.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">18. Customizations, victory Conditions &amp; Maps</h2><br>There are 11 victory conditions, 63 customizations, and 12 maps.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">19. Stories </h2><br>Currently, there are 16 stories with 78 chapters, in which we explore the aforementioned themes. Each chapter gives you a bonus or a malus.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">20. Technology</h2><br>Technology unlocks units and can also be spent on economical endeavours.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">21. Music</h2><br>The soundtrack plays songs from two catalogs. One black and one white. Songs from the white catalog have an angelic vibe. They symbolize the afterlife. While songs from the black catalog are historical. They symbolize the struggle of living life among the perils of predation.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">22. Single-player &amp;&amp; MMO</h2><br>The game has a single-player mode and an online mode! <br><br>No Microtransactions. Just Fun &amp; Fair Play.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Spheres of Influence","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1117160/53ff439e53edbf5360cc0933d8e20d6764f244ef.jpg"},{"name":"Subutai","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1117160/48043a8065b4476d15d9270a91982f4e41947ddf.jpg"},{"name":"\"Cats can have a little salami\"","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1117160/609d8b94415ee8d46a0bae3b7501932ffd3c624a.jpg"},{"name":"Bunnies","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1117160/fc97760363f0e9782a63b2d8d20f2758ccaf792d.jpg"},{"name":"Training the mind","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1117160/c950a9fbcb8cf0c0f60bd109c757596f9789c618.jpg"},{"name":"Sophisticates","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1117160/8b0bad7a7dfd0af4c830f33945f4a2f01fe4e219.jpg"},{"name":"To the stars","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1117160/406cb6e1fbea541bdcaba8bb81c4d5270e58c47a.jpg"},{"name":"Beacon","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1117160/79cb1e1f494fc6e6fb58af41affc40df0ee225c1.jpg"},{"name":"Kangaroo courts, no more !","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1117160/3904edb276e55c241a3746b7abf9513c88216f70.jpg"},{"name":"Crassus","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1117160/3b56ce7ab62569e147b897503f208764cc847b3e.jpg"}],"total":50},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117160/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1703178693","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117160/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1703178693","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117160/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1703178693","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1117160/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1703178693","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">1.
