Take part in online games for up to 6 players and establish your strategy to win the race. Create your own team of 2 riders from over 900 professional cyclists and choose a jersey that sets you apart. <br><br>Play in Criterium mode each week and try to unlock additional content for your team. New professional riders and World Tour team jerseys will be available so you can modify your team the way you want.<br>Adapt your strategy to the stage. In multiplayer, the Col du Galibier can be climbed with a mountain team as well as a sprint team. Your riders' characteristics are randomly set at the start of the game, to ensure all the players have the same chance.
