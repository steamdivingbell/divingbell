{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Lern Island Letters is a short narrative game where you play as a postman, sorting the mail of the five intriguing residents of a peaceful remote island. Pick up on their peculiar habits, discover their secrets without opening the envelopes, and try to save this natural haven from its fate before the end of the week.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3313970/extras/postman.gif?t=1736962680\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This experience is brief, usually between 10 and 30 minutes, making it easily replayable if you want to find all the clues and jokes, or if you think you can get a better ending than on your first playthrough.  </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Less reading, more mystery</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3313970/extras/heart.gif?t=1736962680\" />Even if you\u2019re just replacing your grandfather as a postman for a week, you intend on remaining professional: opening people\u2019s mail is not an option.
