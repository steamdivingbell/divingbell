One day, all the cars, bits of earth, cans, objects and so on began to rise towards the sky, and all of a sudden, time stopped. Rumor has it that a black hole caused time to stop, which explains the objects floating in the air, but we can't understand why there are no humans left on Earth. Grumpy, the frog, has been living in the shantytown since he was born, and ever since he was a child he's been curious, so he decides to go and see what's going on up there. The other frogs told him, &quot;You're just a frog, you won't make it&quot;. Since then, Grumpy has had one thing on his mind: to go up there.<br><br><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2587980/extras/Gameplay.jpg?t=1719241480\" /><br><br>You control a frog that performs jumps according to its energy gauge, which builds up to a maximum when you hold down the keyboard space key. When you release the space key, the height of your jump will depend on the amount of energy accumulated. It's crucial to release the space key correctly, otherwise you may not be able to jump if you don't have enough energy. You can also control the frog in flight, but with certain limitations.<br><br><strong>LEVELS</strong><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2587980/extras/Niveaux.jpg?t=1719241480\" /><br><br>As you progress through the game, you'll encounter a variety of gameplay phases, each offering a unique experience and relatively high difficulty. You'll experience 2D phases, top-down views, areas where you'll have to make sure you land on small objects, make choices between different paths, cross water phases, and many more challenges!

These flags allow you to reappear at the point where you touched the last flag, which is very useful if you don't want to start the game all over again. To reappear at this precise point, simply press the E key. Bear in mind, however, that you're only allowed 3 &quot;reappearances&quot; per flag. Once you've used up all 3 reappearances, you won't be able to reappear at the last flag you touched. To reobtain the 3 &quot;reappearances&quot;, you'll need to touch another flag that hasn't yet been activated.<br><br><strong>DIAMOND &amp; KEY</strong><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2587980/extras/Diamand___Cl\u00e9.jpg?t=1719241480\" /><br><br>Although the game is mainly linear, it does offer the possibility of discovering diamonds and keys. These items will allow you to open doors that require a certain number of diamonds or keys to unlock rewards such as more diamonds or keys, access to teleporters to progress further in the game, bonus flags, and many other benefits. Finding and collecting diamonds and keys is optional, so you're free to end the game without them if you wish.<br><br><strong>CONCLUSION</strong><br><br>I sincerely hope you enjoy this game.

However, I would like to warn you to take care not to damage your screen or any other equipment on your PC, as this game can be particularly demanding and frustrating.
