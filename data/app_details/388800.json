{"about_the_game":"Azure Striker Gunvolt is a 2D action game featuring the talents of star creator Keiji Inafune as the Executive Producer and Action Supervisor. <br>With the \u201cseptimal\u201d power to create and manipulate lightning, Gunvolt faces off against the massive conglomerate known as the Sumeragi Group. Intense battles <br>unfold against Sumeragi's ultra-powerful adepts (those who possess septimal powers) as Gunvolt fights to keep his nation free.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Speedrun Mode</h2>This new mode gives speedrunners around the world the chance to compete for the best time, <br>with pre-determined settings put in place by the Gunvolt team to maximize efficiency for this challenging new mode. <br>Future updates which will new add features and settings are already planned, <br>so stayed tuned for information about that in the near future.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Lightning-Based Action</h2>Use your trusty sidearm to tag enemies, then let loose a burst of electricity for massive damage. You can even tag multiple enemies and zap them all simultaneously. <br>Your lightning abilities are not just for defeating enemies, though. Use them to perform various maneuvers such as hovering across hazardous terrain.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Do Battle With a Variety of Bosses</h2>Sumeragi's most powerful members, with a wide range of personalities, await you at the end of your missions. <br>Battles get heated as bosses unleash their most powerful skills and techniques.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Those for Whom the Muse Sings Shall Turn the Tides of Battle</h2>Even Gunvolt falls in battle sometimes. When this happens, there is a chance that Lumen, <br>aka The Muse, will revive you and grant you a massive power boost. Furthermore, <br>if you manage to amass at least 1000 Kudos during a stage, <br>the BGM will change and Lumen will sing one of her songs for you for as long as you maintain those Kudos. <br>Your Kudos will reset upon taking damage, so keep that no-damage run going for as long as you can!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Japanese Voice Mode</h2>In this long-awaited mode, players will be able to play the original Japanese version of the game, <br>which includes ample mid-stage dialogue, all fully voiced in Japanese with English text. <br>The entire script has been re-translated to coincide with the dialogue of the Japanese version of the game. <br>To play the game in Japanese Voice Mode, select it from the Language Settings before starting the game.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"It's My Hobby!!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/388800/3b3f4749170247c42486877345c9c5eb60210fc6.jpg"},{"name":"Mantis, Move Out!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/388800/10c0ac457da4a4c9fb6dc57584bee69d982d1532.jpg"},{"name":"The Lamest of Lame...","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/388800/eb77d7e0d39f98103b5f85106936c4f4f487842f.jpg"},{"name":"Waaay Too Slow!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/388800/ae33f194df5d9aee5d8a6746ca3424f8e035e527.jpg"},{"name":"Go Straight to Hell!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/388800/6c6276127a4bd47b5afb9616fb0ea07d604e6b1e.jpg"},{"name":"Pure Euphoria!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/388800/d0cefcfbcd213054d46e302e9fb7b15d97256820.jpg"},{"name":"You're Gonna Be My New Plaything","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/388800/1c54f3a550f91e2f5268fb2e95b559187c54741f.jpg"},{"name":"FEED MEEE!!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/388800/1e8293f223d94c746189602bb22e2f7de50f341b.jpg"},{"name":"It's My Secret Love Technique!!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/388800/a1934811601c5c97e427b76dc0d8eb031cb60579.jpg"},{"name":"Tanks Aren't Supposed to Jump!!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/388800/15c22299edb3a0b3fb5c6c81ab284302aa2216dd.jpg"}],"total":25},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/388800/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727748558","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/388800/page.bg.jpg?t=1727748558","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/388800/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727748558","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/388800/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727748558","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Azure Striker Gunvolt is a 2D action game featuring the talents of star creator Keiji Inafune as the Executive Producer and Action Supervisor. <br>With the \u201cseptimal\u201d power to create and manipulate lightning, Gunvolt faces off against the massive conglomerate known as the Sumeragi Group.
