{"about_the_game":"<strong>Story Description:</strong><br>In Washington State, a state-specific quarantine has been in place for quite some time now, a process that has led to the neglect of things like violence, murders, and sexual abuse, with virtually no repercussions for anyone except those crossing the border. You, as a nihilistic, desensitized person who has lost any sense of optimism in life, are neutral to these daily occurrences and issues.<br><br>On one unfortunate day, a woman named Samarah, a person with more freedom and power than the rest of the civilians, comes into your life. The government granted these benefits partly because of her intellectual superiority over the masses. She approaches you with a particular interest in placing you into her polyamorous relationship, where she attempts to maintain a diverse collection of people varying in all sexual orientations and genders. Being nothing but a neutral, self-deprecating, powerless individual, you have no option but to accept this if you value your life.<br><br>How do people in this life cope with their self-destructive tendencies? Why does the state operate the way it does? Is there a way to find happiness in a life where everyone is miserable? While all of these questions are up in the air, one thing is for sure: dreams and the interpretation of imagination are a logical inconsistency. The pursuit of the answer, or perhaps defining the question, awaits as you read through this dark psychological drama visual novel. <br><br><strong>Key Features:</strong><br>-A 4-7 hour long Visual Novel<br>-Hundreds of CG's<br>-Over 30 music tracks <br>-A dark and intense narrative","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3078550/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725540115","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3078550/page.bg.jpg?t=1725540115","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3078550/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725540115","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3078550/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725540115","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,3,4,5],"notes":"This game contains the following:\r\n-Frequent Mentions and Depictions of Blood and Violence \r\n-Frequent Mentions and Depictions of Sexual Acts and References to Sexual Violence \r\n-Frequent Mentions and Depictions of Self-Harm\r\n-Frequent Mentions and Depictions of Drugs and Alcohol\r\n-Frequent Uses of Offensive and Derogatory Terms"},"detailed_description":"<strong>Story Description:</strong><br>In Washington State, a state-specific quarantine has been in place for quite some time now, a process that has led to the neglect of things like violence, murders, and sexual abuse, with virtually no repercussions for anyone except those crossing the border.
