One nightmarish day,  a terrible Spaghetti Monster, also known as Larry, invaded the planet and started gobbling up all the good people! He also used his magic to turn human food into MAN EATING MONSTERS!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a last effort, the United Banana Republic of Earth built underground cities to hide from Larry and his minions!  It is now up to you and your friends to help retake the surface world! Travel across the world with several locations like Egypt, France, USA, and more!

Each level will randomly spawn you in an elevator bringing you to any random place in the world! You won't only have to survive onslaughts of hordes of zombified food, there will be obstacle courses and puzzles as well! You can either play solo or with friends online CO-OP.
