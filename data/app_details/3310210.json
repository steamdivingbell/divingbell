{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FNAF-Like</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Blessed with Death positions itself as a FNAF-Like, and we distance ourselves from the term FNAF-Fangame. The game has its own story, style and characters that are in no way connected to the FNAF world. We only based ourselves on the gameplay mechanics of the first FNAF games but changed them from the ground up. Our game is of course oriented towards the existing community that is hungry for new secrets and gameplay mechanics.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3310210/extras/Camera.gif?t=1738154580\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Plot</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You desperately needed money, so you took the one job in the city that everyone avoided. Guarding an ancient house located deep in the forest. Where there is no road leading in or out. During the day, you don't have to be afraid. But at night, when the stars are favorable, they appear. Now you fight for your survival on the edge of the world. Use magical objects that appear to be eons old and lock the doors. Every night, there are more and more of them. But you get to know them all better and learn about the past of this place. Search for clues and survive.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New Gameplay Mechanics</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Blessed with Death stands out from other FNAF-Like thanks to its beautiful drawing style and gameplay mechanics. The antagonists all have individual gimmicks and characteristics that have not been seen in this form before. Additionally, after every night, new magical objects are unlocked. You can always choose one of them to help you get through a night and each object allows for different ways a night can be played.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">No electricity &amp; the hallways</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> There is no electricity in the game that you could use up, but that doesn't make it any easier because the door system has been adapted to this, creating a completely new experience. Now, in addition to the cameras, you need to keep an eye on two hallways that are both connecting the house to the players room.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3310210/extras/Hallway.gif?t=1738154580\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Replayability</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">All enemies are randomly made more or less aggressive each time you start a night.
