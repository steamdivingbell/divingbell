Discover allies or foes who have shared the same fate. Be careful, not everyone will have your best interest at heart.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2067460/extras/floatgoat2.gif?t=1724104948\" /><br><br><strong>Turn-Based Combat: </strong><br>Tactically decide how to deploy party members.
