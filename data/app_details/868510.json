At your disposal you have a giant worm on your shoulder to serve you as weapon, several boss skills that allow you to hit and kill multiple enemies and loyal minions that will fight for you to the death. <br><br>The Outsiders is a short and visceral game for those moments when you just want some good gruesome fun, when you don't have a lot of time to spare or even between two matches of your favorite MOBA or Battle Royale.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MAIN FEATURES OF THE GAME</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Visceral action that puts you on the role of the Big Boss;<br></li><li>Nothing bigger than you on screen, you are the gigantic badass monster;<br></li><li>Endless gameplay with good replayability;<br></li><li>3 different random arena levels;<br></li><li>3 different powerful weapons to allow for diverse strategies;<br></li><li>3 different Boss skills that will slay them all!<br></li><li>Awesome heavy metal soundtrack by Paulo Germano.
