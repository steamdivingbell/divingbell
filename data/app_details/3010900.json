{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3010900/extras/Steam_Page_Discord.png?t=1726313661\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">UNDER THE SAME SUN YOU FIND EITHER RICHES OR DEATH </h2>Prepare for a treacherous journey across the desert, filled with risks, misfortunes and wishful thinking. Your patron, the Contractor, has tasked you with an almost impossible task - track down and defeat the Ancient Gods. Her quarrel with them is none of your business, all you know is that you have little to no hopes of making it through. Fortunately for you, she is willing to help, albeit in an odd manner...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fight through the harsh and unforgiving Venus Desert</h2>The desert offers fighters of many kinds, spellcasters of long forgotten empires, brute warriors of savage nature, imperial hunters capable of instantly executing weak enemies, constructs of unknown origins &amp; purpose, and much more. Form a powerful combination of units, and crush your enemies.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3010900/extras/BATTLE.gif?t=1726313661\" />.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Stake your units</h2>Gold is scarce, and the Contractor, is offering a bargain. Stake a unit's soul, and place a bet. Can you guess which unit will die first? How about who will deal the most damage? Win and gain enough gold to make it through, or lose, and your unit is sent into oblivion, permanently dying. Staking a unit will always pose a risk, for the desert is unpredictable and filled with many surprises. Alas, your chances of making it are grim without constantly pleasing the Contractor, by signing her risky deals.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3010900/extras/BETTING_AND_STAKED.gif?t=1726313661\" />.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Purchase units &amp; barter for beads</h2>If you manage to get your hands on any gold, slave caravans are roaming the desert, willing to sell your their finest exhibits. Purchase units, and then buy beads, powerful items that grant unique abilities. As each unit is unique, so is each bead. Use those two elements appropriately and build a strategy, by utilizing the many possible combinations that exist. A savage slow brute, infused with a bead that allows them to attack faster, and even perform double attacks? Or a spellcaster that can now tank? Use your combinations not only to succeed in battle, but weight the bets in your odds. A bet that requires you to guess who will kill first? Maybe a bead that executes enemies will be of help....<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3010900/extras/BUY_GLAD_AND_BEAD.gif?t=1726313661\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Track down the Ancient Gods</h2>No map has ever chartered this place, however a mystical compass exists that can help you track down your enemies. Ransack shards from God's domains, and use them to align it, finding your way to their secret enclaves. Tracking a specific Ancient God is important, for you know what your enemy will be, if you don't gather enough shards, the compass might point you somewhere randomly....<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3010900/extras/MAP.gif?t=1726313661\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Face &amp; defeat the horrors</h2>Powerful bosses, called Sentinels, guard their Gods. Each one has different strengths and weaknesses, and taking them down is no easy task. On top of that, even in your darkest hour, the Contractor always demands you to gamble. Boss fights feature unique bets, tailored to their abilities, so your units must be prepared for the worst of fates.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3010900/extras/BOSS_FIGHT.gif?t=1726313661\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3010900/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726313661","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3010900/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1726313661","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3010900/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726313661","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3010900/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726313661","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3010900/extras/Steam_Page_Discord.png?t=1726313661\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">UNDER THE SAME SUN YOU FIND EITHER RICHES OR DEATH </h2>Prepare for a treacherous journey across the desert, filled with risks, misfortunes and wishful thinking.
