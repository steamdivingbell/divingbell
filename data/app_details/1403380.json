It can do this by minimizing your CPU's power state for background tasks and optimizing your CPU's power state for foreground tasks.  Additionally, you can customize how your CPU deals with load and temperatures, creating new possibilities for overclocking and silent PC builds.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>CPUs usually have similar features built in.  However, these features typically lack configurability and often don't work at all with overclocking.  The built in hardware features are also not using all of the available information that Chill Boost uses, so they will often boost unnecessarily for background processes like indexing, scans, and updates.  You can use Chill Boost to get more control over your computer's temperature, noise, and power consumption.  If you are overclocking, you may be able to use the additional control to stabilize higher overclocks, especially on processors with large core counts.<br></li><li>Chill Boost uses your power scheme settings to work.  It is separate from a power scheme setting, as you can have it enabled with any power scheme.  However, power schemes which do not allow 100% CPU utilizations will have reduced/no benefits from this feature.<br></li><li>Enabling verticle sync or framerate limits when gaming can help you get the most from Chill Boost.<br></li><li>Overclockers may find this feature useful for semi-stable overclocks which only fail under sustained heavy load due to rising temperature.<br></li><li>I developed this feature because I noticed that under heavy load, the overclock I used on my AMD Ryzen based processor would cause the chip to slowly heat up and lose performance until the system would hang.  I still wanted the overclock, though, because it worked great under normal loads.  So, I made this feature so that I could use the full speed of my overclock for normal loads while preventing heavy loads from crashing my machine.<br></li><li>Here are some hints for overclockers.  If your voltage is too tight for your clock rate, you will likely crash quickly when doing a stress test before even heating up significantly.  Higher voltage will heat up the chip faster, but can increase the range of temperatures that it will operate, which can give you more room to play with the Chill Boost Reservoir Size and/or increase stability in general.  Be sure to do some research online about what most people feel are safe voltages for your CPU before setting it too high.<br></li><li>If you are overclocking an AMD Ryzen based CPU, you may need to use P-State overclocking in order to benefit from Chill Boost.  When overclocking without P-States, the CPU may refuse to drop down to a lower voltage, and then when Chill Boost tries to limit the CPU power usage, nothing will happen.  You may also see this if some of your P-States are unstable, as the system seems to detect this sometimes and blocks them from activating.  P-State 1 is what Chill Boost is going to try to use under heavy load, so I would recommend optimizing your P-State 0 for single core loads and P-State 1 for all core loads, so that Chill Boost can give you the best of both worlds.<br></li><li>If you are overclocking an Intel CPU, you can do regular overclocking in conjunction with Chill Boost.  Intel chips have generally always been willing to drop to lower power states when overclocking.  Unfortunately, you cannot customize the P-States even if you want to, so you won't be able to optimize quite as much as with an AMD chip, though that may not matter if the voltage curve is sufficiently aggressive.<br></li><li>The Auto Calibration button will run benchmarks on your processor at various configurations and then use the results to optimize to your Chill Boost settings according to heuristics developed alongside the Chill Boost features.  Depending on available sensors, it will attempt to find the best values for your Efficiency Locker Max Power State, Critical Max Power State, and Stressed Max Power State.  This is a good way to help you get the most out of Chill Boost without actually having to figure out everything yourself.  It also displays information that may help you when manually tweaking things.<br></li><li>The Auto Calibration results table shows detailed information about how the processor is performing at each energy state.<br> - Score shows how well the processor did in benchmarks.  This version's benchmarking code is far from perfect, so the results may be misleading if you are using them to compare different hardware.  The results are probably most useful when comparing a single device in multiple configurations.  If the calibration options include simultaneous multithreading or additional cores, these are summed up in the score.<br> - Scored Efficiency takes the score divided by the measured energy consumption.  This version's benchmarking code is far from perfect, and sensor accuracy varies by product and configuration, especially when overclocking.  Therefore, the results may be misleading if you are using them to compare different hardware.  The results are probably most useful when comparing single device in different configurations.  Another thing you should consider is that this efficiency score does not include idle waste energy, so if you can turn your PC off after it is done working, higher power states may actually be more efficient than shown here.<br> - Measured Efficiency takes the clock speed divided by the measured energy consumption.  Power sensors often report wrong values for various reasons such as overclocking, making it difficult to trust this value.  The calibration tool makes decisions based on Estimated Efficiency instead, if available.<br> - Estimated efficiency uses voltage and clock rate for estimation.  The resulting values are ratios of each estimated efficiency to the least efficient estimated efficiency.  The efficiency values are intended to represent how many calculations the CPU can do in a configuration with a fixed amount of energy, relative to each other.</li></ul>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Chill Boost Enabled (Default: False)<br>Enables Chill Boost feature, which reduces the CPU power state in specific circumstances to improve performance.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Responsiveness (Default: 12)<br>This value is the number of times per second the chill boost updates.  Higher values will increase responsiveness of the feature, but also can increase load on the CPU.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Display Responsiveness (Default: 4)<br>This value is the number of times per second the chill boost settings panel updates.  Because the settings panel does not run on the same timer as the feature itself, displayed values may not exactly match up with what is actually happening.  Usually you would want the display panel updating slower, as it uses more resources and throws off its own results when running too quickly.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Reservoir Size (Default: 0)<br>The reservoir size is how many seconds your CPU is allowed to run at full load before Chill Boost kicks in, and should be matched to your CPU cooling system.  For example, if you have a water cooled system that can't keep up with your overclock and it takes 30 seconds for your computer to crash at full load, you might want to set this at 10 seconds to limit unnecessary throttling but still prevent the system from reaching conditions in which it would crash.  If you have an air-cooled system or a tight overclock, temperature issues can hit much faster so you might be better off leaving this value at 0.  The reservoir only applies when looking at load.  Temperature limit settings will ignore reservoir settings.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Reservoir Fill Rate (Default: 0.1)<br>The reservoir fill rate is a multiplier on how many seconds are filled per second of CPU underutilization.  If you are overclocking your CPU in a configuration that is not thermally stable at 100% load, you might outpace your heat dissipation and crash if you set this value too high.  If you are not overclocking, your CPU should be expected to handle 100% load just fine, in which case this feature would be more about improving heat, noise, and energy management at lower values.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Load Threshold (Default: 49)<br>This is the CPU usage percentage at which the stressed power state limit is triggered.  This is extra useful when temperature sensors are unavailable or when temperature sensors do not respond fast enough.  This threshold works in conjunction with the boost reservoir.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Temperature Target (Default: 70)<br>This is the temperature at which the stressed power state limit is triggered.  This target ignores the boost reservoir and tries to reduce the CPU temperature until it is below the target.  CPUs already have similar mechanisms built in.  However, when overclocking these mechanisms tend to be disabled, save for some last-ditch temperature controls which tend to limit only clock speed and not voltage.  Even when not overclocking, these features are typically nonconfigurable, so this setting gives you more flexibility to efficiently keep temperatures low and noise down without sacrificing performance under light loads.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Temperature Critical Limit (Default: 75)<br>This should be higher than the Chill Boost Temperature Target.  It works similarly, but can make more drastic voltage reductions by dropping to an even lower power state.  If you are overclocking, this would be your last line of defense outside of built-in emergency thermal limiters which may wait to kick in until as much as 100C.  While the default is 75C, I am not saying that 75C is safe, but it surely is a lot safer than a 100C hardware limiter.  Depending on your hardware, if you are reaching 75C without overclocking, this may be evidence that your cooling system is inadequate, installed improperly, or failing.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Load Temperature Skew (Default: 5)<br>This setting reduces your temperature allowances based on load.  When this setting is 5 and the load is 100%, the temperature target and critical limit will be reduced by 5.  At 0% load, the reduction would be 0.  This allows the tool to respond faster than by simply going by the temperature sensors alone.  This setting can allow the CPU to bounce back to high performance quicker when load is reduced.  The setting also enables the tool to catch temperature spikes quicker.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Temperature Sensor Anti Glitch (Default: True)<br>Temperature sensors can be glitchy sometimes.  This is a very basic protection mechanism which ignores negative temperature values coming from the temperature sensor.  On my system, I was getting odd temperature spikes during load tests because the sensor was sending back negative numbers from time to time, causing my temperature protections to not work correctly.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Stressed Max Power State (Default: 70)<br>This setting is a power state limit for dealing with load or temperature under stressed conditions.  Depending on your hardware, the optimum value for this setting may vary wildly.  The auto-calibration feature will select the power state with the second highest voltage, which usually offers both high efficiency and decent performance, but you could use the information from the auto-calibration table to optimize this value yourself.  Lower values should reach more conservative power states, but the power states follow a step function that varies by hardware, so you have to lower the value enough to reach the next step before any actual change happens.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Critical Max Power State (Default: 0)<br>This setting is a power state limit for dealing with load or temperature under critical conditions.  The value 0 will enable the maximum voltage drop available.  Higher values may still be effective without reducing performance as much.  Processors have their own built-in protection mechanisms, but this setting can offer another layer of protection, which can come in especially handy when overclocking as some hardware protection mechanisms may be disabled.  Auto-calibration will always set this value to 0 for maximum safety, but depending on your hardware you may be able to select a higher value which is stable under constant maximum load, in which case I would recommend setting this to the most efficient power state shown in the auto-calibration table.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Safety Mechanism (Default: False)<br>The Chill Boost Safety Mechanism exists in case you are using Chill Boost to thermally stabilize an overclock, so that your system does not go full throttle and crash before Chill Boost is able to run.  Chill Boost only functions correctly while the tool is running.  This mechanism attempts to leave your computer in the reduced power state if the computer crashes until the tool is running again.  This feature could potentially cause Chill Boost to limit power more often than intended.  Also, with this setting enabled, your power plan will not be reverted back to your normal power plan when you exit Simplode Suite normally, so you might have poor performance when the tool is not running and not remember why.  Many computers reset their power plan on restart for whatever reason, and this safety mechanism will not work correctly in this case, though you could lower the maximum CPU power state in the power plan to which your system reverts so that you can still have the same sort of protection.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Efficiency Locker (Default: True)<br>Chill Boost Efficiency Locker blocks background and low priority apps from switching your processor into performance mode.  When a processor is in performance mode, efficiency losses can be enormous, leading to more heat, more noise, and possibly shorter device lifespans.  We like performance, though, for things we are focused on, but often times a background process will put your device into performance mode unnecessarily.  The heat can even reduce the performance of your foreground app, so this feature can even increase perceived performance.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Efficiency Locker Thread Load Threshold (Default: 0.5)<br>When the efficiency locker is enabled, this threshold determines when it is active.  Other efficiency locker settings change specific aspects of this behavior, but in general the computer will be allowed to run at full throttle when the application you are currently focused on has at least one thread that is trying to use the CPU more than this threshold.  Getting close to 100% thread load can be quite difficult because time spent waiting for resources does not count.  With that in mind, you may need to keep this number unituitively low considering a thread at 60% load can still be starved for more processor power.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Efficiency Locker Mode (Default: 1)<br>Performance Optimized: In this mode, the feature will not engage until it has detected unnecessary boosting caused by background apps.  Apps that you want to boost will be able to boost without delay.<br>Efficiency Optimized: In this mode, the feature will block boosting until it detects that an app that you want to boost needs boosting.  This mode may delay boosting slightly.<br> - 0<br> - 1<br></li><li>Chill Boost Efficiency Locker Multithread Enhancement (Default: True)<br>When enabled alongside the Chill Boost Efficiency Locker, it can more accurately detect when multithreaded apps have headroom for efficiency improvement.  Sometimes multithreaded applications have exotic thread configurations which make it difficult to determine if they are facing a thread speed bottleneck.  For applications where the total load is less than the thread load threshold, we can easily determine that we have room to increase efficiency.  However, when total load is higher than the thread load threshold, threads could be cascading information to each other making them behave as a single thread with similar efficiency penalties, and if we judged simply be looking at the threads individually, we would incorrectly enter efficiency mode, noticeably reducing the performance of the app.  By analyzing process CPU usage at small enough intervals, the tool is able to see moments when an app is completely caught up.  The duration and cadence of these moments can be used to determine how much room we have for efficiency improvements without reducing performance even when threads are interacting in unknown ways.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Efficiency Locker Multithread Enhancement Threshold (Default: 0.9)<br>This is the threshold at which the Efficiency Locker Multithread Enhancement will consider the focused app busy enough to need maximum performance.  To reduce the chance that a busy application may be throttled, the focus app will be considered busy from when it is triggered until the value falls below 0.5 if this threshold is above 0.5.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Efficiency Locker Max Power State (Default: 100)<br>When the Chill Boost Efficiency Locker activates, the max power state will be limited to this value.  The default value of 99 is usually a substantial improvement in efficiency on its own, though the most efficient power state is likely lower than 99.  The Auto Calibration feature can set this value to most efficient power state available.  The efficiency locker may reduce the power state even lower than this setting depending on the other efficiency locker settings.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Efficiency Locker Frame Drop Resistance (Default: 3)<br>The efficiency locker can sometimes cause unnecessary frame drops if it detects a brief period of favorable conditions.  Higher values in this setting will increase the amount of time that the efficiency locker will wait before kicking in, reducing the chances that it will kick in at a bad time and cause a frame drop.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Efficiency Locker Strict Processes (Default: )<br>These processes will only be allowed to run while the efficiency locker is active and not above the strict process energy state threshold.  Use the file names of each process, separated by commas or new lines.  While processes in the list are in the background and the maximum power state is above this value, they will be completely unresponsive.  While processes in the list are in the foreground, the maximum power state will be limited to the threshold.  This allows you to run selected processes at maximum efficiency while minimizing any negative impact on other foreground processes.  There is no way to configure processes to run at different voltages simultaneously, so the only way to ensure efficiency for heavy background processes is to allow them to run only while the voltage is limited.  Chill Boost Efficiency Locker offers the unique capability to recognize times when efficiency must be sacrificed for foreground performance, and can suspend and resume selected heavy background processes in real time to maximize both foreground performance and background efficiency.  CPU based video encoders and cryptocurrency miners are examples of programs which can benefit greatly from this feature, allowing you to leave them running while working on other things or even gaming, all while keeping your CPU cool and on demand foreground performance high.  You might want to use this with virtual machines, but be advised that some virtualizers may intercept input with hooks, which can cause severe input lag when suspended, though you may be able to disable the input hooks in the respective settings of your virtualizer.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Efficiency Locker Strict Process Energy State Threshold (Default: 89)<br>This is the power state threshold that efficiency locker strict processes will be allowed to run.<br></li><li>Base Min Processor State (Default: 0)<br>This setting is from your power scheme.  Unless overridden, the tool will obey this setting.  If this is not set to 0, some Chill Boost features might be inneffective because the tool may not be able to lower the value enough to make a difference.<br></li><li>Base Max Processor State (Default: 100)<br>This setting is from your power scheme.  Unless overridden, the tool will obey this setting.  If this is not set to 100, some Chill Boost features might be inneffective because the most impactful processor state change is usually the jump between 99 and 100.  A jump between 90 and 99 might do absolutely nothing, for example.<br></li><li>Override Min Max Powerstate (Default: True)<br>Overriding the minimum power state can increase the range at which Chill Boost is allowed to operate.  This lets you use all of the settings of a more restricted power scheme, but still run the processor down to this level based on your other Chill Boost settings.  This can prevent confusion with Chill Boost appearing to not work when it is actually just obeying your existing power plan settings.<br></li><li>Min Power State Override (Default: 0)<br></li><li>Max Power State Override (Default: 100)<br>Overriding the maximum power state can increase the range at which Chill Boost is allowed to operate.  This lets you use all of the settings of a more restricted power scheme, but still run the processor up to this level based on your other Chill Boost settings.  This can prevent confusion with Chill Boost appearing to not work when it is actually just obeying your existing power plan settings.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Efficiency Estimation Voltage Exponent (Default: 2.6)<br>When using the chill boost auto calibration feature, efficiency estimations are used to select optimum power levels for various features.  The power estimation formula looks like this:<br>Efficiency = Clock ^ ClockEstimationExponent / Voltage ^ VoltageEstimationExponent<br>I first thought that the value 2 would work fine, because increasing the voltage with the same resistance will also increase the current proportionally.  However, processors are more complicated than that, so I played with it and selected a default value that gave me better results.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Efficiency Estimation Clock Exponent (Default: 0.15)<br>When using the chill boost auto calibration feature, efficiency estimations are used to select optimum power levels for various features.  The power estimation formula looks like this:<br>Efficiency = Clock ^ ClockEstimationExponent / Voltage ^ VoltageEstimationExponent<br>I first thought that the value 1 would work fine, because getting more work done with the same amount of power would increase efficiency proportionally.  However, processors are more complicated than that, so I played with it and selected a default value that gave me better results.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Efficiency Estimation Minimum Runs (Default: 5)<br>When using the chill boost auto calibration feature, power points are checked in a binary search pattern.  Different power points get tested different amounts of time, and all of the data is used to provide a better estimation.  Some power points may only be tested once or a small number of times in this fashion.  This setting will make sure that each power point is tested at least this number of times.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Calibration Rate (Default: 0.5)<br>This is the maximum number of samples per second that the auto calibration feature will take.  If this value is too high, the tool may pick up mismatched samples.  If the value is too low, auto calibration may take a long time.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Calibration Simultaneous Multi Thread (Default: True)<br>If enabled, SMT (also known has hyper-threading on Intel) will be used during calibration.  This can improve the accuracy of the efficiency data by taking into account this capability.  Including SMT also allows higher core power usage during testing which can improve precision, as smaller power usage values are more difficult to measure.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Calibration Cores (Default: 1)<br>Using this option, you can run the auto calibration with as many cores as you like.  Calibration is more stressful on your hardware with more cores, and testing too many cores may adversely affect system and tool performance.  Testing additional cores can improve the quality of the measurements taken during calibration.<br></li><li>Use Priority Chill Boost Process (Default: True)<br>Runs Chill Boost features in a separate priority process to ensure that it can work even if other priority processes on your computer are hogging all of the resources.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Process Priority (Default: Real Time)<br>Select the desired priority for the Chill Boost process.  I recommend setting this to &quot;Real Time&quot;.  If any other process has higher priority than the Chill Boost process, Chill Boost may be blocked from doing its job by that process.<br> - Normal<br> - Idle<br> - High<br> - Real Time: Real Time priority processes will generally get all of the processing time they want, and if they want too much it can cause your system to become unstable.<br> - Below Normal<br> - Above Normal<br></li><li>Chill Boost Hour Meter (Default: 0)<br>This is the number of hours Chill Boost has been enabled.  For performance and hardware longevity, updates at around a 6 minute interval.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Optimized Busy Hours (Default: 0)<br></li><li>Chill Boost Optimized Core Watt Hours (Default: 0)<br></li><li>Chill Boost Processor Busy Hours (Default: 0)<br></li><li>Chill Boost Core Watt Hours (Default: 0)<br></li><li>Estimated Watt Hours Saved (Default: 0)<br>The estimated watt hours saved works by comparing the average energy efficiency when Chill Boost is limiting the power state to the average energy efficiency when Chill Boost is not limiting the power state.  As a result, you may see weird behavior such as the value rising when the power state is not limited, and this is because the average efficiency changes as new data arrives.  The other thing to consider about the watt hours saved, is that in most cases, the majority of the energy your computer is consuming is not in CPU cores, but in things like your GPU, monitors, RAM, and processor IO, and Chill Boost only helps optimise your CPU core energy consumption, so what might be an apparant 50% savings shown by this value will have a lesser impact on battery life, for example.  That being said, if you use Chill Boost long enough, the savings does add up, and depending on how you use your computer, the savings may actually pay for your product license.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Borderless Fullscreen (\u21f1\u21f2)</h2>Attempts to make the current window into a borderless full screen window.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Warning: May cause graphical glitches and potentially even functionality glitches on some programs.  You should save work before trying this for the first time on an app.</li></ul>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Borderless Full Screen Interaction Tweak (Default: True)<br>Some programs try to get smart and do things when they detect they are in borderless full screen mode.  In my experiences, these things are usually detrimental.  This tweak will set the pixels off by one, which can avoid this in the cases I saw.  If the programs you are using behave fine without this tweak, maybe keep it off to get a bit closer to pixel perfection.<br></li><li>Borderless Full Screen Full Window Fix (Default: False)<br>When enabled, borderless full screen will not attempt to remove the borders, but instead will try size the program in such a way that the borders would be outside of your screen.  Some programs try to fight the normal mode, but will work with this enabled.<br></li><li>Borderless Full Screen Span All Screens (Default: False)<br>Span all screens when using the borderless full screen feature.<br></li><li>Borderless Full Screen Horizontal Overscan (Default: 1)<br>When switching to borderless full screen, attempt to overscan/underscan horizontally by this ratio.  Some programs may resist overscan, but underscan should work more often.<br></li><li>Borderless Full Screen Vertical Overscan (Default: 1)<br>When switching to borderless full screen, attempt to overscan/underscan vertically by this ratio.  Some programs may resist overscan, but underscan should work more often.<br></li><li>Borderless Full Screen Lock (Default: True)<br>When enabled, programs that have been set to borderless full screen will automatically reset to full screen if changed.  This is helpful for some applications which change their sizes and positions for strange reasons.  You will need to toggle the borderless full screen off for it to unlock.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tiles (\u25eb)</h2>Enables the ability to create unlimited tile groups and unlimited tiles per group.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>This entry is for information and licensing only, see related actions for how to use the feature.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Group Left (\u21d0)</h2>Tile the target window with the next window to the left.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>When in a group, attempt to swap the active window with the window to the left.<br></li><li>When not in a group, attempt to join with the nearest window to the left.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Group Top (\u21d1)</h2>Tile the target window with the window above.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>When in a group, attempt to swap the active window with the window above.<br></li><li>When not in a group, attempt to join with the nearest window above.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Group Right (\u21d2)</h2>Tile the target window with the next window to the right.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>When in a group, attempt to swap the active window with the window to the right.<br></li><li>When not in a group, attempt to join with the nearest window to the right.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Group Bottom (\u21d3)</h2>Tile the target window with the window below.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>When in a group, attempt to swap the active window with the window below.<br></li><li>When not in a group, attempt to join with the nearest window below.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unjoin (\ud83d\udd17\u238c)</h2>Remove window from its current group.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tiling Window Manager (\u25eb\u2699)</h2>The Tiling Window Manager feature enables you to link your windows together in any configuration of tiles and tabs with persistence.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>As you make adjustments to individual tiles and tabs, such as minimizing, maximizing, moving, and resizing, the tool will dynamically adjust the rest of the windows in the group according to the tiling and tabbing you have configured.<br></li><li>This feature is actually more of a tiling/stacking/tabbing/hybrid window manager.  It enables you to easily use tiling, tabbing, and stacking window management strategies together.<br></li><li>With the full version, you can build multiple workspaces with unlimited tiles and tabs that will persist until you shut down your PC.  You can quickly switch between the workspaces using standard maximize, minimize, and restore functions.  You can even access multiple workspaces simultaneously or join the workspaces themselves together.  This provides much more flexibility over traditional workspace switchers that essentially just divide your apps into entirely separate virtual monitors that are confusing and easy to forget, and may even cause your work to seemingly disappear without a trace when they fail.<br></li><li>With the lite version, you can have a total of one tab group and two active tiles.  Creating additional tab groups or tiles will undo previous ones.</li></ul>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Tiling Window Manager Enabled (Default: True)<br>When enabled, the tiling window manager will dynamically adjust your windows according to the tiling and tabbing configurations you have enabled.  You can disable the feature to pause the tiling and tabbing interactions, and reenable to resume.<br></li><li>Window Hover Linking (Default: True)<br>When enabled, moving a window over top of another window will cause a window linking menu to appear.  To use the menu, hold the cursor over a menu button until the loading indicator completes and then release the cursor.  To aid in selecting a window, each window will only be highlighted once per window drag, so if the wrong window gets highlighted, simply drag your cursor outside of that window and the next time you move your cursor over your selected window, the previously highlighted window will be ignored.<br></li><li>Virtual Maximize Group (Default: True)<br>When maximizing a window that is part of a group, spread the group's windows over the screen instead of performing a standard operating system maximize operation.<br></li><li>Window Join Security (Default: Block)<br>This setting can protect against an unsecured app joining itself to a secured app.  If an unsecured app can do this, it can potentially relocate a secured app in front of your mouse right before you click causing a click on a secured application.  This would be a very complicated way to attack your computer, so it would be a very unlikely attack vector, though I still can't let you take that risk by default.<br> - Block: When selected, attempts to join a window to a window with a higher security level are blocked.  (Safest)<br> - Allow: When selected, attempts to join a window to a window with a higher security level are allowed.  <br></li><li>DPI Zone Fix (Default: True)<br>When enabled, tries to avoid conditions which cause unexpected behavior on multiple monitor systems with DPI differences.<br></li><li>Window Border Spacing Adjustment (Default: 1)<br>With this option, you can adjust how much the tool accounts for window borders when moving windows in groups.<br></li><li>Mitigate Windows Explorer Size Crash Min Width (Default: 300)<br>When performing certain operations on a Windows Explorer window that is below a certain size, Windows Explorer may crash.  To prevent this from happening, the tool will try to avoid setting Windows Explorer windows below this size.  You may not actually need this enabled, as some users do not experience the issue, but I have enabled it by default because it is a pretty bad first impression of my product if you happen to run into this bug immediately.  Set the value to 0 to disable.  The exact minimum size that the problem occurs also seems to vary, so you may need to raise this if explorer windows are glitching out, or alternatively you could lower it if you want smaller windows and are not experiencing the bug.  The bug is not specific to Simplode Suite Long Debug, but the mitigation feature can in some cases prevent the bug from happening even when performing operations unrelated to the tool.  It does this by detecting when a Windows Explorer window is resized, and increasing the size if it happens to be too small.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tabs (\ud83d\udcc1)</h2>Enables the ability to create unlimited tab groups with unlimited tabs.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>This entry is for information and licensing only, see related actions for how to use the feature.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Group Tab (Tab)</h2>This feature will cause the active window to join together with the window behind it into a tabbed group.<br><br>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Tab Rearrange (Default: True)<br>When enabled, you can reorder tabs of tab grouped windows by clicking and dragging the tab over its neighboring tabs.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mouse Accelerator (\ud83d\uddb0\ud83d\udca8)</h2>This is a customizable mouse accelerator.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>This accelerator works without any DLL injections, so there is reduced chance that a game might falsely identify it as a cheat.  However, unlike driver level modification, this tool makes no attempt to hide the source of the input, so it would be easy for a game to see that the mouse input was modified.<br></li><li>Some games disable operating system mouse acceleration but will still be accelerated by this custom accelerator.<br></li><li>The custom curve formula looks something like this: \u2211(m*v^p) with v being cursor velocity, m being each multiplier setting and p being each power setting.  The custom curve formula may be expanded in future versions, as it does not provide as much curve customization capability as I would like.<br></li><li>The mouse acceleration features are intended for cases when you can't find a direct mouse speed that is both fast enough and precise enough for your needs.  I recommend getting used to direct 1:1 input with no acceleration if possible, so you will pretty much be able to use the same muscle memory everywhere, even on devices that do not have this tool installed.<br></li><li>I believe that major operating systems each use their own signature mouse acceleration settings primarily to help lock you in to their system.  Once you get used to their mouse acceleration, attempting to switch to a competitor will feel weird and possibly help persuade you to give up and return.<br></li><li>Using any input modification features puts you at risk with multiplayer gaming.  Each game has its own rules on where it draws the line between cheating and not cheating.  Some don't care, some will kick you, and some might ban you.  This product does its part in cooperating with anti-cheat software by not hiding the source of input, so any game could easily ignore injected input if programmed to do so.<br></li><li>This feature has a low risk of being considered cheating in multiplayer games.  When it comes to aiming, games designers are typically worried about automatic aiming and precision firing tools which use live information gathered from the game you are playing to give you an advantage in the game.  This feature, on the other hand, is really just changing the behavior of your mouse, using only information from prior mouse movements.</li></ul>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Mouse Accelerator (Default: False)<br>Enables the Mouse Accelerator<br></li><li>Mouse Acceleration Confirmation (Default: False)<br>This is used to record whether or not you have tested your mouse acceleration settings.  If you don't confirm your settings, the mouse accelerator will automatically shut off after a delay to prevent you from losing access to your mouse accidently.  Once you confirm your settings you can toggle them on and off without confirmation.  Any changes will require a new confirmation.<br></li><li>Mouse Slider Right Mouse Button (Default: False)<br>When enabled, it causes the mouse to slide according to recent movement while the right mouse button is pressed.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator Input Multiplier (Default: 1)<br>This is a simple input multiplier for the custom mouse accelerator.  This could be helpful if you change the hardware DPI of your mouse and want a simple way to get your old curve behavior back.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator Output Multiplier (Default: 1)<br>This is a simple output multiplier for the custom mouse accelerator.  This could be helpful if you like your acceleration curve feel, but just want it to be faster or slower.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator Minimum Acceleration Ratio (Default: 1)<br>If the custom acceleration values are low enough, the accelerator may completely block some mouse events from being registered at all.  The value '1' will ensure that the mouse will never be slower than having no acceleration at all.  Lower values can enable you to slow down the mouse passed normal limits, where some mouse input events will not be forwarded to other programs.  Higher values will act as a direct multiplier to mouse input.  This multiplier only acts when the mouse acceleration parameters do not have greater acceleration than this value.  This value puts a floor on your mouse accelerator curve.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator Maximum Acceleration Ratio (Default: 3)<br>This setting can put a ceiling on your mouse accelerator curve.  The mouse acceleration ratio will not be allowed to be greater than this value.  You can use this to construct your own Precision Twitch acceleration profile, as your mouse will have a one to one correspondence with the cursor for movements above this limit.  Set it to 0 to disable it.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator Curve Type (Default: Custom)<br> - Custom: Set your mouse acceleration curve to a custom trinomial.<br> - Precision Twitch: This feature forces a mouse acceleration curve that gives 1:1 mouse behavior for twitch movements, but enables additional precision for very slow mouse movements.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator M 1 (Default: 1)<br>Multiplier 1<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator P 1 (Default: 1)<br>Power (Exponent) 1<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator M 2 (Default: 0.1)<br>Multiplier 2<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator P 2 (Default: 2)<br>Power (Exponent) 2<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator M 3 (Default: 0)<br>Multiplier 3<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator P 3 (Default: 3)<br>Power (Exponent) 3<br></li><li>Mouse Precision Twitch Threshold (Default: 3)<br>This option determines where to draw the line between mouse movements that should have 1:1 behavior and movements with enhanced precision.  Higher values will apply enhanced precision to greater speed mouse movements, where lower values will make slower movements have 1:1 behavior.<br></li><li>Mouse Precision Twitch Multiplier (Default: 3)<br>This option controls how much twitch movements will be multiplied.  Higher values here increase the difference between twitch movements and enhanced precision movements.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator Max Input Frames Per Second (Default: 512)<br>Lower values reduce load on the processer caused by the accelerator.  Higher values can increase the precision and responsiveness of the accelerator.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator Max Output Frames Per Second (Default: 512)<br>Too high of values can make weird things behave sluggishly, like resizing windows.  You can manually type in higher values than the slider will allow for mice that poll at faster rates.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator Adaptive Mode (Default: False)<br>Basically, this is a hybrid approach between having mouse acceleration and not having mouse acceleration, where you get closer to the feel of 1:1 mouse movements than with traditional mouse acceleration, but you still get the acceleration properties allowing for additional precision when moving the mouse slowly and additional speed when moving the mouse quickly.  It works by smoothly transitioning between linear acceleration and your chosen curve depending on how fast you have been moving the mouse in a recent time window.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator Adaptive Speed Window (Default: 1)<br>The adaptive speed window is the period of time which the accelerator will look at previous mouse movements to establish an acceleration baseline.  Higher numbers increase the amount of time it takes for the acceleration factor to reduce.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator Adaptive Speed Rise Modifier (Default: 1)<br>Values higher than 1 will cause the adaptive accelerator to respond more quickly to increases in acceleration.  If you set this value less than one, the adaptive speed fall off will be faster than the rise.<br></li><li>Override OS Mouse Settings on Launch (Default: False)<br>If enabled, this tool will override operating system settings for mouse speed and acceleration upon launch.  This does not affect custom acceleration settings.  This option is mainly for forcing your saved settings in case they get overwritten while the tool is closed.<br></li><li>OS Mouse Speed (Default: 10)<br>As this value increases, the speed of the cursor increases.  This value is in effect even when custom acceleration is in use.  If you have a DPI selectable mouse, I suggest you keep the DPI all the way up, and use these configurations to make the speed manageable.  This way you will get the maximum amount of precision out of your hardware.  Lack of precision may cause your cursor to routinely skip pixels even when moving at the slowest possible speed.<br></li><li>OS Mouse Acceleration (Default: True)<br>If enabled, the operating system will use its own mouse acceleration mechanism.<br></li><li>OS Mouse Acceleration Speed (Default: 1)<br>Raising the value seems to make the cursor even slower at low speeds and faster at high speeds.<br></li><li>OS Mouse Acceleration Threshold 1 (Default: 6)<br>Controls the threshold at which the cursor ought to be moving at double speed.<br></li><li>OS Mouse Acceleration Threshold 2 (Default: 10)<br>Controls the threshold at which the cursor ought to be moving at quadruple speed.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator Always Intercept Mode (Default: False)<br>Intercept mode can increase performance of some weird things, like resizing windows.  Also, it can make the acceleration smoother for speed multipliers less than 1.  When enabled, standard mouse messages are intercepted and included in the mouse accelerator calculations, thus reducing the total number of messages being sent in many cases.  Unfortunately, this optimization can also cause the mouse to go unresponsive if Simplode Suite Long Debug is too busy.  Another potential drawback of this setting is that the mouse curve may not behave exactly the same inside some games as it does on the desktop.  A major advantage of the custom mouse accelerator is the ability to obtain the same acceleration curve in multiple environments, because when the behavior does not match it can interfere with muscle memory.  So, if your applications perform well with this feature off, you may be better off disabling this feature so that you can avoid losing the advantages of a uniform mouse feel.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator Dynamic Intercept Mode (Default: True)<br>Dynamic intercept mode recognizes some specific scenarios where intercept mode might greatly improve performance, like resizing windows, and will temporarily enable the effects of the intercept mode.  This can also avoid the drawbacks of intercept mode for the most part.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator Dynamic Performance Optimization Factor (Default: 2)<br>Some types of operations have been found to perform poorly when given mouse input at high rates, such as resizing and moving windows.  With values greater than one, the output framerate will be divided to improve performance during these operations.  This option goes well with dynamic intercept mode.<br></li><li>Use Priority Input Process (Default: True)<br>Runs input features in a separate priority process to avoid input lag.<br></li><li>Input Process Priority (Default: Real Time)<br>Select the desired priority for the input process.  I think &quot;Real Time&quot; will get you the best results, but perhaps you have a different sort of environment where it is not allowed or you are just uncomfortable with &quot;Real Time&quot;.<br> - Normal<br> - Idle<br> - High<br> - Real Time: Real Time priority processes will generally get all of the processing time they want, and if they want too much it can cause your system to become unstable.<br> - Below Normal<br> - Above Normal</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mouse Wheel Accelerator (\ud83d\uddb0\u21f3\ud83d\udca8)</h2>This is a simple customizable mouse wheel accelerator.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>By default, mouse wheel speed doubles at level 1, triples at level 2, and quadruples at level 3, but you can configure these multipliers.<br></li><li>Using any input modification features puts you at risk with multiplayer gaming.  Each game has its own rules on where it draws the line between cheating and not cheating.  Some don't care, some will kick you, and some might ban you.  This product does its part in cooperating with anti-cheat software by not hiding the source of input, so any game could easily ignore injected input if programmed to do so.<br></li><li>This feature is generally not particularly useful for cheating in multiplayer games, but still faces some risk of being considered cheating.  In order to work correctly, the feature may produce 2 mouse wheel events for 1 hardware event, which technically does not comply with the common rule of 1 user input to 1 game input.</li></ul>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Mouse Wheel Accelerator (Default: False)<br>Enables the Mouse Wheel Accelerator<br></li><li>Notches Per Second for Level 1 Acceleration (Default: 8)<br></li><li>Mouse Wheel Accelerator Level 1 Multiplier (Default: 2)<br>If the mouse wheel notches per second is between the level 1 threshold and the level 2 threshold, this multiplier is used.<br></li><li>Notches Per Second for Level 2 Acceleration (Default: 12)<br></li><li>Mouse Wheel Accelerator Level 2 Multiplier (Default: 3)<br>If the mouse wheel notches per second is between the level 2 threshold and the level 3 threshold, this multiplier is used.<br></li><li>Notches Per Second for Level 3 Acceleration (Default: 16)<br></li><li>Mouse Wheel Accelerator Level 3 Multiplier (Default: 4)<br>If the mouse wheel notches per second is greater than the level 3 threshold, this multiplier is used.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Virtual Touch Screen (\ud83d\udd90\ud83d\uddb5)</h2>Enable virtual touch screen.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>This feature is experimental and may not work as expected.  It requires the Kinect V2 hardware and compatible adapter for your system.  Beware of Kinect system requirements.<br></li><li>The Kinect V2 has been discontinued, but you can still find them at affordable prices along with PC power adapters of questionable authenticity.  I have looked into supporting other depth sensing products, but the ones I have encountered simply do not produce data of sufficient quality to use my algorithms.<br></li><li>You can get around the need for an adapter if you are capable of soldering on your own 12-volt power jack.  A cheap generic 12-volt power adapter may potentially cause problems with your device, but my troubles usually seem to be weak signal and electromagnetic interference.  By soldering on your own power jack, your data connection can be simplified to a single data cable, which is a far superior solution with regards to electromagnetic interference and signal resistance.  Using the official adapter, the signal has to flow through an additional data cable, an additional junction, and two additional metal to metal contacts, resulting in increased resistance and interference on the signal.  If you are afraid to solder the power jack on yourself, you might be able to find one at an online marketplace already done for you.<br></li><li>My personal experience is that most USB 3.0 hosts will not work correctly with the Kinect V2.  I have seen success with Renesis chipset USB 3.0 PCIe cards as well as Intel motherboard USB 3.0 ports.  The Renesis USB 3.0 PCIe cards I have used only require a PCIe3.0x1 slot, but I have only found it to be compatible with the Kinect when plugged into my x8 and x16 slots for unknown reasons, and even then, some of my x8 and x16 slots also did not work.</li></ul>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Virtual Touch Enabled (Default: False)<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Dead Zone (Default: 2)<br>Raising this value reduces the amount of shaking in virtual touches.<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Strictness (Default: 1)<br>This value controls how strict the tool is in tracking virtual touch information.<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Infrared Correction (Default: 1)<br>Infrared brightness information is used to filter out bad depth data.  Setting this to 0 effectively disables this feature.  Higher values make the infrared check more strict.  If you set this too high, the tool may lose track of your fingers more often.  If you set this too low, phantom touches may be triggered.<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Click Engage Threshold (Default: 1)<br>Reducing this value makes it easier to click with the virtual touch screen, but may increase the probability that you have unintentional clicks.<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Click Disengage Threshold (Default: 1)<br>Reducing this value makes it easier to release a click with the virtual touch screen, but may increase the probability that your click is released unintentionally.<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Click Depth Overlay (Default: False)<br>This overlay helps in diagnosing problems with using the virtual touch feature.  You can use it to see if you are too close or too far from the sensor.<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Camera Margin (Default: 330,180,310,180)<br>You can use the camera margin to zoom in the camera.  The camera does not match up perfectly to the depth sensor, so the sides may not work for touch detection.  By increasing the margin, you shrink the field of view of the camera which in turn can cut out non-functional areas.<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Sensor Margin (Default: 20,90,65,90)<br>The depth sensor may pick up lots of bad data near its edges.  Increasing the size of the margins can avoid bad edge data.  When used in conjunction with a properly sized camera margin, you can still touch the edges of the screen.<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Front Overlay (Default: True)<br>This overlay attempts to appear in front of all other windows.  This is almost necessary, as it shows you where your hands are pointing before you activate virtual touch detection.  This setting may not go into effect until you turn virtual touch off and on.<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Overlay Opacity (Default: 0.2)<br>Controls how transparent the front camera overlay is.  This setting may not go into effect until you turn virtual touch off and on.<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Back Underlay (Default: True)<br>The underlay has similar purposes to the overlay, except it tries to sit behind your windows, including your desktop icons.  This is more for style, as having a mostly transparent front layer and a fully opaque back layer gives the stylistic impression that you are behind a futuristic semi-transparent touchscreen.  Aside from its style purposes, it also can give you a better view of what you are doing without taking away screen real estate from other things, so I'd say leave it on if it isn't slowing you down.  This setting may not go into effect until you turn virtual touch off and on.  Only works when front overlay is also enabled.<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Zone (Default: 0,0,0,0)<br>This setting allows you to specify the coordinates on screen for the virtual touch zone.  If you have multiple monitors, the sliders might not get you to the values you need, in which case you will need to type in the values.  If you set all to 0, it will default to fill one of your monitors.<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Pause (Default: False)<br>When enabled, touch input from the virtual touch screen will be paused.<br></li><li>Touch Glitch Fix (Default: True)<br>Disables stylus handling in the tool GUI.  For almost a decade, users of WPF applications face issues with touch screens randomly not working in specific applications because of an apparant bug in stylus handling that has not been addressed.<br></li><li>Use Priority Virtual Touch Process (Default: True)<br>Runs virtual touch in a separate priority process to increase responsiveness.<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Process Priority (Default: Normal)<br>Select the desired priority for the virtual touch process.  I would be careful about selecting something higher than normal in this case, as the current algorithm can heavily use the CPU.  This process split is just as much designed to protect the rest of the tool from this feature as it is to protect the feature from the rest of the tool.<br> - Normal<br> - Idle<br> - High<br> - Real Time: Real Time priority processes will generally get all of the processing time they want, and if they want too much it can cause your system to become unstable.<br> - Below Normal<br> - Above Normal</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Glass Apps (\ud83d\udd8c\ud83d\udc7b)</h2>The Glass Apps feature will automatically make most windows have varying degrees of transparency depending on a variety of customizeable factors so that you can see through apps that you are not focused on.<br><br>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Glass Apps (Default: False)<br>When enabled, causes dynamic transparency in apps based on various configurable factors, including focus, prior focus, mouse position, and application type.<br></li><li>Glass Apps Default App Opacity (Default: 0.75)<br>Adjusts the transparency of the windows which are not already affected by another transparency option.  Values closer to 1 are less transparent.  Values closer to 0 are more transparent.<br></li><li>Glass Apps Current App Opacity (Default: 1)<br>Adjusts the transparency of the focused window.  Values closer to 1 are less transparent.  Values closer to 0 are more transparent.<br></li><li>Glass Apps Previous App Opacity (Default: 0.9)<br>Adjusts the transparency of the previously focused window.  Values closer to 1 are less transparent.

Currently this feature only checks for an active audio session, and if found assumes there is video, so it will detect audio only windows as playing video also, and potentially not detect windows that are playing videos with no audio.

The application positioning will attempt to stay on a single monitor if possible.  This ensures that newly focused windows will appear on the monitor you are currently looking at, assuming that is where your cursor is.<br></li><li>Smart Focus General Apps From Taskbar (Default: True)<br>If you want your taskbar to trigger Smart Focus, enable this setting.<br></li><li>Smart Focus General Apps From Taskbar Preview Thumbnails (Default: Disabled)<br>Controls how Smart Focus behaves when clicking on a taskbar preview thumbnail.  When hovering over a taskbar preview thumbnail, the operating system illuminates the window that will be focused, which may draw your attention away from the cursor and to the window.<br> - Disabled<br> - Move Window to Cursor: The window will be moved to the cursor, which may be a bit jarring after the target window has been illuminated.<br> - Move Cursor to Title Bar: The cursor will automatically be moved to the title bar of the newly focused window, which will let you quickly grab it and move it if you want.<br> - Move Cursor To Center: The cursor will automatically be moved to the center of the newly focused window, which is likely where you are already looking, saving you a bit of time.<br></li><li>Smart Focus Pull Factor (Default: 1)<br>When set to 1, will center Smart Focused windows on the cursor.  When set to 0, will bring the closest edge of a Smart Focused window to the cursor.  Values in between will produce a margin effect.  This option does not effect some windows with special positioning.<br></li><li>Smart Focus Full Screen Apps (Default: False)<br>If disabled, full screen applications will be ignored by Smart Focus.<br></li><li>Smart Focus Task Switcher (Default: True)<br>The operating system's task switcher appears when pressing [Alt]+[Tab].  Enable this option to automatically move the task switcher to the monitor your mouse is on.<br></li><li>Smart Focus Start Menu (Default: True)<br>On standard multiple monitor setups, the start menu always launches on your primary monitor.  Enable this setting to dynamically position the start menu based on the location of your cursor.  This mainly helps when using the operating system key to launch the start menu, as manually clicking on the start button will naturally put the start menu where it would normally be.  The operating system also has a setting which allows you to place a taskbar on each monitor, and if you use that setting then you can open up the start menu on each screen without this tool so long as you are willing to have multiple taskbars.  That setting can be found by right clicking on the taskbar and going into &quot;Taskbar settings&quot;.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cursor Finder (\ud83d\uddb0?)</h2>Helps you keep track of your cursor.

To balance all microphones, you should aim for a value that the smallest signal microphone will still hit.<br></li><li>Microphone Manager Temporal Static Reduction (Default: 1)<br>At values greater than 0, the microphone manager will reduce the volume of the microphone when it detects periods of silence.  This reduces light background noise, static, and hiss when you are not speaking.  If the value is set too high, the feature may function incorrectly and cause problems with the audio signal.<br></li><li>Microphone Manager Temporal Static Reduction Threshold Modifier (Default: 1)<br>This setting controls which sound level is considered silence by the tool.  A baseline volume is already chosen dynamically for each microphone, and this modifier multiplies the value.  So, if the static reduction function is silencing your speech, you would want to lower this value, and if it is not silencing static, you would want to raise this value.<br></li><li>Microphone Loudness Watcher Frames Per Second (Default: 144)<br>Controls how often the microphone loudness watcher checks the loudness.  Higher values place more load on the system, but may offer more responsive loudness management.<br></li><li>Microphone Loudness Watcher Display Frames Per Second (Default: 6)<br>This is the target rate for the user interface to be updated in the microphone manager.<br></li><li>Use Priority Microphone Process (Default: True)<br>Runs audio features in a separate priority process to increase responsiveness.<br></li><li>Microphone Process Priority (Default: Real Time)<br>Select the desired priority for the audio process.  I think &quot;Real Time&quot; will get you the best results, but perhaps you have a different sort of environment where it is not allowed or you are just uncomfortable with &quot;Real Time&quot;.<br> - Normal<br> - Idle<br> - High<br> - Real Time: Real Time priority processes will generally get all of the processing time they want, and if they want too much it can cause your system to become unstable.<br> - Below Normal<br> - Above Normal</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Delete Temp Files (\u274cTemp)</h2>Deletes temp files to free up drive space.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>You can specify a time period to keep recently created/modified temp files, which can reduce potential problems experienced by programs which rely on temporary storage.

The tool will wait until you are done moving a window before it will change the scaling.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Display Off (\ud83d\uddb5\ud83d\udd0c)</h2>Turns off your monitors.<br><br>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Screen Off Delay Milliseconds (Default: 750)<br>Keyboard presses and mouse movements can cause the screen to turn back on.  This delay allows you to trigger the Screen Off function and then clear your hands before the monitors will go off.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New GUID to Clipboard (GUID\ud83d\udccb)</h2>Copies a new GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) to the clipboard.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>GUIDs are normally used by programmers in software to name things uniquely without having to worry about anything else having the same name.  I wasn't sure I should give this feature a prominent position, but I decided that the ability to quickly create an almost 100% guaranteed unique identifier could come in useful for pretty much anyone.<br></li><li>Alternatively, you could just flop your hands onto the keyboard a few times to make an ID that is probably unique...</li></ul>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>New Guid to Keyboard (Default: False)<br>When using the New Guid To Clipboard action, there is a risk that you will accidentally paste the same GUID twice without realizing it.

The alternative behavior currently does not support the additional timing options.<br></li><li>Force Paste Dangerous Mode (Default: False)<br>Enables SendKeys commands when executing ForcePaste.  Also includes an additional {DELAY 1000} command which delays by the number of milliseconds specified.  Enabling this feature is potententially dangerous because someone could put an evil command in your clipboard without you knowing, so you could accidentally execute the evil command if you perform a force paste.<br></li><li>Force Paste Unquote (Default: False)<br>If enabled, removes start and ending quotes when using Force Paste.  Some programs like to put quotes around information that you are copying.  If you are getting creative with using Force Paste to fill out forms from a spread sheet, for example, going back and removing the outside quotes can interrupt your workflow.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Legacy Paste (\ud83d\udd78\ud83d\udccb\u2935)</h2>Legacy paste from the clipboard.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>This paste command will tell the currently focused legacy control to paste if the control supports it.

If set, the program will double check by pinging the selected address to make sure the internet is really having problems, so as not to suddenly disconnect you from your favorite game unnecessarily.<br></li><li>Automatically Reset Network Adapters Second Chance Ping Timeout Milliseconds (Default: 1000)<br>Determines how long to wait for a ping from the second chance address before initiating the automatic network reset.<br></li><li>Automatically Reset Network Adapters Number of Double Checks (Default: 2)<br>When internet failure is detected, double check this number of times.  Double checking reduces the probability that the network will reset unnecessarily.<br></li><li>Automatically Reset Network Adapters Double Check Rate Milliseconds (Default: 1000)<br>When internet failure is detected, double checks will occur at this specified rate.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Restart Explorer (\u2756\u21bb)</h2>Restarts Windows Explorer.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Scan for Hardware Changes (\ud83d\udda5*)</h2>Scan for hardware changes.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Sometimes helps get wonky hardware going again.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Toggle Taskbar Autohide (\u2756\ud83d\uddd5)</h2>Toggles auto-hide for the taskbar.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>I have seen the taskbar misbehave with this setting sometimes.  I can usually get it to clear up by restarting the explorer.  See Restart Explorer (\u2756\u21bb)</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unlock Drag Drop (\ud83d\udca7\ud83d\udd13)</h2>Allows a prompt for drag and drop to windows with administrator rights.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The operating system does not allow drag and drop functionality from a regular app to a secured app.  When enabled, the tool will detect when you are trying to do this, and a drag and drop security converter window will appear.  If you want to override the security measure, you can place the cursor over the unlock button until it unlocks.  At this point, the tool takes over the cursor in administrative mode, preventing programs with lower access levels from forcing the drag drop to complete.  You should now be able to complete the drag drop into programs that were previously blocked.<br></li><li>This feature requires that the tool be started with administrator rights.  Without administrator rights, this feature will simply do nothing.</li></ul>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Drag Drop Unlocker (Default: True)<br>Allows you to override operating system restrictions on some drag and drop operations to secured windows.<br></li><li>Run as Admin (Default: True)<br>If enabled, Simplode Suite will try to always have admin privileges.  Without admin privileges, some features only partially work and some features do not work at all.  Some of these features provide the ability to get admin privileges on demand, but some require restarting the application which may result in the loss of some session level configuration, such as window linking and tab layouts.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Equalizer Ring (\ud83d\udd8c\ud83d\udd0a)</h2>Paint a graphic equalizer on the function rings.<br><br>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Equalizer Ring (Default: False)<br>If enabled, paints a graphic equalizer on the function rings.<br></li><li>Number of Audio Visualizer Slices (Default: 16)<br>Controls the number of slices visible in the audio visualizer.  Setting this value too high will reduce performance while the audio visualizer is enabled.<br></li><li>Equalizer Ring Smoothness (Default: 0.6)<br>Lower values can make the equalizer visual more responsive.  Higher values can make the equalizer visual smoother.<br></li><li>Equalizer Ring Rebalancing Rate (Default: 1)<br>The equalizer visualization draws each frequency bucket according to its own historical ranges to maximize visual appeal across the spectrum.  This setting controls how quickly the frequency buckets respond to range changes.<br></li><li>Equalizer Ring Fill Bias (Default: 1.5)<br>The equalizer may appear too empty or too full depending on other settings and the qualities of the sound.  You can use this setting to adjust the fullness of the equalizer visualization.<br></li><li>Equalizer Ring Frame Rate Cap (Default: 60)<br>This limit allows you to reduce resource usage of the Equalizer Ring.<br></li><li>Equalizer Ring V Sync (Default: False)<br>If enabled, the equalizer ring will attempt to synchronize itself to the refresh rate of the monitor.  This will override the frame rate cap.<br></li><li>Equalizer Ring Disable for Super Ring (Default: True)<br>The Equalizer Ring can cause slowness if active at the same time as a super ring.  This feature will automatically disable the equalizer ring while the super ring is open.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Favorites Menu (\u2605\u29c2)</h2>In this menu you can put anything you like, and you are free to rearrange the items within and drag in additional items.<br><br>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Ring Drag Rearrange (Default: True)<br>Allows you to drag buttons to rearrange them within a ring, but only within the favorites ring or the task ring.<br></li><li>Ring Change Ring (Default: True)<br>Allows you to drag buttons from one ring to another.  Within the favorites ring, dragged buttons will be moved.  Outside of the favorites ring, dragged buttons can be copied to the favorites ring.<br></li><li>Icon Lossy Compression (Default: False)<br>If enabled, icons that are generated by the application will be allowed to lose fidelity during compression, allowing far greater compression.<br></li><li>Toggle Ring Menu to Favorites (Default: False)<br>If enabled, the standard ring menu toggling operation will automatically bring you to the Favorites menu instead of the Main menu.  You can use this option to get more control over what you see when using the tool, as you can freely change items in your favorites ring.  You will still be able to access any items outside of your favorites menu by right clicking on the center orb of the main ring.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Favorites Menu Add File (\u2605File+)</h2>Use this to select a file from your computer and add it to your favorites menu.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>You can also do this with drag and drop, but because of operating system security concerns, drag and drop may be forbidden between programs of different security levels.  You can get around this using the Unlock Drag Drop feature, or by running the application without administrative privileges.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Favorites Menu Add Ring (\u2605Ring+)</h2>Use this to add a new ring to your favorites menu.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Use the edit button in the flyout of your new ring to change the name and emblem.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Favorites Menu Add URL (\u2605URL+)</h2>Use this to select a file from your computer and add it to your favorites menu.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>You can also do this with drag and drop from your browser's URL box, but because of operating system security concerns, drag and drop may be forbidden between programs of different security levels.  You can get around this using the Unlock Drag Drop feature, or by running the application without administrative privileges.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Toggle Favorite (\u2605)</h2>Adds or removes the associated action or menu from your favorites menu.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>If the item is not in your favorites menu, it will be added to the root of your favorites menu.<br></li><li>If the item already in your favorites menu, it will be removed from your favorites menu.<br></li><li>Also contains a hierarchical listing of your favorites menu which you can use to add or remove the item in specific locations within your favorites menu.</li></ul>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Flyout Include Favorites Button (Default: True)<br>If enabled, flyouts will include a quick access favorites button.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Limit Simplode Suite RAM Usage (\u00a7\ud83d\udddc)</h2>Tell Simplode Suite to reduce its physical memory usage.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>This feature may be less useful than it appears.  Programs automatically use more memory than they need when extra memory is available and will release that memory when it is needed by other apps.  Limiting memory usage unnecessarily can be wasteful, but it can also be beneficial to already have the memory free when loading new apps or features, rather than having to unload old memory first before loading new memory.<br></li><li>This feature does not currently work with features that run in separate processes, but those features tend to use less memory than the main process anyways.</li></ul>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Automatic Memory Limiter (Default: False)<br>If enabled, the tool will try to automatically reduce the amount of physical memory it is using according to the selected target size.<br></li><li>Memory Usage Target Mebibytes (Default: 150)<br>Depending on which features of the tool you are using and your scaling/DPI settings, the minimum amount of memory necessary for the tool varies.  If this value is lower than the minimum required memory, there will be wasted effort unloading and then immediately reloading necessary resources.<br></li><li>Automatic Memory Limiter Interval (Default: 30)<br>This setting is the number of seconds the tool will wait between checks when the automatic memory limiter is enabled.<br></li><li>Individual Process Executable Names (Default: True)<br>When enabled, each coprocess will use its own separate executable file.  This makes it easier to identify specific types of Simplode Suite activity with other tools, such as the task manager.  You must restart the tool for changes to this setting to go into effect.  This setting has nearly zero cost, because nearly all of the code is located in library files which the processes share.  When I last checked, the individual executables files themselves are only around 14KB each.<br></li><li>Show Process Windows (Default: False)<br>When enabled, coprocesses will have visible windows.  This makes it easier to identify specific types of Simplode Suite activity when looking at them with other tools, such as the task manager, but may clutter your taskbar or screen in certain situations.  You must restart the tool for changes to this setting to go into effect.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Task Menu (\u2756\u29c2)</h2>Contains currently active apps.<br><br>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Task Ring Focus Ordering (Default: True)<br>If enabled, the most recently focused app will always be moved to the last position in the task ring and task menu.<br></li><li>Task Ring Include Task View (Default: True)<br>If enabled, task view action will be available in the task ring.  The task view action will open your operating system's task viewer, if available.<br></li><li>Dirty Chromium Icon Integration (Default: False)<br>When enabled, it checks the URLs of your Chrome windows to retrieve individual icons for them.  Beware that this feature inspects the URLs you are visiting and requests the icon from the associated website.<br></li><li>Dirty Chromium Icon Integration Page Specific (Default: False)<br>Tries to parse contents of URLs from Chrome windows to find page specific icons for them.  Beware that this feature inspects the URLs you are visiting and requests the page and the icon from the associated page.  Sometimes Chrome does not react well to the integration, so if Chrome starts freezing up on you, you should try to turn this off and see if it improves.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Task View (\u25a6\u2756)</h2>Opens your operating system's task viewer.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Only works on operating systems that have a built-in task viewer.<br></li><li>Simply sends [\u2756]+[Tab], which is the default operating system hotkey for opening its task viewer.</li></ul>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Task Ring Include Task View (Default: True)<br>If enabled, task view action will be available in the task ring.  The task view action will open your operating system's task viewer, if available.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Default Window Menu (\u231c)</h2>Opens the default window corner menu.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Simply sends [Alt]+[Space], which is the standard hotkey for opening the classic corner menu.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Disable Focus (\ud83d\uddd4 NO ACTIVATE)</h2>Disables focus for the target/active window.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fake Focus (\ud83d\uddd4Fake Focus)</h2>Sends the window a fake focus message and attempts to bind the keyboard to it until you press escape.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>You might need to get creative to find a use case for this.  Some apps stop working when they lose focus, so you might want to use this to access another app while avoiding this.<br></li><li>Internet browsers and some other complicated programs seem to be incompatible with this feature at this time.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Lock Window Minimum Size (\u2bd0)</h2>Locks in the current dimensions of the window as its minimum dimensions.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The minimum dimension lock is only effective in joined window groups where it prevents windows from getting squished during automatic adjustments.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Memory Limit App (\ud83d\uddd4\ud83d\udddc)</h2>Tell the focused app to reduce its physical memory usage.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>This feature may appear more useful than it really is.  Programs use more memory than they need when extra memory is available and will release that memory when it is needed by other apps.  Limiting memory usage unnecessarily can be wasteful.  Ultimately no matter how smart the computer thinks it is at managing your memory, it is possible that you know better how you plan to use your apps, and for that reason I included this feature despite its dubious merits.<br></li><li>The limit works more like a suggestion, where the system will override the limit to give more memory when necessary.</li></ul>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>App Memory Usage Default Target Mebibytes (Default: 150)<br>When setting memory targets for other apps, this value will be used as the default target value.<br></li><li>Automatic App Memory Limiter (Default: False)<br>If enabled, the tool will try to automatically reduce the amount of physical memory that the apps you have selected are using according to their respective target sizes.<br></li><li>Automatic App Memory Limiter Interval (Default: 30)<br>This setting is the number of seconds the tool will wait between checks when managing the memory usage of other applications.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Raw Window Details (\ud83d\udee0)</h2>View and edit raw details of the active window.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>It is easy to break running programs by changing these settings.  You probably don't really want to change these.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Move Window (\u21f3\u2b04)</h2>Move the window.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Not compatible with either Multi Touch Window Resize or Mouse Right Button Chord Resize features.  These features must be initiated using the window title bar dragging.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Resize Window (\u21f2)</h2>Resize the window.<br><br>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Multi Touch Window Resize (Default: True)<br>When moving a window with a multi-touch capable device, you can resize using an additional touch.  The top left corner of the window will be moved according to your first touch, and the bottom right corner of the window will be moved according to your second touch, so you can effectively pinch the window smaller or stretch the window bigger with two fingers.  When using touch interfaces, this method may be much easier than trying to precisely touch a window's edge for resizing, as the top bar of a window is usually set aside for movement and is much larger than the resizable window edges.<br></li><li>Input Grabber (Default: True)<br>If enabled, the program will use an invisible window at times to capture input for some features.  If disabled, some features will not be able to work.<br></li><li>Mouse Right Button Chord Resize (Default: Dynamic)<br>When moving a window, you can resize it by additionally pressing the right mouse button.  This means you will start by clicking the top bar for movement like normal, but you will then press the right mouse button also, having both the left mouse button and the right mouse button pressed at the same time, like a musical chord of notes.  When you do this, the window will anchor at the corner farthest from the cursor, allowing you to expand or contract the window at the closest corner.  This method may be easier than trying to precisely click on a window's edge for resizing, as the top bar of a window is usually set aside for movement and is much larger than the resizable window edges.<br> - Disabled<br> - Dynamic: Mouse Chord Resize will anchor to the farthest corner of the window from the start position.<br> - Bottom Right: Mouse Chord Resize will anchor to the bottom right corner of the window.<br> - Top Left: Mouse Chord Resize will anchor to the top left corner of the window.<br> - Top Right: Mouse Chord Resize will anchor to the top right corner of the window.<br> - Bottom Left: Mouse Chord Resize will anchor to the bottom right corner of the window.<br></li><li>Resize Window Override Min Max (Default: False)<br>When enabled, the Resize Window action will ignore minimum and maximum window sizes.  You might end up making a window unusable if this is enabled.<br></li><li>Resize Window Context Inclusion (Default: True)<br>Some windows in the tool do not have large enough borders to make them drag resizable.  When enabled, this option tries to include a resize button in relevant menus for these windows.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Minimize (\ud83d\uddd5)</h2>Minimizes the window's group.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>You can also use the standard window minimize button.  The [Shift]+[\u2756Windows]+[Down] hotkey is built into the operating system.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Maximize (\ud83d\uddd6)</h2>Maximizes the window with its group.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>You can also use the standard window maximize button.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Close Window (\ud83d\uddd4\u274c)</h2>Asks the active window to close normally.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>If you recently switched windows, the first request is ignored as a safety precaution.  The safety precaution turns off temporarily after activation, allowing you to go on a window closing spree if you want.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Super Close Window (\ud83d\uddd4\u274c!)</h2>Attempts to forcibly terminate the foreground process (window).<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Sometimes a program refuses to close and prevents usage of the task manager.  For these times, there is Super Close.<br></li><li>WARNING: May cause instability.  However, when a program refuses to close, you might consider it already unstable, right?<br></li><li>You should take care to remember the hotkey so you can use it when a program has you trapped.<br></li><li>For unresponsive applications which cannot take foreground focus, you can use this feature through secondary targeting by holding left click on the Super Close Window button and then right clicking on the unresponsive window.<br></li><li>If this does not work for some reason, consider trying the logout hotkey.<br></li><li>If recently switched windows, the first attempt is ignored as a safety precaution.  The safety precaution turns off temporarily after activation, allowing you to go on a window destroying spree if you want.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ghost Window (\ud83d\uddd4\ud83d\udc7b\u261e)</h2>Toggles window click-through.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Click-through windows allow clicks and touches to pass through them.<br></li><li>Toggling this off is a bit tricky.  To make it easier you can use the Unghost All Windows (\u274c\ud83d\udc7b) feature.  There are a couple ways you could do this for a specific window.  Clicking the button will impact the active window, so you could activate the window first using the task ring or the task bar.  Alternatively, click the button and hold the click as if you are dragging the button.  While you keep the left mouse button pressed, you can right click on any window to perform the action on it.  This works with most window targeted actions.</li></ul>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Ghost Window Control Key Target Toggle (Default: True)<br>When enabled, holding the control key while performing a secondary action can select ghost windows.  The ghost window action itself will be affected in reverse, as it can select ghost windows by default.  For reference, a secondary action is performed by holding a click on an action button and then using the other mouse button to click on a window.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Always on Top Toggle (\ud83d\uddd4\u234f)</h2>Toggles always on top mode for the active window.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Click Through Overlay (\ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\uddd4\u234f)</h2>Converts a window into a click through overlay window.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Click through overlay windows are partially transparent, sit on top of other windows, and do not respond to mouse clicks.<br></li><li>You can also achieve the same results using a combination of other Simplode Suite features, but this feature conveniently manages all aspects in one action.<br></li><li>This feature has a sliding secondary action for controlling the amount of transparency of the window.<br></li><li>Sliding secondary actions can be triggered in two ways.  Secondary actions are available when you click and hold your primary mouse button on an action button.  You can then move your mouse to your target and then also click and hold the secondary mouse button, where moving your mouse left, right, up and down will make adjustments based on the action.  On multi-touch capable touch screens, you can trigger a sliding secondary action by holding one finger on the action button and then sliding another finger on your target.</li></ul>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Click Through Overlay Default Opacity (Default: 0.6)<br>This option adjusts how transparent a click through overlay window will be.  A value of 0 will be entirely invisible, and a value of 1 will be fully opaque.</li></ul>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1403380?t=1606288960","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1403380/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1606288960","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1403380/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1606288960","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1403380/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1606288960","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Free Select allows you to choose any one premium feature from Simplode Suite to have absolutely free!

It can do this by minimizing your CPU's power state for background tasks and optimizing your CPU's power state for foreground tasks.  Additionally, you can customize how your CPU deals with load and temperatures, creating new possibilities for overclocking and silent PC builds.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>CPUs usually have similar features built in.  However, these features typically lack configurability and often don't work at all with overclocking.  The built in hardware features are also not using all of the available information that Chill Boost uses, so they will often boost unnecessarily for background processes like indexing, scans, and updates.  You can use Chill Boost to get more control over your computer's temperature, noise, and power consumption.  If you are overclocking, you may be able to use the additional control to stabilize higher overclocks, especially on processors with large core counts.<br></li><li>Chill Boost uses your power scheme settings to work.  It is separate from a power scheme setting, as you can have it enabled with any power scheme.  However, power schemes which do not allow 100% CPU utilizations will have reduced/no benefits from this feature.<br></li><li>Enabling verticle sync or framerate limits when gaming can help you get the most from Chill Boost.<br></li><li>Overclockers may find this feature useful for semi-stable overclocks which only fail under sustained heavy load due to rising temperature.<br></li><li>I developed this feature because I noticed that under heavy load, the overclock I used on my AMD Ryzen based processor would cause the chip to slowly heat up and lose performance until the system would hang.  I still wanted the overclock, though, because it worked great under normal loads.  So, I made this feature so that I could use the full speed of my overclock for normal loads while preventing heavy loads from crashing my machine.<br></li><li>Here are some hints for overclockers.  If your voltage is too tight for your clock rate, you will likely crash quickly when doing a stress test before even heating up significantly.  Higher voltage will heat up the chip faster, but can increase the range of temperatures that it will operate, which can give you more room to play with the Chill Boost Reservoir Size and/or increase stability in general.  Be sure to do some research online about what most people feel are safe voltages for your CPU before setting it too high.<br></li><li>If you are overclocking an AMD Ryzen based CPU, you may need to use P-State overclocking in order to benefit from Chill Boost.  When overclocking without P-States, the CPU may refuse to drop down to a lower voltage, and then when Chill Boost tries to limit the CPU power usage, nothing will happen.  You may also see this if some of your P-States are unstable, as the system seems to detect this sometimes and blocks them from activating.  P-State 1 is what Chill Boost is going to try to use under heavy load, so I would recommend optimizing your P-State 0 for single core loads and P-State 1 for all core loads, so that Chill Boost can give you the best of both worlds.<br></li><li>If you are overclocking an Intel CPU, you can do regular overclocking in conjunction with Chill Boost.  Intel chips have generally always been willing to drop to lower power states when overclocking.  Unfortunately, you cannot customize the P-States even if you want to, so you won't be able to optimize quite as much as with an AMD chip, though that may not matter if the voltage curve is sufficiently aggressive.<br></li><li>The Auto Calibration button will run benchmarks on your processor at various configurations and then use the results to optimize to your Chill Boost settings according to heuristics developed alongside the Chill Boost features.  Depending on available sensors, it will attempt to find the best values for your Efficiency Locker Max Power State, Critical Max Power State, and Stressed Max Power State.  This is a good way to help you get the most out of Chill Boost without actually having to figure out everything yourself.  It also displays information that may help you when manually tweaking things.<br></li><li>The Auto Calibration results table shows detailed information about how the processor is performing at each energy state.<br> - Score shows how well the processor did in benchmarks.  This version's benchmarking code is far from perfect, so the results may be misleading if you are using them to compare different hardware.  The results are probably most useful when comparing a single device in multiple configurations.  If the calibration options include simultaneous multithreading or additional cores, these are summed up in the score.<br> - Scored Efficiency takes the score divided by the measured energy consumption.  This version's benchmarking code is far from perfect, and sensor accuracy varies by product and configuration, especially when overclocking.  Therefore, the results may be misleading if you are using them to compare different hardware.  The results are probably most useful when comparing single device in different configurations.  Another thing you should consider is that this efficiency score does not include idle waste energy, so if you can turn your PC off after it is done working, higher power states may actually be more efficient than shown here.<br> - Measured Efficiency takes the clock speed divided by the measured energy consumption.  Power sensors often report wrong values for various reasons such as overclocking, making it difficult to trust this value.  The calibration tool makes decisions based on Estimated Efficiency instead, if available.<br> - Estimated efficiency uses voltage and clock rate for estimation.  The resulting values are ratios of each estimated efficiency to the least efficient estimated efficiency.  The efficiency values are intended to represent how many calculations the CPU can do in a configuration with a fixed amount of energy, relative to each other.</li></ul>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Chill Boost Enabled (Default: False)<br>Enables Chill Boost feature, which reduces the CPU power state in specific circumstances to improve performance.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Responsiveness (Default: 12)<br>This value is the number of times per second the chill boost updates.  Higher values will increase responsiveness of the feature, but also can increase load on the CPU.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Display Responsiveness (Default: 4)<br>This value is the number of times per second the chill boost settings panel updates.  Because the settings panel does not run on the same timer as the feature itself, displayed values may not exactly match up with what is actually happening.  Usually you would want the display panel updating slower, as it uses more resources and throws off its own results when running too quickly.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Reservoir Size (Default: 0)<br>The reservoir size is how many seconds your CPU is allowed to run at full load before Chill Boost kicks in, and should be matched to your CPU cooling system.  For example, if you have a water cooled system that can't keep up with your overclock and it takes 30 seconds for your computer to crash at full load, you might want to set this at 10 seconds to limit unnecessary throttling but still prevent the system from reaching conditions in which it would crash.  If you have an air-cooled system or a tight overclock, temperature issues can hit much faster so you might be better off leaving this value at 0.  The reservoir only applies when looking at load.  Temperature limit settings will ignore reservoir settings.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Reservoir Fill Rate (Default: 0.1)<br>The reservoir fill rate is a multiplier on how many seconds are filled per second of CPU underutilization.  If you are overclocking your CPU in a configuration that is not thermally stable at 100% load, you might outpace your heat dissipation and crash if you set this value too high.  If you are not overclocking, your CPU should be expected to handle 100% load just fine, in which case this feature would be more about improving heat, noise, and energy management at lower values.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Load Threshold (Default: 49)<br>This is the CPU usage percentage at which the stressed power state limit is triggered.  This is extra useful when temperature sensors are unavailable or when temperature sensors do not respond fast enough.  This threshold works in conjunction with the boost reservoir.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Temperature Target (Default: 70)<br>This is the temperature at which the stressed power state limit is triggered.  This target ignores the boost reservoir and tries to reduce the CPU temperature until it is below the target.  CPUs already have similar mechanisms built in.  However, when overclocking these mechanisms tend to be disabled, save for some last-ditch temperature controls which tend to limit only clock speed and not voltage.  Even when not overclocking, these features are typically nonconfigurable, so this setting gives you more flexibility to efficiently keep temperatures low and noise down without sacrificing performance under light loads.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Temperature Critical Limit (Default: 75)<br>This should be higher than the Chill Boost Temperature Target.  It works similarly, but can make more drastic voltage reductions by dropping to an even lower power state.  If you are overclocking, this would be your last line of defense outside of built-in emergency thermal limiters which may wait to kick in until as much as 100C.  While the default is 75C, I am not saying that 75C is safe, but it surely is a lot safer than a 100C hardware limiter.  Depending on your hardware, if you are reaching 75C without overclocking, this may be evidence that your cooling system is inadequate, installed improperly, or failing.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Load Temperature Skew (Default: 5)<br>This setting reduces your temperature allowances based on load.  When this setting is 5 and the load is 100%, the temperature target and critical limit will be reduced by 5.  At 0% load, the reduction would be 0.  This allows the tool to respond faster than by simply going by the temperature sensors alone.  This setting can allow the CPU to bounce back to high performance quicker when load is reduced.  The setting also enables the tool to catch temperature spikes quicker.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Temperature Sensor Anti Glitch (Default: True)<br>Temperature sensors can be glitchy sometimes.  This is a very basic protection mechanism which ignores negative temperature values coming from the temperature sensor.  On my system, I was getting odd temperature spikes during load tests because the sensor was sending back negative numbers from time to time, causing my temperature protections to not work correctly.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Stressed Max Power State (Default: 70)<br>This setting is a power state limit for dealing with load or temperature under stressed conditions.  Depending on your hardware, the optimum value for this setting may vary wildly.  The auto-calibration feature will select the power state with the second highest voltage, which usually offers both high efficiency and decent performance, but you could use the information from the auto-calibration table to optimize this value yourself.  Lower values should reach more conservative power states, but the power states follow a step function that varies by hardware, so you have to lower the value enough to reach the next step before any actual change happens.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Critical Max Power State (Default: 0)<br>This setting is a power state limit for dealing with load or temperature under critical conditions.  The value 0 will enable the maximum voltage drop available.  Higher values may still be effective without reducing performance as much.  Processors have their own built-in protection mechanisms, but this setting can offer another layer of protection, which can come in especially handy when overclocking as some hardware protection mechanisms may be disabled.  Auto-calibration will always set this value to 0 for maximum safety, but depending on your hardware you may be able to select a higher value which is stable under constant maximum load, in which case I would recommend setting this to the most efficient power state shown in the auto-calibration table.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Safety Mechanism (Default: False)<br>The Chill Boost Safety Mechanism exists in case you are using Chill Boost to thermally stabilize an overclock, so that your system does not go full throttle and crash before Chill Boost is able to run.  Chill Boost only functions correctly while the tool is running.  This mechanism attempts to leave your computer in the reduced power state if the computer crashes until the tool is running again.  This feature could potentially cause Chill Boost to limit power more often than intended.  Also, with this setting enabled, your power plan will not be reverted back to your normal power plan when you exit Simplode Suite normally, so you might have poor performance when the tool is not running and not remember why.  Many computers reset their power plan on restart for whatever reason, and this safety mechanism will not work correctly in this case, though you could lower the maximum CPU power state in the power plan to which your system reverts so that you can still have the same sort of protection.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Efficiency Locker (Default: True)<br>Chill Boost Efficiency Locker blocks background and low priority apps from switching your processor into performance mode.  When a processor is in performance mode, efficiency losses can be enormous, leading to more heat, more noise, and possibly shorter device lifespans.  We like performance, though, for things we are focused on, but often times a background process will put your device into performance mode unnecessarily.  The heat can even reduce the performance of your foreground app, so this feature can even increase perceived performance.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Efficiency Locker Thread Load Threshold (Default: 0.5)<br>When the efficiency locker is enabled, this threshold determines when it is active.  Other efficiency locker settings change specific aspects of this behavior, but in general the computer will be allowed to run at full throttle when the application you are currently focused on has at least one thread that is trying to use the CPU more than this threshold.  Getting close to 100% thread load can be quite difficult because time spent waiting for resources does not count.  With that in mind, you may need to keep this number unituitively low considering a thread at 60% load can still be starved for more processor power.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Efficiency Locker Mode (Default: 1)<br>Performance Optimized: In this mode, the feature will not engage until it has detected unnecessary boosting caused by background apps.  Apps that you want to boost will be able to boost without delay.<br>Efficiency Optimized: In this mode, the feature will block boosting until it detects that an app that you want to boost needs boosting.  This mode may delay boosting slightly.<br> - 0<br> - 1<br></li><li>Chill Boost Efficiency Locker Multithread Enhancement (Default: True)<br>When enabled alongside the Chill Boost Efficiency Locker, it can more accurately detect when multithreaded apps have headroom for efficiency improvement.  Sometimes multithreaded applications have exotic thread configurations which make it difficult to determine if they are facing a thread speed bottleneck.  For applications where the total load is less than the thread load threshold, we can easily determine that we have room to increase efficiency.  However, when total load is higher than the thread load threshold, threads could be cascading information to each other making them behave as a single thread with similar efficiency penalties, and if we judged simply be looking at the threads individually, we would incorrectly enter efficiency mode, noticeably reducing the performance of the app.  By analyzing process CPU usage at small enough intervals, the tool is able to see moments when an app is completely caught up.  The duration and cadence of these moments can be used to determine how much room we have for efficiency improvements without reducing performance even when threads are interacting in unknown ways.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Efficiency Locker Multithread Enhancement Threshold (Default: 0.9)<br>This is the threshold at which the Efficiency Locker Multithread Enhancement will consider the focused app busy enough to need maximum performance.  To reduce the chance that a busy application may be throttled, the focus app will be considered busy from when it is triggered until the value falls below 0.5 if this threshold is above 0.5.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Efficiency Locker Max Power State (Default: 100)<br>When the Chill Boost Efficiency Locker activates, the max power state will be limited to this value.  The default value of 99 is usually a substantial improvement in efficiency on its own, though the most efficient power state is likely lower than 99.  The Auto Calibration feature can set this value to most efficient power state available.  The efficiency locker may reduce the power state even lower than this setting depending on the other efficiency locker settings.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Efficiency Locker Frame Drop Resistance (Default: 3)<br>The efficiency locker can sometimes cause unnecessary frame drops if it detects a brief period of favorable conditions.  Higher values in this setting will increase the amount of time that the efficiency locker will wait before kicking in, reducing the chances that it will kick in at a bad time and cause a frame drop.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Efficiency Locker Strict Processes (Default: )<br>These processes will only be allowed to run while the efficiency locker is active and not above the strict process energy state threshold.  Use the file names of each process, separated by commas or new lines.  While processes in the list are in the background and the maximum power state is above this value, they will be completely unresponsive.  While processes in the list are in the foreground, the maximum power state will be limited to the threshold.  This allows you to run selected processes at maximum efficiency while minimizing any negative impact on other foreground processes.  There is no way to configure processes to run at different voltages simultaneously, so the only way to ensure efficiency for heavy background processes is to allow them to run only while the voltage is limited.  Chill Boost Efficiency Locker offers the unique capability to recognize times when efficiency must be sacrificed for foreground performance, and can suspend and resume selected heavy background processes in real time to maximize both foreground performance and background efficiency.  CPU based video encoders and cryptocurrency miners are examples of programs which can benefit greatly from this feature, allowing you to leave them running while working on other things or even gaming, all while keeping your CPU cool and on demand foreground performance high.  You might want to use this with virtual machines, but be advised that some virtualizers may intercept input with hooks, which can cause severe input lag when suspended, though you may be able to disable the input hooks in the respective settings of your virtualizer.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Efficiency Locker Strict Process Energy State Threshold (Default: 89)<br>This is the power state threshold that efficiency locker strict processes will be allowed to run.<br></li><li>Base Min Processor State (Default: 0)<br>This setting is from your power scheme.  Unless overridden, the tool will obey this setting.  If this is not set to 0, some Chill Boost features might be inneffective because the tool may not be able to lower the value enough to make a difference.<br></li><li>Base Max Processor State (Default: 100)<br>This setting is from your power scheme.  Unless overridden, the tool will obey this setting.  If this is not set to 100, some Chill Boost features might be inneffective because the most impactful processor state change is usually the jump between 99 and 100.  A jump between 90 and 99 might do absolutely nothing, for example.<br></li><li>Override Min Max Powerstate (Default: True)<br>Overriding the minimum power state can increase the range at which Chill Boost is allowed to operate.  This lets you use all of the settings of a more restricted power scheme, but still run the processor down to this level based on your other Chill Boost settings.  This can prevent confusion with Chill Boost appearing to not work when it is actually just obeying your existing power plan settings.<br></li><li>Min Power State Override (Default: 0)<br></li><li>Max Power State Override (Default: 100)<br>Overriding the maximum power state can increase the range at which Chill Boost is allowed to operate.  This lets you use all of the settings of a more restricted power scheme, but still run the processor up to this level based on your other Chill Boost settings.  This can prevent confusion with Chill Boost appearing to not work when it is actually just obeying your existing power plan settings.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Efficiency Estimation Voltage Exponent (Default: 2.6)<br>When using the chill boost auto calibration feature, efficiency estimations are used to select optimum power levels for various features.  The power estimation formula looks like this:<br>Efficiency = Clock ^ ClockEstimationExponent / Voltage ^ VoltageEstimationExponent<br>I first thought that the value 2 would work fine, because increasing the voltage with the same resistance will also increase the current proportionally.  However, processors are more complicated than that, so I played with it and selected a default value that gave me better results.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Efficiency Estimation Clock Exponent (Default: 0.15)<br>When using the chill boost auto calibration feature, efficiency estimations are used to select optimum power levels for various features.  The power estimation formula looks like this:<br>Efficiency = Clock ^ ClockEstimationExponent / Voltage ^ VoltageEstimationExponent<br>I first thought that the value 1 would work fine, because getting more work done with the same amount of power would increase efficiency proportionally.  However, processors are more complicated than that, so I played with it and selected a default value that gave me better results.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Efficiency Estimation Minimum Runs (Default: 5)<br>When using the chill boost auto calibration feature, power points are checked in a binary search pattern.  Different power points get tested different amounts of time, and all of the data is used to provide a better estimation.  Some power points may only be tested once or a small number of times in this fashion.  This setting will make sure that each power point is tested at least this number of times.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Calibration Rate (Default: 0.5)<br>This is the maximum number of samples per second that the auto calibration feature will take.  If this value is too high, the tool may pick up mismatched samples.  If the value is too low, auto calibration may take a long time.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Calibration Simultaneous Multi Thread (Default: True)<br>If enabled, SMT (also known has hyper-threading on Intel) will be used during calibration.  This can improve the accuracy of the efficiency data by taking into account this capability.  Including SMT also allows higher core power usage during testing which can improve precision, as smaller power usage values are more difficult to measure.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Calibration Cores (Default: 1)<br>Using this option, you can run the auto calibration with as many cores as you like.  Calibration is more stressful on your hardware with more cores, and testing too many cores may adversely affect system and tool performance.  Testing additional cores can improve the quality of the measurements taken during calibration.<br></li><li>Use Priority Chill Boost Process (Default: True)<br>Runs Chill Boost features in a separate priority process to ensure that it can work even if other priority processes on your computer are hogging all of the resources.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Process Priority (Default: Real Time)<br>Select the desired priority for the Chill Boost process.  I recommend setting this to &quot;Real Time&quot;.  If any other process has higher priority than the Chill Boost process, Chill Boost may be blocked from doing its job by that process.<br> - Normal<br> - Idle<br> - High<br> - Real Time: Real Time priority processes will generally get all of the processing time they want, and if they want too much it can cause your system to become unstable.<br> - Below Normal<br> - Above Normal<br></li><li>Chill Boost Hour Meter (Default: 0)<br>This is the number of hours Chill Boost has been enabled.  For performance and hardware longevity, updates at around a 6 minute interval.<br></li><li>Chill Boost Optimized Busy Hours (Default: 0)<br></li><li>Chill Boost Optimized Core Watt Hours (Default: 0)<br></li><li>Chill Boost Processor Busy Hours (Default: 0)<br></li><li>Chill Boost Core Watt Hours (Default: 0)<br></li><li>Estimated Watt Hours Saved (Default: 0)<br>The estimated watt hours saved works by comparing the average energy efficiency when Chill Boost is limiting the power state to the average energy efficiency when Chill Boost is not limiting the power state.  As a result, you may see weird behavior such as the value rising when the power state is not limited, and this is because the average efficiency changes as new data arrives.  The other thing to consider about the watt hours saved, is that in most cases, the majority of the energy your computer is consuming is not in CPU cores, but in things like your GPU, monitors, RAM, and processor IO, and Chill Boost only helps optimise your CPU core energy consumption, so what might be an apparant 50% savings shown by this value will have a lesser impact on battery life, for example.  That being said, if you use Chill Boost long enough, the savings does add up, and depending on how you use your computer, the savings may actually pay for your product license.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Borderless Fullscreen (\u21f1\u21f2)</h2>Attempts to make the current window into a borderless full screen window.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Warning: May cause graphical glitches and potentially even functionality glitches on some programs.

You can disable the feature to pause the tiling and tabbing interactions, and reenable to resume.<br></li><li>Window Hover Linking (Default: True)<br>When enabled, moving a window over top of another window will cause a window linking menu to appear.  To use the menu, hold the cursor over a menu button until the loading indicator completes and then release the cursor.  To aid in selecting a window, each window will only be highlighted once per window drag, so if the wrong window gets highlighted, simply drag your cursor outside of that window and the next time you move your cursor over your selected window, the previously highlighted window will be ignored.<br></li><li>Virtual Maximize Group (Default: True)<br>When maximizing a window that is part of a group, spread the group's windows over the screen instead of performing a standard operating system maximize operation.<br></li><li>Window Join Security (Default: Block)<br>This setting can protect against an unsecured app joining itself to a secured app.  If an unsecured app can do this, it can potentially relocate a secured app in front of your mouse right before you click causing a click on a secured application.  This would be a very complicated way to attack your computer, so it would be a very unlikely attack vector, though I still can't let you take that risk by default.<br> - Block: When selected, attempts to join a window to a window with a higher security level are blocked.  (Safest)<br> - Allow: When selected, attempts to join a window to a window with a higher security level are allowed.  <br></li><li>DPI Zone Fix (Default: True)<br>When enabled, tries to avoid conditions which cause unexpected behavior on multiple monitor systems with DPI differences.<br></li><li>Window Border Spacing Adjustment (Default: 1)<br>With this option, you can adjust how much the tool accounts for window borders when moving windows in groups.<br></li><li>Mitigate Windows Explorer Size Crash Min Width (Default: 300)<br>When performing certain operations on a Windows Explorer window that is below a certain size, Windows Explorer may crash.  To prevent this from happening, the tool will try to avoid setting Windows Explorer windows below this size.  You may not actually need this enabled, as some users do not experience the issue, but I have enabled it by default because it is a pretty bad first impression of my product if you happen to run into this bug immediately.  Set the value to 0 to disable.  The exact minimum size that the problem occurs also seems to vary, so you may need to raise this if explorer windows are glitching out, or alternatively you could lower it if you want smaller windows and are not experiencing the bug.  The bug is not specific to Simplode Suite Long Debug, but the mitigation feature can in some cases prevent the bug from happening even when performing operations unrelated to the tool.  It does this by detecting when a Windows Explorer window is resized, and increasing the size if it happens to be too small.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tabs (\ud83d\udcc1)</h2>Enables the ability to create unlimited tab groups with unlimited tabs.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>This entry is for information and licensing only, see related actions for how to use the feature.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Group Tab (Tab)</h2>This feature will cause the active window to join together with the window behind it into a tabbed group.<br><br>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Tab Rearrange (Default: True)<br>When enabled, you can reorder tabs of tab grouped windows by clicking and dragging the tab over its neighboring tabs.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mouse Accelerator (\ud83d\uddb0\ud83d\udca8)</h2>This is a customizable mouse accelerator.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>This accelerator works without any DLL injections, so there is reduced chance that a game might falsely identify it as a cheat.  However, unlike driver level modification, this tool makes no attempt to hide the source of the input, so it would be easy for a game to see that the mouse input was modified.<br></li><li>Some games disable operating system mouse acceleration but will still be accelerated by this custom accelerator.<br></li><li>The custom curve formula looks something like this: \u2211(m*v^p) with v being cursor velocity, m being each multiplier setting and p being each power setting.  The custom curve formula may be expanded in future versions, as it does not provide as much curve customization capability as I would like.<br></li><li>The mouse acceleration features are intended for cases when you can't find a direct mouse speed that is both fast enough and precise enough for your needs.  I recommend getting used to direct 1:1 input with no acceleration if possible, so you will pretty much be able to use the same muscle memory everywhere, even on devices that do not have this tool installed.<br></li><li>I believe that major operating systems each use their own signature mouse acceleration settings primarily to help lock you in to their system.  Once you get used to their mouse acceleration, attempting to switch to a competitor will feel weird and possibly help persuade you to give up and return.<br></li><li>Using any input modification features puts you at risk with multiplayer gaming.  Each game has its own rules on where it draws the line between cheating and not cheating.  Some don't care, some will kick you, and some might ban you.  This product does its part in cooperating with anti-cheat software by not hiding the source of input, so any game could easily ignore injected input if programmed to do so.<br></li><li>This feature has a low risk of being considered cheating in multiplayer games.  When it comes to aiming, games designers are typically worried about automatic aiming and precision firing tools which use live information gathered from the game you are playing to give you an advantage in the game.  This feature, on the other hand, is really just changing the behavior of your mouse, using only information from prior mouse movements.</li></ul>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Mouse Accelerator (Default: False)<br>Enables the Mouse Accelerator<br></li><li>Mouse Acceleration Confirmation (Default: False)<br>This is used to record whether or not you have tested your mouse acceleration settings.  If you don't confirm your settings, the mouse accelerator will automatically shut off after a delay to prevent you from losing access to your mouse accidently.  Once you confirm your settings you can toggle them on and off without confirmation.  Any changes will require a new confirmation.<br></li><li>Mouse Slider Right Mouse Button (Default: False)<br>When enabled, it causes the mouse to slide according to recent movement while the right mouse button is pressed.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator Input Multiplier (Default: 1)<br>This is a simple input multiplier for the custom mouse accelerator.  This could be helpful if you change the hardware DPI of your mouse and want a simple way to get your old curve behavior back.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator Output Multiplier (Default: 1)<br>This is a simple output multiplier for the custom mouse accelerator.  This could be helpful if you like your acceleration curve feel, but just want it to be faster or slower.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator Minimum Acceleration Ratio (Default: 1)<br>If the custom acceleration values are low enough, the accelerator may completely block some mouse events from being registered at all.  The value '1' will ensure that the mouse will never be slower than having no acceleration at all.  Lower values can enable you to slow down the mouse passed normal limits, where some mouse input events will not be forwarded to other programs.  Higher values will act as a direct multiplier to mouse input.  This multiplier only acts when the mouse acceleration parameters do not have greater acceleration than this value.  This value puts a floor on your mouse accelerator curve.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator Maximum Acceleration Ratio (Default: 3)<br>This setting can put a ceiling on your mouse accelerator curve.  The mouse acceleration ratio will not be allowed to be greater than this value.  You can use this to construct your own Precision Twitch acceleration profile, as your mouse will have a one to one correspondence with the cursor for movements above this limit.  Set it to 0 to disable it.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator Curve Type (Default: Custom)<br> - Custom: Set your mouse acceleration curve to a custom trinomial.<br> - Precision Twitch: This feature forces a mouse acceleration curve that gives 1:1 mouse behavior for twitch movements, but enables additional precision for very slow mouse movements.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator M 1 (Default: 1)<br>Multiplier 1<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator P 1 (Default: 1)<br>Power (Exponent) 1<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator M 2 (Default: 0.1)<br>Multiplier 2<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator P 2 (Default: 2)<br>Power (Exponent) 2<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator M 3 (Default: 0)<br>Multiplier 3<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator P 3 (Default: 3)<br>Power (Exponent) 3<br></li><li>Mouse Precision Twitch Threshold (Default: 3)<br>This option determines where to draw the line between mouse movements that should have 1:1 behavior and movements with enhanced precision.  Higher values will apply enhanced precision to greater speed mouse movements, where lower values will make slower movements have 1:1 behavior.<br></li><li>Mouse Precision Twitch Multiplier (Default: 3)<br>This option controls how much twitch movements will be multiplied.  Higher values here increase the difference between twitch movements and enhanced precision movements.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator Max Input Frames Per Second (Default: 512)<br>Lower values reduce load on the processer caused by the accelerator.  Higher values can increase the precision and responsiveness of the accelerator.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator Max Output Frames Per Second (Default: 512)<br>Too high of values can make weird things behave sluggishly, like resizing windows.  You can manually type in higher values than the slider will allow for mice that poll at faster rates.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator Adaptive Mode (Default: False)<br>Basically, this is a hybrid approach between having mouse acceleration and not having mouse acceleration, where you get closer to the feel of 1:1 mouse movements than with traditional mouse acceleration, but you still get the acceleration properties allowing for additional precision when moving the mouse slowly and additional speed when moving the mouse quickly.  It works by smoothly transitioning between linear acceleration and your chosen curve depending on how fast you have been moving the mouse in a recent time window.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator Adaptive Speed Window (Default: 1)<br>The adaptive speed window is the period of time which the accelerator will look at previous mouse movements to establish an acceleration baseline.  Higher numbers increase the amount of time it takes for the acceleration factor to reduce.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator Adaptive Speed Rise Modifier (Default: 1)<br>Values higher than 1 will cause the adaptive accelerator to respond more quickly to increases in acceleration.  If you set this value less than one, the adaptive speed fall off will be faster than the rise.<br></li><li>Override OS Mouse Settings on Launch (Default: False)<br>If enabled, this tool will override operating system settings for mouse speed and acceleration upon launch.  This does not affect custom acceleration settings.  This option is mainly for forcing your saved settings in case they get overwritten while the tool is closed.<br></li><li>OS Mouse Speed (Default: 10)<br>As this value increases, the speed of the cursor increases.  This value is in effect even when custom acceleration is in use.  If you have a DPI selectable mouse, I suggest you keep the DPI all the way up, and use these configurations to make the speed manageable.  This way you will get the maximum amount of precision out of your hardware.  Lack of precision may cause your cursor to routinely skip pixels even when moving at the slowest possible speed.<br></li><li>OS Mouse Acceleration (Default: True)<br>If enabled, the operating system will use its own mouse acceleration mechanism.<br></li><li>OS Mouse Acceleration Speed (Default: 1)<br>Raising the value seems to make the cursor even slower at low speeds and faster at high speeds.<br></li><li>OS Mouse Acceleration Threshold 1 (Default: 6)<br>Controls the threshold at which the cursor ought to be moving at double speed.<br></li><li>OS Mouse Acceleration Threshold 2 (Default: 10)<br>Controls the threshold at which the cursor ought to be moving at quadruple speed.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator Always Intercept Mode (Default: False)<br>Intercept mode can increase performance of some weird things, like resizing windows.  Also, it can make the acceleration smoother for speed multipliers less than 1.  When enabled, standard mouse messages are intercepted and included in the mouse accelerator calculations, thus reducing the total number of messages being sent in many cases.  Unfortunately, this optimization can also cause the mouse to go unresponsive if Simplode Suite Long Debug is too busy.  Another potential drawback of this setting is that the mouse curve may not behave exactly the same inside some games as it does on the desktop.  A major advantage of the custom mouse accelerator is the ability to obtain the same acceleration curve in multiple environments, because when the behavior does not match it can interfere with muscle memory.  So, if your applications perform well with this feature off, you may be better off disabling this feature so that you can avoid losing the advantages of a uniform mouse feel.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator Dynamic Intercept Mode (Default: True)<br>Dynamic intercept mode recognizes some specific scenarios where intercept mode might greatly improve performance, like resizing windows, and will temporarily enable the effects of the intercept mode.  This can also avoid the drawbacks of intercept mode for the most part.<br></li><li>Mouse Accelerator Dynamic Performance Optimization Factor (Default: 2)<br>Some types of operations have been found to perform poorly when given mouse input at high rates, such as resizing and moving windows.  With values greater than one, the output framerate will be divided to improve performance during these operations.  This option goes well with dynamic intercept mode.<br></li><li>Use Priority Input Process (Default: True)<br>Runs input features in a separate priority process to avoid input lag.<br></li><li>Input Process Priority (Default: Real Time)<br>Select the desired priority for the input process.  I think &quot;Real Time&quot; will get you the best results, but perhaps you have a different sort of environment where it is not allowed or you are just uncomfortable with &quot;Real Time&quot;.<br> - Normal<br> - Idle<br> - High<br> - Real Time: Real Time priority processes will generally get all of the processing time they want, and if they want too much it can cause your system to become unstable.<br> - Below Normal<br> - Above Normal</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mouse Wheel Accelerator (\ud83d\uddb0\u21f3\ud83d\udca8)</h2>This is a simple customizable mouse wheel accelerator.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>By default, mouse wheel speed doubles at level 1, triples at level 2, and quadruples at level 3, but you can configure these multipliers.<br></li><li>Using any input modification features puts you at risk with multiplayer gaming.  Each game has its own rules on where it draws the line between cheating and not cheating.  Some don't care, some will kick you, and some might ban you.  This product does its part in cooperating with anti-cheat software by not hiding the source of input, so any game could easily ignore injected input if programmed to do so.<br></li><li>This feature is generally not particularly useful for cheating in multiplayer games, but still faces some risk of being considered cheating.  In order to work correctly, the feature may produce 2 mouse wheel events for 1 hardware event, which technically does not comply with the common rule of 1 user input to 1 game input.</li></ul>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Mouse Wheel Accelerator (Default: False)<br>Enables the Mouse Wheel Accelerator<br></li><li>Notches Per Second for Level 1 Acceleration (Default: 8)<br></li><li>Mouse Wheel Accelerator Level 1 Multiplier (Default: 2)<br>If the mouse wheel notches per second is between the level 1 threshold and the level 2 threshold, this multiplier is used.<br></li><li>Notches Per Second for Level 2 Acceleration (Default: 12)<br></li><li>Mouse Wheel Accelerator Level 2 Multiplier (Default: 3)<br>If the mouse wheel notches per second is between the level 2 threshold and the level 3 threshold, this multiplier is used.<br></li><li>Notches Per Second for Level 3 Acceleration (Default: 16)<br></li><li>Mouse Wheel Accelerator Level 3 Multiplier (Default: 4)<br>If the mouse wheel notches per second is greater than the level 3 threshold, this multiplier is used.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Virtual Touch Screen (\ud83d\udd90\ud83d\uddb5)</h2>Enable virtual touch screen.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>This feature is experimental and may not work as expected.  It requires the Kinect V2 hardware and compatible adapter for your system.  Beware of Kinect system requirements.<br></li><li>The Kinect V2 has been discontinued, but you can still find them at affordable prices along with PC power adapters of questionable authenticity.  I have looked into supporting other depth sensing products, but the ones I have encountered simply do not produce data of sufficient quality to use my algorithms.<br></li><li>You can get around the need for an adapter if you are capable of soldering on your own 12-volt power jack.  A cheap generic 12-volt power adapter may potentially cause problems with your device, but my troubles usually seem to be weak signal and electromagnetic interference.  By soldering on your own power jack, your data connection can be simplified to a single data cable, which is a far superior solution with regards to electromagnetic interference and signal resistance.  Using the official adapter, the signal has to flow through an additional data cable, an additional junction, and two additional metal to metal contacts, resulting in increased resistance and interference on the signal.  If you are afraid to solder the power jack on yourself, you might be able to find one at an online marketplace already done for you.<br></li><li>My personal experience is that most USB 3.0 hosts will not work correctly with the Kinect V2.  I have seen success with Renesis chipset USB 3.0 PCIe cards as well as Intel motherboard USB 3.0 ports.  The Renesis USB 3.0 PCIe cards I have used only require a PCIe3.0x1 slot, but I have only found it to be compatible with the Kinect when plugged into my x8 and x16 slots for unknown reasons, and even then, some of my x8 and x16 slots also did not work.</li></ul>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Virtual Touch Enabled (Default: False)<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Dead Zone (Default: 2)<br>Raising this value reduces the amount of shaking in virtual touches.<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Strictness (Default: 1)<br>This value controls how strict the tool is in tracking virtual touch information.<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Infrared Correction (Default: 1)<br>Infrared brightness information is used to filter out bad depth data.  Setting this to 0 effectively disables this feature.  Higher values make the infrared check more strict.  If you set this too high, the tool may lose track of your fingers more often.  If you set this too low, phantom touches may be triggered.<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Click Engage Threshold (Default: 1)<br>Reducing this value makes it easier to click with the virtual touch screen, but may increase the probability that you have unintentional clicks.<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Click Disengage Threshold (Default: 1)<br>Reducing this value makes it easier to release a click with the virtual touch screen, but may increase the probability that your click is released unintentionally.<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Click Depth Overlay (Default: False)<br>This overlay helps in diagnosing problems with using the virtual touch feature.  You can use it to see if you are too close or too far from the sensor.<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Camera Margin (Default: 330,180,310,180)<br>You can use the camera margin to zoom in the camera.  The camera does not match up perfectly to the depth sensor, so the sides may not work for touch detection.  By increasing the margin, you shrink the field of view of the camera which in turn can cut out non-functional areas.<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Sensor Margin (Default: 20,90,65,90)<br>The depth sensor may pick up lots of bad data near its edges.  Increasing the size of the margins can avoid bad edge data.  When used in conjunction with a properly sized camera margin, you can still touch the edges of the screen.<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Front Overlay (Default: True)<br>This overlay attempts to appear in front of all other windows.  This is almost necessary, as it shows you where your hands are pointing before you activate virtual touch detection.  This setting may not go into effect until you turn virtual touch off and on.<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Overlay Opacity (Default: 0.2)<br>Controls how transparent the front camera overlay is.  This setting may not go into effect until you turn virtual touch off and on.<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Back Underlay (Default: True)<br>The underlay has similar purposes to the overlay, except it tries to sit behind your windows, including your desktop icons.  This is more for style, as having a mostly transparent front layer and a fully opaque back layer gives the stylistic impression that you are behind a futuristic semi-transparent touchscreen.  Aside from its style purposes, it also can give you a better view of what you are doing without taking away screen real estate from other things, so I'd say leave it on if it isn't slowing you down.  This setting may not go into effect until you turn virtual touch off and on.  Only works when front overlay is also enabled.<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Zone (Default: 0,0,0,0)<br>This setting allows you to specify the coordinates on screen for the virtual touch zone.  If you have multiple monitors, the sliders might not get you to the values you need, in which case you will need to type in the values.  If you set all to 0, it will default to fill one of your monitors.<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Pause (Default: False)<br>When enabled, touch input from the virtual touch screen will be paused.<br></li><li>Touch Glitch Fix (Default: True)<br>Disables stylus handling in the tool GUI.  For almost a decade, users of WPF applications face issues with touch screens randomly not working in specific applications because of an apparant bug in stylus handling that has not been addressed.<br></li><li>Use Priority Virtual Touch Process (Default: True)<br>Runs virtual touch in a separate priority process to increase responsiveness.<br></li><li>Virtual Touch Process Priority (Default: Normal)<br>Select the desired priority for the virtual touch process.  I would be careful about selecting something higher than normal in this case, as the current algorithm can heavily use the CPU.  This process split is just as much designed to protect the rest of the tool from this feature as it is to protect the feature from the rest of the tool.<br> - Normal<br> - Idle<br> - High<br> - Real Time: Real Time priority processes will generally get all of the processing time they want, and if they want too much it can cause your system to become unstable.<br> - Below Normal<br> - Above Normal</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Glass Apps (\ud83d\udd8c\ud83d\udc7b)</h2>The Glass Apps feature will automatically make most windows have varying degrees of transparency depending on a variety of customizeable factors so that you can see through apps that you are not focused on.<br><br>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Glass Apps (Default: False)<br>When enabled, causes dynamic transparency in apps based on various configurable factors, including focus, prior focus, mouse position, and application type.<br></li><li>Glass Apps Default App Opacity (Default: 0.75)<br>Adjusts the transparency of the windows which are not already affected by another transparency option.  Values closer to 1 are less transparent.  Values closer to 0 are more transparent.<br></li><li>Glass Apps Current App Opacity (Default: 1)<br>Adjusts the transparency of the focused window.  Values closer to 1 are less transparent.  Values closer to 0 are more transparent.<br></li><li>Glass Apps Previous App Opacity (Default: 0.9)<br>Adjusts the transparency of the previously focused window.  Values closer to 1 are less transparent.  Values closer to 0 are more transparent.<br></li><li>Glass Apps Min Opacity (Default: 0.05)<br>This option sets the minimum amount of opacity (the maximum amount of transparency) that the tool will set for any app.  This prevents you from accidently making a window entirely invisible which can be tricky to restore.<br></li><li>Glass Apps Opaque Mouse Over (Default: True)<br>When enabled, the tool will remove transparency from windows while the mouse cursor is over them.<br></li><li>Glass Apps Video Auto Detection (Default: False)<br>If enabled, the tool will try to detect when windows are playing video and apply video specific transparency settings (no transparency by default).  Currently this feature only checks for an active audio session, and if found assumes there is video, so it will detect audio only windows as playing video also, and potentially not detect windows that are playing videos with no audio.  This is potentially helpful when the window title cannot reliably indicate whether or not you are looking at a video.<br></li><li>Glass Apps Video Title Indicators (Default: Vimeo, YouTube, Twitch)<br>If any of these terms are found in the title of a window, it will be considered a video window.<br></li><li>Glass Apps Video Title Indicator Exceptions (Default: Pandora, Spotify)<br>If any of these terms are found in the title of a window, it will not be considered a video window.  Also, these exceptions will override video auto detection when it is enabled.<br></li><li>Glass Apps Current Video App Opacity (Default: 1)<br>Adjusts the transparency of the focused window, overridden when video is detected.  Values closer to 1 are less transparent.  Values closer to 0 are more transparent.<br></li><li>Glass Apps Default Video App Opacity (Default: 1)<br>Adjusts the transparency of the video detected windows which are not already affected by another transparency option.  Values closer to 1 are less transparent.  Values closer to 0 are more transparent.<br></li><li>Start Menu Transparency Adjustments (Default: False)<br>This option can enable or prevent Simplode Suite from making adjustments to the Start Menu's transparency settings.

If disabled, all Smart Focus features will be disabled even if they are individually enabled.<br></li><li>Smart Focus General Apps (Default: True)<br>When focusing on most general applications, the application will be moved to the cursor if it is not near the cursor.  The application positioning will attempt to stay on a single monitor if possible.  This ensures that newly focused windows will appear on the monitor you are currently looking at, assuming that is where your cursor is.<br></li><li>Smart Focus General Apps From Taskbar (Default: True)<br>If you want your taskbar to trigger Smart Focus, enable this setting.<br></li><li>Smart Focus General Apps From Taskbar Preview Thumbnails (Default: Disabled)<br>Controls how Smart Focus behaves when clicking on a taskbar preview thumbnail.  When hovering over a taskbar preview thumbnail, the operating system illuminates the window that will be focused, which may draw your attention away from the cursor and to the window.<br> - Disabled<br> - Move Window to Cursor: The window will be moved to the cursor, which may be a bit jarring after the target window has been illuminated.<br> - Move Cursor to Title Bar: The cursor will automatically be moved to the title bar of the newly focused window, which will let you quickly grab it and move it if you want.<br> - Move Cursor To Center: The cursor will automatically be moved to the center of the newly focused window, which is likely where you are already looking, saving you a bit of time.<br></li><li>Smart Focus Pull Factor (Default: 1)<br>When set to 1, will center Smart Focused windows on the cursor.  When set to 0, will bring the closest edge of a Smart Focused window to the cursor.  Values in between will produce a margin effect.  This option does not effect some windows with special positioning.<br></li><li>Smart Focus Full Screen Apps (Default: False)<br>If disabled, full screen applications will be ignored by Smart Focus.<br></li><li>Smart Focus Task Switcher (Default: True)<br>The operating system's task switcher appears when pressing [Alt]+[Tab].  Enable this option to automatically move the task switcher to the monitor your mouse is on.<br></li><li>Smart Focus Start Menu (Default: True)<br>On standard multiple monitor setups, the start menu always launches on your primary monitor.  Enable this setting to dynamically position the start menu based on the location of your cursor.  This mainly helps when using the operating system key to launch the start menu, as manually clicking on the start button will naturally put the start menu where it would normally be.  The operating system also has a setting which allows you to place a taskbar on each monitor, and if you use that setting then you can open up the start menu on each screen without this tool so long as you are willing to have multiple taskbars.  That setting can be found by right clicking on the taskbar and going into &quot;Taskbar settings&quot;.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cursor Finder (\ud83d\uddb0?)</h2>Helps you keep track of your cursor.

You can get around this using the Unlock Drag Drop feature, or by running the application without administrative privileges.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Favorites Menu Add Ring (\u2605Ring+)</h2>Use this to add a new ring to your favorites menu.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Use the edit button in the flyout of your new ring to change the name and emblem.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Favorites Menu Add URL (\u2605URL+)</h2>Use this to select a file from your computer and add it to your favorites menu.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>You can also do this with drag and drop from your browser's URL box, but because of operating system security concerns, drag and drop may be forbidden between programs of different security levels.  You can get around this using the Unlock Drag Drop feature, or by running the application without administrative privileges.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Toggle Favorite (\u2605)</h2>Adds or removes the associated action or menu from your favorites menu.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>If the item is not in your favorites menu, it will be added to the root of your favorites menu.<br></li><li>If the item already in your favorites menu, it will be removed from your favorites menu.<br></li><li>Also contains a hierarchical listing of your favorites menu which you can use to add or remove the item in specific locations within your favorites menu.</li></ul>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Flyout Include Favorites Button (Default: True)<br>If enabled, flyouts will include a quick access favorites button.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Limit Simplode Suite RAM Usage (\u00a7\ud83d\udddc)</h2>Tell Simplode Suite to reduce its physical memory usage.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>This feature may be less useful than it appears.  Programs automatically use more memory than they need when extra memory is available and will release that memory when it is needed by other apps.  Limiting memory usage unnecessarily can be wasteful, but it can also be beneficial to already have the memory free when loading new apps or features, rather than having to unload old memory first before loading new memory.<br></li><li>This feature does not currently work with features that run in separate processes, but those features tend to use less memory than the main process anyways.</li></ul>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Automatic Memory Limiter (Default: False)<br>If enabled, the tool will try to automatically reduce the amount of physical memory it is using according to the selected target size.<br></li><li>Memory Usage Target Mebibytes (Default: 150)<br>Depending on which features of the tool you are using and your scaling/DPI settings, the minimum amount of memory necessary for the tool varies.  If this value is lower than the minimum required memory, there will be wasted effort unloading and then immediately reloading necessary resources.<br></li><li>Automatic Memory Limiter Interval (Default: 30)<br>This setting is the number of seconds the tool will wait between checks when the automatic memory limiter is enabled.<br></li><li>Individual Process Executable Names (Default: True)<br>When enabled, each coprocess will use its own separate executable file.  This makes it easier to identify specific types of Simplode Suite activity with other tools, such as the task manager.  You must restart the tool for changes to this setting to go into effect.  This setting has nearly zero cost, because nearly all of the code is located in library files which the processes share.  When I last checked, the individual executables files themselves are only around 14KB each.<br></li><li>Show Process Windows (Default: False)<br>When enabled, coprocesses will have visible windows.  This makes it easier to identify specific types of Simplode Suite activity when looking at them with other tools, such as the task manager, but may clutter your taskbar or screen in certain situations.  You must restart the tool for changes to this setting to go into effect.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Task Menu (\u2756\u29c2)</h2>Contains currently active apps.<br><br>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Task Ring Focus Ordering (Default: True)<br>If enabled, the most recently focused app will always be moved to the last position in the task ring and task menu.<br></li><li>Task Ring Include Task View (Default: True)<br>If enabled, task view action will be available in the task ring.  The task view action will open your operating system's task viewer, if available.<br></li><li>Dirty Chromium Icon Integration (Default: False)<br>When enabled, it checks the URLs of your Chrome windows to retrieve individual icons for them.  Beware that this feature inspects the URLs you are visiting and requests the icon from the associated website.<br></li><li>Dirty Chromium Icon Integration Page Specific (Default: False)<br>Tries to parse contents of URLs from Chrome windows to find page specific icons for them.  Beware that this feature inspects the URLs you are visiting and requests the page and the icon from the associated page.  Sometimes Chrome does not react well to the integration, so if Chrome starts freezing up on you, you should try to turn this off and see if it improves.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Task View (\u25a6\u2756)</h2>Opens your operating system's task viewer.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Only works on operating systems that have a built-in task viewer.<br></li><li>Simply sends [\u2756]+[Tab], which is the default operating system hotkey for opening its task viewer.</li></ul>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Task Ring Include Task View (Default: True)<br>If enabled, task view action will be available in the task ring.  The task view action will open your operating system's task viewer, if available.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Default Window Menu (\u231c)</h2>Opens the default window corner menu.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Simply sends [Alt]+[Space], which is the standard hotkey for opening the classic corner menu.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Disable Focus (\ud83d\uddd4 NO ACTIVATE)</h2>Disables focus for the target/active window.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fake Focus (\ud83d\uddd4Fake Focus)</h2>Sends the window a fake focus message and attempts to bind the keyboard to it until you press escape.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>You might need to get creative to find a use case for this.  Some apps stop working when they lose focus, so you might want to use this to access another app while avoiding this.<br></li><li>Internet browsers and some other complicated programs seem to be incompatible with this feature at this time.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Lock Window Minimum Size (\u2bd0)</h2>Locks in the current dimensions of the window as its minimum dimensions.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The minimum dimension lock is only effective in joined window groups where it prevents windows from getting squished during automatic adjustments.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Memory Limit App (\ud83d\uddd4\ud83d\udddc)</h2>Tell the focused app to reduce its physical memory usage.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>This feature may appear more useful than it really is.  Programs use more memory than they need when extra memory is available and will release that memory when it is needed by other apps.  Limiting memory usage unnecessarily can be wasteful.  Ultimately no matter how smart the computer thinks it is at managing your memory, it is possible that you know better how you plan to use your apps, and for that reason I included this feature despite its dubious merits.<br></li><li>The limit works more like a suggestion, where the system will override the limit to give more memory when necessary.</li></ul>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>App Memory Usage Default Target Mebibytes (Default: 150)<br>When setting memory targets for other apps, this value will be used as the default target value.<br></li><li>Automatic App Memory Limiter (Default: False)<br>If enabled, the tool will try to automatically reduce the amount of physical memory that the apps you have selected are using according to their respective target sizes.<br></li><li>Automatic App Memory Limiter Interval (Default: 30)<br>This setting is the number of seconds the tool will wait between checks when managing the memory usage of other applications.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Raw Window Details (\ud83d\udee0)</h2>View and edit raw details of the active window.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>It is easy to break running programs by changing these settings.  You probably don't really want to change these.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Move Window (\u21f3\u2b04)</h2>Move the window.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Not compatible with either Multi Touch Window Resize or Mouse Right Button Chord Resize features.  These features must be initiated using the window title bar dragging.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Resize Window (\u21f2)</h2>Resize the window.<br><br>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Multi Touch Window Resize (Default: True)<br>When moving a window with a multi-touch capable device, you can resize using an additional touch.  The top left corner of the window will be moved according to your first touch, and the bottom right corner of the window will be moved according to your second touch, so you can effectively pinch the window smaller or stretch the window bigger with two fingers.  When using touch interfaces, this method may be much easier than trying to precisely touch a window's edge for resizing, as the top bar of a window is usually set aside for movement and is much larger than the resizable window edges.<br></li><li>Input Grabber (Default: True)<br>If enabled, the program will use an invisible window at times to capture input for some features.  If disabled, some features will not be able to work.<br></li><li>Mouse Right Button Chord Resize (Default: Dynamic)<br>When moving a window, you can resize it by additionally pressing the right mouse button.  This means you will start by clicking the top bar for movement like normal, but you will then press the right mouse button also, having both the left mouse button and the right mouse button pressed at the same time, like a musical chord of notes.  When you do this, the window will anchor at the corner farthest from the cursor, allowing you to expand or contract the window at the closest corner.  This method may be easier than trying to precisely click on a window's edge for resizing, as the top bar of a window is usually set aside for movement and is much larger than the resizable window edges.<br> - Disabled<br> - Dynamic: Mouse Chord Resize will anchor to the farthest corner of the window from the start position.<br> - Bottom Right: Mouse Chord Resize will anchor to the bottom right corner of the window.<br> - Top Left: Mouse Chord Resize will anchor to the top left corner of the window.<br> - Top Right: Mouse Chord Resize will anchor to the top right corner of the window.<br> - Bottom Left: Mouse Chord Resize will anchor to the bottom right corner of the window.<br></li><li>Resize Window Override Min Max (Default: False)<br>When enabled, the Resize Window action will ignore minimum and maximum window sizes.  You might end up making a window unusable if this is enabled.<br></li><li>Resize Window Context Inclusion (Default: True)<br>Some windows in the tool do not have large enough borders to make them drag resizable.  When enabled, this option tries to include a resize button in relevant menus for these windows.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Minimize (\ud83d\uddd5)</h2>Minimizes the window's group.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>You can also use the standard window minimize button.  The [Shift]+[\u2756Windows]+[Down] hotkey is built into the operating system.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Maximize (\ud83d\uddd6)</h2>Maximizes the window with its group.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>You can also use the standard window maximize button.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Close Window (\ud83d\uddd4\u274c)</h2>Asks the active window to close normally.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>If you recently switched windows, the first request is ignored as a safety precaution.  The safety precaution turns off temporarily after activation, allowing you to go on a window closing spree if you want.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Super Close Window (\ud83d\uddd4\u274c!)</h2>Attempts to forcibly terminate the foreground process (window).<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Sometimes a program refuses to close and prevents usage of the task manager.  For these times, there is Super Close.<br></li><li>WARNING: May cause instability.  However, when a program refuses to close, you might consider it already unstable, right?<br></li><li>You should take care to remember the hotkey so you can use it when a program has you trapped.<br></li><li>For unresponsive applications which cannot take foreground focus, you can use this feature through secondary targeting by holding left click on the Super Close Window button and then right clicking on the unresponsive window.<br></li><li>If this does not work for some reason, consider trying the logout hotkey.<br></li><li>If recently switched windows, the first attempt is ignored as a safety precaution.  The safety precaution turns off temporarily after activation, allowing you to go on a window destroying spree if you want.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ghost Window (\ud83d\uddd4\ud83d\udc7b\u261e)</h2>Toggles window click-through.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Click-through windows allow clicks and touches to pass through them.<br></li><li>Toggling this off is a bit tricky.  To make it easier you can use the Unghost All Windows (\u274c\ud83d\udc7b) feature.  There are a couple ways you could do this for a specific window.  Clicking the button will impact the active window, so you could activate the window first using the task ring or the task bar.  Alternatively, click the button and hold the click as if you are dragging the button.  While you keep the left mouse button pressed, you can right click on any window to perform the action on it.  This works with most window targeted actions.</li></ul>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Ghost Window Control Key Target Toggle (Default: True)<br>When enabled, holding the control key while performing a secondary action can select ghost windows.  The ghost window action itself will be affected in reverse, as it can select ghost windows by default.  For reference, a secondary action is performed by holding a click on an action button and then using the other mouse button to click on a window.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Always on Top Toggle (\ud83d\uddd4\u234f)</h2>Toggles always on top mode for the active window.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Click Through Overlay (\ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\uddd4\u234f)</h2>Converts a window into a click through overlay window.<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Click through overlay windows are partially transparent, sit on top of other windows, and do not respond to mouse clicks.<br></li><li>You can also achieve the same results using a combination of other Simplode Suite features, but this feature conveniently manages all aspects in one action.<br></li><li>This feature has a sliding secondary action for controlling the amount of transparency of the window.<br></li><li>Sliding secondary actions can be triggered in two ways.  Secondary actions are available when you click and hold your primary mouse button on an action button.  You can then move your mouse to your target and then also click and hold the secondary mouse button, where moving your mouse left, right, up and down will make adjustments based on the action.  On multi-touch capable touch screens, you can trigger a sliding secondary action by holding one finger on the action button and then sliding another finger on your target.</li></ul>Settings:<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Click Through Overlay Default Opacity (Default: 0.6)<br>This option adjusts how transparent a click through overlay window will be.  A value of 0 will be entirely invisible, and a value of 1 will be fully opaque.</li></ul>","developers":["Simplode LLC"],"fullgame":{"appid":"1242710","name":"Simplode Suite"},"genres":[{"description":"Casual","id":"4"},{"description":"Utilities","id":"57"}],"header_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1403380/header.jpg?t=1606288960","is_free":false,"linux_requirements":[],"mac_requirements":[],"name":"Simplode Suite - Free Select","package_groups":[],"packages":[505113],"pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10</li></ul>"},"platforms":{"linux":false,"mac":false,"windows":true},"publishers":["Simplode LLC"],"ratings":{"dejus":{"rating":"l"}},"release_date":{"coming_soon":false,"date":"29 Sep, 2020"},"required_age":0,"screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1403380/ss_d5cccd20f5f34a246ea70169e79c3993ddcb572e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1606288960","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1403380/ss_d5cccd20f5f34a246ea70169e79c3993ddcb572e.600x338.jpg?t=1606288960"}],"short_description":"Free Select allows you to choose any one premium feature from Simplode Suite to have absolutely free!
