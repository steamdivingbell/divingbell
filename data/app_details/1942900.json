We DO NOT coddle you.  We grew up going from Atari 2600 in the 80s to the NES in the 90s facing the real Mike Tyson in <i>Punch-Out!</i>, trying to kill <i>Jaws</i> in the NES game, fighting through hordes of evil in <i>Ghosts N' Goblins</i>, and understanding the sewer system in the OG <i>TMNT</i>, all without hand-holding, YouTube to bail us out, or smart phones to give us every answer at the touch of a button.  We want you to laugh at the jokes, enjoy the game at your own pace, but also to feel a sense of accomplishment when you beat an opponent.  We want you to remember what it's like to have to scoot up to the screen, turn your hat backwards, and actually focus to beat a boss.  We're not for everyone, we know that, and we want it that way.  All that being said, we designed Retro KO! to make you <strong>LAUGH</strong>.  So, sit back, grab a adult beverage of choice and see if you're tough enough to make your way through the Venereousville Boxing ranks and defeat Tike Myson for all the glory!<br><br>_________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>VB Retro Knock-Out! is the first prequel chapter to <i>VanillaBeast: Ace in the Hole</i>.
