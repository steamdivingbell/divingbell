Centuries later, you wake up to a world that is physically broken in half, and a blight of undulating flesh is writhing from its core and overcoming the last remnants of civilization. As the Galvanized, it's all on you to beat back the flesh blight, and protect your city from the encroaching threat. Do you have what it takes, or will you be assimilated like the rest?

There are alternate firing modes for each weapon. Try right clicking with each for a hefty variety of combat and movement options!<br><br>Slag Gun - The primary fire punches 6 holes into a disk of compacted slag at supersonic speeds, creating a short range kinetic burst for for clearing your immediate surroundings. The alt-fire launches a grenade for lobbing around corners and behind enemy cover.<br><br>Chain Gun - A rotary assault weapon fed by a quantum hypercapacity magazine designed to deliver a steady stream of hollow point ammunition to any cellular life the user wishes to shred. The alt-fire is a grappling chain that embeds itself into fleshy surfaces in the environment, you can raise or lower yourself on the chain with the scroll wheel for an extended range of movement.<br><br>Rocket Gun - The primary fire delivers a payload of high explosive charges that are effective against foes with heavy armor or metalic bodies. The alt fire activates a spacetime moebius strip at the rocket's current position, essentially freezing it in mid air. Use this to charge a barage for clearing many enemies at once. <br><br>Burr Gun - A mysterious flesh blight organism that turns out to make a great improvised weapon for the Galvanized. It spits a small spikey lifeform out of what most would assume is a mouth. The alt-fire allows the weilder to control the position of the Burr psychokinetically to pummel any target. The more lifeforms it spits out, the more effective the attack, however spawning these creatures takes time that must be used to evade enemy attack.<br><br>Far Gun - A long range, rotary duel barreled rifle with sensor driven anti-recoil motors for pinpoint accuracy at 8,000 yards in any condition.
