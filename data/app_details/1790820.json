{"about_the_game":"<strong>This game is currently in development</strong><br><br>Dead-End Dungeons is a fantasy 3D, random dungeon generator featuring a turn-based, combination-focused battle system, and hundreds of possible random encounters.  Each time players enter the dungeon, it builds randomly, so you'll never explore the same dungeon twice!   Command a team of 3 heroes and try and survive the dungeon!  <br><br>Use your character's abilities to battle progressively challenging minions and mini-bosses.  Combine your abilities to form deadly combinations in battle. <br>Level up your heroes to unlock new abilities, weapons, &amp; combination possibilities.    <br>Find the Boss Room &amp; defeat the dungeon boss for gold and rewards, or die in the dungeon and lose everything...   <br><br>Dead-End Dungeons features 4 starting heroes to chose from, and many more to unlock (and more heroes to be added in the future).    Players can expect to find gold, powerful weapons, magical trinkets, damaging traps, mysterious portals, debilitating curses, tough mini-bosses, hidden secret rooms and treasure, and a few other surprises that randomly occur in every dungeon.  <br><br><strong>Made in Unity-3D</strong>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1790820/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1719439183","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1790820/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1719439183","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1790820/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1719439183","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1790820/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1719439183","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>This game is currently in development</strong><br><br>Dead-End Dungeons is a fantasy 3D, random dungeon generator featuring a turn-based, combination-focused battle system, and hundreds of possible random encounters.
