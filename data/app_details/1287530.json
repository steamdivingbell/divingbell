In order to do this, you will zone out plots, build houses, determine taxation policies, set priorities, and grow the supply chain alongside your population.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1287530/extras/02_timelapse.gif?t=1726488373\" /><br><br><strong>Families are the centrepiece of Lords and Villeins. </strong> Their profession dictates their occupation in the economy and the kind of businesses they can run. Once you assign them a plot of land and build their house, they will do so almost completely autonomously, all the while managing their stock, setting aside produce to pay taxes, and trading with other families and caravans for supplies and to maximise their profit. <br><br><strong>Your role is to direct and regulate the economy. </strong>Balance the supply and demand, secure critical resources, and maintain stable growth. Lords and Villeins offers you a sandbox with an in-depth simulation and a great variety of strategies to manage it! Ranging from a fully communist economy where all produce is taxed and redistributed from your warehouse to a free marketplace with little to no intervention. <br><br><strong>Logistics will challenge your management skills.</strong> As your settlement grows, you need to keep in mind the travelling distances, storage placements, private markets, and housing while reflecting on the terrain and its natural resources in order to fully optimise the productivity of each villager.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1287530/extras/03_zones.gif?t=1726488373\" /><br><br><strong>Highly customizable gameplay </strong>lets you craft the exact kind of game that fits your taste!
