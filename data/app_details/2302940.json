After successful registration, you can bind a mobile phone number, and under the premise of complying<br />\r\n<br />\r\nwith the platform rules, you can change the bound mobile phone number. JUMPWORK has the right to stipulate the prerequisite<br />\r\n<br />\r\nconditions, the number of accounts that can be registered, and other related matters for the auxiliary registration of a new JUMPWORK<br />\r\n<br />\r\naccount through an existing JUMPWORK account, as displayed on the product page.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJUMPWORK has the right to change the registration and binding methods of accounts based on user needs or product requirements.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n7.1.2 The ownership of the JUMPWORK account belongs to JUMPWORK. After completing the registration procedures, users only<br />\r\n<br />\r\nobtain the right to use the JUMPWORK account, and this right only belongs to the initial applicant.

Non-initial applicants may not use the JUMPWORK account through gifting, inheritance, renting, transferring, or any<br />\r\n<br />\r\nother means.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n7.1.3 Users are responsible for properly safeguarding their registered account information and passwords and are legally accountable for all<br />\r\n<br />\r\nactions taken under the registered account and password. Users agree not to disclose account and password information to others under any<br />\r\n<br />\r\ncircumstances. If you suspect someone is using your account, you should immediately notify JUMPWORK. If you register a new<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJUMPWORK account with the assistance of an existing JUMPWORK account, JUMPWORK may, for the purpose of ensuring your<br />\r\n<br />\r\naccount security, require you to use the aforementioned \"existing JUMPWORK account\" for related auxiliary operations, including but not<br />\r\n<br />\r\nlimited to auxiliary login, password recovery, account freezing, and submitting appeals. If you bind the new JUMPWORK account to a<br />\r\n<br />\r\ndifferent mobile phone number than the one associated with the aforementioned \"existing JUMPWORK account,\" the aforementioned \"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nexisting JUMPWORK account\" will lose the ability to perform related auxiliary operations for the new JUMPWORK account, and this<br />\r\n<br />\r\naction is irreversible, so you should proceed with caution.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n7.1.4 When registering for an JUMPWORK account using a mobile phone number, the system will automatically assign you an<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJUMPWORK ID. You can set your JUMPWORK ID and, under certain conditions, modify it according to the guidance on the relevant<br />\r\n<br />\r\nfunction page.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n7.1.5 When using specific services or features of the software client, you may be required to create or register a new account (hereinafter<br />\r\n<br />\r\nreferred to as a \"functional account\") based on your JUMPWORK account. You must follow specific requirements for operation. Unless<br />\r\n<br />\r\notherwise stated or permitted in writing by JUMPWORK, the ownership of the aforementioned account also belongs to JUMPWORK.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter creating or registering the account, the user only obtains the right to use the account, and this right also only belongs to the initial<br />\r\n<br />\r\napplicant. The initial applicant shall not gift, borrow, rent, transfer, or sell the account, nor permit non-initial applicants to use the account in<br />\r\n<br />\r\nany other way. Non-initial applicants may not use the account through gifting, inheritance, renting, transferring, or any other means.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n7.1.6 If you do not log in to your registered JUMPWORK account or functional account for an extended period, JUMPWORK has the<br />\r\n<br />\r\nright to reclaim the account to avoid resource waste. Any losses incurred as a result are the sole responsibility of the user.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n7.2 User Considerations<br />\r\n<br />\r\n7.2.1 You understand and agree that to provide you with effective services, this software may use your terminal device's processor and<br />\r\n<br />\r\nbandwidth resources.
