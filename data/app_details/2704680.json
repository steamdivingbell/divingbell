{"about_the_game":"You play as <strong>Swole Mole</strong> and despite his name he's not all that strong, that's why he's gonna need your help so that he can retrieve the ancient spell book, stolen from him by evil rats. So join Mole in this epic boss rush through multiple beautifully hand drawn worlds to stop those rats and their king before they take over Mole's homeland or worse THE WORLD!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Boss Battles</strong></h2>We all know that boss fights are the best part of any game so why not have them be the game. Every level is a boss fight of epic scale and difficulty with colorful and unique bosses that you can fight in any order to keep you from ever filling stuck on any given one.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Multiple Options</strong></h2>Nobody plays games the same way so why be restricted to a single fight style.<br><strong>Close Courters Fighting</strong> Get close and personal with your enemy for high damage at the cost of a higher risk of being damaged.<br><strong>Long Range Projectiles &amp; Attacks</strong> Throw rocks, create large shockwaves with your rump, or shoot bullets at your enemies to avoid getting to deep into the action so you can stay at safe distance at the cost of damage.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Traditionally Drawn Animations</strong></h2>All game backgrounds and animations are drawn traditionally which means each and every frame is drawn by hand on paper then inked before being scanned and colored digitally all to give a beautiful look that can't be replicated any other way. This style of drawing is much slower and more difficult but it gives the game a timeless and organic look with tiny flaws within every line making the game feel that much more lively and natural.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2704680/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1702193123","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2704680/page.bg.jpg?t=1702193123","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2704680/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1702193123","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2704680/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1702193123","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Captions available","id":13}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"You play as <strong>Swole Mole</strong> and despite his name he's not all that strong, that's why he's gonna need your help so that he can retrieve the ancient spell book, stolen from him by evil rats.
