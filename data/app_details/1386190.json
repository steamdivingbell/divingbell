{"about_the_game":"<strong>Blueprint?</strong><br>Fishhead: Blueprint is the fourth main game in the Fishhead platformer series. The game picks up where Fishhead 2 (2002) ended.

Most of these doors lead to levels, some to other locations. In most levels you have to collect usb-keys to open doors, find switches, collect hammers and defeat enemies. Some levels have light puzzles, others have mini bosses. The game has around 40 enemies and other dangers.  You can get new moves (like wall-jumping and swimming) in labs, opening new parts of the game. In some levels you get help from a goose, which somehow stumbled into the game. He will fly you to places, or you can ride him when he is too lazy to fly. The game features simple but tidy, low-res pixel art graphics and a very limited palette. The music and sounds are chiplike. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1386190/extras/fhbgif04s.gif?t=1597740506\" /> <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1386190/extras/fhbgif05s.gif?t=1597740506\" /> <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1386190/extras/fhbgif06s.gif?t=1597740506\" /><br><br>Features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Large overworld to explore </li><li>Traditional platform action</li><li>Over 40 levels and other locations</li><li>Over 40 enemies and other dangers</li><li>Alternative exits to unlock secret parts of the game</li><li>Old-school pixel art</li><li>Bonus games</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1386190/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1597740506","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1386190/page.bg.jpg?t=1597740506","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1386190/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1597740506","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1386190/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1597740506","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Blueprint?</strong><br>Fishhead: Blueprint is the fourth main game in the Fishhead platformer series.
