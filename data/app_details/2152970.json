{"about_the_game":"Absorb is a reverse horror game in which you are a hungry amorphous blob monster from a recently discovered planet. The explorers who found you had no idea you would hitch a ride onboard their ship and begin eating your way through their space station base in pursuit of the stolen core. As the blob, bounce and maneuver your way through distinct environments in this single player 2D physics platformer where you will devour any hostile forces you can and avoid, through careful positioning and aiming, the ones you can't. Fling yourself across the station, dodging hazards and eating enemies you encounter along the way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe controls are simple, aim and click to launch yourself through the air. Grow and shrink as you eat and take damage to affect your flightpath.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2152970/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1663396154","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2152970/page.bg.jpg?t=1663396154","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2152970/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1663396154","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2152970/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1663396154","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Absorb is a reverse horror game in which you are a hungry amorphous blob monster from a recently discovered planet.
