During the day, they carry out their tasks, acting like regular villagers to prevent suspicion and gain trust. However, during the night, they reveal their true identities and conspire to take control of the village, orchestrating schemes to sow discord, disrupt the village, and pit the villagers against each other by using their unique abilities.<br><br>Traitors adopt an extremely self-centered approach, not playing with anyone throughout the game, even considering other traitors as threats. Their goal is to win the game by eliminating everyone else, seizing control of the village, and being the last one standing.
