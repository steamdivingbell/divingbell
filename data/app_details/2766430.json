{"about_the_game":"The MXR is a 3D animation tool designed to empower creators with no-code high fidelity VFX tools for concerts, live events and broadcast. Current industry standard tools are pixel based, but MXR uses geometry and advanced 3D geometry, FX, simulations, shaders, and post processing. MXR represents a massive generational leap forward for VJs, live visual designers, broadcast design and XR. Using LFOs and external data inputs such as Midi, OSC and DMX, creators can automate a variety of FX and parameters to create dynamic environments for use as audio reactive or interactive real-time visuals. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn short, MXR is revolutionizing live visual creation by leveraging the best of tools like Blender, Unreal Engine and Resolume into one dynamic and responsive creator tool.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2766430/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735841521","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2766430/page.bg.jpg?t=1735841521","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2766430/0dece31351556ac1dfbd8abc7256ee3b59dadf1a/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735841521","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2766430/0dece31351556ac1dfbd8abc7256ee3b59dadf1a/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735841521","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3188390,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"The MXR is a 3D animation tool designed to empower creators with no-code high fidelity VFX tools for concerts, live events and broadcast.
