The current build allows you to play the <strong>5 day challenge mode </strong>where you complete tasks for your colleagues and try to earn the Insert Name Here Inc's Junior Office Assistant contract. And if you get it now you can tell everyone you know <i>'Hey you know that 5 Days game, yeah I was there at the beginning before it sold out!'</i> <br><br><strong>Hey wait, is there a story hidden in this game?</strong> - Well observed my clever little duck! The current build of 5 Days, Minimum Wage is focused on winning the contract to be the Junior Office Assistant for Insert Name Here Inc while introducing clues and easter eggs that hint at a much larger story. In future updates I hope to develop these storylines further, opening up multiple narratives that will unfold depending on the path the player chooses.<br><br><strong>Why are there no Achievements enabled, I need validation!</strong> - The focus so far in development of 5 Days, Minimum Wage has been to deliver a game that introduces the core concepts, mechanics and themes of the game. But, I see you, and yes, I hope to include Achievements, and Rewards in future updates that will acknowledge the progress you've made.<br><br><strong>Optimization</strong> - Look its embarrassing to admit, but we all have performance issues from time to time. You know what I mean - it all works great when your playing alone, but as soon as you try it in the real world, it doesn't quite work out the way you imagined it would. <br>All joking aside, I have worked incredibly hard to ensure the best possible experience for everyone. At time of writing there are no known bugs or game breaking glitches, but I welcome feedback from the community and hope to address any quality of life issues that may occur within future updates. <br><br><strong>Character Creation</strong> - We all love dressing up and expressing ourselves and whilst 5 Days, Minimum Wage features a character creation system with a wide range of choices to make already I want more! I am hoping to release seasonal, themed and quirky costume choices in future updates.<br><br><strong>I am a Gamer God and I demand a suitable challenge</strong> - Hey, I hear you, but let me explain. The current build of 5 Days, Minimum Wage was developed so it can be accessible to all players. Think of it as more of a proof of concept. If there is the demand within the community then I hope to release a number of game modes designed to challenge even the greatest God of Gaming, including -  <br><br><strong>ENDLESS</strong> - In this game mode the player will advance into week 2 where there will be more task to complete and the level of difficulty will increase week after week. <br><br><strong>VS</strong> - Sabotage, undercut, and step on everyone you know and love to get to the top! <br><br><strong>You say future updates a lot, but when?</strong> - Well, that's a good question. The date for the full release will be *<i>mumble mumble inaudible sounds</i>....... <br>The honest answer is I am chomping at the bit to get this updates out! But, as I've said elsewhere I am a team of one - a genuinely independent developer and delivery will depend on the support I receive from the community. There are lots of ways to support the project - purchasing the game or wish listing it right here on Steam. Tell your friends and family to do the same - reach out to your favourite Streamer / Youtuber and ask them to check the game out! Believe me, it all helps.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Early Bird","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2912450/b464a22f5ea58abfd919e78618879675f5456514.jpg"}],"total":1},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2912450/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1719202854","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2912450/page.bg.jpg?t=1719202854","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2912450/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1719202854","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2912450/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1719202854","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>5 Days, Minimum Wage</strong> is all about working in an office and nothing else.
