{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What is NovaMundi?</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">NovaMundi is an open-world exploration game with tactical combat, in which you lead a group of warriors to traverse the ever-changing dangerous lands of the Andes in the XVI Century.  Build your reputation to recruit people in towns, explore mysterious caverns filled with dangerous spirits to gain the blessings of the lands, barter for supplies to survive, and use diplomacy to unite your people against the invaders.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1370940/extras/battle.gif?t=1732197177\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The people of the Muisca territory stand divided and are also constantly threatened by the nearby Panche, Muzo, and more. In this scenario, a run-down group of Spanish explorers has reached their land and seeks to profit from these divisions and conflicts to make alliances and ultimately gain control of it. It's up to your group to unite the Muisca and prepare for the upcoming invasion.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1370940/extras/bugsCaves.jpg?t=1732197177\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Deep in the dark caverns of these mountains, the fabric of reality is torn apart: the spirits of the land are angry, and they will test whoever invades these sacred places.

Maybe you\u2019d like to freshen the experience\u2026 NovaMundi has a perk system that allows you to tailor your experience to your wants and needs instead of an arbitrary difficulty system. Maybe you don\u2019t want to play with diseases, or you\u2019d like the challenge of only being able to use one kind of troop, or starting without any gold. Maybe you\u2019re a fan of Andean wildlife and would like to recruit the help of jaguars and spectacled bears. You can do it with perks. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Real-time battles with big warbands and big consequences: NovaMundi has a satisfying combat system in which you can battle many different units against big enemy groups. Battle several dozen Muisca warriors of several classes, archers, and beasts against Panche raiders and Spanish invaders. Face archers against melee fighters and protect your frontline using guardians. Each individual is unique; if wounded they will need several days to heal, and if they die\u2026 There is no escape from the cold embrace of death. </p></li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1370940/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732197177","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1370940/page.bg.jpg?t=1732197177","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1370940/20e809db51eca25b42177832c466ad5031a5232e/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732197177","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1370940/20e809db51eca25b42177832c466ad5031a5232e/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732197177","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What is NovaMundi?</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">NovaMundi is an open-world exploration game with tactical combat, in which you lead a group of warriors to traverse the ever-changing dangerous lands of the Andes in the XVI Century.
