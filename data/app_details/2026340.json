Relive the glory of the retro console era in the spirit of the classic Atari while experiencing heart-pounding platforming and shoot 'em up action.

Gameplay is rooted in classics like MegaMan, Metal Slug, and Sunset Riders (but with adorable unicorns) and an absurd plot inspired by classic cartoons like Rick and Morty and The Simpsons.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2026340/extras/ezgif.com-gif-maker__5_.gif?t=1666646641\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fast-paced, relentless platforming action<br></li><li>Fully voiced characters starring Olivia Vidas and Christina Costello<br></li><li>Amazing 1-bit retro art style<br></li><li>Original Soundtrack by Jaggy Fox<br></li><li>16 Screen Filling Bosses!<br></li><li>Over 40 Levels of bullet hell madness<br></li><li>8 Unique worlds to explore and destroy<br></li><li>16 Tools for destruction</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2026340/extras/ezgif.com-gif-maker__4_.gif?t=1666646641\" /><br><br>The Unichrome prototype was originally created in just 3 days as part of WGJ 28 with the theme &quot;Rainbow Unicorn&quot;.
