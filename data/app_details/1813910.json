{"about_the_game":"Screaming Loaf is a wacky 2D action-puzzle-platform game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Fiendish Fillings want to become a sandwich, the Terrible Toasters want something to grill, the Bothersome Birds want to fill their stomachs, and the Malicious Mould wants to make something rot. Loaf just wants to sit on his bread board in peace, but in order to do so, he'll have to destroy everything that is out to get him... by screaming at them!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach level has you play as Loaf with the objective to destroy all enemies by screaming at them. To control Loaf you use 5 buttons; move left, move right, scream, jump, and drop a slice. Different enemies have different strengths, so some may require prolonged screaming to eliminate. Screaming is not only good for damaging enemies, Loaf's scream can also propel himself across water, activate levers, inflate balloons, and more. Loaf is made up of 5 bread slices, Loaf has the ability to drop screaming slices off his back and re-join with them later. More points are scored for completing levels quickly, so strategically dropping slices next to where enemies are about to spawn will help to defeat them more efficiently. Figuring out where to drop slices plays a big part in the game's puzzle solving. Slices also act as health, a slice is lost from Loaf upon enemy collision. Beware though, each slice you drop gives Loaf one less slice of protection; if you touch an enemy with no slices attached, it is game over.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nScreaming Loaf features 172 unique levels of puzzles, action, and platforming, with many different enemies to scream at and a variety of obstacles to overcome. The game is spread across 4 stories with humorous cutscenes between each chapter. You can also unlock accessories for Loaf, just for fun!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Complete Story A","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1813910/b8c6e989f89822ad76d08fb588e9cfa6305ad5ce.jpg"},{"name":"Complete Story B","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1813910/ddcb9c87c76c4311f3254ed264dfc43540c12848.jpg"},{"name":"Complete Story C","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1813910/81de02ea1cc6d85b13095cf3c5734fbbe36b6757.jpg"},{"name":"Complete Story D","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1813910/fd89a6ac26775e9f676b05b89026d2bfcaab7396.jpg"},{"name":"Unlock all accessories","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1813910/102b23edeb65aee0dec65bca60dff8c0888dee22.jpg"},{"name":"Get 3 stars in every level","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1813910/55ed768b3b300f1391d6cc8384bd5f39d1b65f10.jpg"}],"total":6},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813910/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735578033","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813910/page.bg.jpg?t=1735578033","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813910/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735578033","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813910/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735578033","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":3133720,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Screaming Loaf is a wacky 2D action-puzzle-platform game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Fiendish Fillings want to become a sandwich, the Terrible Toasters want something to grill, the Bothersome Birds want to fill their stomachs, and the Malicious Mould wants to make something rot.
