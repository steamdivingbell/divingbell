{"about_the_game":"Armored Tussle is a roguelike twin-stick shooter where you control the elite tomcat battle tank pilots through a series of procedurally generated missions behind enemy lines, completing objectives, collecting upgrades and defeating any enemies that stand in your way.<br><br>You have to complete a enough mission objectives to win the operation, but to complete a mission you have to successfully evacuate the map. Failing to do so means you lose that pilot and all their tank\u2019s upgrades, and any completed objectives on that mission. Do you take what you\u2019ve got and get out, or try and score big first.<br><br>Each mission, the enemy grows stronger and more resistant, but you and your pilots will be up to the task, because you\u2019re the best of the best. You might be behind enemy lines, but they\u2019re trapped down there with you.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2647090/extras/SteamTitle_Operations.png?t=1706800809\" /><br>An operation is a campaign of individual missions. To win, you have to complete a minimum number of objectives. You will fail the operation if you lose too many objectives such that you can\u2019t meet the minimum anymore, or if you lose all your pilots. To win a mission you must complete the minimum number of objectives within and successfully evacuate your pilot. You fail a mission by not completing enough objectives, not evacuating the mission in time, or getting your pilot killed.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2647090/extras/SteamTitle_Tomcat.png?t=1706800809\" /><br>You, the Lieutenant, command your pilot and their tank through the map, using the main cannon and coaxial machine gun as your weapons. Each can be improved with permanent upgrades found in the level, which carry from mission to mission as long as the tank is still alive. Bolster the tomcat with addons, limited use powers that grant additional tactical abilities, such as a rocket launcher barrage, active defense shield, or deploying a barrier for protection.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2647090/extras/SteamTitle_Enemies.png?t=1706800809\" /><br>When you hit the ground, there is a roster of enemy units that might be deployed in the map. From tanks to troopers, all of them have unique attacks, and must be handled properly to avoid taking too much damage. As the operation progresses, the enemy will deploy stronger, more seasoned units to fight you, making even the weakest enemies a challenge later in the game.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2647090/extras/SteamTitle_CustomMaps.png?t=1706800809\" /><br>Armored Tussle also ships with a small python app called Tussle Tiler! It allows you to draw your own mission maps and load them in game. You can also download other player\u2019s maps (which are saved as .CSV files) and load them in your game as well.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2647090/extras/SteamTitle_Features.png?t=1706800809\" /><br>The game features a swath of paint jobs to let you customize your tomcat, as well as color options for both you and the enemy faction. Earn new paint jobs by completing achievements. Check the codex for more information on different units, enemies, objectives, tiles and other parts of the game world. And view your player stats to see just how much carnage you\u2019ve managed to accrue.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2647090/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1706800809","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2647090/page.bg.jpg?t=1706800809","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2647090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1706800809","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2647090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1706800809","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Stats","id":15}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"The game contains the use of stylized military weapons, which shoot and kill combatants, including stylized gore.
