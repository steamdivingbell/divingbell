{"about_the_game":"You Got Crabs is a relaxing crab simulator that allows you to watch, and care for, crabs in different settings.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCrabs<br />\r\nCrabs are simple creatures. They require food and space to live, but not much else. They will roam around, eat plants or animals and breed with each other. Watch them grow and live their lives, or intervene with toys and new foods which can be found in crates that wash ashore.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvolution<br />\r\nThe crabs will evolve and their changes will affect their life cycles. The evolutionary processes are displayed by the color of the crab. A crab that has more red or orange will likely be able to handle heat better than a blue crab, for example. These traits are passed on to offspring, so they are able to adapt over time to changing environments. In the game, the player is able to modify the environments to force these changes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFood<br />\r\nThese particular crabs love to eat plants, particularly their specially formulated berries, but over time they may develop a taste for meat. If they do they will feast on the bodies of other dead crabs. If they never reach cannibalism, however, they may begin nibbling on the stalks that grow their special berries to gain extra nutrients. Be careful that they don't destroy the crop.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Crabtopia","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2695870/8bada923793801babaf61ecddf2edd7004288d96.jpg"},{"name":"Symphony of Colors","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2695870/ca8ca5fac2795e95abc9d79914b1b794be1b8ee7.jpg"},{"name":"Monochrome Mastery","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2695870/b5530040724a8f6f3057e85601df581656889d79.jpg"},{"name":"Ancient Crab","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2695870/992a46a8c10bac4027e16030de87f3d7810ccf4b.jpg"},{"name":"Master Breeder","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2695870/8b2f1afd753399c3e9dd0030e0e55a47300462b2.jpg"},{"name":"Gourmet Feast","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2695870/3122b8a9ae90a8f203f41cf4670dc1c0509ca232.jpg"},{"name":"Berry Buffet","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2695870/fec8bfbed29e6fe49a1a9c1baaaa1bcd4f2f8723.jpg"},{"name":"Crab Nursery","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2695870/af04d89d01a5e84c7ab424060517c12d6800a035.jpg"},{"name":"Robocrabs","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2695870/2e41026cfe3a3a09e5be95e2ad1f50af3fe3a288.jpg"},{"name":"Grand Prize","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2695870/0e5571a9c87606767d712df5364473dd23712795.jpg"}],"total":13},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2695870?t=1703313467","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2695870/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1703313467","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2695870/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1703313467","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2695870/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1703313467","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You Got Crabs is a relaxing crab simulator that allows you to watch, and care for, crabs in different settings.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCrabs<br />\r\nCrabs are simple creatures.
