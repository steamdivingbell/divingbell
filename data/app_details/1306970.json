{"about_the_game":"Become the immortal warrior-prince Atilla, awakened after millenia in deep space by an impudent invasion of your tomb-ship. Pick up your blood-sword and investigate - are these intruders the old enemies from your past, or as yet unknown foes to conquer? No matter, they have rooted themselves into the ship and defiled all that is sacred to you with their foul presence. It is time to drive them out into the void and save your people.<br><br><i>Awaken prince, and carve a red ruin!</i><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1306970/extras/first_gif_on_page_waystone.gif?t=1726503722\" /><br><br>Diluvian Ultra: Chapter One includes 10 levels + a hub, 6 different weapons with 30 different upgrades and 13 enemy types. <br><br>Further chapters continuing Atilla\u2019s story as well as expanding his arsenal and the roster of enemies to obliterate will be released as paid DLCs at a future date.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1306970/extras/strategic_combat.gif?t=1726503722\" /><br><br>Diluvian Ultra\u2019s combat is built around a dual-damage system where you have to combine weapons to be effective.
