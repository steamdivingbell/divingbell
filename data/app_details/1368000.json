Can you survive international assassins? Can you stop an evil mastermind's nefarious plans? Can you avoid contracting an STD?<br> Welcome to Phoenix Erupting, a visual novel brought to you by the people who played Police Quest IV and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. You are sent by your bosses to investigate an evil European megalomaniac with dreams of world domination or whatever.

The other reason we made this game is because it\u2019s the genre of game that requires minimal programming and game design.<br> But within those limitations anything can happen \u2013 you can catch a venereal disease, have something shoved up your arse, listen to a man going to the toilet, and literally get covered in shit \u2013 and that\u2019s if you play the game well!<br> There are well over 100 different decisions trees spread throughout the game \u2013 some of these decisions not affecting the game at all, while others can result in an untimely death. This game has 12 different final endings giving the game great replay value.

This side-splitting adventure will have you laughing non-stop at jokes about poop, drugs, murder, women, alcoholism, foreigners, and dead children. This game also contains reference humour and meta gags so you can feel good about how clever you are.<br> Because you get to choose how the story progresses it\u2019s your fault if you don\u2019t find this game funny.
