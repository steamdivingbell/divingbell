We, <i>Hapiwaku Project Team</i>, are still very small development team. Kei, a friend of mine, and I are main developers, who are 24 years old and just graduated from graduate school this spring. I previously planned to go on to a doctoral course, but I decided to concentrate on IEH development! My 19-years-older wife, Wakana, is pregnant and the baby is due in this June. She is working on the new world map of IEH2 with the baby. My 13-year-old daughter, Arua, is also working for various artwork of IEH2, and my sister, Nohn, is supporting them. We family are encouraged by all your comment and very active to develop IEH with <i>hapiwaku !</i> (<i>Hapiwaku</i> is a Japanese word that means happy and excited.) A lot of new features are coming in IEH2! We will continue to work on improving our game. We will also keep updating IEH1 based on your wonderful feedback, so please keep up the good work and looking forward to the future updates!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1580930/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1616912883","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1580930/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1616912883","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1580930/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1616912883","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1580930/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1616912883","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The contents of this DLC are as follows:<br><br><strong>- Upgrades almost all the monsters' art to IEH2's.<br>- Upgrades the character icon in the battle screen to IEH2's.<br>- 5500 Epic Coin<br>- Supports the developers to make IEH2.</strong><br> <br>This DLC allows you to pre-warp into parts of the IEH2 world!<br>It stacks with other DLC.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">IEH2 Monsters Art</h2><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1580930/extras/IEHnewmonsters600x333.png?t=1616912883\" /><br><br>After you purchase this DLC, the art of almost all the monsters except for Blobs (area 8) changes as shown on the right side of this image!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Incremental Epic Hero 2 Development</h2>As we mentioned in the previous post, we are currently working on Incremental Epic Hero 2 (IEH2), which is much upgraded from the current IEH (IEH1). <br>We plan to release IEH2 as a new game that is a sequel to IEH1 in the near future! <br>IEH2 is a kind of Prestige Tier 3 after Reincarnation.
