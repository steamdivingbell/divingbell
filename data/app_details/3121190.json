You'll spend hours making drinks and listening to patrons' stories, all while the music and the sound of the rain outside create a super cozy environment. It\u2019s the kind of atmosphere that makes you want to brew some warm coffee, wrap yourself in blankets, and enjoy the ASMR triggers.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3121190/extras/SteamGif0_A.gif?t=1722809884\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Characters</strong></h2>Some intriguing patrons frequent this beachside bar.
