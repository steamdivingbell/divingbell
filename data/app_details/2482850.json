That said, if big AAA studios don't get everything right day one, our little team certainly won't, so we'll no doubt be making bug fixes and balancing changes after release, and we'll take that responsibility seriously. If people dig what we've made and would like more, we'll definitely consider it, so long as we won't bankrupt ourselves in the process.

I can't speak for everyone on the team, so I'll answer just for me... I've kind of always wanted to work on a game like this. I grew up loving the games of Bullfrog and Psygnosis, in particular Syndicate, Wipeout, G-Police, and Colony Wars. So experiences involving &quot;teams of high tech soldiers, using high tech vehicles, causing chaos in an original science fiction world&quot; have always been embedded deep in my frontal lobe. Over the years I've fallen in love with games like Halo, Earth Defence Force, Red Faction, Just Cause, Crimson Skies, and Ace Combat. Polaris is a melting pot of all these inspirations (and more!) combined with the raw talent and creativity of the awesome team I get to work with everyday. Also they turned off the Warhawk servers so this is the only way I get to fulfil that particular gameplay fantasy.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>What's the best way to stay up-to-date on development?</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Via our newsletter.
