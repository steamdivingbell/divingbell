{"about_the_game":"This is NOT the latest version, please check out PSF 2025 (https://store.steampowered.com/app/3013260/Pro_Strategy_Football_2025/)!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom a flexible installation package to a customizable ticker to wide open career play to a greatly improved AI, you asked for it, and you got it!  And remember, with Steam's Remote Play Together, you can play your friends around the world!  Playing against another person raises the intensity to a whole new level!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs always, the PSF goal is to put more power in your hands, and this year, that starts with the game installation.  You choose where to install the game and mods!  But that\u2019s not all \u2026<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCareer Play now supports 1 to 16 conferences, and 2 to 140 teams!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can now change the game\u2019s coaches at any time, even during the game!  Easily switch between taking over either team or watching the AI play both teams, or even just let the AI finish the current possession, the current quarter, or the rest of the game!  If you\u2019re watching a game, you can decide to step in and take over either team (or both!)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe new studio ticker expands on last year\u2019s popular PSF Studio and now provides updates around the league!  And you can customize it however you want \u2013 change the background and text colors, change the possession marker, decide which games to include, even decide how often you want it to update!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA big request has been most flexibility in tweaking the injuries and fatigue, and you can now do this!  Raise or lower fatigue or injuries (or turn them off completely), and even turn off multi-game injuries if you want to limit injuries to only the current game!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNo more losing veterans when they are cut!  They\u2019re now placed in a waiver pool and can be drafted in a later draft or even a future year!  To enhance this, career play now has two separate roster adjustments and a new Waiver Draft!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso, viewing the different drafts (Rookies, Free Agents, and Waivers) is streamlined this year!  You can easily switch between each pools so you can see what players are available in all the pools!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLive Sims now let you pause on any screen, rather than just the animation!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNew stats have been added, too \u2013 track rushes, passes, and catches of 20+ and 40+ yards, and you can now track how many fourth downs a team tried to convert in a season!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSingle Season play now lets you export all active players, with positions and OVR (will be added to career soon!)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe editor has improved this year as well, with a new three-quarter length option, easier Team screen, and improved generated player uniforms (animation images)!  Modders have created many image sets with all sleeves options!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nContinuing with improving the user experience, you can now easily search and filter when trying to locate a league or a player, great for editing leagues or viewing player history!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExpanded rules now has more options and MANY more historic sets!  And more overtime options!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd most importantly of all, the AI has been greatly improved this year, whether it's choosing draft picks, calling plays, or managing the clock!  Of course, I have never, and never will, have a cheating AI!  If the AI is tough to beat, that's a testament to all the users who sent me their detailed suggestions with play by play examples, and to hours of work and testing to get the AI better and better!","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2459100?t=1725741306","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2459100/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1725741306","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2459100/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725741306","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2459100/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725741306","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This is NOT the latest version, please check out PSF 2025 (https://store.steampowered.com/app/3013260/Pro_Strategy_Football_2025/)!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom a flexible installation package to a customizable ticker to wide open career play to a greatly improved AI, you asked for it, and you got it!
