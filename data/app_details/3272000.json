Each round offers fresh challenges with unique trinkets, strategic Egg Bombs, and unpredictable rivalries. No two games are alike!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game unfolds over 13 rounds. Players select trinkets to collect while deducing their opponents\u2019 secret categories.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>CHARACTER SELECTION</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Before the game, choose one of six crow personalities\u2014<i>The Duelist, The Warrior, The Bard, The Jester, The Warlock,</i> or <i>The Child.</i> Each personality has unique reactions during trinket collection or loss.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>CATEGORY SELECTION</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">At the start of each game, players choose one secret category from a pool of 12. There are 6 colors and 6 types of trinkets, making each round different based on your choice.</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Trinket Colors</strong>: Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, White</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Trinket Types</strong>: Gem, Weapon, Candle, Paper, Jewelry, Potion</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each player is presented with 3 category choices. Once you select yours, the other two can be ruled out as your opponents' secret categories. Use this knowledge to your advantage as you collect trinkets and outsmart your competition!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>TRINKET SELECTION</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Every round, 5 random trinkets from a pool of 72 appear.

Only one player can use an action per round, and the ability to act rotates between players.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The <strong>Random Action</strong> is available in rounds 1 to 4. This action allows a player to exchange one trinket on the board with a random trinket from the pool. Once the player selects the trinket, it is immediately replaced, and an additional 3 seconds are added to the round timer, giving opponents a chance to adjust their selection.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The <strong>Swap Action</strong> comes into play during rounds 5 to 8. Here, a player can swap the position of two trinkets. After selecting the first trinket, they choose another to switch places with. At the end of the round, these two trinkets are swapped, though player selections remain unchanged.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Finally, the <strong>Egg Bomb Action</strong> becomes available in rounds 9 to 12. This action allows a player to destroy one trinket of their choice, removing it from the game and preventing it from being collected.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3272000/extras/Trinkets-Egg-Bomb.gif?t=1730369307\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>REVEAL &amp; COLLECTION</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">After selections are made, trinkets are revealed, and any used actions are carried out. Players collect their trinkets unless it\u2019s destroyed.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>SCORING</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Points are tallied based on the trinkets' match to player categories:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">+1 point for collecting any trinket.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">+1 point for trinkets that match your category.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">+2 points for trinkets that match another player's category.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">+2 bonus points for trinkets that match multiple categories.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">During rounds 1 to 10, the current leader is marked by a crown above their crow, adding to the competitive atmosphere. Player scores remain hidden until the end of the game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>END GAME</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">After 13 rounds, the player with the most points is crowned the next Crow King!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>REPLAY</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With 72 trinkets and constantly changing strategies, no two games of <i>Trinkets!</i> are the same.
