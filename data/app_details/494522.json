{"about_the_game":"The Boeing-Vertol CH-47 Chinook\u2122 is a versatile, twin-engine, tandem rotor heavy-lift helicopter. Boasting top speeds of 170 knots (196 mph, 315 km/h), the Chinook \u2122 was faster than contemporary utility and attack helicopters when it was introduced in the 1960s. It is one of the few aircraft of that era such as the C-130 and the UH-1 'Huey' that is still in front line service with over 1,179 built so far. Its primary roles include troop movement, artillery emplacement and battlefield resupply.<br><br>Virtavia\u2019s FSX: Steam Edition of the Chinook is a faithful reproduction of the aircraft featuring various animations, authentic flight dynamics, and high res gauges.
