{"about_the_game":"Truckers can now enjoy the Scania S BEV in Euro Truck Simulator 2! The Scania 40 S and 45 S BEV, which are both based on the Scania S with a 4x2 Chassis, feature two powertrain options, a six-speed transmission combined with three electric motors with a continuous power output of 400/450 kW (540/610 hp). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe interior comes with a few specific changes for the electric variant. BEV-specific gauges are introduced alongside a refreshed interior that includes Blind Spot Indicators built into the A-pillars, an electronic parking brake, as well as some smaller changes to the driver's dashboard. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease be aware, that as our in-game world of Euro Truck Simulator 2 faces similar difficulties as the real one, we currently do not have an electric vehicle charging infrastructure in the game. As such, we have decided to bring this electric vehicle into the game only as an option in predefined deliveries known as Quick Jobs.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3035040/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1719932442","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3035040/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1719932442","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3035040/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1719932442","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3035040/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1719932442","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Remote Play on Phone","id":41},{"description":"Remote Play on Tablet","id":42},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Truckers can now enjoy the Scania S BEV in Euro Truck Simulator 2!
