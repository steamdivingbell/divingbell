As you try to take possession of the precious flower, guardian spirits will gradually appear. Strive to get the petals of the flower from them and awaken La P\u00e9ri, a mesmerizing feminine silhouette covered in light. Her dance will dazzle you, but will you be moved enough to give up immortality and let the P\u00e9ri live ?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cLa P\u00e9ri\u201d is a VR experience based on classical music and ballet by composer Paul Dukas and starring John Rhys-Davies as the Narrator.
