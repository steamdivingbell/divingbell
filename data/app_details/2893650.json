{"about_the_game":"Rift Walker Demo is an open world 2D puzzle platformer where... there aren't any platforms?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour journey starts as a lone wanderer trying to make their way through this new world until you find your first relic where a mysterious voice speaks to you. With the help of the voice you discover more lost relics from a generation long gone that allow you to traverse the new world and create the platforms needed to fill the void that the 'Rift' ripped apart and discover places that others could never reach.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis journey however, isn't entirely lonesome...there are others. These others have also found their own relics to manipulate for both good and evil. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut manipulating relics isn't the only thing you do, this new world isn't empty. Ancient ruins that were once buried deep beneath the land emerge as a result of the ever looming 'Rift' and contain dangerous traps and puzzles only you are capable of solving.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the power you have been granted you gain the ability to raise mountains, destroy worlds and gain near immortality...or so you thought.
