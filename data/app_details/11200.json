The result is Shadowgrounds Survivor, and it's every bit as good as the first release. Survivor, the extended remix of Shadowgrounds, is a must-have for any fans of action-horror.&quot;<br><br>- Worthplaying - 89% (full review)<br><br>&quot;FrozenByte definitely has a winner on its hand. If you have the hankering to play an action top down shooter that looks good and has addictive gameplay, look no further than Shadowgrounds: Survivor.&quot;<br><br>- GamingTrend - 89% (full review)<br><br>&quot;I don't know of any other top-down shooters for the PC which are done as well, or look as good or cost $20.  You also receive the tools to completely mod the game and create additional maps.  Generally my rule is that if I feel like replaying a game right after I finish it, that's a good enough indication of its worth, and Survivor is definitely worth it.&quot;<br><br>- 2024 - 85% (full review)","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/11200/0000002885.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725011465","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/11200/0000002885.600x338.jpg?t=1725011465"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/11200/0000002886.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725011465","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/11200/0000002886.600x338.jpg?t=1725011465"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/11200/0000002883.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725011465","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/11200/0000002883.600x338.jpg?t=1725011465"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/11200/0000002884.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725011465","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/11200/0000002884.600x338.jpg?t=1725011465"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/11200/0000002887.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725011465","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/11200/0000002887.600x338.jpg?t=1725011465"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/11200/0000002888.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725011465","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/11200/0000002888.600x338.jpg?t=1725011465"}],"short_description":"Surviving is only half the game.
