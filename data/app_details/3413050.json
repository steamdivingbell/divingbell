{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Naki is a</strong> <strong>single-player first-person survival horror game</strong>. You play as a conspiracy theorist who reads strange books in search of bibliographic references while an Anunnaki tries to stop you from publishing everything online. You can turn your house into a true battlefield and research lab, moving TVs, cameras, scanners, and even landmines.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>ABOUT THIS DEMO</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>This demo version contains 4 unlockable Amulets with a round limit. Some areas are also blocked, and new items, areas, and enemies that may be added to the full game will not be available in the demo. That said, the variety of strategies available is still wide, allowing you to be very creative with what is already accessible.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>READ strange books without being seen</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">At the start of each round, an even stranger topic is randomly selected. Your job: find mentions or references (direct or indirect) to the topic within the books. The catch? There\u2019s an Anunnaki in your house. What\u2019s it doing there? Well\u2026 you\u2019ve been snooping where you shouldn\u2019t, thinking for yourself for far too long\u2026 theorizing about grand conspiracies\u2026 and now it\u2019s time to share your findings with the world. At any cost.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>TYPE manually to publish</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Once you\u2019ve found the right page, head to your laptop to manually type in the page number, author, and book ID. There are four books, so you\u2019ll need to memorize their names and IDs. Anything goes. Just a tip: rushed typing isn\u2019t always the most accurate. And the laptop? Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s not exactly lightning-fast.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>PREPARE your house, <i>Home Alone</i> style</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Between reading, typing, and keeping watch, it\u2019s tough to juggle all three. So get creative to minimize the risk of being attacked. The Anunnaki is stealthy, so set up security cameras, plant camouflaged landmines, prep the fire extinguisher, leave the stove gas on... Everything\u2019s perfectly \u201csafe.\u201d You definitely won\u2019t forget where you placed that landmine. Trust me.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>EARN POINTS and UNLOCK permanent upgrades</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each reference you successfully publish on the laptop earns you points. These points persist after death, allowing you to purchase Amulets that tweak critical aspects of the game. From cuddly companion cats to <i>Dark Souls</i>-style parries.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>OPTIMIZE your dissemination creatively</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Like any good \u201cconspiracy theorist\u201d \u2013 let\u2019s face it, we all know the world\u2019s a lie and society is collapsing because of the Anunnaki pulling the strings \u2013 the more effective your online dissemination, the more points you\u2019ll earn.
