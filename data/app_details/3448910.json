{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Vint is a temporal upscaling system that incorporates interpolation and black frame insertion among other tools to improve the motion fidelity of nearly any video content. Vint can play and handle local video files, web sources like YouTube, and realtime UVC streams like those from video capture card. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CRT Beam\u00a0Scanout  Emulation:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Vint offers unique functionality like the ability to run CRT beam scanout emulation on arbitrary video sources. CRT emulation allows you to not only add a retro feel to your video motion but to lower image persistence without as much flicker as traditional black frame insertion/strobing. This feature is currently in development but will available soon after initial release.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Interpolation:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Vint uses RIFE machine learning based interpolation to increase the output framerate of videos with remarkably minimal artifacts.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Higher framerates are more important than ever because when screen sizes increase, displays get brighter, and videos have more action and movement, the same framerate can make movement becomes harder to follow and produce more perceived flicker.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Interpolation helps to mitigate the flicker, choppiness, and distracting image separation artifacts created by low framerate video sources.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Strobing/BFI:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Vint also supports a variety of black frame insertion (BFI) strobing formats. Vint can create strobing for any video source and refresh rate. Vint also supports multiple strobing to simulate 35mm film projection formats which reduce flicker.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Video Sources:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Vint can process realtime video from local files or from web streamed sources like Youtube, Twitch, or even arte.tv </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Vint can also transcode video files to compress and interpolate them at higher resolutions or output framerates than can be achieved in realtime. This is a great option for 8k or higher resolution 3D VR 180 videos.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Finally, Vint can process UVC inputs like those from video capture cards. This allow you to interpolate video games from consoles or other computers at relatively low latency.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hardware Requirements and Performance:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Vint uses a advanced, high quality interpolation engine called RIFE. While Vint accelerates RIFE using the powerful tensor cores on Nvidia RTX GPUs, it still requires substantial GPU horsepower. In realtime, an RTX 3080 can be expected to interpolate 1080p video to 60FPS. An RTX 4090 can achieve 4k video to 60FPS. An RTX 5090 is expected to achieve 4k video up to 120FPS</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Vint does <strong>not</strong> currently support AMD or Intel GPUs or MacOS and Linux operating systems. It may be possible in the future but performance on these systems is currently inadequate.<br><br>Performance can be determined by looking at CUDA usage in the GPU section of task manager as well as checking whether frames are dropped in the MPV video player. Press 'i' in the video player to bring up that video data and statistics.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Vint User Interface:</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Vint has substantial customization and configuration options. These options are nearly all optional. All config changes apply instantly.<br>The control client offers a variety of functions including the ability to quickly play web links with a click on the notification tray icon. The client is super lightweight, it launches instantly and uses next to no resources ( &lt;60MB of RAM and light on the CPU, especially when idle). </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3448910/extras/vint_perf.png?t=1738527912\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Vint client also supports high DPI settings and can be resized and rearranged at will. Custom fonts are supported and arbitrary UI sizes.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Videos can be queued and reordered for both realtime playback and offline transcoding.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Vint requires no admin privileges and is fully modular without external dependencies. Dependencies can be replaced and the install directory can be moved anywhere on your computer. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Licensing:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Vint uses open source dependencies and abides by their license terms.
