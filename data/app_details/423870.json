{"about_the_game":"Astervoid 2000 is a 1 to 4 player local-multiplayer\u200b space brawler, combining classic arcade action with modern gameplay. <br><br>We've re-envisioned the 1979 hit Asteroids, but as a couch-multiplayer deathmatch game. Set your nav for the asteroid fields and your phasers to kill! Your goal is to blast your opponents into space rubble. Astervoid 2000 doesn't feature any power-ups, so it all comes down to your piloting skill. Explosive, indestructible, and projectile-ricocheting icy asteroids will slam against your ship, or can be weaponized against or by your opponents.

The faster you destroy enemy ships the higher your score. Earn your place on our leaderboard!<br><br><strong>Versus Mode</strong><br>2 to 4 players compete head to head against one another in a free-for-all or team deathmatch.
