{"about_the_game":"Game Introduction<br />\r\nWelcome players to the world of Fengshen Zhuan! Fengshen Zhuan is a battle chess game adapted from the classic Chinese mythological work &quot;Fengshen Yanyi&quot;, set in the late Shang Dynasty 3000-4000 years ago, adding a strong mythological color. This game is a part of the Bamboo Annals series, dedicated to spreading traditional Chinese cultural stories. Players will travel through time and space, enter that ever-changing era, experience classic battles in mythology, meet numerous mythological heroes, and experience the collision of ancient wisdom and courage. The game not only reproduces grand historical scenes, but also incorporates rich mythological elements, allowing every player to find their hero dreams in the game.<br />\r\nLevel characteristics<br />\r\nJiang Ziya's Perspective: The game is played from the perspective of Jiang Ziya, the founding prime minister of the Zhou Dynasty. Starting from being ordered by his teacher to go down the mountain to assist Ming Jun, he fought all the way and eventually overthrew the cruel Shang Dynasty, completing the great mission of enfeoffment. Players will follow Jiang Ziya and grow from an ordinary Taoist to a legendary figure who changes history. The scenes of other main characters in the original work have been deleted or integrated into Jiang Ziya's plot, ensuring a coherent and compact story, significantly enriching the text, and highlighting the combination of Chinese classical classics and Western game modes in &quot;Fengshen Yanyi&quot;. The game not only showcases Jiang Ziya's wisdom and courage, but also reveals his inner struggle and determination through rich storylines and tasks. Players will experience multiple epic battles, face countless enemies and challenges, and ultimately complete the mission of becoming gods.<br />\r\nTreasures and Weapons: The abundant treasures, weapons, and formations in the original work are perfectly reflected in the game, allowing players to immerse themselves in the world of immortal fights and experience endless mythological fun. Each treasure and weapon has its unique attributes and story background, which players can obtain by completing tasks and challenges. In the game, various unique formations are also designed, allowing players to flexibly apply them according to the battle situation and increase the strategic nature of the battle. The treasure system not only enhances the depth of the game, but also provides players with more exploration and collection fun. Players can enhance their combat power and face stronger enemies by forging and upgrading treasures. Every time a new treasure is obtained, it will bring players a brand new combat experience and a sense of achievement.<br />\r\n15 levels: The game includes 15 levels, starting from the Battle of Jizhou and ending with the Nine Bend Yellow River Formation, fully showcasing the mythological stories of the late Shang Dynasty. Each level is carefully designed, striving to restore the true face of history and mythology. Players will face different enemies and challenges in each level, and need to constantly adjust their strategies and tactics. The game also incorporates rich storylines and dialogues, allowing players to gain a deeper understanding of the background and motivations of each character while fighting. Each level is full of surprises and challenges, and players need to use their wisdom and courage to win in battles. Through continuous battles and challenges, players will gradually uncover the truth of the entire story and experience thrilling heroic legends.<br />\r\nCultural Heritage: As part of the &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot; series, the game uses technology as a carrier and is committed to spreading traditional Chinese cultural stories. The game not only reproduces ancient war scenes, but also showcases the unique charm of Chinese culture through rich storylines and dialogues. Players will learn a lot of historical and mythological knowledge in the game, and experience the vastness and profoundness of Chinese culture. The game also features some hidden tasks and Easter eggs, allowing players to discover more cultural details through exploration and puzzle solving. Through this approach, games not only bring entertainment to players, but also subtly spread traditional Chinese culture. The game team hopes to use this game to help more people understand and love Chinese culture, inherit and promote our cultural heritage.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3044860/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1718990246","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3044860/page.bg.jpg?t=1718990246","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3044860/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718990246","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3044860/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718990246","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Game Introduction<br />\r\nWelcome players to the world of Fengshen Zhuan!
