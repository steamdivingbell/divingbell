{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Jaime was just playing in the forest when, drawn in by a beautiful red bird, he accidentally fell into a deep and mysterious cave.

They lived in harmony until foreign invaders arrived and destroyed the sacred tree that channeled sunlight into the depths of the caverns. The magical Yb\u00e1 fruit, the last remnant of that ancient power, now glows in the depths, waiting to be collected. Use the power of the sacred necklace given by the bird to create blocks of light, scaling impossible heights, revealing hidden paths, and overcoming obstacles.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With each step, you uncover pieces of this ancient puzzle.
