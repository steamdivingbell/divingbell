A purchase get 1-Game 1-Comic 1-MiniFilm. This our format, each of our games gives this, they are not different products. \r\nThe game features all the classic elements of the genre: run and jump through moving platforms and other hazards as you defeat enemies and search for keys. \r\nHill Quest is the first game using #GoodGuysGameDevelopers philosophy which means: No DLC at cost, no season pass, no preorders, no in-app purchases, no deluxe editions, just pay for the game ONCE. \r\nEvery day more and more devs are turning into the money grabbing schemes, not to mention charging people for unfinished products. If the users don\u2019t do something and some devs stay clean and make movements like this, you will end up paying from 2 to 3 times more for your triple A games and even indies will fall into this. We do love to make games, we won\u2019t stop anytime soon, but with your help this will give a big fat message to the industry, and help us to stand our ground for a long time giving you Triple A titles with Indie Soul and good Game Dev practices.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Hill Quest is a new game franchise, a platformer with sci-fi elements.
