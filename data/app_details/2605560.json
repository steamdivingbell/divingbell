{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Storybook Agatha is a Turn-Based Strategy RPG. <br><br>After coming back to visit her mentor, Agatha finds an enchanted old book. She starts flipping through it and notices a strong magical source as she goes deeper, before she know it she suddenly gets dragged into the world of the book! <br><br>The story resets back to the beginning as Agatha comes to deep within the woods. No one inside the world seems to know anything about outside the page, and worse still the hero of the book Kael refuses to help. Agatha must work herself through the book meeting new team mates on the way, while Kael takes on his own path. <br><br>Work your way through battles with support of your allies as you try to find a way out, and hopefully convince the hero to help you complete the story he was made for! <br><br>Grow stronger through leveling up and grow everyone on your team with skill trees to suit your playstyle. Use magic and elemental attacks to help control the tide of battle. A neutralize styled combat system will skip anyone's turn when maxed for them so watch out and use it wisely!</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2605560/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735962571","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2605560/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1735962571","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2605560/a0f9d058c3f7c1a8c85fdb3ba20909baefe532fa/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735962571","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2605560/a0f9d058c3f7c1a8c85fdb3ba20909baefe532fa/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735962571","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Storybook Agatha is a Turn-Based Strategy RPG. <br><br>After coming back to visit her mentor, Agatha finds an enchanted old book.
