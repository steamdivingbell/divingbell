{"about_the_game":"The 4VEP Add-On takes you back to the days of the classic \u2018slam-door\u2019 commuter trains on the Woking-Portsmouth Line.<br><br>The 4VEP (\u2018Vestibule Electro Pneumatic\u2019), named the Class 423 under the British Rail TOPS classification system, was one of the \u2018slam-door\u2019 electric multiple units that formed the backbone of rail passenger transport in southern England from the 1960s until after 2000.
