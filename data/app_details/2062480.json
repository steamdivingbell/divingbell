The landscape the errant tennis ball springs over is very pretty indeed though it can get confusing as to what's dangerous and what isn't. Bounder is very neat indeed - it's fairly addictive and both pretty to see and listen to.\u201d<br>91% \u2013 Amtix!

Once you start off, bouncing all over the place, it becomes quite addictive, operating your ball and dodging low flying birds and other weird looking nasties.
