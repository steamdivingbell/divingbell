{"about_the_game":"The player controls scientist \u201cCurias\u201d aboard the ICARUS - a black hole research facility - who tries to balance the ship\u2019s distance to the black hole while gathering data. They must fulfill research tasks, upload them to the D\u00c6DALUS mothership and further their understanding of the strange events, developing new technology through their funding. All the while fixing and navigating the occurring problems that come with\u2026 existing at the edge of space and time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe goal of this game is to gather as much data about the black hole as you can. To do that you have to accept research missions and fulfill them by interacting with strange anomalies or with research stations on your ship. While doing your missions you have to keep the ship running by repairing broken stations and always remember to keep your space ship at a safe distance from the black hole. From completing missions you unlock abilities that allow you to manage your time more efficiently to do even more research missions, like quantum tunneling or Ariadne's String which give you time and space bending powers. When you eventually fall into the black hole your collected research data is converted into funding for further missions which can be spent on upgrades that will help you survive longer on your next mission.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3012990/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1719410153","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3012990/page.bg.jpg?t=1719410153","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3012990/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1719410153","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3012990/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1719410153","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The player controls scientist \u201cCurias\u201d aboard the ICARUS - a black hole research facility - who tries to balance the ship\u2019s distance to the black hole while gathering data.
