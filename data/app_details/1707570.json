{"about_the_game":"Merchant's Game is a 2D pixelart open-ended game that you hire npc's, negotiate prices, sell and buy items to pay your debt to the lanlord. Merchant's Game is a single-player game that can be played by keyboard and mouse. In a fantasy world you open a shop in a busy gateway in the mittle of the Galaxy. However things are not good as before so you start from the day 1 and continue your journey until the payment day arrives. No need to be worried if you've already done that. So keep your shop open. Forever.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1707570/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1711373023","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1707570/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1711373023","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1707570/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1711373023","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1707570/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1711373023","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Merchant's Game is a 2D pixelart open-ended game that you hire npc's, negotiate prices, sell and buy items to pay your debt to the lanlord.
