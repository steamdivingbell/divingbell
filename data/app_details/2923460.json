{"about_the_game":"In the depths of the Asteroid Jungle, one wrong move is all it takes to be caught by the enemy. Mastery of your ships systems will be necessary to survive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMovement is simple but must be deliberate. Your engine's built in limiter will require you to wait a moment between movements. Learning the timing of this is essential in order to move at a consistent pace.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCloaking is the base of any cloaked starship's capabilities. Unfortunately, your cloaking technology also interferes with your navigation system. It will be up to you to manually keep track of where you've been.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTorpedos are your primary weapon against the enemy. As long as you are close enough, they will always hit. But don't miss, the blast will quickly give your position away.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMines are an indirect but equally effective weapon if used wisely. However in order to hide them from the enemy, they are also hidden from you. Remember where they are or risk tearing apart the hull of your ship against your own mines.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRadar is tricky in a fight between cloaked starships. The readings are fuzzy and unclear, but against a foe skilled at hiding, it might provide the only clues you get at the enemy's position.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2923460/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714523165","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2923460/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1714523165","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2923460/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714523165","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2923460/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714523165","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In the depths of the Asteroid Jungle, one wrong move is all it takes to be caught by the enemy.
