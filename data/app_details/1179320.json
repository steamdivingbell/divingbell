However, the game also contains an active turn-based battle system which players use to fight enemies and bosses over the course of their adventure. When players aren't tackling the main storyline, they'll find themselves in hub areas where they have the ability to interact with their party members through minigames such as Cooking and Teatime. Interacting with party members in this manner raises friendship and strengthens them in battle. While the story is mostly linear, the player's friendship with their allies will determine the path players can take in the final chapter and endings/character outcomes available.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1179320/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734917280","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1179320/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1734917280","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1179320/b4c1648c36375d9b7a99e04206e76b269cc6dceb/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734917280","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1179320/b4c1648c36375d9b7a99e04206e76b269cc6dceb/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734917280","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"There are some CGs depicting blood and characters receiving injuries due to the battle shonen-inspired nature of the game, such as a character being stabbed with a blade and another receiving injuries to the face and torso."},"demos":[{"appid":1936370,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Magnetic Bonds</strong> is a fusion of the visual novel and turn-based RPG genres inspired by battle shonen manga!
