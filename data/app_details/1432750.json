{"about_the_game":"Chionophile is a very short experience about the mood of winter in the woods. It is a slow paced pure walking simulator; you only walk, slowly, in the wilderness away from civilization. A beautiful poem from Archibald Lampman accompanies your short journey; and the original music score that is composed by P\u0131nar Karaba\u015f.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game has 2 chapters. While the first one is a little linear, the second one (which is more expansive) takes place in a large open area. There are paths for the player to follow to reduce confusion about where to go. But you are free to roam away from the path and discover.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPS: The core aspect of this game is the atmosphere. It is recommended for those who mostly seek to experience the mood.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSave progression: The game saves your progression at the beginning of each chapter.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"audibly.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1432750/79a352397bfd818f79590e146a675e332c8f9ae7.jpg"},{"name":"sky.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1432750/57f06193a79cd7a8b2751e0fcf16fcf757cf3e77.jpg"},{"name":"everywhere.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1432750/5c910cf5af2647790f03f376b7fd290c04ed50f8.jpg"},{"name":"clear;","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1432750/92f4cb1d1f1c663223bc9d2814873c9c9269e08b.jpg"},{"name":"slow.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1432750/d63f7a9f91cb268dd45ad628e38f55b0ea471073.jpg"},{"name":"dream.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1432750/00831762c130fe24cb3755f2334c95f481167781.jpg"}],"total":6},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1432750/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728914774","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1432750/page.bg.jpg?t=1728914774","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1432750/f65b685b315b883b39db7f0541948dc5d9d24e31/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728914774","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1432750/f65b685b315b883b39db7f0541948dc5d9d24e31/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728914774","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Chionophile is a very short experience about the mood of winter in the woods.
