The game has a clever premise: instead of controlling one character, you control two\u2014little dots that are linked together, occupying opposite spots on a single circle. Move a character right, and the other moves left.\u201d<br>The New Yorker<br><br>\u201cDuet is a game of few parts, but each one of those parts fits perfectly with the rest. It feels as designed as a raindrop, and just as perfect.\u201d<br>Polygon<br><br>\u201cDuet does what the best video games do. It introduces an abstract idea, a fabricated set of simple systems, then it gives you a set of meaningless obstacles to overcome using those systems. But somewhere \u2014 in-between those two ideas \u2014 a weird magic trick.
