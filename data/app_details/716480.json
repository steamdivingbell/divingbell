Right now this game is just a glimpse of the vision that I have planned for it and I'm going to continue to work feverishly in the coming days and weeks to continue adding features and gameplay modes until my vision is fulfilled. <br><br>I may have missed the option during creating this store page to flag it as Beta, but I want to make it very clear that this game is still being worked on daily. I've made this game myself from scratch and I'm going to continue updating it regularly. The most important of those updates are...<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Adding weapons</li><li>Adding Female character option</li><li>Adding the character class system</li><li>Adding Traps and Towers</li><li>Adding more Enemies</li><li>Adding more maps</li></ul><br>I'll always be tweaking animations and textures and creating more menus and options (like controller support). <br><br>This is a continued effort and I hope that you enjoy it. Thank you</p><br><h1>Update Notes</h1><p><strong>12/18 Update</strong><br><br>Hi everybody!<br>I've been working on quite a few things and getting ready for the Holidays. I hope you are all enjoying your Holiday season.<br>I added quite a bit in this update, but I still have a lot more coming. As always I appreciate your continued interest and support. I'm working on getting new screenshots and game play trailers made. Anything you want to post on the community page would be helpful. Here's a list of most of the things that I added in this update...<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Goblins</li><li>Werewolves</li><li>Rotating Camera (q and e keys)</li><li>Destructible and Repairable fences (Left click on knocked over fences when near to repair)</li><li>Tweaks to gameplay (damage indicators and knock back, animations, and debugging)</li> </ul><br>As always there's a lot more to come and I'm working to get a lot ready for the Holiday break. Thanks again!<br><br>-Chris</p><br><h1>Just Updated</h1><p><strong>100 Days Until Halloween!</strong><br><br>Hi everyone! There's only 100 days until Halloween! I just made a fairly large update and I'm really excited about it. I'm getting ready for a long stretch of new content coming up. Here's a list of some things that I added...<br><br><strong>Monsters...</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Witch</li><li>Ghost</li><li>Spider</li><li>Scarecrow</li><li>Rat</li></ul><br><strong>Weapons...</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Running Spin Attack with sword </li><li> also a charged attack with sword, but right now it's the same thing as above </li><li> Slingshot </li><li> Slingshot charged attack </li><li> Wand with fireball spell </li><li> Wand charged attack </li></ul><br><strong>Characters and Maps</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Girl Hero</li><li> Flat Map </li></ul><br>I changed the menus and added a controls list to reflect new changes. I also added the <strong> game mode </strong> section to reflect what modes are coming up. I'll be adding challenge maps here soon.<br><br>I'm still looking to fix the audio issues (there currently isn't any audio) and I apologize for that aspect as well as the limited game play at the moment. But...<br><br>I have a lot more coming! The base mechanics are mostly done I then I can focus on adding a lot more content and game modes in the next 100 days before Halloween. I'll be adding the leveling up system with new weapon upgrades and a spell book with different elements as well as new skins for the heroes! <br><br>Everyone's continued support is seriously very much appreciated. Any interest makes this feel worthwhile. Just to re-iterate I'm making this game myself and it has been a long journey and I'm looking forward to making it the best I can. Thank you! See you on Halloween!<br><br>-Chris</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Halloween Knight is a hack n' slash adventure game mixed with tower defenses where you try to protect your house on Halloween night.
