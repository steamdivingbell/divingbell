{"about_the_game":"Add unique combat specialists to your game\u2019s battlefields with the Soldier Character Pack 2! Gee-kun-soft is back with another set of 16 characters fit for modern combat. This pack focuses on specialized personnel whose skills are useful on and off the battlefield. Have a tired, no-nonsense, doctor share an office with the army\u2019s colorful poison expert while making sure the 2 lightly armored assassins don\u2019t get into a competition over who can steal the most state secrets! Or have the pack\u2019s 2 snipers compare strategies while the grenade and flamethrower users discuss how to make the biggest boom, all while the older commanding officers groan at the increased paperwork on their desks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach character comes with a character sprite, faceset with 8 different emotions, enemy front view battlers, SV battlers, and bust images! And if that wasn\u2019t enough, some of the characters come in variations where they\u2019re wearing hats or helmets so that they\u2019ll be ready no matter what comes at them. Have your commanding officer only wear her hat when in meetings, or give your pair of extraction experts helmets and eye protection when they\u2019re in the middle of a dangerous mission! Most enemy battlers also come with effect versions, so you could switch out the image depending on what status they have or if they\u2019re powering up. Let your players know they need to defend from a powerful attack when the animal handler\u2019s dog disappears from their side, and that they should push to defeat the sniper quickly if the sniper\u2019s glowing aim assist appears in front of them!
