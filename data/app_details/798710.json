This game graphics have been made with using revolutionary dither technology, created with Amiga fans & experts. Developed over many years, the revolutionary DITHER technology enables PC-game developers to reach the next level of legendary Amiga and/or C-64 graphics on their games. We haven't created or invented dither technology but we have applied a little bit adjusted version of it to this game. Through the liberal, almost irresponsible use of DITHER we are able to radically alter the standard graphics into an unbelievable Amiga visual look and players can enjoy 100% retro stylish games.<br
