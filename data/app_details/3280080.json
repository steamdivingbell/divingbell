{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Shared Goal</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">During your tenure at Stravard University, you met a friend named Ted. Ted had always been known for his radical ideas, particularly those against technology, but never took the initiative to do anything about it. With technology and the Internet now growing at a rapid pace, and with Microrock's new operating system, WinGoals SP, you decide enough is enough. Without action, nothing can be done. With your drive, and Ted's intelligence, the two of you team up and set out on the common goal of total technology destruction.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">It Won't Be Easy</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Back in the mid to late 90s, it wasn't exactly simple to make malware, but it was a lot more trivial than it is today in the early 2000s. You will have to take courses to increase your knowledge, experiment with different payloads and infection routines for your malware, and at the end of it all, release something significant enough to not just infect machines, but render them completely unusable. Play through ten years of computer advancement, hone your skills, and commence your plan of destruction before it's too late.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Pick Your Poison</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Ten years is a long time, and not every piece of malware you create will be capable of achieving the goal of destruction. You'll also need to make money. Sure, you could make money by working part-time on spreadsheets for WageSlave Inc, but that's no way to spend your time. Towards the beginning of your journey, experiment with different malware such as Trojans, Adware, and Viruses. Trojans will allow you to hone your skills quickly, Adware will generate you passive income, and Viruses will give you the chance for your malware to really get out there. Once your skills are honed enough, move on to the most advanced malware type, Worms. Worms will give you the chance to create something significant enough to infect and destroy every computer and server in the world.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Are you ready?</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Malware Tycoon involves lots of skill, time management, and a strategic approach in order to see your goal through. Manage your money correctly, continuously learn, lurk forums for opportunities, and take notice of the latest tech news in order to plan accordingly. In addition, there is always the looming threat of the police catching on to your activities, and arresting you. You must destroy technology by the end of 2012. Don't lose sight of your mission, and be wary of how you dedicate your time.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3280080/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1739490300","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3280080/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1739490300","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3280080/0dbb172b8007afb2e0389a9e13764fcb05aa36f5/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739490300","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3280080/0dbb172b8007afb2e0389a9e13764fcb05aa36f5/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739490300","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Shared Goal</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">During your tenure at Stravard University, you met a friend named Ted.
