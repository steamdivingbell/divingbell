Through voice-over narratives and frightened faces, &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot; conveys a sense of human sanity being unraveled by too much forbidden fruit. By film's end, Foyer has the Thousand Yard Stare down to a science. His once-doubting Wilmarth has picked from the Tree of Knowledge, and become a reluctant believer.\u201d<br>5/5 \u2013 Film Threat<br><br>\u201cYou are about to encounter what very well be the single most successful H.P. Lovecraft adaptation ever to lick fear across a screen. Shot with an aesthetic, production design and performance style angled to emulate the feel of '30s/'40s Universal horror film - without falling into camp - WHISPERER arrives like shadows out of time, a discovered relic from another dimension. A genuinely scary film and a hellishly great time.\u201d<br>5/5 \u2013 Bloody Disgusting<br><br>\u201cThe Whisperer in Darkness is a hell of a fine film, one of the best adaptations of a Lovecraft story ever made, and it's far superior to the vast majority of bigger-budgeted films that have &quot;H.P. Lovecraft's&quot; before their titles. Whisperer is faithful to a fault to the source material. What changes it does make a very welcome and actually enhance the story, as opposed to just padding things out, like so many other movies based on Lovecraft's short stories do. It is an obvious labour of love and, when movie makers care this much, it shows in every frame of the film. If you're a fan of H.P. Lovecraft, then this is MANDATORY VIEWING. If you've never read anything by HPL and always wanted to see what all the hoopla was about, this is a great place to start to get a handle on his unique and genre-changing brand of horror.\u201d<br>5/5 \u2013 Innsmouth Free Press<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/970440/ss_f2acdbe47a1fa9a491c61e996baedf517535c71c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1552584447","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/970440/ss_f2acdbe47a1fa9a491c61e996baedf517535c71c.600x338.jpg?t=1552584447"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/970440/ss_c4bf16f8c85f00c19d6e1fcfce176d3190785709.1920x1080.jpg?t=1552584447","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/970440/ss_c4bf16f8c85f00c19d6e1fcfce176d3190785709.600x338.jpg?t=1552584447"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/970440/ss_442278db146fc28962ac41ebc1f02299d002d1bc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1552584447","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/970440/ss_442278db146fc28962ac41ebc1f02299d002d1bc.600x338.jpg?t=1552584447"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/970440/ss_01b783ed4c8d6fa9ece804a4d5aaeb4982fb29af.1920x1080.jpg?t=1552584447","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/970440/ss_01b783ed4c8d6fa9ece804a4d5aaeb4982fb29af.600x338.jpg?t=1552584447"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/970440/ss_cf9037bdd5f2cb143131d626f53ef3e1c83fb6a6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1552584447","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/970440/ss_cf9037bdd5f2cb143131d626f53ef3e1c83fb6a6.600x338.jpg?t=1552584447"}],"short_description":"Celebrated author H.P.
