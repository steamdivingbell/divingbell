in Manacaster is carefully calibrated according to a strict mathematical algorithm, leading to intense, evenly-matched battles that keep you on the edge of your seat until the final moment of victory...or defeat.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Digital + Tabletop = Play Your Way:\u00a0</strong> We have built a digital clone of the tabletop edition
