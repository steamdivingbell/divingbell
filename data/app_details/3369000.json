{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Noox is a 3D first person  medieval fantasy ghost investigation game that can be played solo or co-op. Use magically powered tools to collect evidence left behind by ghost hauntings, sort through the clues to decide which type of ghost is haunting the location, and assemble the necessary runes on your trap to capture the ghost and stop the haunting. But beware of draining your mana too fast by using too many tools at once, because the ghost will sense your weakness and use that moment to attack!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You play an alchemist investigating hauntings to extract magical energy (noox) from spirits. Travel to different haunted locations and stop the evil presence. Utilizing some fantasy twists on classic ghost investigation tools like an EMF reader of glowing mushrooms, track the ghost and collect the energy it infuses into objects that it has interacted with. Once enough information has been collected, assemble the necessary runes to capture the ghost on your trap and bring the ghost back to your workshop to complete your collection and unlock new abilities.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3369000/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733823593","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3369000/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1733823593","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3369000/2551340f4f48ec85e703729edd07bc4dff301597/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733823593","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3369000/2551340f4f48ec85e703729edd07bc4dff301597/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733823593","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Noox is a 3D first person  medieval fantasy ghost investigation game that can be played solo or co-op.
