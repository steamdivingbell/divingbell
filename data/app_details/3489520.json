{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Do you like playing platform games and especially the old ones? A brand new and yet old game (in appearance) in 16-bit cartoon graphics. Experience a crazy adventure with an unusual hero. Suitable for everyone who wants to relax and have a good time. The individual levels are just the right length, and the difficulty is also set appropriately to make the game fun, but still not entirely easy. It all just depends on your skill. Beautiful pixel graphics like the good old games, but not insanely and deliberately difficult to play.
