{"about_the_game":"Your journey begins in a cave on top of a high mountain. You will have to uncover the eagle's nest. He will help you to come down. There is only one way to the castle. An abandoned trail through a swamp. You have to get rid of the witch's servants and fix the boat. <br />\r\n\tWith the help of the boat, you will move to the castle. You will get through a secret passage to the prince. You will learn the story that the castle is heated by an underwater lake. The water in it is warmed by a dragon, which comes to the underground once a year. There is a flower there that blooms once a year. It is the Queen of the Night. If you find such a flower, the dragon will come again and help defeat the witch's army. But the way to the dungeon is very dangerous. No one has ever been there before.<br />\r\n\tYou will find the way to the dungeon and go down there. In the abandoned caves you will find a way out to the other side of the mountain.  There you will find an old sea bay, from which the water left long ago. However, there is a pillar of water that has incredibly remained in place. By solving the riddle, you will be able to enter the underwater kingdom.<br />\r\n\tYou will dive into the underwater worlds and explore the old bathyscaphe. You will find a lot of artifacts and discover the passageway to the magic flask, where the witch has enchanted the fairy. You can set the fairy free, and she will open a portal to the Dragon's Dwelling.<br />\r\n\tThe dragon's dwelling is a nest that floats in the air. A long chain leads to it. You will have to overcome your fear and go up to the nest. First you will explore the secret cave. In this nest you will find the blossoming flower of the Queen of the Night. When you return with it to the castle, you will summon the dragon.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2642780/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1698921302","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2642780/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1698921302","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2642780/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1698921302","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2642780/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1698921302","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2644920,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Your journey begins in a cave on top of a high mountain.
