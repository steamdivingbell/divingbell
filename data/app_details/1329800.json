{"about_the_game":"Your orders are to surrender, but you prefer death to dishonor. <br><br>Instead, you hold your position behind two bunkers with nothing more than your assault rifle and a bloodlust. Face off against the invaders and survive several waves of attacks. As you take on the enemy, their general will devote more resources to the fight in hopes of crushing you. He will send helicopters, tanks, planes, artillery barrages, and eventually grab his shotgun and come after you himself. What he doesn\u2019t know is that there is no stopping you.<br><br>Remember that you have allies who will drop health packs and weapon upgrades. Choose between eight possible upgrade paths that best fit your play style. <br><br>Only you can stand up to them. If you can destroy their army and kill their general, you could end the entire war.<br><br><strong>Soundtrack:</strong><br>Wave 1 - Hey Sailor By Letter Box<br>Wave 2 - Vindicated By Ethan Meixsell<br>Wave 3 / Intro - Unusual Habitat By Silent Partner<br>Wave 4 - Loitering By Riot<br>Wave 5 - Pentagram By Audionautix<br>Wave 6 - Driven To Madness By Ethan Meixsell<br>Wave 7 (Final Wave) - Beat Down By Silent Partner<br>General (Boss) Fight Song - Angel Of Mercy By Ethan Meixsell<br>Credits Song - Highway Girl By Riot<br>Death Song - Keep It Real By Audionautix<br><br><strong>Sound Effects (FreeSound):</strong><br>\u201cArtillery Gunfire\u201d by Qubodup is licensed under CC0 1.0<br>\u201cAssaultRiflePack1\u201d by SuperPhat is licensed under CC0 1.0<br>\u201cBox of stuff falls\u201d by AnimationIsaac is licensed under CC0 1.0<br>\u201cCannon Shot\u201d by Qubodup is licensed under CC0 1.0<br>\u201cCarbonfiber15\u201d by Hiramjustus is licensed under CC0 1.0<br>\u201cExplosion2\u201d by Steveygos93 is licensed under CC BY 3.0<br>\u201cExplosion_01\u201d by Tommccan is licensed under CC0 1.0<br>\u201cExplosion\u201d by Omar Alvarado is licensed under CC BY 3.0<br>\u201cFabric Ripping\u201d by HarpyHarpHarp is licensed under CC0 1.0<br>\u201cGun lee enfield 303 rifle fire shot\u201d by Kyles is licensed under CC0 1.0<br>\u201cHitting metal object with metal\u201d by Jorickhoofd is licensed under CC BY 3.0<br>\u201cHQ Explosion\u201d by Quaker540 is licensed under CC0 1.0<br>\u201cMale_Scream_2\u201d by AlineAudio is licensed under CC0 1.0<br>\u201cMan getting hit\u201d by Under7dude licensed under CC0 1.0<br>\u201cScream 01\u201d by Adriancalzon is licensed under CC BY 3.0<br>\u201cScream 05\u201d by Adriancalzon is licensed under CC BY 3.0<br>\u201cShotgun Cock Reload Layered\u201d by Paul368 is licensed under CC0 1.0<br>\u201cShotgun_Shot_01\u201d by Mattix is licensed under CC BY 3.0<br>\u201cSingle Pistol Gunshot 3\u201d by Morganpurkis is licensed under CC0 1.0<br>\u201cSquish Impact\u201d by Bertsz is licensed under CC0 1.0<br>\u201cTank Firing\u201d by Qubodup is licensed under CC0 1.0","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1329800/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1637006934","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1329800/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1637006934","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1329800/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1637006934","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1329800/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1637006934","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Your orders are to surrender, but you prefer death to dishonor. <br><br>Instead, you hold your position behind two bunkers with nothing more than your assault rifle and a bloodlust.
