Inspired by old-school tabletop magazines, ARCADIA is MCDM's digital magazine for 5th edition GMs and players. We hope you like it! <br> <br><strong> Angelic Ancestries</strong> by Sadie Lowry with art by Nephelomancer. Remember Sadie's work on &quot;Uqaviel, the Recreant&quot; from ARCADIA 1? She's back with more angel goodness, and this time the players get in on the heavenly feeling. We've got four new player ancestries plus two awesome NPCs to add to your game. Get ready to meet the scions! The art in this article comes from the great. <br> <br><strong> Good Fences Make Good Neighbors</strong> by Justice Arman with art by Elisa Serio. Sometimes you steal a painting from a local noble and need to unload it fast. Other times you need to get your hands on some outlawed firearms. That's where our fences come in! This article contains rules for buying and selling stolen goods and three unique NPCs ready to fence for you. <br> <br><strong> I Cut Off Its Snout</strong> by Rudy Basso with art by Gustavo Pelissari. Sure you've fought owlbears, but have you ever tasted one? This article introduces new rules for cooking up monsters! The critters you fight on adventures might just be your next lunch. Cooked to perfection, these foes aren't just tasty. <br>  &quot;","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2380010/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1681824230","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2380010/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1681824230","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2380010/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1681824230","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2380010/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1681824230","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Arcadia Issue 011 - December 2021</h2>  Welcome to ARCADIA!
