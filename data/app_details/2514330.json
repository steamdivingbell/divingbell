When you choose, you turn to the night phase to ward off increasingly difficult enemy waves attempting to bring you back to ruin. The cycle continues until you defeat all the waves in the run, and you are rewarded for your progress to rebuild the town and upgrade yourself for the next adventure.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2514330/extras/Title_Grow.png?t=1738128150\" /><br><br>During the day phase, you can spend as much time as you\u2019d like growing your garden.
