The Su-25 has seen combat in several conflicts during its more than 25 years in service. The Su-25 combines excellent pilot protection and high speed compared to most dedicated attack aircraft.

Although the Su-25 lacks some of sensors and weapons of the Su-25T, it provides better flight performance and is a more simple aircraft to operate.
