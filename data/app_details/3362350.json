You can also shoot enemies with a pistol. Splashes of blood occur with any successful attack. The player can find and smoke marijuana to gain a higher jump. The violence is cartoonish but bloody, and all the enemies are zombies/vampires although they are dressed in police/bishop/freemason uniforms. They are not human enemies.
