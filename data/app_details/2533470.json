{"about_the_game":"It's a groundbreaking simulator where you can experience the life of mushrooms. As a mushroom, you can't walk, just peacefully stand in the forest. The forest is perfect for calming your heart.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Varieties</h2>There are over 50 different types of mushrooms. Even if you start alone, the mushrooms will multiply rapidly, and it will soon become lively. Each one has a unique personality. Oh? That mushroom over there seems a bit strange...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Touch</h2>You can collect spores by touching the mushrooms. These spores might come in handy for something. Be careful not to touch them too much, as it weakens the mushrooms.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Relaxation Effect</h2>The sounds of the forest will bring a relaxing effect to you. At night, you can even watch the mushrooms and enchanting fireflies. You can also play music if you like.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Spawn Rate</h2>If you want to spend time with specific mushrooms, you'll be able to change the mushroom's appearance rate after a certain period.
