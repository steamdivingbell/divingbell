As soon as it approaches, players must don gas masks in order to survive. <br>But these masks have a limited shelf life. <br>At the same time, you have to find solutions in the short time available to protect the train from the effects of the storm!<br><br><strong>5 days, 5 areas. No mistakes!</strong><br><br>Each level represents a day of the journey and brings with it new areas and challenges.<br><br>If you don't manage to protect the train or fix the problems in time, the train becomes unusable. The crew (i.e. the players) will succumb to the storm as the gas mask won't last forever. This means you have to start the day all over again.<br><br>Can your group make it through all five days, solve the problems and outwit the toxic storm to reach Silverton safely?<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ART-STYLE</h2></strong><br><br>The art style of Ticket to Silverton is stylised, with a mixture of fantasy and dream world look.

The areas look like something out of a dream, with unusual colours and details that give the environment a special atmosphere.<br><br>The focus was on making the graphics as good as possible to make the game not only visually appealing, but also fun and varied. The textures are high quality, the lighting effects are harmonious and the animations are fluid, making the experience feel lively and modern.<br><br>Thanks to the imaginative style, the different areas in the game can be designed in a variety of ways, so that each new level offers a new, interesting atmosphere.
