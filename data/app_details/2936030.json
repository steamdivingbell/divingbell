{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EXPLORE AN OPEN WORLD</h2>Scavenge rare scrap and discover new bots to build and collect as you freely explore the many lush forests, arid deserts, tropical jungles and arctic wastes of Botworld. Over the course of the story-driven single player campaign, you\u2019ll discover new environments, meet a variety of characters, collect rare treasures and uncover the many secrets hidden at the heart of Botworld.  But make sure you have a strong team of bots, because you never know what's around the corner.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2936030/extras/bot_exploration.gif?t=1733991320\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ENGAGE IN REAL-TIME BATTLES</h2>Outsmart your foes in a unique real-time tactical battle system. Your bots will leap, charge, stun or blast around the arena with advanced AI, while you plan the perfect time to deploy abilities like Frost Missile or Firewall to support your bot team and stomp your foes. Each bot has unique abilities and a powerful Ultimate - combining these with the powerful player abilities is the key to becoming a seasoned Botmaster.
