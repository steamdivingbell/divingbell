You will lead the warriors of different clans to find the truth of history. Each clan has its own unique playstyle and so does each class. You can recruit a beast army to help you, or build a huge Bronion Works, or even construct a magic field to defeat powerful enemies. Each fight plays out differently, so let your creativity run wild.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WORLD OUTLOOK</h2>The ancestors once built a great and prosperous country in the Wilderness, and each clan lived and multiplied with the help of the ancestors. Until the day disaster came, the meteorite destroyed the world of the ancestors, while the demons, ghosts and orcs ravaged this land, and even the witches who sheltered Human broke their covenant and disappeared. As the guider of the former ancestors, you revived and arrived.
