{"about_the_game":"- World Story -<br />\r\nThe game &quot;Ninnin&quot; is set in &quot;Fifty City,&quot; where the protagonist lives. Fifty City is a fictional city where ordinary people and ninjas coexist.<br />\r\nOriginally, Fifty City was a peaceful place. However, sudden invasions by the ruthless &quot;Hunter&quot; gangs have caused incidents and accidents in various locations. As the city lacked a military presence and only had the police to contend with the gangs, it was challenging to stop them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo address this, the government recruited mercenaries from the ninja community to combat the gangs. The families of these mercenaries also moved into the city, fostering a coexistence between ninjas and ordinary residents. Thanks to the ninjas, the incidents caused by the gangs have significantly decreased. However, the &quot;Hunter&quot; gangs still hold their ground within the city. Concerned about this, the government officially employed the mercenaries as ninja police to protect the city.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Game Story -<br />\r\nThe protagonist, &quot;Ninnin,&quot; was a cute child born and raised in &quot;Fifty City.&quot; When they were young, they narrowly escaped being killed by the gangs but received help from a certain ninja police officer. Ever since then, the protagonist held deep respect for ninja police and, although not a ninja, dedicated themselves to intense training and eventually became a member of the ninja police force. Now, faced with the threat against their own life and the city, the protagonist ventures into the &quot;Hunter&quot; gang's hideout to defeat them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Game Features -<br />\r\nThe game is divided into three sections. but now  there are 2 boss implemented only with in the third section. Each section features four bosses, and it is a PVE single-player game where you engage in one-on-one battles. Clearing all four bosses in a section allows you to progress to the next section.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn line with the ninja concept, you can use weapons called &quot;Kunai&quot; and bombs for attacks. You also have the ability to perform double jumps and downward jumps, which ordinary people cannot do. The combat mechanics are straightforward, and you cannot change the key bindings for weapon usage in the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you clear sections, the number of available weapons increases by one, and a tutorial ready for the game. Additionally, with each section change, the game's background, and boss designs all change. Although the game continuously features 1:1 boss battles, each boss has different skills and motions to keep the gameplay engaging.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Developer's Comment -<br />\r\nThe playtime is not lengthy, and the difficulty of the bosses is not too challenging compared to other games. Although it may be simpler in comparison, we put a lot of effort into creating it with care. If you want to play a game for a short time before bed, have a little spare time, or just want to see cute pixel characters, playing this game will be helpful. ^^","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2408720/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1703344564","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2408720/page.bg.jpg?t=1703344564","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2408720/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1703344564","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2408720/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1703344564","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"- World Story -<br />\r\nThe game &quot;Ninnin&quot; is set in &quot;Fifty City,&quot; where the protagonist lives.
