In order to dominate close-quarter combat (CQB), you need to master the different stunts and how to use them in harmony with the environment. Seek cover by sliding where your enemies' bullets can't reach you, or take an aggressive stance and make them seek cover by diving head-on and emptying everything you have on them. Every stunt is different, with its own benefits and drawbacks; learning to use them in the correct situation makes all the difference in combat.<br><br>&quot;You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.&quot; \u2013 Bruce Lee<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dive</h2>Diving is explosive movement that allows you to quickly dodge incoming fire and makes you a harder target to hit. The 360-degree free aiming system allows you to engage any opponent while diving. Use this to your advantage by combining movement and firing; you will last longer in combat.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Slide</h2>No matter how good you are, sometimes you need to reassess the situation and seek cover while formulating a new approach. Sliding makes you a smaller target for the enemy and allows you to find hard-to-reach cover. It is advised to keep laying prone until you can hear the enemy reloading.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unannounced Stunt</h2>This stunt will be announced later.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unannounced Stunt</h2>This stunt will be announced later.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2663890/extras/choose.png?t=1733926369\" /><br>Decide whether you're going to storm the enemy stronghold and rain down lead-filled justice or stand your ground with your fellow Suits and teach law enforcement not to poke their noses where they don't belong.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2663890/extras/facing.png?t=1733926369\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2663890/extras/slowmotion.png?t=1733926369\" /><br>Leaving rooms full of defeated enemies earns you the ability to slow down time around you and gain an extra edge. When you enter slow motion, you are able to dodge incoming bullets, take better aim at your opponents, and advance to the next firing position more safely.

If you are overwhelmed, you can improve your survival chances by grabbing submachine guns with a high rate of fire.
