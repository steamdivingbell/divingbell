The PC can crawl into narrow spaces like vents and holes and interact with certian elements in the scene by giving a comment or by using the lift for example. When you get chased or get scared the PC makes a scared noise or starts to breath heavily, which he also does when the players sprints for too long and the PC has no stamina.
