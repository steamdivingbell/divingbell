{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You're a hero on a quest to save the world from the interdimensional monster known as Zadeus ([Zuh-day-us])!

These buffs range from increasing a card's damage, lowering its cost, or even making one of your minions throw explosive barrels each time it attacks. Get creative and put together some overpowered card monstrosities!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ADAPTED FROM THE TABLETOP GAME</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Adapted from the tabletop game Mage Tower, but updated and enhanced with over 400 new cards and monsters to create a huge roguelike adventure!  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1698850/extras/mage_tower.jpg?t=1735505423\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Tom Vasel from The Dice Tower in his tabletop review: &quot;It's fun, it really is! ... if you play it, you're not gonna get something that you can play a couple times and you're done with.
