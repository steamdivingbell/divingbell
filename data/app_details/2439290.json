{"about_the_game":"Piracy has never been this fun! Sail the high seas, plundering booty. Start off in a small ship that you can use to ram other ships to plunder their gold.

The Trade Update. Perhaps you grow weary of the constant struggle of hunting down merchant vessels in order to liberate them of their cargo.
