{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Inner Storyline</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Nicole who is in a coma, finds herself in a world that she cannot escape. She continues to lurk through the dark hallways of this textureless world to find some sign of hope. Furthermore, she is being stalked by an entity that is gaurding the maze. The origin is unknown. Will she escape?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Inner Gameplay</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In harder difficulties, the green cubes will provide the player with currency that they can use in the upgrade menu. Some cubes will be red, which will give the player newfound abilities that they can use against the entity who follows you in Normal and Harder Modes. Your objective is to complete the maze effectively and find the red door. Once you have collected all five red cubes, you will be able to escape through the red door. You will also be stalked by an entity within the maze, so you must be careful not to run into it.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Inner Boss Fight</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Inner will also have a boss battle. You can obtain a blue cube to enter the blue door in Normal and above difficulties. This will provide the player with a tough challenge and can double your currency.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Inner Difficulty Options</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If your a casual or hardcore player, inner will give you plenty of options to enjoy your time. Modes range from Easy to Night Terror. There is a total of five difficulties:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Easy</strong> - Easy difficulty will give the player freedom to explore the maze without the pressure of being stalked. There is no enemy in Easy, however, it will give the player a chance to try out the abilities and unlock an achievement along the way.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Normal</strong> - Normal difficulty will not only add the enemy to the maze, but it will also serve as a balanced challenge, especially, if you havent upgraded your cubes yet. As you unlock more upgrades, Normal should become fairly easy to complete, however, it will still challenge the player at first.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Hardcore</strong>\u00a0- Hardcore difficulty will be a major step up from the Normal difficulty. The design of the maze will start to shift as you approach higher difficulties and Hardcore showcases the first steps of that transtion. The enemy will be faster. If you continue to upgrade your cubes, Hardcore should become more balanced.\u00a0</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Nightmare</strong> - Nightmare difficulty is meant for the most hardcore players. The enemy will be at the same speed as Hardcore, however, now the enemy makes no sound. Normally, the enemy will make glitch sounds, but in this mode, it is silent. Although, the enemy has a cry that will still be let out occasionally. QuickTip - You can still hear the glitch sounds if you use SuperReveal.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Night Terror</strong> - Night Terror is exactly what it sounds like. This mode is only for those who are very dedicated to playing Inner and will serve as the hardest challenge in the game. You will have to upgrade all your cubes to max to even play this difficulty. The enemy is twice as fast as the Nightmare enemy. All I can say is good luck.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>EndGame</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Completing the game in general will give the player more points to spend on upgrading the abilities up to tier five. Harder difficulties will reward the player with more points. Night Terror is the hardest difficulty. Players will have to unlock all tier five upgrades before entering this mode.</p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Easy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3247840/e2c63f8fa6bb5e39f15564e6a636e01061571e07.jpg"},{"name":"Normal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3247840/31dd383535bc7dfb5195fd963cca5bbd0474e28a.jpg"},{"name":"Hardcore","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3247840/ee4c1eb204f776b082db465bfb2cabebbf6d29dc.jpg"},{"name":"Nightmare","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3247840/0a803ff76f74eaea96e9938ce38bc7db01bba1e6.jpg"},{"name":"Omega Light","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3247840/b20defe4fc4d9a650bf869234d835245f55b3f38.jpg"},{"name":"Omega Reveal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3247840/25a6a1b79df86cb3f04fdf6d151ca79396291bc2.jpg"},{"name":"Omega Sprint","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3247840/c9143456103be82e15412991501ae59595c72048.jpg"},{"name":"Omega Walk","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3247840/cbc0665596ae0e8fa27b9bff8956197128a2479a.jpg"},{"name":"Omega Spark","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3247840/c73f36ae22e88d037832d1e5853b4d49b0876a54.jpg"},{"name":"Wake Up","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3247840/d8d7c70ecba55db9fac5a0ddb27a591fe39ff94d.jpg"}],"total":10},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3247840/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729828555","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3247840/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1729828555","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3247840/b6ee7be1b3c48db8056411932b2f002a190d6568/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729828555","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3247840/b6ee7be1b3c48db8056411932b2f002a190d6568/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729828555","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Inner Storyline</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Nicole who is in a coma, finds herself in a world that she cannot escape.
