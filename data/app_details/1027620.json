He lives with his parents in the sleepy countryside for five years, helping them run their humble family business \u2014 while the rest of his friends leave home, and leave him behind. <br><br>When Mitsuki finally leaves the nest, he\u2019s twenty-three years old, and woefully behind with his studies. If he wants to get accepted into university, he\u2019ll need to re-learn everything he was taught during high school, and then some.  <br><br>Mitsuki moves to Tokyo to attend a rigorous cram school, with the hopes of passing his university entrance exams next spring. He soon finds, however, that his other classmates treat him like a social outcast, being the oldest at his school by far. It proves impossible to make friends, and Mitsuki consigns himself to an isolated, lonely existence...  <br><br>That is, until he meets the single mother, Himuro Kyouko, who just-so-happens to live in the same apartment complex as him.  <br><br>Mitsuki offers to help Kyouko babysit her daughter, Tama. Kyouko, in turn, helps Mitsuki study for his upcoming exams. Over the course of a year, the two bond \u2014 first, as friends, and then as something more.  <br> <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1027620/extras/features.png?t=1728710865\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Around 80,000 words of text (approx 5-6 hours of reading)</li><li>Detailed background and character art</li><li>A custom OST</li><li>1080p display</li><li>Daily messages from Kyouko, the story\u2019s heroine</li><li>A kinetic story with no choices or branches</li><li>A cute single mother!</li></ul></p>[/*][/list]","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Introductions","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1027620/c281fea72b4a9c99bbaec9ce44d7b16cc8e0d41b.jpg"},{"name":"Omelette rice","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1027620/b4cc9e493cecbfdc935715121ff8a8864fecbe0d.jpg"},{"name":"Kyouko","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1027620/b105d310e6db279319e94b4806bc87536b66937a.jpg"},{"name":"Interrupted","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1027620/45dd7de46ceb5e38db568f315cbde9e0b70e368c.jpg"},{"name":"A quiet moment","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1027620/a3fa137df951d6bb8f9f86ef0b41249888a5ae7b.jpg"},{"name":"Sun and surf","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1027620/afd053694fc758f6f1f409e91acae46e4f1ad866.jpg"},{"name":"Shaved ice","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1027620/223009fe7feb2810ec74283b8fe5ae3f73c080ed.jpg"},{"name":"Victory","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1027620/0bad2130648925d8a146ec25bd0fc536c9b187fb.jpg"},{"name":"Hot springs","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1027620/ce225f9eead78e387c0394a58004b621944de18b.jpg"},{"name":"Stumble","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1027620/0b5679eb77d71139c7b5d65fe786309f6919c17b.jpg"}],"total":14},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1027620/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728710865","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1027620/page.bg.jpg?t=1728710865","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1027620/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728710865","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1027620/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728710865","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"This game depicts a slowly-developing romance between two young adults.
