{"about_the_game":"Starlair is a Metroidvania where the players create the worlds. You play as a bounty hunter traveling the galaxy looking for adventure - and riches. Every planet in the galaxy is created by another player. Either play or build - or both! It's up to you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe world creator allows you to build your own Metroidvania style adventure game - with potentially dozens of hours of gameplay, and then upload it to the Starlair universe to challenge players. Each world will have unique rewards that will entice many bounty hunters to visit. They'll be able to harvest resources which allows them to upgrade their player and ship.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"First Landing","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3126380/1f6da541fe4a03c9d9a8d457158c3d76f7f8245d.jpg"},{"name":"Never Outmatched","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3126380/523ee8d51d9cb1300a6d668a6b58470dcf10c87b.jpg"},{"name":"Space Loot","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3126380/b4905c813d9d6368c103747ba3e2b30e9c82f65a.jpg"},{"name":"Shooting Star","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3126380/0fcc134b2f8e6c255f10c16b7de74157b18117a8.jpg"},{"name":"Standard Relic","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3126380/498c85d9452cbe6a5506c8a9fbfe160abf160c2c.jpg"},{"name":"Time Bomb Relic","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3126380/d15b127a6f348776916bda98bc260576c2363647.jpg"}],"total":6},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3126380/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737049913","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3126380/page.bg.jpg?t=1737049913","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3126380/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737049913","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3126380/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737049913","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Starlair is a Metroidvania where the players create the worlds.
