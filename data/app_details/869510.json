{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As the developer of this game, I\u2019m trying to explore a new type of deck-building battle game. To determine whether my current concept deviates too much from mainstream preferences, I\u2019ve created a basic version of the gameplay along with a small portion of content for everyone to evaluate. Since this game is highly experimental, there is currently no English support, nor do I have plans to add it at the moment.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Here are the core design ideas that this game offers:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">No distinction between &quot;your turn&quot; and &quot;my turn&quot;\u2014both players act simultaneously. There's no need to endure the long and tedious animations during your opponent\u2019s turn.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">An innovative &quot;power&quot; mechanism. Instead of separate &quot;attack&quot; and &quot;health&quot; values, both are unified under &quot;power&quot;. Taking damage also decreases your damage output, making &quot;speed&quot; (the order of actions) extremely important.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Restrained numerical design. Most of the numbers you\u2019ll see in battles are kept to single or at most double digits, bringing a gameplay experience closer to that of a board game.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Limited influence of randomness (unsuccessfully, though). I tried to remove the card draw mechanic and use probability-based resource generation tied to characters in an attempt to reduce the impact of luck on the outcome. However, as things stand, the current resource generation system still makes luck too influential, and I might come up with a better solution for this in the future.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">I have many more fancy mechanics and ideas that haven\u2019t been implemented in this version. If you\u2019re looking forward to seeing the game with more polish, have any suggestions, or even if you find certain aspects of the current version frustrating, please feel free to let me know in any form.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As there\u2019s currently only one server located in China, the online battle experience may be poor for overseas players. If you\u2019d like to try the battle mode, I recommend using the server program included in the game folder to set up your own server.</p>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/869510?t=1730649612","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/869510?t=1730649612","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/869510/9e11cb4e732294a8364cb8b2c40c659629cfbb85/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730649612","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/869510/9e11cb4e732294a8364cb8b2c40c659629cfbb85/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730649612","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As the developer of this game, I\u2019m trying to explore a new type of deck-building battle game.
