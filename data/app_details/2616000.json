{"about_the_game":"Transform the look of your favourite animals in Meadow! This pack contains two skins: one Striped Polecat skin for the Fox and one Leopard skin for the Lynx.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you would come across striped polecat while on a walk in Africa, it would be hard to blame you if your first natural instinct would be to keep your distance. These animals looks very much like skunks, and while we\u2019d wager that most people on earth have never been subjected to being sprayed by a skunk, most people do know that skunks spray predators with a horrifically foul smelling musk that they secrete from their anal glands. Striped polecats are, however, not skunks. So would you be safe from nasty bum spray with these fellers? No! They too can secrete their own blend of deodorant from hell, only not quite as potent as the one skunks have in their arsenal. That\u2019s what experts say, at least. We\u2019re not keen to verify that claim. Note: bum spray is not included in this skin pack.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLeopards also belong to the group of animals we recommend that you keep your distance from. A lot of us know how much it sucks to be clawed by a house cat, so imagine the absolute mayhem a cat ten times bigger can cause. But boy are they beautiful, with their majestic spots. Did you know that the spots of a leopard are called rosettes because they\u2019re similar to roses in shape? Or that they can reach running speeds of up to 58 km/h? Oh, and they can jump up to 6 meters. Yeah, so don\u2019t get on their bad side.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2616000/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1701341697","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2616000/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1701341697","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2616000/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1701341697","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2616000/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1701341697","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Transform the look of your favourite animals in Meadow!
