This means that Steam users can play with mobile players and vice versa, and with players on any other storefront than Steam.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LEADERBOARDS</h2>See the top players and their completion time for each level in the global leaderboards. Try completing levels as fast as possible to get your name and replay featured at the top of the leaderboard!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FREE PLAY</h2>You don't have to be limited to the Story Mode levels if you just want to experience an endless number of new levels. This mode is also suitable for players that find certain levels too difficult, and want to keep playing at a more comfortable difficulty level. For each difficulty tier in Story Mode (A, B, C... etc), there is an equivalent tier in Free Play with an infinite number of randomly generated levels. Free Play tiers are unlocked by reaching that tier in Story Mode.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SOLO RACE</h2>Solo race is all about beating your own best time. You see your own ghost of your best run yet, and keep iterating to improve your time. Solo Race levels are unlocked by completing that level in Story Mode.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">REPLAYS</h2>When completing a level, or when dying, you can hit the Replay button to save a replay of your gameplay that level. This is useful if:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> You want to watch back a play that you were happy with<br></li><li> You want to share a play with a friend<br></li><li> Stumped by a difficult level? Pause a replay and click &quot;Play from here&quot; to give it a redo from that spot</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SPEED RUN</h2>For the speedrunners, Worm Game's got you covered. After completing Story Mode, you unlock Speed Run. This is about completing Story Mode in one play session, and getting the best time on the speed run leaderboards. This is divided into:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Classic Speed Run: You die, you restart the current level. Time keeps running.<br></li><li> Hardcore Speed Run: You die, you lose. Completing a hardcore run is in itself an incredible feat, let alone beating someone's best time. Earn a special badge for others to see, as well as a customization to your worm.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BONUS LEVELS</h2>After completing Story Mode, you also unlock Bonus Levels. These levels are unorthodox and challenge you to play Worm Game in new ways.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Worm Game is configurable</h2><strong>Tilt Screen</strong><br>By default, Worm Game looks the same on PC and Mobile (Android and iOS). However, you can turn on the Tilt Screen setting to get a wide view on PC.<br><br><strong>Track Player</strong><br>By default, the camera focuses more on each room than the worm. However, you can adjust a slider that lets you fully track the worm.<br><br><strong>Pause between Rooms</strong><br>By default, the game does not pause as you go from one room to the next. However, some people might prefer a short pause to get more time to see what lies ahead. This can be adjusted in Settings. Note that this is not available in multiplayer as everything is live.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2444930/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731084446","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2444930/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1731084446","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2444930/de269b16cc7cb10f1c0371eb33fd8eaabd7358a9/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731084446","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2444930/de269b16cc7cb10f1c0371eb33fd8eaabd7358a9/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731084446","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Worm Game is an intense escape mission from the vaults of worm hell, taking you on an increasingly difficult journey to sneak through the heavily guarded gates.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Over 40 increasingly difficult levels in STORY MODE<br></li><li> Race against other players in MULTIPLAYER<br></li><li> Get your name on the LEADERBOARDS - show off your skills and challenge your friends<br></li><li> Infinite randomly generated levels in FREE PLAY - play an endless number of levels at any difficulty<br></li><li> Race against yourself in SOLO RACE - keep improving your times and race against your own ghost<br></li><li> Save your REPLAYS - watch and share your plays, and even jump back into the gameplay at any time in the replay to practice<br></li><li> Complete Story Mode to unlock SPEED RUN - finish the game in a single play session, as fast as you can!<br></li><li> Unlock the BONUS LEVELS - a series of unorthodox levels that put your skills from Story Mode to the test</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SIMPLE CONTROLS</h2>The game can be played with mouse only - click and hold the mouse button to guide the worm.<br><br>Worm Game supports gamepad - control the worm with the joystick, and go faster by pressing A or any trigger button.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">STORY MODE</h2>Story Mode consists of tiers of increasing difficulty, denoted by the letters of the alphabet (A, B, C...).<br>Each tier has 3 levels.
