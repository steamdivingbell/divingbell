{"about_the_game":"Prepare to embark on an unforgettable journey through the post-apocalyptic world of UNFATED, the first MMO built on Unreal Engine 5, unlocking the full potential of advanced graphics and breathtaking visuals. Brace yourself for an immersive experience where survival and resistance intertwine in a struggle for humanity's future against an ancient menace that emerged from behind the ice wall.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2511660/extras/Banner_1.png?t=1710382294\" /><br><br>Not from the depths of outer space, but from an uncharted region concealed behind the icy confines of Antarctica, they emerged\u2014a hidden faction that once thrived as the first inhabitants of Earth. Unleashing a war of devastating proportions, they sought to reclaim dominance over a world they once ruled. This long-forgotten chapter in history led to an extermination, reshaping the planet's destiny.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2511660/extras/Banner_2.png?t=1710382294\" /><br><br>Now, ten years after the catastrophic attack, humanity stands divided into two factions. One group roams the barren landscapes, scavenging for sustenance and vital resources, their struggle against hunger and deprivation never-ending. The other faction, valiantly resisting the ancient invaders, finds sanctuary in underground bunkers. Within these fortified havens, they muster aid, weapons, and supplies for those who prove their mettle in the battle against their former rulers. The ancient beings harbour no intent to obliterate all humans, selectively eliminating those who resist while sparing those who submit. As a result, the chances of surviving an alien bullet may be higher for the first group, but hunger remains their most formidable adversary. Meanwhile, the resistance wields abundant supplies and weaponry, fiercely protecting their resources.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2511660/extras/Banner_3.png?t=1710382294\" /><br><br>UNFATED's expansive world hosts numerous alien outposts, remnants of an ancient civilization that once held dominion. These formidable bastions serve as staging grounds for their otherworldly forces. Hidden deep underground, sinister creatures, once concealed behind the veil of history, now emerge only under the cover of darkness. Dismantling these outposts and vanquishing the malevolent creatures earns the recognition of the resistance, granting access to a vast repository of potent weapons and supplies. The completion of quests reveals the hidden truths of the ancient beings' origins, piecing together the puzzle of their reign and igniting a spark of hope for survival.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2511660/extras/Banner_4.png?t=1710382294\" /><br><br>As you traverse diverse and unforgiving terrains, you will encounter designated safe zones\u2014refuges from the perils that lurk outside.

Vehicles, essential for traversing the vast open world, can be acquired from skilled mechanics for a fee. Yet, some of the most coveted items and vehicles in guerrilla camps require more than mere currency. Perilous journeys await, as you brave the hazards of the map to acquire these rare treasures.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2511660/extras/Banner_5.png?t=1710382294\" /><br><br>Forge alliances and cultivate friendships with fellow survivors, for strength lies in unity.
