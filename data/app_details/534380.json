{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">It\u2019s been 20 years since the events of the original game. The virus won, and humanity is slowly dying. You play as Aiden Caldwell, a wandering Pilgrim who delivers goods, brings news, and connects the few remaining survivor settlements in barren lands devastated by the zombie virus. However, your true goal is to find your little sister Mia, who you left behind as a kid to escape Dr. Waltz's torturous experiments. Haunted by the past, you eventually make the decision to confront it when you learn that Mia may still be alive in Villedor \u2014 the last city standing on Earth.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You quickly find yourself in a settlement torn by conflict. You\u2019ll need to engage in creative and gory combat, so hone your skills to defeat hordes of zombies and make allies.

With every sunset, monsters take control of the streets. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/534380/extras/02_EXPLOREAPOST.gif?t=1738070628\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Fifteen years ago, humanity was devastated by the Fall \u2014 a catastrophic event that would change the world forever. With the Harran virus spreading around the globe, people quickly found out that all hope for tomorrow is lost.

Learn the ways of combat and parkour to feel the crunch of skulls and slices of flesh as you swing weapons or use your moves to fend off any forms of danger.
