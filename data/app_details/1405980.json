{"about_the_game":"Astronomy and geography laboratory (spacecraft, solar system, earth, moon, relativity, flying over the world, etc.)<br><br>The laboratory contains 4 sub-games. Through these sub-games, you can experience the magnificence of the universe, the beauty of the earth, the spectacle of the moon and the completely different world you see while driving a spaceship at a speed close to the speed of light. The influence of relativity. Our team comes from the California Institute of Technology and the Department of Physics at Oxford University, and integrates physical science formulas into visual effects.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1405980/extras/1.png?t=1659426846\" /><br>Laboratory scenario 1: Traveling in the lunar system<br>You will find yourself in the satellite control room and can observe this beautiful planet in the geostationary satellite orbit. You will see the Himalayas, American metropolitan areas, Amazon forests and densely changing clouds. We have shaped the earth that simulates the world with extremely high resolution! Of course, there is also the moon. You will experience the Apollo landing on the moon, come to the surface of the moon in person, see countless impact craters, and experience the special gravity field of the moon (far lower than that on the earth). Please remember not to fall into a meteorite Impact craters, because some meteor impact craters are several kilometers deep. Together with your children, you can observe the earth\u2019s terrain, clouds and the bright lights of the night city from a completely different perspective.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1405980/extras/2.png?t=1659426846\" /><br>Experimental scenario 2: Wanderers in the solar system<br>We are used to being numb and chasing fame and fortune.
