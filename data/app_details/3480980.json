{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Musical Weapons</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Survivors SymphonYs weapons are musical instruments and their attack patterns based on music. Each combination of weapons creates a musical variation \u2013 leading to over 28 million possible scores. The better your Instruments harmonize, the higher the tempo of the music and the more damage you deal. In addition to your musical weapons, you are also able to break bones, activate special attacks, and reflect bullets. Dash to the rhythm of the music for additional strength.\u00a0\u00a0<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3480980/extras/mus_trans.gif?t=1738348860\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Explore and Defend</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your goal is to survive 4 days, protect the last tree in your base and descent into the well of darkness to face the evil in the abyss. Explore 5 hand-crafted levels - filled with more than 150 unique monsters - and listen for new musicians to help your cause. But beware: While carving your path through hordes of enemies, your base will also be attacked by the evil lurking in the well.  This calls for hard decisions to be made: Do you level up your weapons OR the defenders in your base? Do you keep exploring and gain more experience OR warp back to defend?
