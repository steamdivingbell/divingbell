{"about_the_game":"<strong>Tiny Space Academy</strong> is a 2D space sim where you can grow your own space agency and explore the solar system with rockets you design! You\u2019ll face constant challenges getting your little astronauts into space. There are more than 70 different rocket components to unlock and create custom rockets. You can play the campaign and balance the cost of each rocket or play sandbox and just have fun with the gravity mechanics. The solar system is yours to explore!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Design Unique Rockets for Each Mission:</h2>With over 70 rocket components, you can build unique rockets to explore our solar system. You can create space stations, landers, satellites, and any space craft that you can think of!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1519890/extras/Assembly.gif?t=1617209692\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Land on Multiple Planets:</h2>Tiny Space Academy has over a dozen unique planets and moons to explore. Each with their own mass, atmosphere and terrain challenges. Landing on some of these planets can be difficult, but with the right rocket design, your astronauts will make it down safely!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1519890/extras/Landing.gif?t=1617209692\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore Planet Surface:</h2>You can perform an EVA while on the surface of any planet or moon.
