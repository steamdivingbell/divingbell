{"about_the_game":"Pixel Puzzles World War II, merging history with the definitive jigsaw puzzler on the PC platform.<br><br>Italian tanks during World War II presented a mixed array of designs and performance. While some models, like the Carro Armato M13/40 and the Semovente 75/18, showcased innovative features and capable firepower, others suffered from technical issues and inadequate armor. Hindered by limited industrial capacity and a fragmented approach to tank development, Italy's tank forces faced challenges in competing with the more advanced tanks of other nations. Despite their shortcomings, Italian tanks played roles in various campaigns, particularly in North Africa and the Mediterranean theater.
