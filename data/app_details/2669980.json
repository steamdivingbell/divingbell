{"about_the_game":"Need the right synth vibes for your cyberpunk game? Want some bops to turn your modern city into a lonely abyss or place forgotten by the rest of the world? Then pick up to Inanimateness! ayato sound create is back with another music pack with 21 BGMs to fill your game with the feeling of being the only one in the world left or the last hero when all the rest have been relegated to ancient myths. Explore dungeons to the sounds of mechanical beats and guitars, ponder what options your hero has left to a piano-heavy track, and let an almost western-style guitar guide your path when your hero enters a mostly deserted city while searching for a long-lost friend.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInstead of relying on slow and quiet melodies to make the tracks feel somber, this pack keeps solid beats and toe-tapping tunes going while mixing in deep echo-y effects or lonely instruments to give them the right emotion. Battle against enemies with heavy metal guitars roaring in your players\u2019 ears, or turn that track on when your hero realizes that they only have a few minutes to escape a boobytrapped factory! And when it\u2019s time to take a break, play one of the tracks that fills the void with echoing synth and subtle gongs just so your players don\u2019t ever truly relax in such a strange world. Multiple audio file formats make it simple to use each track in your favorite engine. So if you want some new tunes to set the mood and make your players feel your hero\u2019s loneliness, check out Inanimateness!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nContents:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* 21 royalty free BGM<br />\r\n* wav, ogg, mp3, m4a and looping ogg file formats included<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTerms of Use:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack is for use in RPG Maker Series or the engine of your choice.<br />\r\nOK to be used in Commercial projects<br />\r\nContents can be edited<br />\r\nOK for use in games with gore<br />\r\nOK for use in adult-rated games","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2669980/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1698942065","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2669980/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1698942065","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2669980/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1698942065","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2669980/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1698942065","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Need the right synth vibes for your cyberpunk game?
