{"about_the_game":"Cold deserted space?..<br />\r\nNot anymore!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA short novel for 15 minutes will immerse you in a noisy corner of the universe of some distant future (or past?) where you can maintain your usual lifestyle, even while in deep space: throw your feet on the control panel of a spaceship, walk around the bridge in your underwear, refuel at the nearest no-name station, walk around the moon and much, much more... The main thing is not to forget a daily sustenance!<br />\r\nBut there won't be any problems with that, right? Yeah \u2013 tell that to the girl who spilled coffee on the food replicator! Of course, there are a lot of eateries around, but you need to remember the rules of decency, and try not to violate some Intergalactic Code of Some Boring Nonsense.<br />\r\nTo eat at the nearest cafe \u2013 what could be easier, right? Right?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are two endings in the game. It won't be hard to find both.
