{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Train Traffic Manager isn't your grandpa's model railway set.</h2>Think fast, plan faster, and keep those trains from turning into flaming metal confetti.

It's more fun than a cactus in your caboose!<br><br>Each environment has its own unique challenges. Deserts have meteor showers (because of course they do), forests have fallen trees (what's a forest without a little lumber?), winters bring the freeze to your switches, and at midnight, well, you'll just have to see.<br><br>And if the chaos of normal mode gets too much, take a breather in endless mode. No objectives, just you, the tracks, and an infinite number of trains. It's the zen garden of train management!<br><br>Ready to dive into the madness?
