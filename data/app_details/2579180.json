Expand and grow  your city by getting points through placing buildings<br>to their desired location as each building tile has a specific synergy with other tiles or merge<br>the same buildings to upgrade their density to  bigger buildings. The goal is to keep getting<br>points to keep growing your dream city.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2579180/extras/GAME_STEAM_BG.gif?t=1715662781\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2579180/extras/Place_land.gif?t=1715662781\" /><br><br>Your start of the game by placing land on the hex grid. You are given limited land at the start.<br>So you should place them strategically so you will know where to place building tiles and<br>which suitable place will give you the most points or best to merge buildings. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2579180/extras/place_buildings.gif?t=1715662781\" /><br><br>From the start  of every session till the end,  you have full  freedom to choose what building<br>tiles to place and when to place them. In this game currently you get to place three types of<br>buildings, either houses, shops or factory tiles. Each building tile type has a preference, so if<br>you place them to their most preferred location, then you will get a lot of points. For example<br>,houses really like having other house tiles  next to each other leading you to get more points<br>however they do not like having factory tiles next to them, leading you to lose points. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2579180/extras/merge.gif?t=1715662781\" /><br><br>One of the main highlights of Merging City, is merging  two existing buildings of the same type<br>to increase their density or building size. Each building tile has 3 Densities. Low density,<br>medium density and high density. Each density has 3 levels. You also get points when you<br>merge.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2579180/extras/get_points.gif?t=1715662781\" /><br><br>When you place a building tile to its most desired location or merge two existing buildings of<br>the same type you are rewarded with points. In this game you will need to continuously<br>generate points to get Land tiles. So Place your tiles strategically so that you can keep<br>merging buildings, generate points and expand your ever growing city.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2579180/extras/features.gif?t=1715662781\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What Merging City <strong>Offers</strong></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Relaxing</strong>  City building experience with <strong>no worry of City Management</strong></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong> Freedom</strong> to choose and when to place tiles with <strong>no RNG</strong></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Build</strong> an <strong>endless</strong> ever growing city with <strong> minimal strategy elements</strong></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Great to play in <strong>small sessions</strong> every now and then</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Merge buildings</strong> and watch them grow to <strong>big buildings</strong></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What Merging City Does <strong>Not</strong> Offers</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>No <strong>city management</strong></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>No <strong>complex resource management</strong></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>No <strong>4X Strategy</strong></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>No <strong>RNG to place Tiles</strong></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>No <strong>Trading</strong></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Merging City Draws Inspiration From <strong>Awesome Games</strong> Like</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Dorf Romantik</strong></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Islanders</strong></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Tile Town</strong></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>2048 Game</strong></li></ul><br>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2579180?t=1715662781","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2579180/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1715662781","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2579180/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1715662781","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2579180/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1715662781","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2579180/extras/_GAME_NAME___1_.png?t=1715662781\" /><br><br><strong>Merging City</strong> is a chill strategic  city building puzzle  game with no worries of management. <br>You get to choose when to  place land tiles  and buildings tiles  such as houses, shops and<br>factories, with no RNG.
