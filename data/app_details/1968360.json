{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A revolution in the shoot 'em up genre! This game lets you rotate your ship and shoot diagonally at enemies, adding modern controls to retro gameplay.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This small change in controls creates a huge difference in gameplay. You'll find this game to be more realistic, more immersive, and more challenging than your typical shoot 'em up game.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mesmerizing Graphics</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The ships rotate in 3D, just like real fighter jets. The enemies move in beautiful circular patterns while pulling barrel rolls. The laser beams glow like in your favorite sci fi movies. The explosions are realistic, with particles and smoke. And it all runs at a silky smooth framerate with v-sync.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1968360/extras/L4-explosion.png?t=1731536816\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Varied and\u00a0Balanced Gameplay</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You'll get a different experience every time you play this game. The enemies appear in randomized positions, and they use AI to make their own decisions about where to go. You won't get bored playing the same levels over and over. And you cannot simply memorize the levels - you must have enough skill to beat this game.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each level introduces a new enemy with a new weapon, creating a new gameplay experience. The enemy weapons include lasers, splitting bullets, and rockets. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each enemy weapon has its own pros and cons. Lasers move fast, but they don't deal much damage. Splitting bullets occupy a wide area of the screen, but you can find gaps between them. Rockets can be shot down, but they'll deal a lot of damage if you don't.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The final level adds heat-seeking rockets for an extra level of challenge.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1968360/extras/L5-redLaser.png?t=1731536816\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Upgrade your Ship</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You'll start off only a single laser cannon with 3-round burst fire. As you progress through the levels, you'll have the opportunity to upgrade your ship by collecting powerups. You can upgrade your ship to have 2 or 3 laser cannons, and automatic fire.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1968360/extras/L2-explosion.png?t=1731536816\" /> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Simple Controls</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">All you need to do is move and shoot. It's a truly retro experience, without the steep learning curve of complex controls. The game is simple enough for anyone to play, yet still challenging for experienced gamers. The game is easy to learn but difficult to master.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1968360/extras/L1-greenLasers.png?t=1731536816\" /> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hybrid Horizontal  / Vertical Shooter</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The enemies enter from the top of the screen, but the screen layout is landscape. Plus, you can shoot at any angle from forward to sideways. This makes <i>Invaders from the Third Dimension</i> the first ever hybrid horizontal/vertical shooter. Now the player has more options than just sliding horizontally and shooting vertically. You can aim diagonally at enemies, so you don't have to put yourself on a collision course.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1968360/extras/L5-rocket-explosion.png?t=1731536816\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">3D Graphics, Retro Gameplay</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The ships are 3D models that rotate in 3 dimensions, not pixelated 2D images </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Real-time dynamic lighting </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Realistic explosions with particles and smoke</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1968360/extras/L3-explosion-rocket.png?t=1731536816\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Better Controls</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Rotate your ship </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Shoot at any angle </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Unleash arcs of 3-round burst fire</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1968360/extras/L1-explosion.png?t=1731536816\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Sick Soundtrack</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Our 80's-style synthwave soundtrack will keep you in the zone.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Save your game</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We automatically save your game at the start of each level.
