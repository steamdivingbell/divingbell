Odd Sequence can be a &quot;best friend&quot; for those who like graphic design with a flat, minimalist, geometric, or modern art style. Who doesn't like a clean interface?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Varied Bot Classes</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2896040/extras/Desc_Class.png?t=1732777299\" />There are many bot classes that you can use in the game (although there are only 3 right now). Each bot class have its own uniqueness, starting from weapon type, basic attack types, special move types, and ultimate skill types. Try them all and choose that suits you best!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Choose A Weapon and Set of Equipment for Your Bots!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2896040/extras/Desc_Weapon_EN.png?t=1732777299\" />Choose your favorite weapon and set of equipment for your bots.

A simple basic attack? Or the most powerful one? Or the most effective one? It's up to you, try to make your own! As a result, you might get the basic attack sequence you want, or you might get a weird, unique, and absurd basic attack sequence. Don't forget to adjust each of these basic attacks!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Choose Your Bot's Special Moves and Ultimate Skills to Your Liking!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2896040/extras/Desc_SPMV_EN.png?t=1732777299\" />Do you want a more offensive game?

Combine your best basic attacks, special moves, and ultimate skills to create an undefeatable bot!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">&quot;Hack&quot; All the Skill Attributes You Want!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2896040/extras/Desc_Hack_EN.png?t=1732777299\" />This is one of the exclusive features in Odd Sequence, which may not exist in other games (at least in my experience). With complex status details, you can change the attribute values of all the basic attacks, special moves, and ultimate skills you want. That's right, as long as the attack attributes aren't &quot;fixed&quot;, you can modify them according to the right type of attacks! Do you want to mess with those attack attributes? Go ahead, try it if you can!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Skill Tree System is Available!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2896040/extras/Desc_Talent_EN.png?t=1732777299\" />What is a skill tree? Is it something that is necessary in certain games? Of course it is! With this skill tree, you can strengthen your bot even further. Activate all the skills in this skill tree from root to leaf to unlock all your bot's full potential! This can also give you a satisfying effect, right?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Defeat a Variety of Enemies!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2896040/extras/Desc_Enemy_EN.png?t=1732777299\" />Adapt to the situation in the stage, because the enemies and obstacles in each chapter are different. So, you need to be able to set the right type of stats and attacks to defeat the enemies and complete the chapter.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Fight the enemy bosses and show them who the real boss is!
