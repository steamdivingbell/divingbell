{"about_the_game":"This game is set in a fractured magical world. Although you are not the protagonist of the story, you are the central figure of the game. It\u2019s a role-playing game that blends action and roguelike elements. You will unravel the story through conversations with various characters and engage in battles with enemies. You can recruit party members and switch between them at any time, offering diverse combat experiences.<br><br>The game features a day and night cycle: daytime favors combat, while nighttime shrouds the scene in darkness, reducing your hit accuracy. However, the monsters lurking in the darkness at night can become your prey, presenting new challenges.<br><br>Each scene contains different magical elements that affect the cooldown and power of your abilities. You can optimize element concentrations to enter the &quot;Elemental Superconductivity&quot; state, giving your abilities massive boosts. But be careful, as enemies can also harness these elements against you.<br><br>There are three classes in the game:<br>    <ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li><strong>Warrior</strong>: Specializes in melee combat with strong defense and health, and can inspire teammates.<br>    </li><li><strong>Mage</strong>: Excels at area damage, using magic orbs and totems to unleash powerful abilities.<br>    </li><li><strong>Sage</strong>: Draws on life force to control the power of rules and can amplify spells through the Sage\u2019s Book, making them even more destructive than the Mage.<br>    </li></ul><br>You can collect materials to craft equipment and potions, but you'll need to unlock blueprints or alchemy formula first. Additionally, the game has a dream system where real-world transactions use gold, while dreams use goodwill as currency. In the dream world, you will face malevolent forces that constantly drain your goodwill.<br><br>The overall pace of the game is relaxed and casual, designed to provide a laid-back adventure rather than high-pressure combat.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3102270/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728025780","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3102270/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1728025780","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3102270/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728025780","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3102270/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728025780","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This game is set in a fractured magical world.
