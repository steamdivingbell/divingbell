{"about_the_game":"<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2908950/extras/Tunnel_Combat_small.gif?t=1726386067\" /><br><br>Tunnel Escape is a rogue-lite exploration RPG/ADV set in a city infected by a zombie virus. It combines action and strategy in a fusion of intense gunplay with turn-based combat, item crafting and a deep skill system. Each bullet shot, each grenade thrown and each step taken will count towards failure or success.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EXPLORE THE UNDERGROUND LABORATORY</h2><br>On the run from the spreading infection in the city, Beatrice discovers the entrance to a secret biological laboratory. Documents mention the existence of a successfully developed vaccine, sending her on a journey deep into the complex as she becomes humanity\u2019s last hope.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2908950/extras/Tunnel_EventsSkills_small.gif?t=1726386067\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">UTILIZE AN ARSENAL OF WEAPONS AND SKILLS</h2><br>Beatrice will need to defend herself from the dangers lurking below. Unlock unique guns, each with their own benefits and downsides; use throwables to blast enemies into pieces, blind them, stun them or set them all on fire. Even a strong kick to the face can turn the tide of battle in your favor - time to unleash the power of high-heels in close-quarters-combat!<br><br>In addition to raw weapon power, Beatrice can learn hundreds of different skills. Every gun has its own set of active skills, for example unlocking the potential of rapid fire for the pistol, using birdshot to hit all enemies at once with the shotgun, or emptying an entire magazine into the undead horde in one go with the automatic rifle. Supplemented by a huge number of passive skills for offense and defense, Beatrice gets access to a growing number of strategic options.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2908950/extras/Tunnel_Boss_Action_small.gif?t=1726386067\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FIGHT UNIQUE ENEMIES AND BOSS BATTLES</h2><br>Zombies are far from the only threat roaming the massive, interconnected facility. Dozens of strange abominations can be encountered, from mutated creatures, infested animals and living plants to weaponized machinery and many more. Every stage features a unique selection of enemies, complete with a boss battle at the end. Defeating a stage boss will require clever use of strategy, learning the enemies\u2019 weaknesses and utilizing the right skills at the right time.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2908950/extras/banners_characters2.png?t=1726386067\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ENJOY HANDCRAFTED ART AND ANIMATIONS</h2><br>Every animation was crafted by use of traditional techniques, with every frame and variation of motion having been carefully hand-drawn and manually refined. <br><br>Beatrice\u2019s facial expressions, subtle bodily movements, particle effects and voice overs for every event are meticulously controlled through scripting.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2908950/extras/Tunnel_EventsChestsCombo_small.gif?t=1726386067\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ENCOUNTER RANDOM EVENTS: EVERY RUN IS DIFFERENT</h2><br>Meet other characters, open chests with valuable loot, buy stat-altering drinks at vending machines, water strange plants (at your own risk) and defeat thieving little rodents among many other events that can be encountered at random. No two runs will be the same as Beatrice needs to adapt to beneficial and dangerous encounters alike.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2908950/extras/Tunnel_Crafting2_small.gif?t=1726386067\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CRAFTING SYSTEM</h2><br>Unlock crafting to combine items into new or stronger ones. Recovery items and ammunition for a secret weapon can be assembled whenever you are not in an active battle.

Whether you play for the story or the challenge, the rogue-lite system of earning permanent upgrades will make the game easier even after failed attempts - and for those seeking the hardest challenge: Beatrice\u2019s level can be lowered in the later game for that extra dose of difficulty.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FULL CONTROLLER SUPPORT AND FORCE FEEDBACK</h2><br>In addition to keyboard controls, every part of the game has full controller support. Furthermore, detailed force feedback simulates hits, kicks, shots and blasts, creating a tactile experience for every action. We recommend giving controller vibration a try for the highest level of immersion.<br><br>For an especially comfortable experience: The game was designed for effortless navigation with just one hand. Left, right or both hands, the control scheme allows you to play the way you desire.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Singularity of Fate","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2908950/70655f4e172667bbdb6aa0e689bfa53634ea75d0.jpg"},{"name":"Mission Bearer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2908950/987390c2a8fabe2663ad1e3fbc11e2af3419ef21.jpg"},{"name":"Mad Scientist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2908950/ca17fbb2f3203e85d2da023d7a78b6bec49d75e4.jpg"},{"name":"Shadow of the Past","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2908950/ae358aaa617e521c2ff2788dc2210349c5122684.jpg"},{"name":"No Way Out","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2908950/8a86685716347120a9456fc18add2c98bc5a8bfa.jpg"},{"name":"Reunion","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2908950/d1f8d1cdf12c43272186e748ef91d4d5b4415b39.jpg"},{"name":"Rat Exterminator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2908950/40d6dd9f5082bebf4ca5b61815b5e052d878b56e.jpg"},{"name":"Heard You\u2019re a Pirate?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2908950/dc113f350caf53488b16a441e40ad5fb48b449ea.jpg"},{"name":"Agile Fighter","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2908950/12a7a05808fb8c1b758f613c5d6c17a938ffdb44.jpg"},{"name":"Strategic Genius","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2908950/c6cc7c8a0955087b6beeacbb8ec265097d8c31aa.jpg"}],"total":17},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2908950/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726386067","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2908950/page.bg.jpg?t=1726386067","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2908950/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726386067","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2908950/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726386067","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: \r\n\r\nViolence, drugs, self-harm, and General Mature Content."},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":2963430,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2908950/extras/Tunnel_Combat_small.gif?t=1726386067\" /><br><br>Tunnel Escape is a rogue-lite exploration RPG/ADV set in a city infected by a zombie virus.
