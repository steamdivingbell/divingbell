You must take charge of a brazen knight, a snarky amazon, a cursed enchantress, and a humble peasant to escape your captors.<br><br>Fight the three-headed Chimera, the two-eyed Biclops, and a horde of insatiable gnomes (They're surprisingly dangerous after a few drinks). Wield swords, or magic, or fight with your wits and grace. If all else fails, pummel your enemies with a chamberpot tied to a stick.<br><br>Unravel the conspiracy behind your abduction.
