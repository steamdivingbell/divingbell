{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build Your Railway Company</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Buy and upgrade trains to make ever more money. Or just spam mouse clicks to jam as many passengers as possible onto already overcrowded commuter trains!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Upgrade The City</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Meet the ever increasing demands of each city district to help citizens achieve their dreams. Or at least keep concreting over nature with ever more condos and high rise office blocks!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Expand Outward</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Extend your rail network to unlock new districts and grow the city into a vast heaving metropolis!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">An Idle Clicker</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Train Metropolis as an idle clicker game that puts you in charge of a railway company. Buy trains and assign them to run between different city districts, transporting the goods and passengers those districts need in order to upgrade to the next level. As each district levels up, you'll need to provide more and more goods and passengers. Upgrade your trains, buy ever more trains, or just click your mouse like crazy to keep up with demand.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A City Builder</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">It's also a city builder in disguise! You don't directly place the roads, buildings and rail tracks. Instead you expand your city by adding ever more districts and choosing their upgrade paths. How you connect those districts via your network of trains will also affect your city's future patterns.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Demo</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The demo contains a smaller selection of different city districts, and takes place on a limited sized island. As well saving is disabled in the demo.</p>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3465250?t=1739492683","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3465250/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1739492683","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3465250/ea9a9ffda3bb3e1e04b3ea2d3c4505099c2343ba/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739492683","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3465250/ea9a9ffda3bb3e1e04b3ea2d3c4505099c2343ba/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739492683","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build Your Railway Company</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Buy and upgrade trains to make ever more money.
