{"about_the_game":"Castle Battles streamlines the mechanics of classic, top-down strategy to create a fast paced style of gameplay like no other. Expand your empire by building castles near bountiful resources, collect gold to amass outlandish armies, and swarm your enemies in 40 unique levels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExplore the illustrated world of \u201cThe Great Tapestry\u201d through four story-rich campaigns: Fight to reclaim your lost homeland as Les Moustachiers. Laugh maniacally as The Clearly Evil Empire. Discover the astral mysteries of The Purperilous. And finally, set out on a hero\u2019s journey as The Order of Awesome to stop the narrative from unravelling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNo soulless micro-transactions to help you here! Classic 4X style mechanics are condensed to their strategic core, meaning action packed matches are measured in minutes rather than hours. Thousands of troops can be in action at a time leading to all out swarm warfare. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnjoy the melding of medieval melodies to the pulse of electronica in the Original Soundtrack by Ex-Static: https://xstatic.bandcamp.com/album/the-original-castle-battles-soundtrack<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt\u2019s time to play\u2026 Castle Battles<br />\r\n<br />\r\n0xFFFA0001 0x00FF1010 0x000PERIL 0x0AWAITS0 0x00YOU000 0xFFFA000F","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"A Genius Tactician","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/568370/6db0e8e2cc317ae8a291f155e92b87923fd8873d.jpg"},{"name":"We Follow Your Lead","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/568370/28995ab6dad3398da3a12834617fee493e6d12a5.jpg"},{"name":"Yessss","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/568370/d670f4e29c59f19989e62708ecb36431a905163d.jpg"},{"name":"Every Good Battle Has Snacks","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/568370/5fa87d71cd23b984cc687dc52e31c05fd1f59194.jpg"},{"name":"Promote My Strategist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/568370/9ee29d4df5187296a5f4acdd624c8930e6cd5a38.jpg"},{"name":"Evil Always Finds A Way","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/568370/2f245a38a3f56f67ed4030e10f8f9949f9c8504f.jpg"},{"name":"No Matter Who Wins...","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/568370/3b7942ed3cc9d2beb1c3e896a29c3790f6f1c931.jpg"},{"name":"The Light Of Awesomeness","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/568370/9229341ff9ee6af6e0c56062cae10833c039b6ad.jpg"},{"name":"Moustachiers","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/568370/6fad584daf5c23d278c2dbcbbaa014c68a184392.jpg"},{"name":"Clearly Evil","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/568370/9bcd3aaae3d96186f3a3c3bd9b435b5556636376.jpg"}],"total":14},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/568370/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1573618775","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/568370/page.bg.jpg?t=1573618775","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/568370/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1573618775","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/568370/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1573618775","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Castle Battles streamlines the mechanics of classic, top-down strategy to create a fast paced style of gameplay like no other.
