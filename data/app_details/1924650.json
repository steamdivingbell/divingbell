{"about_the_game":"In this cooperative electronic board game, you and your friends form a group of adventurers seeking to uncover deeper truths about the universe and themselves. Visit temples, ruins, laboratories, caves, and other places of interest. Work together to complete tasks presented by each location, managing die results with the use of abilities, artifacts and limited amounts of energy and sanity. When seekers succeed in their mission, they gain experience, new abilities, and clues. When they fail, they suffer physical, psychological, or legal consequences that delay or stop their progress. Collect as many clues as possible to decipher, at the end of the game, the hidden secrets of the universe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSeekers is inspired by a television series project of the same name. It can be enjoyed in groups of 2 to 4 players or in solo mode. It combines elements of dice rolling, deduction, and role-playing games.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1924650/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1715554724","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1924650/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1715554724","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1924650/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1715554724","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1924650/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1715554724","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In this cooperative electronic board game, you and your friends form a group of adventurers seeking to uncover deeper truths about the universe and themselves.
