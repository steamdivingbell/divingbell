{"about_the_game":"Fill your party with magical maids, towering angelic knights, lab coat-wearing alchemists, and more with the Heroine Character Generator 9 for MZ pack! Gee-kun-soft\u2019s latest generator pack offers up 47 female parts to help your party members and important NPCs stand out from background characters. Give your punk heroine two-tone hair and a dark coat to wear while your Edo-inspired NPCs dress in gorgeous kimonos.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack includes 5 AccA, 5 AccB, 20 Clothing, 5 Eyes, 5 Front Hair, 5 Rear Hair, 1 Facial Mark, and 1 Glasses parts to give your character designs some updates! Create a straight-haired heroine who starts the game as a maid or shopkeeper\u2019s assistant wearing a simple apron over a dress, and who ditches her uniform for a fiery red dress and cape combo or gilded white armor with a matching headdress to match her fighting style. Give your witch party member a dark and spiky cloak or a dress decorated in stars depending on her powers, and have your isekai-ed heroine with long twin-tails keep her more modern and comfortable dress instead of wearing one of the fantastical outfits.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdd even more fantasy to your world with Jiangshi-inspired robes with long sleeves and a talisman attached to a hat, and feathered wings that come out of your heroine\u2019s temples! Smaller pieces like painted face stripes and glasses can add that last detail your heroine has been missing.
