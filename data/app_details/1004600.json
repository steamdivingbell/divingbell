The game does not have buttons to say to click here or there, because inside the game there is a ball that is a smart computer and tells what you have to do. He speaks many things, takes good notice of what he has to say. The game has ambient sounds, some songs. 3D models are very simple in LowPoly.

Personally, it's the simplistic art style that I liked the most. It's all custom-made assets and backgrounds as far as I can tell and it's all very cohesive.
