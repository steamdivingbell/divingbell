All units move along the hex grid, each with different strengths, weaknesses, attack ranges and abilities. As the game proceeds in real time, you and your opponents will be constantly racing to see who can outsmart who first. Can you break through your opponent\u2019s defenses before they break through yours? Can you solve the complicated puzzle of each new terrain makeup before they figure out a killer strategy? Get ready to flex that analytical brain!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/765700/extras/TitleShip.png?t=1692154748\" /><br><br>While galactical warfare breaks out across the planet, your deployment ship will remain stationed in the sky above, firing new units down in drop pods and providing visibility to the tiles beneath. The fun part is that aside from your units, you can control your ship as well, moving it where necessary to deploy units exactly where you want them. But be careful - it takes time for drop pods to open up, and they\u2019re vulnerable to enemy fire. You need to protect your reinforcements!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/765700/extras/TitleCrossPlatform.png?t=1692154748\" /><br><br>Want to become the strongest in the galaxy? Jump into cross-platform multiplayer mode and crush all your friends in 1v1 or 2v2 matches! Multiplayer is the real meat of the game - and where we spent the most time during development, so this is where you can really put your skills to the test after learning the ropes in the single player campaign!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/765700/extras/TitleSinglePlayer.png?t=1692154748\" /><br><br>Before you jump into the challenging realms of multiplayer, we\u2019ve also created a unique single player campaign with multiple missions spread across different planets! Complete with wacky animated scenes just like a real Saturday morning cartoon, this mode will entertain you and teach you how to efficiently play as each different character. The AI will also pose a decent challenge, preparing you for your battles against human opponents!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/765700/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1692154748","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/765700/page.bg.jpg?t=1692154748","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/765700/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1692154748","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/765700/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1692154748","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/765700/extras/steambanner.png?t=1692154748\" /><br><br>To conquer the atrocious, brain-devouring creatures that dwell in the far reaches of outer space...you will need tactical prowess of galactical proportions!<br><br>Choose between three different commanders and battle for control of a planet in furious multiplayer battles...or follow the commanders in a wacky romp in a carefully crafted single player mode!
