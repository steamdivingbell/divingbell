{"about_the_game":"Alpaca Sprint is an adorable infinite runner featuring one of the greatest animals to ever exist. Inspired by the T-Rex Runner game in Google Chrome, you will guide your alpaca through a series of levels, but beware: many obstacles stand in the way of being able to let the wind soar through your wool!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeaturing simplistic gameplay, a beautiful NES-inspired soundtrack, and wonderful spritework, Alpaca Sprint is a nod to simpler times when the biggest achievement was beating your friends for the best score. Don't worry though: actual achievements still exist, too. Alpaca Sprint also includes local and online leaderboards (online leaderboards may only be available on mobile devices). If retro arcade style gaming is your thing, you'll feel right at home with Alpaca Sprint.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"It's Not A Race","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2316020/62a5a2fce5113ec39b7a369a7bac7fa9a8e1b9d7.jpg"},{"name":"It's A Marathon","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2316020/101428141d905b874acb841cbcb37ec87fcee49d.jpg"},{"name":"Powers Of 10 Just Feel Nice","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2316020/530153fb3e0ead5b1883838d2bb8558aac47de14.jpg"},{"name":"They're Real","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2316020/cbaa86e9a66d4074555af6b1eb7e2470371944b3.jpg"},{"name":"Alpacas Don't Howl","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2316020/9480267c5cbe7f84a4cb897ef0f83236e9031767.jpg"},{"name":"Sleepy Alpaca","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2316020/cd1a9e7b415b8f7c54d35bcd42a76ca2849332a0.jpg"},{"name":"Angry Alpaca","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2316020/b3465e591c8745e62e538466fab96190ad48ecb7.jpg"},{"name":"Retro Enthusiast","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2316020/a4d86cf067bc57b85a4d8c40be0021e460ef84e8.jpg"},{"name":"Retro Guru","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2316020/8fd9f525b5a2580f571d909b633b4ddf432632d0.jpg"},{"name":"You Get It","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2316020/cb4bf611ea541e655053114bd27298697912fa3b.jpg"}],"total":14},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2316020/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1704244798","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2316020/page.bg.jpg?t=1704244798","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2316020/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1704244798","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2316020/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1704244798","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Alpaca Sprint is an adorable infinite runner featuring one of the greatest animals to ever exist.
