{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Primaris are ready to step in the battle for the God Emperor and the Holy Throne. Eight new units and unique gameplay mechanics will give you more options for the fight for Gladius Prime.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Primaris Aggressor\u00a0</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Close-quarters anti-infantry unit equipped with flamestorm gauntlets.</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Capable of spearheading devastating offensives or shattering the most determined enemy assaults, Aggressors are walking ceramite strongpoints. They excel at close-quarters combat and laying down torrents of devastating fire before crushing their foes beneath their energised fists.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Primaris Hellblaster\u00a0</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Heavy armour-piercing ranged infantry.</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Few foes can survive the incandescent fury of a Hellblaster Squad. Whether they be Tyranid Hive Tyrant, Ork Warboss or Heretic Astartes battle tank, all are reduced to ash and slag by searing, well-aimed plasma fire pouring from the Hellblasters\u2019 ferocious weapons.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Primaris Inceptor</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Powerful short-range unit equipped with jump packs.</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Equipped with heavy jump packs, Inceptor Squads are superb spearhead troops that deliver overwhelming blows to the enemy. Plummeting to the surface from the very edge of a world\u2019s atmosphere, they strike with devastating force, unleashing a hurricane of fire that turns whole squads of enemy infantry to bloody mist.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Primaris Intercessor</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Tough versatile infantry unit</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Intercessor Squads are capable of laying down punishing fire while advancing or holding ground against the enemy. They have access to a range of bolt weaponry suited to varied battlefield assignments, from engaging enemies at long range to cleansing bunker complexes.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Primaris Invader ATV</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Light vehicle equipped with Onslaught Gatling Cannon</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Invader is a highly flexible all-terrain vehicle, perfectly adapted to an aggressive reconnaissance role. Outfitted with an onslaught gatling cannon, it can rapidly deliver punishing fire against vulnerable parts of the enemy line, or swiftly engage and destroy scouting elements of opposing forces.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Primaris Repulsor Executioner</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Heavy tank with transport capabilities and a significant payload of ranged weapons</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Based on the Repulsor chassis, the Repulsor Executioner sacrifices some transport capacity to accommodate powerful turret weaponry. Even the largest battle tanks can be crippled by the beam of a heavy laser destroyer, while the incinerating blasts of a macro plasma incinerator can obliterate infantry formations.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Redemptor Dreadnought</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Powerful walker unit with a vast array of weapons.</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Redemptor Dreadnoughts are some of the largest of their kind ever fielded by the Adeptus Astartes. Armed to the teeth, they can be equipped to utterly destroy almost any kind of battlefield target with hails of superheated plasma.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Storm Speeder Thunderstrike</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Fast assault vehicle with powerful anti-armour armament.</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Thunderstrikes outmanoeuvre the foe at every turn, targeting vulnerable points in armour, fuel stores and missile hoppers to turn tanks into raging fireballs. Just a single Thunderstrike is capable of destroying armoured breakthrough attempts, and when one is on the battlefield, few enemies are safe.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3326080/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736419384","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3326080/page.bg.jpg?t=1736419384","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3326080/99f6ad26fa707db1c09d4c83aa542543548632f7/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736419384","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3326080/99f6ad26fa707db1c09d4c83aa542543548632f7/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736419384","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Primaris are ready to step in the battle for the God Emperor and the Holy Throne.
