{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In RBM Studio's Waterloo, take command of either Napoleon's army or the allied armies of Wellington and Blucher for the battle of Waterloo, the battle that ended the Napoleonic Wars.  Each side has an historically accurate order of battle that details when and where reinforcements will arrive, letting the player attempt to outdo the generals of history.  As Napoleon, it's your task to advance and clear a path to Waterloo.  As the Allied Coalition commander, you must prevent Napoleon from opening a route while at the same time limiting your losses in the battle. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">RBM Studio's Waterloo features gameplay based on the historical wargaming boardgames of the 70's and 80's.  Players maneuver markers that represent their units on a hexagonal map that mimics the gameboard and cardboard counters of traditional boardgames.  Turns are completed in an &quot;I go, you go&quot; style, wherein players alternate their turns with their opponent until one player passes.  Once that happens, a random number of unopposed actions are given to their opponent.  Pass too early and you risk giving your opponent the opportunity to maneuver completely around your forces.  Combat is resolved through die rolls modified by terrain, supporting units, and for Napoleon, the Grand Battery.     </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The use of cavalry and infantry together gives an advantage to attacks.
