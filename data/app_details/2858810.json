The entire mission is time-bound, and failure occurs if you do not meet the deadline. Exploration and combat are optional, serving to fulfill the needs of various in-game departments, which in turn will assist you in progressing towards your main objective.</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Mobile and Combat</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2858810/extras/\u57fa\u672c\u6218\u6597\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5927.gif?t=1729257285\" /></p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When enemy units approach your team members, they will lock onto the enemy and enter combat mode, automatically selecting appropriate moves based on their status. As the commander, you'll designate paths, switch targets for your team, and promptly retreat wounded members. Most crucially, you'll activate card skills through your team members' actions.</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Rounds and Cards</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2858810/extras/\u5361\u724c\u4e0e\u56de\u5408\u4ecb\u7ecd.gif?t=1729257285\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">To use cards, you must press space to enter a turn, which triggers a card draw. Time slows down within a turn, but your view is obstructed. You can end the turn at any time before it automatically concludes by pressing space again. Hovering over a card during a turn shifts the camera to that card's associated team member, enlarges the card, and displays detailed information. Using a card puts the team member into a casting phase, depleting their focus, represented by the blue bar in the lower left. Successfully completing the casting action is required to unleash the skill. Before using a card, ensure your team member's position is secure to avoid interruptions, and note that insufficient focus prevents card use. After a turn ends, card usage is disabled until the turn cools down, allowing the next turn to commence.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Attention and Techniques</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2858810/extras/\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u62db\u5f0f.gif?t=1729257285\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Focus, aside from health, is the sole resource in combat and significantly impacts the battle's outcome. Both damage dealt and damage taken fluctuate with changes in focus. Attacking the enemy consumes focus and deals focus damage. Thus, conserving your team's focus while depleting the enemy's is crucial for victory. Dominating with numbers, or &quot;many against one,&quot; paves the way to winning. Team members select various moves during attacks, each with differing focus costs and damage output. The mightier the move, the higher both its focus consumption and inflicted damage.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Terrain and Climbing</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2858810/extras/\u5730\u5f62\u4e0e\u6500\u722c.gif?t=1729257285\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The terrain within the Starfall Valley is intricate and variable, yet you can mostly overcome it with jumps or vaults. You also possess several skills to alter the terrain, effectively separating smaller enemies. Although your team members can adjust to the terrain to ensure hits (<span class=\"bb_strike\">most of the time</span>), the terrain still poses a considerable threat to your victories.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Winning battles and obtaining cards and fields</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2858810/extras/\u6218\u6597\u80dc\u5229\u4e0e\u5361\u724c\u83b7\u53d6.gif?t=1729257285\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">After victorious combat or escape, the card slot fills based on the number of enemies defeated. Upon filling the card slot, you acquire a card, which comes with a field attribute. This field attribute attaches to the card and, when its conditions are met in battle, grants a buff to the card's owner.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Card synthesis and camping rest</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2858810/extras/\u5361\u724c\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u624e\u8425\u4f11\u606f.gif?t=1729257285\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">After accepting a mission, well-prepared camp sites appear on the map. Upon entering, you can synthesize cards; when two cards are combined, they transform into one of them randomly, with the fields of both concentrating onto the resultant card. If the two cards are part of a synthesis recipe for a specific card, a new, more powerful card can be created. When preparations are complete, you can rest at the camp interface, recovering a small amount of health and status value after consuming some time, and significantly restoring the status value cap.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Weather and its impact</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2858810/extras/\u5929\u6c14\u4e0e\u5f71\u54cd.gif?t=1729257285\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The chaotic space makes the weather in the meteorite valley very chaotic, and various weather conditions will bring different changes to exploration and combat.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p></li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2858810/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729257285","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2858810/page.bg.jpg?t=1729257285","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2858810/f5b851c3bf5cd1f0e33cc2f6dcaac876661de57c/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729257285","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2858810/f5b851c3bf5cd1f0e33cc2f6dcaac876661de57c/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729257285","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3257660,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Basic Gameplay</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Hire team members, form a squad, and then command your squad to complete various tasks on the map such as defeating enemies, gathering resources, building facilities, transporting goods, and overcoming bosses, thus progressing the story and completing the game.
