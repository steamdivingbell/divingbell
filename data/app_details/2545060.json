{"about_the_game":"In the summer of 2015, the Russian Aerospace Forces achieved significant results in the fight against terrorist groups on the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic (SAR). Our sources embedded in the ranks of terrorists say that a series of terrorist attacks are being prepared in the North Caucasian republics of the Russian Federation in order to reduce the military activity of the Russian Federation in Syria by blackmail. According to the information, the penetration of small sabotage detachments into the territory of the Russian Federation is planned from the territory of Georgia through the unrecognized Republic of South Ossetia. The authorities of South Ossetia, together with their Russian colleagues, carried out a number of measures to strengthen control over the border of the republic.
