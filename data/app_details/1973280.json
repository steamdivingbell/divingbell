{"about_the_game":"Try to survive on an island full with different resources, animals and other players. The focus of this game is to build your base and try not to get raided by other players. You will spawn on an big island. The island has different biomes where you will find different resources.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTry to gather as many resources as possible and start crafting equipment to defend your self. Gather food from the ground or start hunting animals but becareful some animals are really strong. The island has many loot places, some bigger then others. Those loot places have special containers which will give you random items. If you are lucky you will get resources for crafting C4. Keep in mind that in order to craft a C4 explosive you will need a specific item which can only be found in loot containers. This will make raiding harder and will give new players more time to get raided.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe island is very big, try to find a safe spot where you can build your base. Have some thought about security while building your base. You can use different kind of materials for your base. Wooden materials are the easiest to craft but they are also the weakest. Stone and metals are stronger but require a more resources. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nKeep in mind that you claim the area you're building your base with a plotpole / totem. it is important that your plotpole is hidden and well secured. Whoever reaches your plotpole has the option to add himself as owner, then it would be easy for the raider to dismantle your base.<br />\r\nKeep your important stuff in a strong locker/vault. Use a codelock to lock it up. There are different kinds of lockers with different kinds of strengths. Some require a couple of C4's to blow it open.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1973280/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1708713474","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1973280/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1708713474","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1973280/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1708713474","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1973280/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1708713474","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online
