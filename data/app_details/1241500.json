{"about_the_game":"Roar through the Retro 80s streets of Neon City in your sleek Red Stallion.<br>In Dirty Harry's Thunder Drive, you have two goals:<br>One, drive your car into the city's busiest highway and cause the biggest, most entertaining chain of destruction you can.<br>Two, use the rubble and spare parts you collect to rebuild and upgrade your own car.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Upgrades</h2>The more destruction you cause, the more funds you earn to upgrade your stallion. Equip your car with dynamite for explosive power to send oncoming traffic flying. Or try a huge wrecking ball welded to the chassis to sweep out any cars, palm trees, or unlucky citizens it touches.<br>With Speed and Armour upgrades available too, you can transform the beast into a reinforced speed-machine. Then, as you build up your skill you might find yourself flying and flipping through the air in a ballet of carnage.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hand-crafted Vibes</h2>Everything you see, hear and feel was hand-crafted with love for Dirty Harry\u2019s Thunder Drive, so that you can immerse yourself: sitting in your Red Stallion, driving into the sunset, head-first.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1241500/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1582014224","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1241500/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1582014224","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1241500/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1582014224","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1241500/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1582014224","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Roar through the Retro 80s streets of Neon City in your sleek Red Stallion.<br>In Dirty Harry's Thunder Drive, you have two goals:<br>One, drive your car into the city's busiest highway and cause the biggest, most entertaining chain of destruction you can.<br>Two, use the rubble and spare parts you collect to rebuild and upgrade your own car.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Upgrades</h2>The more destruction you cause, the more funds you earn to upgrade your stallion.
