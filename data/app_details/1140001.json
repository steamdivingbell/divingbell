{"about_the_game":"The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.

Whether you join a Trade League, Martial Alliance, or Hegemony, membership can be extremely advantageous. <br></li><li>Galactic Community: Unite the space empires with a galactic senate that can vote on a wide range of resolutions to drive legislative agendas. For example, players can pass a resolution to increase commitments to collective defense or funnel profit towards wealthy elites. Members can also sanction those who defy the community, and enact a single galactic focus. Sway the senate to position yourself as a leader, trading favors and maneuvering, doing whatever it takes to gain influence among schemers.<br></li><li>Origins: Each empire has a story that shapes its path. Give your civilization deeper roots with the new system of Origins. By choosing an Origin, players can flesh out their empire\u2019s background and alter its starting conditions. Whether it\u2019s Void Dwellers who have abandoned their homeworld to live in perpetual orbit, or a society that worships and protects a powerful Tree of Life, you can lay the groundwork wisely for the seeds of your empire.<br></li><li>New constructions: Construct glorious new projects for your empire like the Juggernaut, a massive mobile starbase that provides a moveable repair base even in enemy territory, or the Mega Shipyard, a new megastructure that can churn out fleets with incredible speed. Offering both tactical advantages and a good dose of shock and/or awe, these are sure to be an asset to any space empire.</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1140001/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732009479","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1140001/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1732009479","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1140001/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732009479","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1140001/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732009479","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.
