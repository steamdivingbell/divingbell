{"about_the_game":"<br><br><strong>The Owl Killer</strong><br><br><strong>The Cult</strong> is a ps1.5 style game with low poly and realistic styled textures and creepy atmosphere!<br><br>In the shadowed year of 1985, a killer has been at large leaving behind trails of clues and grisly scenes. Two years have passed, yet the enigma of Ophelia's disappearance still remains. Ophelia vanished without a trace, leaving behind an unsettling scene. Liam, her distraught husband, stumbled upon their home turned upside-down, a chilling tableau of disarray. Most disturbing were the sporadic smears of blood, a silent testament to a struggle that had taken place.  The same night, his daughter also becomes part of the long string of missing disappearances happening in the small town. As Liam digs deeper into the \u2018Owl Masked Killer\u2019 he soon finds himself falling into a rabbit hole. As the clues weigh in, the closer he gets, the more trouble he seems to find himself in. In order to find out the truth, Liam must use his wits to survive in order to make it out alive. The perpetrator is already on his trail, always one step ahead. Will Liam find his family, will he finally crack the case? With Liam's tenacious determination he will uncover harsh truths. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2439820/extras/ezgif.com-video-to-gif__2_.gif?t=1711625111\" /><br><br><strong>Features</strong>:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Ps1 Style Graphics!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Story Focused Horror Experience!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Giallo-inspired plot.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fully Voiced Acted!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Over the Top Gore!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Taxing Puzzles Be careful how you solve them...</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Collectables!
