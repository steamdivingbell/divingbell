{"about_the_game":"It's the day before Halloween, and Spooktoids have only gone and stolen all the candy buckets from around town.<br />\r\nThey have made off with them into their underground, sometimes over-ground (never wombling free) caverns and intend to hoard them for themselves, ruining Halloween in the process!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNot on Evie's watch!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvie chased the Spooktoids down and located the entrance to their lair!<br />\r\nNow she must navigate the caverns and collect all the candy buckets so the good folks of the town have candy to dish out on Halloween!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is very much an 80's inspired retro game!<br />\r\nYou must collect all the items on each screen to open the exit and progress to the next.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou must jump gaps, climb ladders, avoid nasties and not touch anything pointy!<br />\r\nShould you fall into a trap or hit a Spooktoid, you will lose a life and restart the screen!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a very difficult little game but not unfair!<br />\r\nLearn the baddie paths and practice any level you get stuck on with the handy practice mode, once you have reached that level of course!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Dev run
