{"about_the_game":"A racing simulation and arcade game based on Tunnel Boats and Hydroplanes. Explore beautiful race locations in a variety of unique watercraft, including some of the fastest and most iconic power boats in the world. Improve your skill, upgrade your equipment, expand your garage, customize your hull, and dominate the competition. <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2568360/extras/tunnelboat.png?t=1692973176\" /><br>An outboard performance craft that is one of the fastest turning vehicles on the planet. Weighing less than 450kg with the driver and engine, and capable of turning more than 180\u00b0 nearly instantaneously. In the tightest of turns the driver can experience up to 4g's. With over 400hp and revving over 10,000rpm these boats can accelerate from 0-60 in about two seconds and reach top speeds of up to 250kph. Measuring around 6 meters in length and powered by a single V6 two-stroke outboard engine using a three or four blade super-cavitating propeller.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2568360/extras/hydroplane.png?t=1692973176\" /><br>The fastest boat in sanctioned competition and raced for over 100 years. A massive hull 9 meters in length weighing around 3,000kg and powered by a turbine engine. This craft has over 3,000hp which means water shredding speeds up to 320kph. Extreme speeds combined with intermittent vision as enormous walls of water known as &quot;rooster tails&quot; are thrown behind the boat. These boats use three, four and five blade super-cavitating propellers.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2568360/extras/offshore.png?t=1692973176\" /><br>An ocean-going vessel with a Deep V design that cuts through the waves instead of hydroplaning over them. A hull 12 meters or larger and built to withstand enormous impacts, weighing a wave crushing 4,000kg, yet still capable of reaching speeds over 270kph. Featuring two drivers; one that steers the boat called a wheelman, and one that handles acceleration called a throttle-man. Their combined skill and coordination is crucial to overall performance. Powered by two V8 inboard engines, each spinning a four, five or six blade super-cavitating propeller at over 6,000rpm. <u>This boat will be made available shortly after the release of the game as free DLC.</u><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2568360/extras/coast-guard.png?t=1692973176\" /><br>Locate and save stranded vessels, remove debris from active race courses, help crashed racers, or chase criminals while playing as the Coast Guard.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2568360/extras/driving.png?t=1692973176\" /><br>Fast paced unforgiving circuit, sprint, and drag racing. Overtake opponents using strategic turning, throttling and trim. Turn nearly 180\u00b0 instantaneously, accelerate from 0-60 in under two seconds, no brakes or traction to a road, slam through buoys, and hydroplane on the razors edge.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2568360/extras/drivers.png?t=1692973176\" /><br>Race as or against real power boat drivers!
