I'm Bonnie, a hardworking baker who makes sweet pastries for the local town animals! Huh? Basement? Don't worry about that! Why not try one of my six pastries instead? I work hard to bake everything fresh daily!</i><br><br>In this cute, story-driven cooking game, play as Bonnie as she bakes up sweet treats for the local townsfolk! There are several game modes to explore and enjoy as you hop into the world of Bonnie's Bakery:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Story Mode - In this mode, you play through the main story of Bonnie's Bakery, serving customers and baking dishes in the first half, and <span class=\"bb_strike\">escaping the basement to freedom</span>. The baking portion is a mix between visual novel and point-and-click cooking sim, while the basement is- No wait, there's nothing to worry about in the basement! Ha ha ha~<br></li><li> Night Mode - <span class=\"bb_strike\">Free yourself. Carefully sneak through the basement and collect all of the clues you need to get the keycode and escape. Navigate the basement in first person and watch out for her-</span><br></li><li> Investigation Mode - Explore the cute, cartoon town filled with adorable animals, and follow the certain little nuisances that keep getting in your way in a first person perspective!

It feels like there are constantly customers to serve! In this mode, keep baking for an endless wave of customers, similarly to the first half of story mode! But watch out! You only have three lives, so if you fail too many customers, that's game over!<br></li><li> The Ethereal Lady Book - Oh my! Someone didn't put this book away! Maybe you should give it a read? Play as the Ethereal Lady as you go through her story chapter by chapter! Protect your children from the horrible beasts that are running rampant with a real-time, turn-based combat system!<br></li><li> Endless Bonking Mode - Bonk every ingredient with reckless abandon! See how high your score can go before the police are called! Stack upgrades and become the ultimate bonking machine as you rampage through the twisted city!</li></ul><br>You'll also find all sorts of fun things here, such as:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Six fun recipes to bake!<br></li><li> A cute town to explore!<br></li><li> Adorable animal NPCs to interact with!<br></li><li> <span class=\"bb_strike\">A basement.</span><br></li><li> <span class=\"bb_strike\">Four targets to hunt! </span><br></li><li> <span class=\"bb_strike\">Secrets scattered throughout the town!</span><br></li><li> Multiple Endings!<br></li><li> An endless baking mode!<br></li><li> An endless bonking mode!<br></li><li> A mysterious book!</li></ul><br>The bakery's been getting really popular recently, so you should be quick to make sure you can get a seat!
