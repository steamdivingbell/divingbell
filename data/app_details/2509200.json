Players can design and build their bases from scratch, choosing the layout, structures, and aesthetics that suit their playstyle. <br>Resource Management: Building and maintaining a base requires effective resource management. Players must gather and manage resources such as raw materials, energy sources, and workforce to construct and upgrade their bases. Proper allocation of resources is essential for the growth and sustainability of the base, ensuring its survival in the game world. <br>Defensive Structures and Strategies: Bases in Era One must be fortified against external threats. Players can construct defensive structures such as turrets, and traps to protect their bases from enemy attacks. Choosing the right defensive strategy, positioning defenses strategically, and upgrading them over time are crucial aspects of base building in the game. <br>Research and Technological Advancement: As players progress in Era One, they can unlock and research new technologies to enhance their base-building capabilities.

This level of customization allows players to create unique and visually distinct ships that reflect their individual style.<br>Modular Ship Components: Ships in Era One are built using modular components, offering players the flexibility to tailor their ships for specific roles and functions. Players can select and install various modules, such as propulsion systems, weapon systems, cargo holds, and utility modules, based on their playstyle and objectives. The modular nature of ship components enables players to experiment with different configurations and optimize their ships for exploration, combat, trading, or other specialized tasks.<br>Upgradeable Ship Systems: As players progress in the game, they can acquire new technologies and upgrade ship systems to enhance their performance.
