One, it focuses on a single weapon, the Colt 1911 A1, and takes it very seriously, using &quot;high detail gun mechanics&quot;, which means you can &quot;manipulate each part of the gun independently&quot; (the beginning of the video shows this in action). The second is that it's a randomly-generated shooter that features permanent death. Taking place inside a single building, every time you die, you have to start at the very beginning again, but the entire game world is re-rolled. It's available now for $5, which given the ideas on show, is totally worth it just to check it out.&quot;<br>\u2013 Kotaku<br><br>&quot;Receiver didn\u2019t cast me as some nigh-invincible mass of regenerating muscle.
