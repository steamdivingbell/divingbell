{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dungeons of Havoc is an action fantasy game with intense physics-driven combat and deep melee fighting mechanics.

Blocking drains stamina, while parrying increases it.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">NPCs make combat decisions based on their intelligence, weight, and preferences. Their movement uses modern pathfinding, similar to 3D games, with no patterns that players need to memorize.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each playthrough uses a random seed to alter all monsters' stats.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A simple, retro 2D pixel art world with multiple biomes, featuring rich ambient sounds and original orchestral music.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The world follows a mostly linear path, eliminating the need for a map and ensuring it's always clear where to go next.
