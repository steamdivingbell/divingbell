That's why we've introduced an advanced wiring system that allows you to connect your machines and equipment to your bunker's power generator.<br><br>This system adds a new strategic dimension to the game. You'll need to carefully plan the layout of your cables to maximize the efficiency of your electrical network. Each machine or system you wish to power will require a direct connection to the generator, forcing you to make crucial decisions: which equipment is a priority in case of an energy shortage? How can you optimize the layout of your bunker to minimize cable length and thus energy loss?<br><br>The wiring system is intuitive but offers a wide range of possibilities for players who enjoy diving into technical details. It will allow you not only to keep your bunker operational but also to optimize your resources for long-term survival.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>OPEN WORLD</strong></h2>In Survival Bunker, players are thrust into an expansive open world that's as beautiful as it is dangerous. The setting is a post-apocalyptic landscape where nature has reclaimed its territory, resulting in vast forests, abandoned cities, and desolate villages. The open-world design allows for a high degree of freedom, letting players choose their own path and strategy for survival.<br><br>The world is dynamic and ever-changing, influenced by a variety of survival mechanics such as health, thirst, hunger, stamina, and disease. Resources are scarce, and players must scavenge, craft, and build to stay alive. The environment itself poses a range of challenges, from harsh weather conditions to dangerous wildlife and hostile human groups.<br><br>Exploration is rewarded with valuable resources, hidden secrets, and clues about the world's tragic past. Whether you're searching for food, crafting items, or building your underground bunker, the open world of Survival Bunker offers endless possibilities and challenges for players to discover and overcome.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1737740/extras/OPEN_WORLD.gif?t=1696976950\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>VEHICLES</strong></h2>\u200b<br>In Survival Bunker, cars are not just a luxury; they're a vital component of your survival strategy. These vehicles serve multiple purposes, from transporting resources back to your bunker to allowing for efficient exploration of distant locations.<br><br>As you progress in the game, you'll have the opportunity to upgrade your cars, enhancing their speed, storage capacity, and durability. But it's not all smooth driving; cars also require regular maintenance and fuel, adding an extra layer of complexity to your survival planning.<br><br>In this unforgiving post-apocalyptic world, a reliable car can be the difference between life and death. Choose your vehicle wisely, as it will play a crucial role in your quest for survival.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1737740/extras/VEHICLES\u200b.gif?t=1696976950\" /><br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DRONE</h2></strong><br>In Survival Bunker, the drone is more than just a high-tech toy; it's an essential tool for your survival. Equipped with various features, the drone is primarily used for exploration and surveillance.<br><br>The drone allows you to fly over potentially dangerous or inaccessible areas, providing you with valuable insights into your surroundings. It can also be fitted with sensors to detect threats, aiding you in planning your next moves.<br><br>However, the drone has its limitations. Operating on battery power and having a limited range, you'll need to use it wisely to maximize its effectiveness. Additionally, in a world where resources are scarce, maintaining and upgrading your drone will require specific materials and skills.<br><br>In summary, the drone is a valuable addition to your survival arsenal, offering reconnaissance and strategic planning options you wouldn't have otherwise.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1737740/extras/Drone.gif?t=1696976950\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>DOG</strong></h2>In Survival Bunker, a dog is not just a loyal companion; it's also a valuable ally for your survival. Equipped with keen senses, the dog can assist you in various ways, including detecting dangers and aiding in resource discovery.<br><br>The dog can track scents, bark to alert you of nearby threats, and even assist in hunting. Its presence can also have a positive impact on morale, which is crucial in such a challenging environment.<br><br>However, having a dog also comes with responsibilities. You'll need to feed it, take care of its health, and ensure its well-being, adding another layer of complexity to your survival strategy.<br><br>In summary, the dog is a multifunctional addition to your survival experience, offering both emotional support and practical benefits.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1737740/extras/DOG.gif?t=1696976950\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>ENEMIES</strong></h2>In Survival Bunker, danger comes in many forms. You're not alone in this post-apocalyptic world, and not all the creatures you encounter will be friendly. Enemies in the game range from zombies to dangerous animals, as well as other hostile human groups.<br><br>Zombies pose a constant threat, aimlessly wandering and attacking anything that moves. Dangerous animals, although less predictable, can be just as deadly if you encounter them under unfavorable circumstances.<br><br>Perhaps the most dangerous of all are other human groups. Some may be hostile right from the start, looking to loot your resources or eliminate a potential threat. Others might be more subtle, feigning friendship before betraying your trust.<br><br>Each decision you make in your interactions with these enemies will have consequences. Therefore, you'll need to be cautious, strategic, and always prepared to face the unknown.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1737740/extras/ENEMIES_.gif?t=1696976950\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>CHARACTER PROGRESSION</strong></h2>In Survival Bunker, character progression is less about traditional leveling up and more about honing specific skills and talents. Similar to games like Fallout, you have the freedom to customize your character based on your playstyle.<br><br><strong>Skills and Talents</strong><br><br>Instead of leveling up, players will earn skill points by accomplishing certain tasks, exploring, or successfully completing missions. These points can then be invested in a variety of skills and talents, ranging from combat to resource management and diplomacy.<br><br><strong>Crafting and Equipment</strong><br><br>Progression isn't just about skills and talents. The game features a robust crafting system that allows you to create items and equipment to enhance your stats and abilities.<br><br><strong>Quests and Missions</strong><br><br>Quests and missions are another avenue for progression. By completing them, you can earn unique rewards, additional skill points, and even unlock new skills or talents.<br><br><strong>Impact on the World</strong><br><br>The way you choose to develop your character will have an impact on the world around you. For example, investing in diplomacy skills could open up new dialogue options, while focusing on combat could make certain battles easier.<br><br><strong>Flexibility and Customization</strong><br><br>The absence of a traditional leveling system offers great flexibility, allowing you to create a truly unique character. Whether you're a fighter, a diplomat, or a craftsman, Survival Bunker gives you the tools to play the way you want.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>SOCIAL INTERACTION</strong></h2>In Survival Bunker, social interactions play a crucial role in your gaming experience. You're not alone in this post-apocalyptic world; you'll encounter other survivors, be they friends or foes.<br><br><strong>Dialogue and Negotiation</strong><br><br>The game features an interactive dialogue system that allows you to negotiate, trade, or even form alliances. Your skills in diplomacy can influence the outcome of these interactions, opening up new paths and opportunities.<br><br><strong>Community Management</strong><br><br>As a bunker manager, you also have the responsibility of taking care of your community. This includes resolving internal conflicts, allocating resources, and making decisions that will affect the morale and health of your inhabitants.<br><br><strong>Reputation and Consequences</strong><br><br>Your actions and decisions will have an impact on your reputation among different groups and individuals you encounter. A bad reputation could make interactions more challenging, while a good reputation could open doors for you.<br><br><strong>Random Social Events</strong><br><br>The game also includes random social events that can occur at any time. These events can be as simple as a dispute between two inhabitants or as complex as an invasion of your bunker.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>HEALTH AND WELL-BEING</strong></h2>In Survival Bunker, managing the health and well-being of your character and community is essential for long-term survival.<br><br><strong>Physiological Needs</strong><br><br>The game incorporates mechanisms for hunger, thirst, and fatigue. Failing to meet these needs can have severe consequences, ranging from decreased performance to death.<br><br><strong>Illnesses and Injuries</strong><br><br>Risks of illness and injury are ever-present. You'll need to manage medical resources, craft remedies, and treat injuries to maintain the health of your community.<br><br><strong>Mental Health</strong><br><br>Stress and morale also play a role. Traumatic events or poor morale can affect the mental health of your character and community, which can have consequences on their effectiveness and well-being.<br><br><strong>Exercise and Training</strong><br><br>Physical exercise is not just good for health; it can also improve your character's skills. Regular training can increase your stamina, strength, and other physical attributes.<br><br><strong>Diet and Nutrition</strong><br><br>The quality and quantity of food you provide to your community can also impact their health. A balanced diet can increase resistance to illnesses and improve performance.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>What Happens When Your Character Dies?</strong></h2><br>In Survival Bunker, the death of your character is not the end of the game, but it does have serious consequences.<br><br><strong>Role Transition</strong><br><br>If your character dies, the role of the bunker manager is passed on to a member of your community, be it your spouse or your child. You continue to play as this new character.<br><br><strong>Skill Loss</strong><br><br>The new character will not have the same skills or attributes as your previous character, which may make managing the bunker more challenging.<br><br><strong>Community Impact</strong><br><br>The death of a leader can have a negative impact on the community's morale. You will need to work to regain their trust and maintain group cohesion.<br><br><strong>Items and Resources</strong><br><br>The items and resources that your previous character had will be passed on to the new character, but some special items might be lost.<br><br><strong>New Opportunities</strong><br><br>The death of your character can also open up new narrative opportunities or challenges, adding an extra layer of complexity and engagement to the game.<br><br>To sign up and stay updated on all things related to Survival Bunker, head over to our official website: .
