{"about_the_game":"It is a space simulation adventure game that combines spacecraft control and planet exploration. <br />\r\nIn the game, players use the W/S keyboard to move the spaceship forward and backward, A/D control the left and right directions, and flexibly use the Q/E keys to instantly roll the spaceship to avoid obstacles or accurately locate. When the mouse moves, it controls the flight trajectory in the air. When the aiming star is aimed at the mysterious planet, the left mouse button can lock the target planet with one click.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce the planet is successfully locked and approached, press the spacebar to activate the login mode and switch to the detailed planet observation interface. In this stage, players will delve deeper into the unique surface of each planet, discover unknown creatures, collect rare resources, and enjoy an immersive journey of cosmic wonders. Driving a spaceship through the Milky Way, each planet is a new exploration stage, waiting for players to reveal the hidden secrets.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3043010/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1719889341","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3043010/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1719889341","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3043010/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1719889341","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3043010/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1719889341","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"It is a space simulation adventure game that combines spacecraft control and planet exploration. <br />\r\nIn the game, players use the W/S keyboard to move the spaceship forward and backward, A/D control the left and right directions, and flexibly use the Q/E keys to instantly roll the spaceship to avoid obstacles or accurately locate.
