{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><u>The Hundredth Hike</u></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Hundredth Hike is an Indie Psychological Horror game, living the story of you, as a mountain hiker, reliving your tragic past and finding the calm of the nature under your boots. Unaware of what lies before you, you unleash a powerful and mysterious truth.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><u>Rich Story</u></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Hundredth Hike is a story rich in lore, that is set in the middle of a devastating apocalypse. Napazarim has taken over the minds of 90% of the population causing hallucinations in the infected people in which became an international pandemic. You are one of the lucky few who survived and after losing your family, over the years you went on hikes all over the world to escape real life. This is YOUR Hundredth Hike how will it be different?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><u>Losing your Mind</u></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Along your Hundredth Hike you question your reality on this enormous hike along a mountain that has been restricted for over a decade. Sneaking into a quarantined country, you delve deep into your own mind and lose touch of reality. Will you bring yourself back from the fold?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><u>Mechanics</u></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Run, Hide and solve deep puzzles to escape your faith. With inventory management for your light sources and many interactive objects you will always feel on edge. With barely any HUD\u00a0and following the protagonists story you will always be immersed in The Hundredth Hike. There are many mechanics of the game I don't want to give away as more and more mechanics are introduced over the course of the game.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><u>Graphics</u></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With the power of UE5, I have been able as a solo developer to get realistic and eye watering graphics with each chapter giving a different feel. From the amazing weather effects to the fully manually placed assets across all of the chapters, you will get an experience which is hard to forget.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><u>Whats in the Demo?</u></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The demo consists of 2 Demos. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">First is the story demo which puts at the start of your journey. You will be able to play the first few levels of the main game. (Recommended to play first)</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> Second is the forest demo which puts you into the forest level with already collected light sources and you must Run, Hide and place the candles in the pentagram all while avoiding something that does not want you there.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3286890/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733715194","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3286890/page.bg.jpg?t=1733715194","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3286890/41e2231ef243bd34264d8a9b05095bc26765fd5e/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733715194","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3286890/41e2231ef243bd34264d8a9b05095bc26765fd5e/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733715194","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"There is some nudity on a select few of the monsters."},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><u>The Hundredth Hike</u></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Hundredth Hike is an Indie Psychological Horror game, living the story of you, as a mountain hiker, reliving your tragic past and finding the calm of the nature under your boots.
