{"about_the_game":"There is something sinister brewing in Tana. The evil Chud have executed a diabolical plan that threatens the whole S\u00e1mi culture, and it is up to you to stop them. Embark in a journey through Tana, solve problems, experience culture, and encounter mythical creatures. <br />\r\n   <br />\r\nS\u00e1mi Fables - Vuoster\u00e1vdnj\u00e1i brings Tana to life using 3D modeling and realistic and mythical game environments. The focus of the game is to experience S\u00e1mi language and culture. The use of the S\u00e1mi language has been decreasing, so Vuoster\u00e1vdnj\u00e1i was developed in hope of developing new ways to experience and learn the language. The main language of the game is Northern S\u00e1mi.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe ultimate purpose of the S\u00e1mi Fables -Vuoster\u00e1vdnj\u00e1i is to strengthen the S\u00e1mi language and heritage of Tana, which is an important region in terms of the preservation of the entire Northern S\u00e1mi language. The S\u00e1mi people, spread over the borders of the current state of Finland and Norway, have a strong common history, which provides a natural basis for cooperation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game environment was created by 3D modeling Tana using reference photos, drone photography, laser data of the terrain area and photogrammetry. 3D objects included different landscapes, village sites, natural environments, varying buildings, and population centers located in Tana. The game environment was developed using the Unreal Engine game and it created for PC platform. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story for the game and other content was designed and produced in cooperation with the project staff from both the Finnish and Norwegian sides by implementing content production-related pilots, workshops, language camps.
