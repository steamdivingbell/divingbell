{"about_the_game":"<strong>Lawless Lands</strong><br><br>The Supporter Pack DLC is for people who'd like to show their continued support for us at Corrosive Studios and to help us continue to grow and do what we do while also giving you an edge in the game by rewarding your character with some unique tools to aid them in their travels. These items are exclusive to owners of The Supporter Pack DLC and cannot be obtained otherwise.<br><br><strong>Exclusives:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Corroded Sword - No one seems to know much about this sword, but one thing is for certain; anything that touches its blade begins to rapidly decay.<br></li><li>Strange Shield - It may not be much to look at, but it will never leave you empty-handed. It is completely unbreakable and it will last longer than any who bear it.<br></li><li>Ring of Tranquility - A magic ring that can both cure and calm a targeted ally, but it cannot be used in combat and it leaves the target in a tranquil state.<br></li><li>Pitcher of Plenty - An enchanted pitcher of water that slowly refills over time. Larger than a typical waterskin, this pitcher will quench even the worst of thirst and refresh your company so they're ready for whatever adventure you choose to embark on!<br></li><li>Lucky Lord Coin - Ever find yourself in a situation where you don't know which choice to make or which way to go? Worry no more! The Lucky Lord Coin can be used to help you out! Give the coin a flip and it'll help you make your decision! Some rumors even say it lands on &quot;heads&quot; a little more often than &quot;tails&quot; and can even improve one's luck.<br></li><li>&quot;Believer&quot; - Exclusive title for your character that can be accessed through the character record book in the inventory.</li></ul><br><strong>Extras: </strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>1x Tome - A textbook written by a scholar of great knowledge.
