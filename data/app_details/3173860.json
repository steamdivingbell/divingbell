On this trip you will not be limited only to the familiar landscapes of your homeworld - go beyond the threshold of our planet, into the unchartered Dimensions of the Void, find the precious Quasar and successfully leave the Cluster. Be aware your next visits can be different - a random selection of alternative pre-designed game world elements will diversify your adventure in the most unexpected places (randomization works at the first loading of each play session).<br><br>DEMO VERSION has limitations of the game world, its content and the duration of the game. It also does not contain a randomization function for the game world - only one pre-designed version of the game world is available in the demo. You will be able to explore about half of the Cluster's territory, as well as part of another dimension.
