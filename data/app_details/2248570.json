When you find a bee, click it and it will disappear. You can also use WASD to move and the arrow keys to zoom.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Difficulty:</h2>A full range of difficulty is included, but all levels start unlocked*, your progress is saved as you play, and you can use hints if you get stuck.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get immersed:</h2>Each painting has its own music and ambiance to help you connect with the world, as you search for all the bees.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Replayable</h2>You can restore a small number of bees back into a painting so you can find them again! It\u2019s much harder when there are only a few bees left (especially randomly). You can also use up to 3 save slots so you can replay without progress loss. Alternatively, you can reset your progress for the entire game if you\u2019d like to start over.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Perfect","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2248570/10c3d1c007ef54db811ce47b2c2eb4edb0601031.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Elf Town","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2248570/619601b1a5cb737d6cc1df508ef84297563182b6.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Horse and Sled","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2248570/aecc776a2962fa345149a3e6db6a593ea65b8e4b.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Mountain Chalets","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2248570/3b870c7b94795946ac426014fcf5cd17a0063a11.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Deer Fireplace","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2248570/902f55e272265aa4ac93a08fa684c8218d038f80.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the City Flats","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2248570/1c7e57d810099abfd279feb0a0808b8e53f682a2.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the House by the Mill","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2248570/67657ec37a933cc2a511b369de41e3ba3d306edf.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Forest Trucks","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2248570/2ba3b89ea8547e68cf4b5e4b8e6cef00cd72b972.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Stream Snowman","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2248570/9f5230e59e89b225d4c93f54ab5a773668bf1769.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Top Down City","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2248570/8b1d9dd00689f8650b46538afdc1ef095c98ac5e.jpg"}],"total":16},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2248570/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714855265","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2248570/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1714855265","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2248570/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714855265","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2248570/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714855265","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>You may also like</h1><p><br><br></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>A hidden object game where you must find all the bees to complete each level. <br><br>Contains all the extra artwork from the Advent version.
