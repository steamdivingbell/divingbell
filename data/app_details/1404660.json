Through unique, self-developed systems, Psych offers a new and innovative gaming experience that will not be forgotten. The world invites you to explore, if you dare. Every corner is filled with stories, puzzles or secrets to uncover. However, the biggest mystery is what happened on the day of the accident. While the main story has a few ways to unravel the mysteries, the side stories also provide plenty of clues and information. Psych is divided into 5 chapters that advance the story immersively, without the player noticing. The customized and countless sound effects will give you goosebumps after goosebumps. With Psych we want to create real horror, a game that will shake up the horror genre.
