There are <strong>over 30</strong> types of enemy ships that you will encounter as you travel, with a varying degree of difficulty. In battle, once you drop their defense screens you can damage blocks individually. If you destroy a component that causes a large portion of the enemy ship to be detached from it's cockpit, those orphaned blocks will be destroyed as well. You can also evade torpedo strikes, and make yourself less vulnerable to attack by using your engines.
