{"about_the_game":"BATTLEDROID is a multiplayer battle simulation game in the auto-battle genre, with elements of tower defense...<br><br>That's a really dull way of saying it's a game about BLOWING STUFF UP in epic battles, and crushing your enemies with loads of DROIDS and big GUNS.

We're giving players signing up to the Next Fest demo a larger selection of units to get a feel for the game as it is now. All of the DLC and in-app purchase stuff is disabled (the game is free-to-play normally, and we hope to be able to make a bit of cash selling DLC for it!)<br><br>The purpose of the Next Fest demo is to tell you about our Kickstarter, which is our shameless hustle to try and muster enough cash to get the game polished up and ready to release into Early Access on Steam this summer! WIthout a successful Kickstarter, BATTLEDROID might just vanish into a sea of games all launched on the same day, and a fourteen year development will be instantly and tragically forgotten... like tears in the rain etc etc.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3035410/extras/battledroid_06.gif?t=1718548186\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BUILD YOUR DEFENCES</h2><br>Pick your terrain and start crafting the most cunning base ever, an impregnable fortress bristling with turrets, scanners and ammunition dumps.
