{"about_the_game":"Pep up operations on the South Coast of England with the classic BR Class 313/2, adorned in the distinctive Southern Coastway livery and ready to serve Brighton, Seaford and beyond in Train Sim World 2: East Coastway.<br><br>A total of 64 Class 313 EMUs were delivered between 1976 and 1977 and were based at Hornsey TMD for the East Coast Main Line and Willesden TMD for the North London and Watford DC Lines. With a step-change in capacity and performance and sporting dual-voltage capability, the Class 313s revolutionised rail travel in the Capital, and sister units would also go onto serve East London, Merseyside and Strathclyde commuter networks.<br><br>The 313s continued their North London service until 2010, by which point London Overground had replaced them with all new Class 378 Captialstars. Instead of facing scrap though, an opportunity was taken to refurbish 19 members of the fleet and send them to Southern, offering a much-needed capacity boost. The pantograph was removed, the interior refreshed and the cab modernised, with the change also came a change in subclass from 313/1 to 313/2. <br><br>The units arrived on the Southern Coastway routes in May 2010, where they have remained ever since, working Lewes shuttles, services to Seaford, and in the peak can reach as far as Eastbourne. With the withdrawal of their Great Northern counterparts, and the retirement of the Class 483 on the Isle of Wight, the Southern Class 313s are now the oldest EMUs in service in the country.
