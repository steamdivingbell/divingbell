{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Legendary Villians Evil Clerics</h2><strong> Let the Blasphemous Rite Begin!</strong><br><strong> <i>Legendary Villains: Evil Clerics</i> </strong> delves deeply into the lore and legendarium of the most devoted servants of the dark powers: evil clerics. Though not always a GM's go-to villain, these malevolent mendicants and blasphemous bishops are plentiful in fantasy games. Myriad options in the form of archetypes and domains already exist, but this book goes further in exploring the roles evil clerics can play as villains in a campaign. This book includes dozens of new feats, spells, and archetypes specially designed for evil clerics, as well as the disease domain and <strong> sinweaver</strong> prestige class, providing a wealth of options for augmenting existing cleric class features. In addition, it provides all-new options like the <strong> avatar of evil</strong> family of feats that bring an evil cleric one step closer to dreadful divinity, variant channeling feats to enrich an evil cleric's bag of supernatural tricks, and the Craft Cursed Item feat gives mischievous clerics a new way to torment their victims. Finally, this book contains a collection of malicious magic items like the <i> altar of binding</i> and <i> phylactery of heresy</i> , some to augment the armamentarium of an evil apostle and others to bedevil those who would stand in her way, along with a pair of perilous priestly tomes replete with dark secrets, sinister spells, and other nefarious new options to make your cultists and clerics truly memorable foes.<br>Grab this testament to the power of the dark side of divinity, and as if evil clerics weren't enough you can make your most malevolent masters of evil even more marvelous with the companion books <strong> <i>Legendary Villains: Antipaladins</i> </strong> and <strong> <i>Legendary Villains: Dark Druids!</i> </strong> It's time to <strong> Make Your Villains Legendary!</strong> (Note: some of these are not yet available on Fantasy Grounds)<br> <i>Converted by:</i> \u00a0 <strong>Connor Bates</strong> <br> <br> <strong>Requires:</strong> An active subscription or a one time purchase of a Fantasy Grounds Full or Ultimate license and the included Pathfinder ruleset.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1334870/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1591124587","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1334870/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1591124587","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1334870/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1591124587","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1334870/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1591124587","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Legendary Villians Evil Clerics</h2><strong> Let the Blasphemous Rite Begin!</strong><br><strong> <i>Legendary Villains: Evil Clerics</i> </strong> delves deeply into the lore and legendarium of the most devoted servants of the dark powers: evil clerics.
