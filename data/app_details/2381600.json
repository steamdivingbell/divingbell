New episodes will contain more interactive features and present a new set of challenges. The episodes will be released as a patch/update and will not require a new purchase.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Logistics Wins Wars</h2>You begin each Single Player level with limited supplies, and will need to allocate rolling stock and locomotives to gathering resources and building out your defensive positions. To be successful you will need to learn the best logistics plan for resources and routes in order to optimize income, all while keeping your trains and infrastructure safe from enemy raiders. There are three primary resources to gather along the rail system, and two secondary products - Steel and Supplies - to produce at your home Factory.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Defend Your Operations</h2>The Deploy-able Turrets, Mobile Outposts, and Forward Bases will need to be built up along the rail system to keep the enemy out.

For additional supporting fire you can build and deploy  Railway Artillery to fire on the enemy from far across the map.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Retro Historical Setting</h2>The setting and story is fictional, but with a historic mid-20th century Cold War era visual design.
