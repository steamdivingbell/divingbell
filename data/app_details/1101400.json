Rune Knights offers MANY ways for squads of up to 4 to work together and theorycraft.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">AN AVALANCHE OF CUSTOMIZATION</h2>10 Skill Trees, over 100 unique talents, more than <strong>200 unique skills</strong>, 10+ Super Abilities, and over 150 legendary items let you build characters and playstyles that other games can't offer with their restricted progression systems. Invest in any skill tree at any time as you level up, and quickly respec your character if you decide to try something new or take advantage of particularly lucky loot.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">YOUR GEAR SUPPLIES YOUR ABILITIES</h2>Gear isn't just about stats. Each piece of gear has an ability assigned to it, which you can use once you equip it. Experimentation and improvisation are key to survival until you can afford to put the perfect build together.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GEAR CRAFTING</h2>You're in control of every aspect of your gear. Special crafting items drop from enemies and can be purchased in Town. These items allow you to upgrade your items, change their skills, and reroll their mods (sometimes to powerful Legendary mods).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SUPER ABILITIES</h2>Investing heavily in a skill tree can reward you with special Super abilities. These abilities charge up as you kill enemies, and allow you short windows of massive power once activated. Each skill tree has its own unique Super.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LEGENDARIES</h2>Legendary items can drop at any time, and provide unique and powerful ways to play and build your character. Certain Legendaries are only dropped from the most powerful enemies in the game. There are currently more than 150 legendaries to find and experiment with. Good luck collecting them all!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">COMPANIONS</h2>Recruit AI-controlled Companions to your party which have all the same customization options that you do. Equip them with any gear you find, customize their talents and flask effects, and put together your own ideal squad.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">POWERFUL, INTERESTING ENEMIES</h2>Over <strong>60</strong> different enemies including <strong>15</strong> unique Bosses and 15 powerful Elite enemies will require you to improvise and react quickly and tactically to overcome them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TRADING</h2>Trade your items and currency with allies in game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ENDGAME</h2>Raids test your build, reflexes, and strategy against unique and difficult boss encounters. Infinite Arena pits your character against waves of increasingly difficult enemies and bosses for a chance to top the leaderboards. Invasions allow you to replay campaign maps on significantly higher difficulties and with a chance to spawn rare goblin enemies with loads of valuable loot. All of these can be done solo and with a party.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">&quot;I WAS TOLD I COULD DUAL WIELD SHIELDS?&quot;</h2>Yes.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1101400/extras/Dual_Shield_Resup_Crop.png?t=1712287124\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">&quot;CAN I PLAY AS A SUMMONER?&quot;</h2>Yes.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1101400/extras/Summons4.jpg?t=1712287124\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD</h2>Many of RK's skills, talents, weapons, and features originated as suggestions by players like you.
