{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Arcadia Issue 014 - March 2022</h2>  Welcome to ARCADIA! Inspired by old-school tabletop magazines, ARCADIA is MCDM's digital magazine for 5th edition GMs and players. We hope you like it! <br> <br><strong> The Big and the Small</strong> by Willy Abeel with art from Gustavo Pelissari. Want to play an ogre character? Of course you do. They have layers. What about a pixie? Heck yeah! This article presents new ancestries including the Large-sized coalder, ogre, one-and-a-halfling, and beefling as well as the Tiny mousquetaire, pixie, garden gnome, and impling. Plus a new creature and companion, the tarrascal! <br> <br><strong> Botanical Undead</strong> by Gwendolyn Marshall with art from Nick De Spain and Miska Fredman. You're going to need a bigger lawn mower! The Corrupted Forest was once the battleground in a war of druids against necromancers. The residual magic from the conflict blighted the land, causing plants to grow with a life of their own and the dead to rise! This article presents the forest's details and provides five new plant-themed undead, including the fungal zombie, shambling corpse mound, thorn skeleton, treant zombie, and vine ghast. <br> <br><strong> The Afterparty</strong> by Sally Tamarkin with Wray Wroulette by Mike Seeley and art from Zuzanna Wuzyk, Faizal Fikri, and Miska Fredman. The goodbye gala for the young Aurelius Wray can't be missed. Before this young aristocrat continues the family tradition of a career in the military, their grandfather is throwing one last shebang. Too bad it's cursed! But don't worry, the party never stops in this adventure for 3rd-level characters, which includes the new dice game, Wray Wroulette. <br>  &quot;","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2406670/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1684244131","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2406670/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1684244131","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2406670/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1684244131","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2406670/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1684244131","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Arcadia Issue 014 - March 2022</h2>  Welcome to ARCADIA!
