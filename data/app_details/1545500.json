{"about_the_game":"The world has been saved and the CHOSEN SISTERS are ready to kick back and relax for a bit! But their mentor, THE NULL BROTHER (that\u2019s you!), wants to go on a new adventure.

Like, wow. I didn't think ANYONE would read this! <br><br>I know, I know, you're not here to be bored with fancy language or paragraphs backstory on how the dark hordes of the Inferni Invictus infiltrated the ranks of the Holy Order of the Wingless Pegasus (isn't that just a horse, though?), you want to know more of the game! Or, rather, you want to see the cool bullet points we've prepared for your convenience. Here they are!<br><br>* 100% turn-based with no twitch-reflex gameplay.<br>* Main story takes around 10 hours with around 2-3 hours of optional content. A bunch more if you're looking to 100%. <br>* All characters in the party all the time, no need to choose between the characters whom you like the most against who'd make the most effective combination.<br>* Absolutely NO GRINDING whatsoever! Sure, there are some optional enemies, but if you just want to play the story, you'll be fine!<br>* Also, also, all the fights in the story are unique! They even feature dialogue sometimes, How. Cool. Is. That?!<br>* Not an angsty teenage protagonist boy in sight.<br>* Only one of these bullet points uses an exclamation mark so you must know we're serious!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1545500/extras/battle_spider.gif?t=1736347658\" /><br><br>You STILL want more?
