It has a heartwarming story and theme to keep you pushing through to help the little guy make his way back to his family.  The difficulty was pleasant, I never got frustrated because it always felt manageable. It made me think of new ways to solve the puzzles. The setting to enable numbers on the tiles were a god send though. In the end it was a charming 2 hours for another perfected achievement game.\u201d<br>Steam Reviewer<br><br>\u201c\ud83d\udc4d A very cute and relaxing puzzle game.
