{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Al[F\u00e9]tena is a role-playing game set in an alternative version of the city of S\u00e3o Paulo in the 1970s, in which an army called Vesorto oppresses the population and forbids them to express themselves. In this context, a group of young people, led by journalist Marcela, set out on suicide missions to end the control of Vesorto and his troops.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The basic structure of the game is divided into two parts. During the day, the focus is on the narrative, with the player able to explore some of S\u00e3o Paulo's neighborhoods in search of allies or do casual activities to obtain information, equipment and skills to use in battles. The night period is focused on battles, allowing the player to invade places of influence of the Vesortos, weakening their defenses, rescuing hostages or acquiring documents that can unlock access to new locations during the day. In these dungeons, the player can also obtain new skills and items.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3492990/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738668282","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3492990/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1738668282","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3492990/31b93ccef4ab405953dea052f915d6965e561778/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738668282","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3492990/31b93ccef4ab405953dea052f915d6965e561778/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738668282","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Al[F\u00e9]tena is a role-playing game set in an alternative version of the city of S\u00e3o Paulo in the 1970s, in which an army called Vesorto oppresses the population and forbids them to express themselves.
