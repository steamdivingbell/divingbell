{"about_the_game":"Sandbox Anything is a creative, but challenging game where you must throw around objects in a specific, or random/erratic way to finish game levels. There are other game modes including a zombie survival, where you can throw around lifeless civilian bodies fighting for their life! This game can be both be played in a calm manner, or sped run to see how efficiently you can put together working structures. The game also includes a built-in level editor, allowing content creators to create interesting levels, or to play around with physics! Multiplayer is also another large feature within Sandbox Anything, allowing friends or strangers to either work together, or battle it to see who can build, and/or destroy better!
