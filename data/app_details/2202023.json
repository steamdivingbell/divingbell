{"about_the_game":"New challenges await on the picturesque Bernina Pass with new scenarios created by SGL. <br> <br>Bernina Pass is famous among railfans and tourists for the stunning unrivalled views of the surrounding scenery. Winding its way through the mountains this route is nothing short of an engineering marvel. Opened in 1908 the peaks and valleys of the Bernina Alps required rails as high as 2,253 m (7,392 ft), and so the route was built with a staggering 7% gradient for the most part, in both directions, and had to feature hairpin curves, bridges and plenty of tunnels \u2013 all of which are still in use today and feature here for you to enjoy. <br> <br>Take on the challenge of this iconic line with five new scenarios. Featuring both standard, requiring the Bernina Pass route only, and enhanced versions to bring in additional rolling stock from other Add-Ons to populate the line. As part of these scenarios you will control a diverted Regio service from Pontresina to St Moritz, keep to time on passenger services from St Moritz to Tirano, take The Bernina Express to Bever and enjoy an Autumn regional service running out of Poschiavo. <br> <br>Climb back into the cab of the ABe 8/12 Allegra and rediscover the wonders of the world-famous Bernina Pass.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2> <br>A selection of Career scenarios are included: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li> Long Way Round <br></li><li> Long Way Round Enhanced <br></li><li> White Turf Special <br></li><li> White Turf Special Enhanced <br></li><li> Odyssey Bianco <br></li><li> Odyssey Bianco Enhanced <br></li><li> A Little Bit Moritz <br></li><li> A Little Bit Moritz Enhanced <br></li><li> Bernina Trading <br></li><li> Bernina Trading Enhanced </li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2202023/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727361657","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2202023/page.bg.jpg?t=1727361657","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2202023/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727361657","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2202023/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727361657","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"New challenges await on the picturesque Bernina Pass with new scenarios created by SGL. <br> <br>Bernina Pass is famous among railfans and tourists for the stunning unrivalled views of the surrounding scenery.
