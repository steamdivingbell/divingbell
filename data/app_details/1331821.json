{"about_the_game":"One of the first models of the Yak-9 family was Yak-9T (&quot;tank&quot;), that appeared in early 1943. In addition to one 12.7mm UBS MG it was armed with a 37mm engine-mounted cannon model 11P (later NS-37) instead of a 20mm SHVAK. The installation of such a heavy and large weapon required reinforcing the airframe in the nose section and moving the pilot cabin 40 cm (1.31 ft.) rearward, which resulted in worse forward and underside visibility.<br><br>Frontline trials were conducted from July 5th till August 26th, 1943 on Central, Bryansk and Western Soviet Fronts. The trials showed that Yak-9T is capable of not only engaging bombers and various ground targets, but it could also hold its own as a dogfighter. Its flight characteristics were only marginally worse than Yak-9 while packing a much bigger punch. Its production started in March 1943 and ended only in June 1945 with a total of 2,748 units produced.<br><br>In addition to Quick Mission Builder and Multiplayer modes, you can fly it in Career mode during <strong>Battle of Kuban</strong> timeframe.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Armament: 37mm gun &quot;NS-37&quot;, 30 rounds, 250 rounds per minute and 12.7mm machine gun &quot;UB&quot;, 200 rounds, 1000 rounds per minute.<br></li><li>Length: 8.5 m<br></li><li>Wingspan: 10 m<br></li><li>Wing surface: 17.15 m\u00b2</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Modifications</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Landing light for night flights (2 kg weight increase, minor speed loss).<br></li><li>Fixed loop radio compass RPK-10 (10 kg weight increase, minor speed loss).<br></li><li>NS-37 gun ammo counter (1 kg weight increase).<br></li><li>PBP-1A reflector gunsight (0.5 kg weight increase).<br></li><li>Rearview mirror (1 kg weight increase).</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Skins</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Standard paint scheme.<br></li><li>Black hawk picture.
