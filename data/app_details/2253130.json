{"about_the_game":"Quantum:Fantasy is a story-driven RPG with an emphasis on hunting large monsters.

Lua, the Rogue, excels in quick strikes and high damage output: as long as she doesn't get hit that is. Xen, the mage, excels in hand-to-hand combat combined with heavy hitting magic skills that can deal damage at range. Alizza, the Knight, excels in drawing aggro and blocking attacks, using her shield to stay near the enemy. Casmir, the Soldier, excels in ranged attacks, using his advanced weaponry to deal damage from afar. Each character, despite sharing the same mechanics, plays differently: the Rogue must always be on the move, weaving behind enemies with flashy moves; the Knight must always maintain aggro, perfectly countering attacks to stay alive; the Mage must always manage his mana, switching between melee and magic constantly; and the Soldier must always position carefully and manage his ammunition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCan you best the monsters in this new world and figure out the cause behind the intermingling worlds?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2253130/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1672104631","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2253130/page.bg.jpg?t=1672104631","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2253130/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1672104631","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2253130/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1672104631","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Quantum:Fantasy is a story-driven RPG with an emphasis on hunting large monsters.
