{"about_the_game":"<strong>Jet-Story 2018</strong> is 30th anniversary remake of 8-bit ZX Spectrum game. You are a pilot of a space battle capsule and your goal is to navigate underground caves and eliminate all alien bases.<br><br>Your ship has rocket engines for horizontal movements and for going up. Acceleration, intertia and gravity are dutifully simulated. There is no &quot;down&quot; control - if you need to go down, you have to let the ship fall. Activating motors requires fuel. Running out of fuel means death.<br><br>Underground caves are full of aliens and enemy machinery trying to block your progress and defend the bases. However, your spaceship has lethal firepower - plasma cannon, bombs and missiles will easily anihilate any opposition - IF you master how to use them.<br><br><strong>WARNING:</strong> This is old-school game with old-school difficulty. Do not even try unless you are ready to die a lot.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/872700/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1530603055","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/872700/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1530603055","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/872700/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1530603055","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/872700/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1530603055","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Jet-Story 2018</strong> is 30th anniversary remake of 8-bit ZX Spectrum game.
