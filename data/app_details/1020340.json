{"about_the_game":"AUDICA\u2122 is a VR Rhythm Shooter from Harmonix, the makers of Rock Band\u2122 and Dance Central\u2122. Armed with a pair of rhythm blasters, you shoot and smash targets to the beat of a soundtrack that features songs from some of the world\u2019s most popular artists. The better your timing and accuracy, the better your score. The better your score, the higher your place on AUDICA\u2019s Leaderboards.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nAUDICA is incredibly intuitive and immersive from the first time you play - use your blue and orange blasters to shoot color-coded targets to the beat while in a breathtaking cosmic arena. On expert difficulty, Audica gameplay is intense and exacting. If you want to claim a spot at the top of the leaderboards, you\u2019ll need to practice until you and your blasters become one, performing a tightly choreographed ballet of beat-blasting brilliance.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Lazer Priest - Beginner","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1020340/12fabe995e6c3a21ecd437ce8b24ba285d068547.jpg"},{"name":"Lazer Priest - Standard","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1020340/db8d95304c7a963785dba750bb2d6449bca657cd.jpg"},{"name":"Lazer Priest - Advanced","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1020340/d0a1986a76440b52e92cb48d02482fa6acc987f9.jpg"},{"name":"Lazer Priest - Expert","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1020340/be8b4d2385cff43c6bb1548ac9536d29f319bafb.jpg"},{"name":"Bodhisattva","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1020340/19d7b9a8f0be2afdbfe884403c046153e9e3b813.jpg"},{"name":"The Graduate - Beginner","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1020340/7618a78d6072601a8f73b23f3858cf9c4fd3cdcd.jpg"},{"name":"The Graduate - Standard","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1020340/ef13f4bd8005dae05945f88900512a8659eb5dea.jpg"},{"name":"The Graduate - Advanced","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1020340/72d953b4cd29d88c994ed39b2268c18a575ec3a2.jpg"},{"name":"The Graduate - Expert","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1020340/ab3c00fcb7f0a0f443517e9dbd9a30d0b82aadfc.jpg"},{"name":"Perfect Timing","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1020340/6768a3a561205754ad43cffd880e01e680f10109.jpg"}],"total":30},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1020340/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1608747792","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1020340/page.bg.jpg?t=1608747792","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1020340/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1608747792","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1020340/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1608747792","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"AUDICA\u2122 is a VR Rhythm Shooter from Harmonix, the makers of Rock Band\u2122 and Dance Central\u2122.
