{"about_the_game":"As an amalgamation of leftover memories from a dead brain and an AI implant, Anala Piers is neither human nor machine. But, is she something more or something less? Suddenly conscious in a world that does not want her and a body that does not belong to her, Anala does the only thing she can think to do: she demands answers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrometheus Unbound is a 2D stealth platformer with graceful speed and machine-precision movement. Gameplay includes fast paced parkour movement and jumps, as well as stealth mechanics like sneaking, hiding, and wall sticking. Each stage is timed, allowing players to re-attempt levels for faster times, or even to challenge the clear times the developers set! In addition to main story levels, there are five challenge levels where players can test their platforming and parkouring abilities to the limits. In addition, many levels are open to explore in multiple ways, allowing the player to find hidden collectibles and other areas.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2846110?t=1729671453","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2846110/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1729671453","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2846110/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729671453","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2846110/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729671453","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"As an amalgamation of leftover memories from a dead brain and an AI implant, Anala Piers is neither human nor machine.
