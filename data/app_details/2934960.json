{"about_the_game":"ZenRage undeniably pays homage to the 1990's classic Desktop Destroyer, but at the same time, it tries to make a fresh twist on the genre.<br><br>The game takes a screenshot of your current desktop and lets you digitally destroy it using a dozen different tools, each with its own unique flair. Embrace the chaos with a chainsaw, shatter your stress with a hammer, or rain down hilarity with a machine-gun barrage. Unleash swarms of digital ants or wield the power of a Tesla-Coil gun to electrify your screen.<br><br>Whenever you're feeling stressed, just launch the game, and unleash your rage onto your desktop. <br>Just got an annoying email? Here's a chainsaw.<br>Frustrated with a never-ending to-do list? Let loose with the drill.<br>Feeling overwhelmed by clutter? Channel your inner zen master and restore balance with the tranquil Zen Rake.<br>Need to paint over your worries? Grab the paint roller and create a masterpiece of serenity on your screen.<br>Drowning in digital chaos? Wash it all away with the soothing flow of the water hose.<br>Want to start fresh? Embrace the power of the rubber eraser and wipe the slate clean, returning your desktop to its pristine state.<br><br>ZenRage is your virtual stress ball, offering cathartic relief in the form of pixelated destruction.<br><br>Recommended dose is 5 minutes, but feel free to indulge in a longer session if needed. Remember to take breaks and step away from the screen to recharge your zen.<br><br><strong>PSA</strong>: No ants were harmed during development of this app.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2934960?t=1715798008","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2934960/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1715798008","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2934960/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1715798008","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2934960/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1715798008","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Stats","id":15}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"ZenRage undeniably pays homage to the 1990's classic Desktop Destroyer, but at the same time, it tries to make a fresh twist on the genre.<br><br>The game takes a screenshot of your current desktop and lets you digitally destroy it using a dozen different tools, each with its own unique flair.
