This means more depth and longevity \u2013 our heroes will have to choose perks to complement their deck-building strategy and carefully manage the board if they wish to triumph.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><strong>Unique roguelike gameplay</strong><br>Your hero starts out with a deck of basic cards (items &amp; abilities).  At the start of each dungeon, your hero's deck is shuffled into the dungeon deck (monsters) and dealt out in a 3x3 grid.  Defeat monsters to earn gold, then use that gold to acquire your items &amp; abilities from the dungeon.  Remove a tile from the dungeon and a new one will be dealt out from the dungeon deck.
