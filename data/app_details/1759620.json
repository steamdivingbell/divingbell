{"about_the_game":"<i>Strawhart</i> is an action-puzzler where you\u2019ll master physics-defying magic in a quest to start a cult and resurrect an ancient evil. The realm of Acre is beset by a foe so powerful that no hero living can hope to save the day. But don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ve got a plan!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Defy Physics and Common Sense</h2><br>Face off against over 80 mind-bending puzzles using an increasingly powerful array of magic. You\u2019ll leave physics behind as you learn to phase through walls, shrug off gravity, transmute your surroundings, and weaponize the common pumpkin. <br>Just never forget: your powers stem from the whims of an ancient, unhinged evil.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build a Cult</h2><br>Gather cultists from across Acre to your cause. Lead eldritch rituals and grow your power, all while hiding your followers from your mother. Bargain with an unknowable evil as you try to control the last, best hope of Acre.  Watch your homestead evolve as you meet and recruit a gallery of questionable characters.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Face Unforgiving Finales</h2>Each land you visit has its own unique finale encounter, where your wits and skills will be pushed past their limits.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Piece Together the Past to Save the Future</h2>Break free of the beaten path and use your magic to explore Acre. Search out fragments from the past and truths buried by time. Discover ultra-challenging bonus objectives tucked in the forgotten corners of the realm.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1759620/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724102952","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1759620/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1724102952","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1759620/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724102952","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1759620/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724102952","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<i>Strawhart</i> is an action-puzzler where you\u2019ll master physics-defying magic in a quest to start a cult and resurrect an ancient evil.
