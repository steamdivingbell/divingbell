Furthermore, the campaign recreates the most iconic moments of the allied involvement within the theater, including the Battle of Raqqa in 2017, the US TLAM strike against the Shayrat Airbase in retaliation for the regime\u2019s chemical attack on Aleppo and the standoff between US forces and the notorious Russian Wagner group, which is now known as the \u201cBattle of Khasham\u201d.<br><br>This campaign also introduces a new, more immersive way for the player to interact with the environment using their HOTAS, this practically completely eliminates the use of space bar or F-10 menu.<br><br>The campaign also includes features that account for the player\u2019s performance and possible errors. This means that his wingmen or other assets in the mission can take over tasks the player is struggling with, which can lead to multiple ways in which each mission can progress.
