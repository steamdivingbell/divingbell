These monsters were dubbed the Dark Gods by the forgotten prophets of days past; according to their grim vision, nothing could stop these beings from destroying the human race.</i></strong><br><br>The prophecies were all true.<br><br>Deities have awakened and destroyed the Earth.<br><br>And humanity responded with firepower.<br><br>The prophets did not realize just how much power the human race would have in the Time of Judgement. They did not understand the destructive power of plasma weapons. They could not imagine an armada of starships able to launch hundreds of thousands of missiles at once. The monsters may have almost godly powers, but the majority of them still vaporize when hit by a megaton warhead!<br><br>You are one of the people who do not fear inhuman beasts, servants of the dark deities, or other unspeakable forces. You have discovered the secrets of the corrupt, debased nobles of Bariz. You have tracked down cultists of the Dark Gods trying to take over Ash even as it freezes.
