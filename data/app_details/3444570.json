{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Once upon a time, a small town famous for its rich mining veins was abandoned due to a mysterious curse. People claimed that those who entered the mines never returned. Our hero, Aras, a brave miner, decides to descend into the mine, both to search for his lost family and to change the town's fate.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Aras's journey begins as he explores the old excavation sites, underground rivers, and ancient ruins of the mine. However, deep within the mine, an ancient and powerful entity, the Patron, has awakened. This being has created a labyrinth filled with powerful creatures and deadly traps to guard the mine's riches.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As Aras ventures deeper, he finds notes and tools left behind by the old miners. These clues reveal that to defeat the Patron, he must gather pieces of an ancient weapon. But each piece is protected by formidable enemies.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Eventually, Aras assembles the weapon and reaches the deepest level of the mine, where he must face the Patron in a final showdown. This battle will test not only his mining skills but also his strategy and courage.
