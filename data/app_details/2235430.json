{"about_the_game":"Late November 1992. A small, isolated town in eastern Poland is struck by a foul calamity that slowly begins to consume everyone and everything it touches. This is the last known whereabouts of your friend Bartek before he stopped answering your calls. Now, you need to follow in his footsteps to uncover what brought him to this town in the first place and why he possibly couldn\u2019t ever get out.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore a Possessed Town</h2>Something is very wrong in the town of Jeziorne-Kolonia. Explore an eerie, isolated 90\u2019s Polish town that has been consumed by something wretched. The streets are overrun by some kind of filthy slime. The people, the buildings, and the wildlife all seem to be slowly deteriorating from the inside. You need to find your lost friend and get out before this town sinks its claws into you too.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fight and Survive Against Unfathomable Monstrosities</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2235430/extras/enemy.gif?t=1738667442\" /><br>Scavenge for scarce supplies and weapons to fight off the twisted monstrosities now roaming the darkest corners of the town.

But they are seldom helpful to outsiders. If you want to understand them, you have to play along with their delusions and understand their inner world.

Their isolated minds slowly edging towards insanity and some of your questions are really starting to get on their shattered nerves\u2026<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Classic Visuals with Modern Tricks and Technology</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2235430/extras/2xdrendering.gif?t=1738667442\" /><br>Our custom in-house technology allows us to bring a new spin on the pixel look.
