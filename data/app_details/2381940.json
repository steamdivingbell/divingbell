{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2381940/extras/SteamStorePoster6.png?t=1689334156\" /><br><strong>NOTE: THIS IS A VR GAME (STEAMVR) &amp; REQUIRES A VR HEADSET WITH CONTROLLERS</strong><br><br>Sector One takes you on a journey through 6 different worlds, where your goal is to kill as many enemies as you can, &amp; survive as long as you can.<br>Each world offers a unique visual experience but also comes with different kinds of challenges that you need to overcome.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DESIGNED TO GIVE YOU A THRILLING EXPERIENCE</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2381940/extras/StardustGif0.gif?t=1689334156\" /><br>Our goal is to make players immerse themselves in artful worlds where their reflexes are being tested at every moment. The visual effects and audio effects are designed to give you a surreal experience that you will enjoy and love. Killing enemies and lasting longer will help you earn trophies, and the more trophies you have, the higher you are on the leaderboard of players worldwide.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LIGHT &amp; DARK WORLDS - MADE OF MATTER &amp; ANTI-MATTER</h2>Sector One has 6 Nodes(Worlds) &amp; each node has two modes(dark and light). Light modes are made of matter, Dark modes are made of anti-matter. When you fly through a Time gate(speeds up the flow of time), matter/antimatter is released, depending on whether you are in a Light mode or Dark mode. You can collect matter/antimatter to use them to manipulate time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A TALE OF TIME - MATTER/ANTIMATTER BLAST</h2>When you create a Matter/Antimatter blast within a Node, time will slow down, and anything outside the blast radius will be destroyed. This will give you the edge over the enemy by helping you to survive longer and hunt more enemies. But remember, time is like a double edged sword. Going through time gates will speed up the flow of time, and matter/antimatter will be released which is required to create matter/antimatter blasts. But when time speeds up, you will need to be extra vigilant to avoid obstacles and crashing into enemies.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ABOUT PLAYALLEY UNIVERSE</h2>The Playalley Universe consists of many many Sectors. Each Sector consists of multiple worlds(Nodes) within it. Sector One has 6 Nodes. Our vision is to create a collection of virtual worlds. each offering an unique experience, with an unique set of rules, but interconnected by some common elements. We welcome you to be a part of this journey.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2381940/extras/SteamStoreEndingPoster1.png?t=1689334156\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Node 0 150 Sec survivor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2381940/f218c970141cc73b78866bedaa7fd69380944099.jpg"},{"name":"Node 0 200 Sec survivor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2381940/7d23f95623a5fb3169d83335501de4adc55199fa.jpg"},{"name":"Node 1 150 Sec survivor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2381940/f218c970141cc73b78866bedaa7fd69380944099.jpg"},{"name":"Node 1 200 Sec survivor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2381940/7d23f95623a5fb3169d83335501de4adc55199fa.jpg"},{"name":"Node 2 150 Sec survivor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2381940/f218c970141cc73b78866bedaa7fd69380944099.jpg"},{"name":"Node 2 200 Sec survivor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2381940/7d23f95623a5fb3169d83335501de4adc55199fa.jpg"},{"name":"Node 3 150 Sec survivor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2381940/f218c970141cc73b78866bedaa7fd69380944099.jpg"},{"name":"Node 3 200 Sec survivor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2381940/7d23f95623a5fb3169d83335501de4adc55199fa.jpg"},{"name":"Node 4 150 Sec survivor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2381940/f218c970141cc73b78866bedaa7fd69380944099.jpg"},{"name":"Node 4 200 Sec survivor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2381940/7d23f95623a5fb3169d83335501de4adc55199fa.jpg"}],"total":22},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2381940/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1689334156","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2381940/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1689334156","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2381940/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1689334156","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2381940/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1689334156","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>YOU CAN NOW USE YOUR READY PLAYER ME AVATARS IN SECTOR ONE</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2381940/extras/SteamStorePoster3_1.png?t=1689334156\" /></p><br><h1>A PLAYALLEY ACCOUNT IS REQUIRED TO PLAY THIS GAME</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2381940/extras/SteamStorePoster4.png?t=1689334156\" /><br>A Playalley account is required to play this game.
