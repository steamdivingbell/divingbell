{"about_the_game":"Violet Wisteria is a nod to the late 80s and early 90s golden era of Japanese gaming. You control Wisteria Asagiri on her quest to stop the dark wizard Maskandes from conquering both the Higher Realm and Earth. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nViolet Wisteria introduces an unprecendented &quot;tri-color attack system&quot; which the player must master to progress. Wisteria can use three different sword attacks, each with their own color attribute, to defeat enemies which appear randomly as palette swaps of the same three colors. Think rock scissors paper, but with colors instead of symbols. This attack mechanic must be used to overcome obstacles and action gimmicks in each of the game's stages, as well as the intricate boss fights. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis demo contains the first two stages out of eight which will be in the final version.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2130830/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1663417960","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2130830/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1663417960","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2130830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1663417960","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2130830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1663417960","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Violet Wisteria is a nod to the late 80s and early 90s golden era of Japanese gaming.
