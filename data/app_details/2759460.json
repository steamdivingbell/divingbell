{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Messerschmitt Me 262 is one of the most unique and recognizable aircraft of WWII. As the world's first-ever jet-powered fighter aircraft, it was faster than all the prop-driven fighters it typically went up against. The E-flite\u00ae UMX\u2122 Me 262 Twin 30mm EDF is the most affordable and convenient model of the ground-breaking aircraft yet! It arrives completely factory-assembled and ready to fly right out of the box including a premium paint scheme and lightweight decals. It's equipped with similar and optimized power systems from the popular UMX A-10 that are compatible with 3S 600-850mAh batteries to meet modern-day EDF performance expectations. It's also equipped with expertly-tuned AS3X and optional-use SAFE Select technologies, plus provides real-time battery voltage and other telemetry information to compatible transmitters. And because of its ultra-micro size, the UMX Me 262 can be flown in more places and smaller spaces than most other EDF models, including at many large parks and sports fields! The fixed landing gear with a steerable nosewheel makes it easy to taxi, take off from, and land on smooth surfaces. Or, leave the landing gear off for more speed and vertical performance with easy hand launches and landings on grass while utilizing the protective reinforcements on the bottom of the nacelles. It all adds up to deliver an authentic, affordable, and convenient Me 262 flying experience you simply can't get with any other model!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This model is equipped with Horizon Hobby and Spektrum exclusive AS3X (Artificial Stabilization \u2013 3-aXis) and optional-use SAFE (Sensor Assisted Flight Envelope) Select technologies, and when SAFE Select is turned on using the mode switch (B on the Spektrum InterLink DX controller) it offers:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Pitch and Bank Angle Limits</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">These envelope limits keep the airplane from rolling or pitching upside down.\u00a0 They also prevent excessive climb or dive angles.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Automatic Self-Leveling</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The airplane instantly returns to and holds level flight when the sticks are released and in the center position.\u00a0 It\u2019s also helpful for keeping the wings level during takeoffs and landings.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759460/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734547724","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759460/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1734547724","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759460/6bebee5a56c819c2c0a64b228f5f768393ea214f/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734547724","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759460/6bebee5a56c819c2c0a64b228f5f768393ea214f/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734547724","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Messerschmitt Me 262 is one of the most unique and recognizable aircraft of WWII.
