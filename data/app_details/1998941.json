{"about_the_game":"Journey through the American West\u2019s awe-inspiring, rugged, and remote desert scenery while tackling heavy tonnage and daunting grades with the Union Pacific Cane Creek Subdivision route for Train Sim World 2!<br><br>Masterfully developed for Train Sim World 2 by Skyhook Games, this new route re-creates Union Pacific\u2019s famed Cane Creek Subdivision, also known as the Cane Creek Branch. Widely renowned for its extraordinary western desert scenery, the Cane Creek Subdivision extends from a connection with Union Pacific\u2019s Green River Subdivision at Brendel, Utah south to Potash, Utah, 35.8 route miles. As created for Train Sim World 2, the route also includes a five-mile section of the Green River Subdivision east from Brendel to Thompson, Utah.<br><br>The Cane Creek Subdivision offers heavy-haul, tough American railroading at its best. From Potash to Brendel, the line climbs nearly a thousand feet in elevation over a \u201croller coaster\u201d profile featuring frequent gradients of 1.2 percent, curves of up to 6 degrees, and a journey through 7,059-foot-long Bootlegger Tunnel. The Cane Creek Branch is a rail line that requires big diesels and lots of horsepower, and you\u2019ll take the throttle of the Union Pacific\u2019s General Electric AC4400CW and Electro-Motive SD40-2 diesels as are included with the route.<br><br>By American railroad standards, the Cane Creek Branch is a newcomer, opened in 1962 by Union Pacific predecessor D&amp;RGW to serve a sprawling potash mine facility at Potash. You\u2019ll handle potash line-haul and switching duties, and you\u2019ll also climb aboard Union Pacific\u2019s big six-axle diesels to handle the railroad\u2019s noted \u201cdirty dirt trains\u201d which lug contaminated mine tailings from Moab to Brendel.<br><br>Choose how you want to play: Operate trains, ride around as a conductor, complete the route tasks, or simply pick a vantage point and watch the action unfold. Create your own experiences with the Scenario Planner and Livery Designer. Whatever you choose to do, there's lots to see and experience in Train Sim World 2: Cane Creek Subdivision!<br><br><strong>Please note: Train Sim World\u00ae 3 is required, as a separate purchase, in order to utilise this content.
