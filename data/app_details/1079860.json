[...] It fits into the same genre as Monument Valley, but runs off in its own directions and doesn't care who knows about it. While puzzle games can sometimes feel flat, Where Shadows Slumber shows that they can be a force to be reckoned with when they're handled well.\u201d<br>4.5/5 \u2013 PocketGamer<br><br>\u201cThis is a maze-based puzzle game, with intuitive controls and a satisfying gameplay loop.
