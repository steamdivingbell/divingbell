{"about_the_game":"Step into the shoes of Emperor Apollo Tiberius, last of his name, in this fictional Cold War era text RPG. As emperor you must allocate the government budget, set ministerial policies, enact royal decrees, make deals with friends and foes alike, and respond to critical events that can change the course of history. Powerful factions grow within the Empire, and amidst these uncertain times, divine right is no longer enough to stay in power. You must gain allies at court, or risk sharing the fate of your father, and his father before him.<br><br>Peace in the Ostaldian Empire hangs by a thread. Border incursions by Yudova and Arconte continue inside disputed territories. Rival superpowers Renavian Republic and Krassnian Union grow more aggressive in their attempts to pull your Empire under their influence. The failed rapid industrialization effort under your predecessor leaves the Ostaldian economy in a recession. Wealth inequality is at an all time high, and unrest among the lower classes rises to heights not seen since the Great Civil War. The people demand change, but with so many different voices you cannot satisfy them all.<br><br>Despite the mountain of problems you must face, the Empire has a long and proud history of resilience, and the people have placed their trust in you to lead them back from the brink. But the goodwill of your citizens will not last forever as conspiracies brew in the shadows, waiting for you to show weakness.
