Thanks so much for checking out my game. I think its important to be transparent with the community, so just know that I am plan on adding more content over time with free updates and no microtransactions. This game is currently just a fun little atmospheric walking simulator where you need to find multiple items to escape, hence the cheap price. There is no progression or saving. I am open to adding stuff like this is in the future if the fanbase becomes large enough. Thank you for reading!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2413230/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1685649085","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2413230/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1685649085","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2413230/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1685649085","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2413230/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1685649085","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Contains instances of fear and violence."},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2413230/extras/Screenshot__59_.png?t=1685649085\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Survival Horror?</h2>Choose your map and try to escape.
