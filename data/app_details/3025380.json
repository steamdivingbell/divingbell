{"about_the_game":"<strong>An RPG with an Endless Story!</strong><br><br>Beyond The Tales is a classic turn-based RPG with a twist! It's about 4 characters that are looking for the meaning of their existence in a very strange world but if they do the world will end.<br><br>After the main story is finished, the game will open new paths to a forever expanding world of custom fan made maps, characters and quests, all bonded together by nothing more than the will of the players to give these 4 characters more adventures to experience. Each new map will have its own original music made by the team.<br><br><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong><br><br>Classic turn-based battle with only 2 commands: skills and items. This battle has a unique factor, since all the skills use energy and you have only one skill that doesn\u00b4t requiere energy but can help you to fill the bar. Each character has a set of very unique skills that combine with the other characters. For example, Aham has Stocade which is a skill that hits very strong but drains all the energy bar at the beginning of the game. Then you have Transfusion, which will take 1/4 of your health for filling your energy bar and also you have healing stab which hits for very low energy cost and recovers 1/4 of your health bar. So if you combine this you won't require to use items to continue playing.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3025380/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736445803","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3025380/page.bg.jpg?t=1736445803","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3025380/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736445803","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3025380/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736445803","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>An RPG with an Endless Story!</strong><br><br>Beyond The Tales is a classic turn-based RPG with a twist!
