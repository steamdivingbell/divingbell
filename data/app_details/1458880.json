{"about_the_game":"The Dark Stares Back is an Indie horror strategy game where you must carefully plan your movement in a house with no power or escape against multiple home invaders with no purpose but to hunt you. Each of them behaves in their own unique way, from being in the room you were in last, to waiting for you to open doors to ambush you, and more. You must learn from your experience to evade them long enough to survive until 7 AM to win. It's all about learning, strategy, and execution.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can run into the dark vents, hide in the empty cabinets, duck behind furniture and more to survive. However, there are many mistakes you can make as well. You must learn them and learn FROM them in order to win. Anything you do can get you killed, especially hesitation. Oh, and you might wanna watch where you step!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1458880/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1608830607","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1458880/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1608830607","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1458880/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1608830607","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1458880/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1608830607","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Dark Stares Back is an Indie horror strategy game where you must carefully plan your movement in a house with no power or escape against multiple home invaders with no purpose but to hunt you.
