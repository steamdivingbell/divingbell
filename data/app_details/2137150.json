{"about_the_game":"Take a swing at the only pentagon-based rhythm game you'll ever need. Premiering all-new features you've never seen before...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">-- A Rhythm Game Unlike Any Other! --</h2><br>All you need is a mouse to hit incoming notes with, but that doesn't mean it'll always be simple. Easy to learn, tricky to master; it won't leave anyone unsatisfied.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">-- It spins? Yes it does! --</h2><br>Super Pentagon revolves around a totally unique concept; literally! The screen rotates around the central pentagon, while notes fly in towards it. Hit the right quadrant in time with the rhythm to keep your score up.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">-- Spinning? New challenges? Oh my! --</h2><br>Each level will carefully introduce a new gameplay mechanic or new note type. We won't throw you in at the deep end (unless you really want to). Levels will start simple, but as the stages and your skills progress, new mechanics will start showing up to keep you on your toes. Variety is the spice of life, after all.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">-- Regular free updates! --</h2><br>The game will receive free updates, adding brand new content, songs, gamemodes, and ever-expanding customisation options. Want to influence development or suggest a song? Just write me and I'll get right on it.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2137150/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1663831983","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2137150/page.bg.jpg?t=1663831983","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2137150/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1663831983","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2137150/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1663831983","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Take a swing at the only pentagon-based rhythm game you'll ever need.
