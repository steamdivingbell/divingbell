In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty\u00ae game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history.<br><br></li><li>New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies.<br><br></li><li>Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone.<br><br></li><li>Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles. </li></ul><br><strong>Squads</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers  created and leveled up in multiplayer.<br><br></li><li>The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he'll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Ghost Stories","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/209160/02389e50db94d8103d71e3e26532659526caf88c.jpg"},{"name":"Spatial Awareness","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/209160/938412147809b3b8d782a0c6b1354980b7a76466.jpg"},{"name":"Brave New World","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/209160/a398ddce474468a1e86dd574eb2ea0d4376c3054.jpg"},{"name":"Liberty Wall","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/209160/bd9bc54978cc4e496bd56b01b9310558b445ee66.jpg"},{"name":"No Man's Land","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/209160/bc18770b2f678ce079eb645b346bc382b1413701.jpg"},{"name":"Blimey O'Riley","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/209160/d631ddab876e49701f239d48c3c726b920e4afb1.jpg"},{"name":"Struck Down","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/209160/eee8e470d8814bcd7656b725fd69a2befa9b85aa.jpg"},{"name":"Waste Not","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/209160/a3f98881e75528718bb396a93f5eda22e4bf89ce.jpg"},{"name":"Homecoming","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/209160/92780cf10aadd423c0220c712bda43d771c28895.jpg"},{"name":"Go Ugly Early","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/209160/1df05bcc60677d4079a0477f358ed2969bfbc9c5.jpg"}],"total":40},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/209160?t=1654830036","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/209160?t=1654830036","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/209160/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1654830036","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/209160/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1654830036","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Valve Anti-Cheat enabled","id":8},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Outnumbered and outgunned, but not outmatched.<br><br>Call of Duty\u00ae: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time.
