{"about_the_game":"Water tanks full, 2 locomotives raring to go, it\u2019s Autumn and the tracks need a good blasting - power wash your way to success with the Train Sim World 3: Rail Head Treatment Train!<br><br>Right through the year, the railway network faces many challenges; hot rails in Summer run the risk of buckling, in the Winter they get frozen, point work fails, electrical contact gets difficult. But when the leaves start falling, the Rail Head Treatment Trains (RHTTs) go out on patrol.<br><br>How does the RHTT help? It is designed specifically for cleaning the track. Crushed leaves and moisture leave a slippery film on top of rails, and this specialist equipment, in the form of high-pressure water jets cut the residue right off, leaving them in better condition to run normal traffic safely. <br><br>These wagons are often hauled by versatile diesel locomotives, such as the Class 66, and these locomotives get dirty! Wet dust and debris coat locos in a muddy layer, but all in the name of reliability. Slotted throughout timetables in Autumn multiple times a day, these trains are a common sight almost anywhere in the UK.<br><br>The RHTT in Train Sim World 3 features 4 wagon variants, with different equipment loaded on each, alongside a weathered Class 66, ready to run on Southeastern Highspeed in-between the busy passenger services.
