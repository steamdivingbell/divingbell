The storyline is very interesting and the fact that it comes with multiple endings is definitely a plus as it puts more pressure on players to play the game in a certain way to get the outcome that they want.  The combat in the game is also another thing that I really enjoy in the game.\u201d<br>IGN Southeast Asia<br><br>\u201cThere is no tomorrow&quot; is a third-person action adventure combining stealth and action-adventure / survival horror elements in an admittedly successful way. This is a genuine result of a creator who is not afraid to experiment with gameplay that may initially seem repetitive in the gaming industry.\u201d<br>JustGamer<br><br>\u201cThere is a really good dark story along this game. Creepy creatures, decent mechanics, interesting characters such as the doll character you will meet in the game.
