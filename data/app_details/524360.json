{"about_the_game":"Wendy Edison and her family come home from church, only to find the gate to the pasture broken and one of their cows has wandered off.  To make matters worse, Wendy's sister Winona blames herself and runs off as well.  Looks like today isn't going to be just another Sunday!<br />\r\n <br />\r\nThis is the second Episode in the soon-to-be long running Farnham Fables series. Buying this will unlock the entire second Episode on the newly created Episode list on Tape 1. It plays exactly the same as the first Episode, only with new characters, new locations, new story, new music, new everything! If you liked the first Episode, or maybe just kinda liked it but thought maybe things could be just a little better, then you'll really enjoy the second Episode maybe!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/524360/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1513515735","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/524360/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1513515735","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/524360/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1513515735","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/524360/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1513515735","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Wendy Edison and her family come home from church, only to find the gate to the pasture broken and one of their cows has wandered off.
