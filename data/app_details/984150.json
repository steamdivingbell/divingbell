Are you brave or will you avoid danger at all costs? Are you resourceful or are you clueless when it comes to survival? Will you help others, or will you only help yourself? As your rating improves, new adventures and Personas will be unlocked, it's up to you how you behave, but there will be consequences. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHighlights<br />\r\n* Explore 16 levels of Interactive Fiction. <br />\r\n* Each level is an opportunity to improve your Survival Rating.<br />\r\n* Unlock 7 different Personas and try to keep them alive to complete the game.<br />\r\n* Repeat and replay to improve your Survival Rating and unlock new adventures. <br />\r\n* Beautiful character artwork.<br />\r\n* Over 250,000 words of fiction to read.<br />\r\n* Haunting sound design and special effects. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThroughout Powerless you will be guided by our A.I named MAUDE (Mobile Assessment Unit of Doomsday Events). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnswer MAUDE's psychological profiling questions and she will assign you different Londoners to test your metal in an apocalyptic London without electricity.
