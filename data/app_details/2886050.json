{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Star Trek Adventures: Native Soil</h2>  Assisting an archeological team on the planet Avalon leads to a shocking discovery and entangles the crew in a momentous cultural dilemma.Your orders are to assist an archaeological team being led by an old friend of one of the ship's command personnel. The planet's original civilization was wiped out thousands of years ago by a radiation burst. Thankfully, the planet is no longer in danger and a new civilization has since flourished there.The away team provides support at the digsite and are present when survivors of the original civilization are unearthed, held in stasis. This discovery will help answer a great archaeological puzzle, but poses an even greater challenge when the revived ancients make claims to the planet now inhabited by a new civilization. \u00a0Avalon is an independent colony and the Federation cannot dictate a solution, but the crew are invited to mediate in an attempt to relieve the impasse of ideals and demands. The away team's advocates face difficult choices and protests from both sides-can they calm the situation and find a solution agreeable to all parties?Although this is a standalone adventure, a one-page mission brief provides inspiration for continuing the mission.

Bennett, and is set during The Next Generation era with the player characters being the crew of a Starfleet vessel.
