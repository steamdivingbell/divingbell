{"about_the_game":"<strong>The Story of a Driver's Journey Home</strong><br>In the Republic of River, a special law is in place.

It's crucial to stop just before hitting any of them; otherwise, the driver will end up behind bars.<br><br>During the journey, the driver might come across valuable items on the road, allowing them to purchase a supercar and a luxurious house. After acquiring the supercar and luxurious house, the driver can continue their journey, heading towards their lavish home.<br><br>For a stress-free drive without worrying about hitting anyone, choose the highway with no pedestrians, allowing you to listen to music and relax. If you're seeking excitement and want to break free from the monotony of safe driving, you can engage in a racing game. Only supercars are allowed in this race, and the law doesn't apply on the racing track. Consequently, there is no risk of hitting or killing anyone.
