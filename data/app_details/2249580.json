{"about_the_game":"Game description:<br />\r\n      This is a leisure strategy game. The game is similar to the traditional millionaire. It is played in the way of rolling dice in turn.<br />\r\n      The game supports three game modes: single player, local multiplayer and local team formation. The game wins by using various strategic elements in the game to make the opponent's blood count zero. The game can support 1-6 person games and fight with robots. This game contains multiple game maps. Players can select the map before starting the game, and can adjust different game parameters as needed (such as number of players, HP, camp, damage refresh round, operation time, etc.).<br />\r\n      The game uses cards and dice to limit and trick opponents by purchasing cards or obtaining refreshed props in the store, so as to gain the initiative of the game and win the final victory.<br />\r\n      At the beginning of the game, each character has a certain amount of blood (configurable in the game parameters) and blue (used to use cards and function dice), and obtains the same starting cards. The number of moving steps is determined by rolling dice. When passing/staying on a block, different block effects will be activated according to the type of block. Defeat other players by making reasonable use of cards and dice in strategic games. During the game, different items will be refreshed regularly. Staying on the land where the items are located will automatically get the item effect. With the progress of the game, the damage bonus of the game will continue to increase, and the damage to the game character is linked to the damage bonus. When the player's HP decreases to 0, the player's role disappears. When the number of players in the remaining camp is 1, the remaining camp players win, and the game ends.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2249580/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1682133708","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2249580/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1682133708","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2249580/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1682133708","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2249580/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1682133708","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Game description:<br />\r\n      This is a leisure strategy game.
