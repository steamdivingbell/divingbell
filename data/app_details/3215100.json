{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3215100/extras/IndiePrecisionTwo.png?t=1736136096\" /><br>Colorize is an indie precision platformer roguelite that combines fast-paced action with mobility and combat abilities. Dive into procedurally remixed levels where precision, timing, and creative builds are your best allies. Each run presents a unique challenge\u2014whether you're leaping across platforms, dodging enemy fire, or unleashing powerful abilities.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3215100/extras/FunAbilitiesTwo.png?t=1736136096\" /><br>In Colorize, your character's abilities are tied to different colors, each offering its own unique theme. Harness the power of Red to unleash fiery blasts, summon the speed of Yellow for rapid dashes, and wield the webs of Blue to climb high. Master these abilities to gain the upper hand against increasingly difficult foes.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3215100/extras/TeleportsTwo.png?t=1736136096\" /><br>Magenta offers the power of teleportation. With precise control, you can blink across gaps, dodge enemy attacks, or even bypass walls. Teleports offer endless opportunities to outmaneuver enemies and explore hard-to-reach areas.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3215100/extras/FireballTwo.png?t=1736136096\" /><br>Unleash the power of Red with devastating fireballs that scorch everything. Use them to melt through enemies and blast through opposition. Aim carefully and incinerate foes from a distance or destroy them with blasing auras. Fireballs offer both offensive and defensive advantages, making them a go-to ability for many builds.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3215100/extras/MoreTwo.png?t=1736136096\" /><br>But that\u2019s not all! As you progress, you'll unlock additional color-themed abilities that enhance your platforming skills and combat capabilities. From slowing down time to creating protective barriers, the possibilities are endless. Discover new powers as you journey deeper into the ever-changing world of Colorize.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3215100/extras/DefeatTwo.png?t=1736136096\" /><br>Face off against a variety of enemies, each with their own attack patterns and weaknesses. Use your color abilities to outsmart and overwhelm your foes as you race past. Strategy and timing are key as you take down hordes of color-coded adversaries.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3215100/extras/BossesTwo.png?t=1736136096\" /><br>Hiding in the later levels are powerful boss enemies. These challenging encounters will test your mastery of the game\u2019s mechanics. Each boss has unique abilities that require quick thinking and adaptability to understand and defeat.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3215100/extras/UpgradesTwo.png?t=1736136096\" /><br>Between runs, collect resources and unlock permanent upgrades that enhance your abilities and stats. These upgrades ensure that no run is ever wasted, allowing you to become stronger and delve deeper into the game\u2019s increasingly difficult levels.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3215100/extras/HowFarTwo.png?t=1736136096\" /><br>With procedurally remixed levels, Colorize offers the deep replayability expected of roguelight. Every run is a different experience with new challenges, enemies, and surprises waiting around each corner. Push yourself to the limit and see how far you can go in this colorful, ever-evolving world. Can you unlock all the abilities and conquer every level?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3215100/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736136096","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3215100/page.bg.jpg?t=1736136096","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3215100/8405b5b5ce5993e56e4f35bbc1b13028cc24b988/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736136096","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3215100/8405b5b5ce5993e56e4f35bbc1b13028cc24b988/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736136096","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":3240080,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3215100/extras/IndiePrecisionTwo.png?t=1736136096\" /><br>Colorize is an indie precision platformer roguelite that combines fast-paced action with mobility and combat abilities.
