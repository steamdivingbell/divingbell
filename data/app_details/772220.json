{"about_the_game":"Arbiter is an intense, multiplayer arena shooter in VR. Blast yourself around the battle grid with an assortment of weapons in destructible environments. Each round is a new arbitration with players representing a side procedurally decided upon by the all-powerful Arbiter AI, a sentient machine unleashed on the world to solve all disputes. And The Arbiter will iteratively solve all of them... Will you fight for the side of kittens or Poland? Fuzzy slippers better than hot dogs? Soda versus Bieber?? You shall fight, and the Arbiter shall judge.
