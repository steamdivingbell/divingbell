A number next to your stamina will display your body temperature (Starting at 98F). As time progresses, your temp will slowly fall with the rate depending on the level. Once your temperature drops to 95F, its game over. The ONLY way to prevent this is collecting Firewood throughout your mission and bringing 3 to a fire pit that will be present in every level. You can only carry 3 pieces of firewood at a time. Once lit, the fire will bump your temp back up to 98.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2713370/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1703193254","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2713370/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1703193254","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2713370/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1703193254","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2713370/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1703193254","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>STORY</strong><br><br>A long and stressful day has Christopher drinking his problems away.
