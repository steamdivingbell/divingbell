{"about_the_game":"Spot The Difference: Haunted House is a casual game where you monitor 10 unique rooms through cameras in a supposedly haunted house. Click objects that have changed and report them to your boss who hired you. Anything about an object can change - perhaps an object moved, changed color slightly, or perhaps their shadow doesn't quite look right anymore. Stay on your toes and find all the differences whether they are paranormal or not.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game features a color blind mode setting that removes all color related events from the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game contains very mild popups, but can be turned off. The game is not intended to be too scary besides the setting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMemory and attention to detail are important, good luck!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"The Gates Are Open","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3163880/f2a5fb17db2d8fa07932df480fe1f97a1171bc12.jpg"},{"name":"Job Done","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3163880/5efccdfea458b4573a0a880d08c92d62ab83bbf4.jpg"},{"name":"I'm the Boss","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3163880/306eace7ff5e8042a50c008af2bdc6693eb5d91c.jpg"}],"total":3},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3163880/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729090596","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3163880/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1729090596","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3163880/40f79c1343e9f13a4374affc6edea59ef2eee4ba/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729090596","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3163880/40f79c1343e9f13a4374affc6edea59ef2eee4ba/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729090596","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Spot The Difference: Haunted House is a casual game where you monitor 10 unique rooms through cameras in a supposedly haunted house.
