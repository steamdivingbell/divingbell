Hunt down a feared unicorn named \u00dcber, as you recruit wax monsters that spawn wax towers that shoot wax at your enemies (we could wax lyrical all day). Or recruit your own horny unicorns and fight Enormy the Enormous; a really dumb but (for some reason) widely revered Barbarian. <br><br>Yeah, it\u2019s all pretty weird, and there\u2019s a lot more to discover. Recruit brand new units to fight by your side like crossbowmen, infested queens, black dragons, white dragons and assassin warriors.
