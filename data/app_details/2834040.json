{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>What would the world be without music?</strong></h2><br>In the year 2150, music is a relic of the past. People have forgotten it. Now it's your task to rediscover it - all the fascinating epochs from the 20th-century jazz to hip-hop. You decide which genre is particularly important to you - which of the individualized musicians you want to hire. Each musician and each genre brings its own exciting characteristics and is worth exploring and experiencing. Take care of your musicians and their needs, let them produce albums, mixtapes, singles, or even a summer hit. Grow into a thriving music empire that dominates the market and the charts. Focus on a single genre or let all genres flourish by creating a precisely planned facility where all processes are strictly timed. Upgrade your musicians, studios, cafeterias, distributions, etc., to suit your needs and watch as simple rooms turn into high-tech laboratories and futuristic studio technology noticeably increases efficiency. Unlock legendary musicians who actually existed. It's worth stopping by regularly even for a short visit. There is always something to upgrade, and special events can occur at any time. These could be XP boosts for a day, discounts, or situations you have to deal with. Do you sell one of your beloved musician because an agent offers you a considerable sum? Do you want to send your most popular musician on a tour? And how do you deal with it when your rappers argue again? Become part of a fascinating world where music gets a second chance and rewrite its history!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2834040/extras/Logo_With_Screenshot_3.png?t=1709209892\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2834040/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1709209892","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2834040/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1709209892","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2834040/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1709209892","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2834040/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1709209892","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>What would the world be without music?</strong></h2><br>In the year 2150, music is a relic of the past.
