{"about_the_game":"<strong>Discover a new world set in an alternate timeline of Sun Haven, one where a hero never arrived. Without a hero to save the day, Dynus, the Moon Dragon, has conquered the lands, and now it\u2019s up to you to wage a heroic last stand against his monsters. Complete objectives to gain more power, meet and befriend your neighbors, and even fall in love and get married! Take your place in the battle against the setting sun.</strong><br><br><br><strong>Play as Darius, recently crowned Demon King of Withergate, Lucia, Archmage of Sun Haven, and Jas, Master Summoner, or Artemis, Amari Bounty Hunter.</strong> With the help of over 13 unique abilities, defend your home against hordes of quirky yet dangerous monsters by using weapons and spells such as:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Swords, bows, and snowball launchers<br></li><li>Fireballs, magical auras, and lightning blasts<br></li><li>Stinky egg cannons, piercing carrot ballistas, and milk machine guns<br></li><li>Puppies, dragons, and even handsome lizard archers</li></ul><br><strong>Upgrade your weapons, skills, pets, and abilities by gaining skill cards, which are drawn every time you level up. </strong>After every loss, make sure to use the weapons rack and anvil to unlock and upgrade your character and ability stats across all 4 characters permanently!
