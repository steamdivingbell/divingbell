{"about_the_game":"Trapped forever on a train to nowhere. Once seen as the greatest invention of the 1800's, the Tempus Rail was a vast locomotive that breached the temporal rift and gifted it's passengers eternal life. Free from consequence and even death, the passengers aboard the Tempus Rail travelled the temporal streams at the precise speed to reset time each day. But when the maiden voyage ended and it was time to leave the temporal rift, the train never stopped. Now countless cycles beyond, the train has devolved into chaos with few who have held their sanity. <br><br>As one of these lucky (or unlucky) few who find themselves barricaded in the rear of the train, you must fight your way to the front of the train in the hopes of stopping the train before days end.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Deck-Builder</h2>Fight your way through deadly carriages using a turn-based combat system in which your deck holds the key to your survival.
