We have worked on 15+ small ideas and projects in the past and with BETRAYED we have finally created a game that fulfills our expectations for quality and reliability. For this reason, we have officially founded our studio &quot;Almost Good Games&quot; and decided to release Betrayed on Steam with the hope of offering entertainment and fun for fellow gamers while also collecting feedback on how to improve the game further.<br><br>We try to be as transparent and open as possible and would love to get your feedback on our work. We have created social media accounts on all major platforms as well as an official Discord you can join. We are active on all those platforms by ourselves.
