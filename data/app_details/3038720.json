The game will also launch with at least two major game modes. Post-launch, the game will receive no less than $15 worth of DLC, mostly if not all in the form of additional aircraft. Those who pledge $25 or more will receive all DLC as it is released.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3038720?t=1719451774","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3038720?t=1719451774","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3038720/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1719451774","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3038720/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1719451774","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FLY LOW.
