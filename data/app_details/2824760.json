{"about_the_game":"On a planet far from here, and in a completely different time... You're part of a crew of explorers, and you've stumbled upon the ancient ruins of a human civilization. How it got there doesn't really matter. Because, really, it wasn't your choice to be here. And even worse, it's magical, cursed, and pure evil. Hoards of undead swarm you, and they aim to make you one of their own. The only thing between you and death is your laser. And even that doesn't seem to work as well as you'd like. <br><br>But even if you're from a different planet or a different time, you still don't want to die, so you best get to figuring it out. If you time it right and use the right ammo, you might just make it out alive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mechanics</h2>In Brass Necessity, the control layout is simple. There are only seven inputs, and four of those are WASD for moving. You've also got the ability to sprint, which is handy for dodging the greedy hands of the dead.<br><br>But the star of the show is your somewhat trusty and temperamental laser. It has two whole inputs dedicated to it. So it's not hard to work. One key reloads the ammo. The other fires it. Simple! The crystals you use as ammo change the properties of your laser. The only snag is that these crystals seem to be growing from the undead. Use the wrong crystal, and they'll be much harder to kill. Meaning you're more likely to die. Use the right one however, and you're less likely to die. Got the wrong ammo? Tough! You'll have to reload or search for the right one. All your crystals suck? Just reload them all to reset your laser. See, simple! Intuitive! Just don't fire your laser too long... the manufacturers never quite got continuous firing right.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About the Studio</h2>Popped Corn Bytes is a game developer and publisher of community-created games.
