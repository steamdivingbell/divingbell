{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Nominated for &quot;Excellence in Game Design&quot; Award at BitSummit Drift 2024</h2><br>Harvest Nature. Make the Goods. Please the Company. ESCAPE THE PLANET.<br><br>Block Rancher is a sandbox Action-Roguelike - you play as a worker at a sprawling conglomerate that creates trinkets and disposable goods for mass consumption. Your role: harvest the exotic creatures and bountiful plant life on your homeworld, and use them to create a stream of throwaway products to fulfil your employer's corporate appetites. Your hope? Impress them enough to qualify for management training and get yourself this dusty, dead-end planet.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Sandbox Planet</h2>Get creative with your play style - the planet is brimming with fascinating plants, iconic creatures, powerful suit enhancements and deadly hazards. All the living creatures you encounter on the planet have their own complex behaviours, interactions and sensitivities - master exploiting their properties to boost your deliveries and fast-track your career.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Symbiotic Critters</h2>Many of the local creatures are happy to tag along and lend you their extraordinary abilities. Strap them to your backpack and they'll greatly enhance your movement and combat powers and deliver very different ways to play.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fail, Upgrade, Repeat</h2>Nothing in this life comes for free, and if you want out you\u2019re going to have to work for it. Use each run to learn more about the planet and develop strategies to survive and thrive. Collect rare materials to purchase upgrades at the worker hub to unlock new abilities and give you a better chance next time.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2877940/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1723428344","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2877940/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1723428344","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2877940/6837e38b0ada9213c578871ceb9c03de4ba2d1aa/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1723428344","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2877940/6837e38b0ada9213c578871ceb9c03de4ba2d1aa/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1723428344","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Nominated for &quot;Excellence in Game Design&quot; Award at BitSummit Drift 2024</h2><br>Harvest Nature.
