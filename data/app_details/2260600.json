{"about_the_game":"Give your sci-fi heroes some incredible robots to battle against with the Last Boss Pack Vol.4! Gee-kun-soft latest battler pack focuses on mechas and armored humanoid robots, with battlers, sprites, and background images to help bring your sci-fi worlds to life! With 10 different robot builds and variations for each to choose from, your players will be able to face robots on land, on sea, in the sky, and even in space! Challenge a red samurai robot to a duel in a dangerous city or have your players try to escape a mecha with four legs that let it roll on land and float on water without slowing down, all while a dark purple robot looms in the distance as the final challenge. Don\u2019t leave your players without a robot of their own, give them a white and blue paladin robot or speedy fighter jet that can help them escape a deadly situation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach robot has a matching sprite, so you can let your players control their own mecha while exploring destroyed cities or space! 14 backgrounds (with two sizes, 816 x 624 and 1000 x 740) give you some out of this world choices for locations of battles and cutscenes. Let your players hang out on the streets of a skyscraper-filled town or on a ship\u2019s deck while floating in space, or force them to survive battles in waste-filled worlds or in space while explosions burst in the background!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack also includes 26 bonus images with the ready-to-battle robots placed into the backgrounds, perfect for introducing your players to their latest foe before a fight! Show the samurai robot sending powerful sword slashes towards the screen before starting a battle, or have the villain\u2019s dark mecha launch a barrage of missiles in a cutscene to force your players down onto a wasteland planet.
