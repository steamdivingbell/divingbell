{"about_the_game":"Dawn Destiny's Child is an independent game with a storyline turn based combat mode, developed by only two people. The game includes various gameplay methods such as making potions, creating weapons, recruiting heroes, and washing hero attributes. The game is mainly based on magical storylines, returning to the style of traditional RPG games.<br />\r\nIn the game, players will play the role of a tribal chieftain, leading their tribe through various levels. Experience various tests and tribulations from monsters and demons. Ultimately, unlock the secrets about humans, demons, and even the world.<br />\r\nKind reminder:<br />\r\nIn various interactions with NPCs, please be cautious in choosing the decisions you want to make, as this can lead to completely different plot directions and endings.<br />\r\nThe story structure of the game includes stories from different periods such as ancient times, the Day of Destruction, the Seven Kills, the Wasteland Age, and the Underground World. If you only complete one ending, you may not fully understand the entire story, so you need to try to complete all the endings as much as possible. Only in this way can you truly understand the entire storyline.<br />\r\nThere are a total of 11 storylines, with an average completion time of approximately 6-16 hours.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame operation instructions\uff1a<br />\r\n1. Basic Operations<br />\r\nIn the scene, the &quot;D&quot; key on the keyboard is for forward and the &quot;A&quot; key is for backward.<br />\r\n2. Falling<br />\r\nThe scene will randomly display various monsters, treasure chests, relics, etc., which correspond to the current scene. The more advanced the scene, the higher the level of weapons, minerals, and herbs dropped from the treasure chest, and the more powerful the monsters that also appear.<br />\r\n3. Scenarios<br />\r\nThere are several scenes in the game, and players will always appear in the &quot;Blood Jungle&quot; scene when they first come out, which is because they need to cooperate with the plot. Only when you pass the 'Blood Jungle' scene will you come to the big map. In the big map, a &quot;eye&quot; symbol will appear on the top of the scene where the player has cleared the level, indicating that the plot has been cleared. However, you can also enter it, but the plot will no longer appear inside. The reason for retaining the &quot;already cleared&quot; scene is that if players find it difficult to pass due to the difficulty of the next scene level, they can gain experience and various materials to enhance their strength by redrawing the previously cleared scene.<br />\r\n4. Forging<br />\r\nTo forge weapons in the 'Forge Room', you need to follow the recipe on the 'Weapon Forge Book' you obtained to forge them. The &quot;Weapon Forging Book&quot; can be viewed in the treasure box interface for detailed instructions. The ore, fragments, and weapon forging books in the &quot;Forging Room&quot; can be continuously clicked to increase the quantity, without the need to drag one by one.<br />\r\n5. Refining Medicine<br />\r\nThe 'Herbal Formula' is given by unlocking the plot, or you can try to match it yourself. Once configured successfully, the 'Herbal Formula' will be automatically recorded in the 'Achievement' interface. If you only obtain the 'Herbal Formula' by unlocking the plot, it is not possible to unlock all the 'Herbal Formula' with just one storyline.<br />\r\n6. Occupation<br />\r\nThe heroes in the game are divided into 8 professions, namely Paladin, Warrior, Thief, Hunter, goddess, Witch, Druid, and Mage. They each have their own weapons and treasures to use, and of course, you need to find a way to obtain them by crafting or dropping them from the treasure chest.<br />\r\n7. Weapon type<br />\r\nThere are a total of &quot;115&quot; weapons in the game, with approximately 6 levels from low to high. However, the level is not specified on the weapon, and players can determine it based on specific attribute values. It is impossible to obtain all weapons by completing only one storyline.<br />\r\n8. Hero attributes and 'characteristics'<br />\r\nIn the game, each profession has its own unique 5 skills, and a maximum of 4 heroes can participate in a battle. Players need to master the skill coordination and position management of each profession before they can pass the level later. Of course, weapons, potions, and other blessings are also needed.<br />\r\nThe game has developed a hero's &quot;characteristics&quot; mechanism. Except for the heroes presented in the plot. Every hero recruited is a &quot;random attribute parameter and characteristic&quot;. Each hero's &quot;feature bar&quot; can hold 5 good and 5 bad features, which appear randomly and may not be full. There are many types of &quot;features&quot; that directly affect the hero's combat power and other numerical values, so selecting a good hero is the key.<br />\r\nThe only way a hero can change the &quot;characteristics&quot; they already possess is to obtain a &quot;special treasure&quot; in the game to wash the hero's characteristics, which requires players to explore.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nReminder: Please brush the medicine rationally, otherwise it will seriously affect the gaming experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI hope it can bring you a good gaming experience, and I wish everyone a happy time!!!<br />\r\nGame communication QQ: 909462111","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2502390/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1694689325","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2502390/page.bg.jpg?t=1694689325","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2502390/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1694689325","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2502390/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1694689325","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Dawn Destiny's Child is an independent game with a storyline turn based combat mode, developed by only two people.
