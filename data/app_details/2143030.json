You'll find all kinds of mysteries along your journey, exploring different biomes, mobs, and items along the way.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As a dwarf searching for treasure and glory, you'll find that your journey can be quite tough without some allies at your side. Each player uses their own personalized talents, spells, and items to help defeat treacherous bosses.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CO-OP UP TO 10 PLAYERS</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Crawl through the caves alone or with a group of friends!
