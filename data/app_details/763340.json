Please expect Brave Hand to be a small, replayable, solitaire-like card game where your goal is to beat your previous score, and unlock a light story along the way. I made it because I loved the simple yet replayable games that came with my first computer, and wanted something like them, but with just a little more strategy. If the main &quot;Brave&quot; mode is too hard or too random for your taste, be sure to try out the other modes! Each mode is designed to cater to a specific type of playstyle. Please contact me through Twitter, our forums, or my website if you run into any trouble or just want to follow along with development. I really hope you enjoy the game. <i>-Scott Brodie</i></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>You\u2019ve landed on a mysterious island and unearthed a long forgotten card game.
