{"about_the_game":"Society has fallen under the control of a company named Vitron. Vitron offers a product that links directly to people's minds, making it incredibly powerful in controlling brain chemistry and how a person perceives the world. It makes people feel happy and fulfilled while censoring out the parts of the world that they do not want to see. Because of the product's mind controlling nature, in combination with its mental censorship, humanity has become completely brainwashed. Vitron's control over the world increases each day as more people become reliant on their devices. Until you come along.<br><br>You play as Jake, the main character of the game who starts out in a brainwashed mindset. It is ultimately your choice and awareness that continues the story-line.
