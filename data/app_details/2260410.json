They comprised all peoples on Earth and persisted as a singular organization by upholding a practical and lasting promise of peace over hundreds of years. Given the course of human history, the fact that Reyab grew as it did not through martial conquest but the proliferation of ideology, technology, and institutions is an anomaly yet to be fully understood.<br><br>Some scientists believe a piece of the answer rests with Patient 147; the title represents many subjects who are part of an ongoing case study. All of them are rather ordinary people save for three significant hereditary traits: innate computing abilities, collaborative proclivities, and perfectly smooth brains. Wherever Reyab infrastructure settled and grew roots, a Patient 147 operated behind the scenes\u2014overwhelmingly in a position of logistics, management, advising, or arbitration\u2014and thus did the Corporation flourish.<br><br>Now that Reyab and Colonists have split as well as militarized their populaces, continuing the 147 case study will be a tall order. On both sides, there are undoubtedly numerous subjects, each one intensely loyal to their faction's cause, willing to fight to the death. They still wear their 147 colors, however, and they have a particular pride in exhibiting their brains with decorative headgear augmentation.</i><br>\u2014transmission from an Unknown vendor</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Escape the lab as Patient 147 with VAIL VR SmoothBrain Pack, featuring 2 exclusive skins:<br><br>SmoothBrain Faction Skins (<strong>&quot;SmoothBrain&quot; REYAB + Colonist</strong> Helm, Cloak and Gloves)","developers":["AEXLAB","habie147"],"fullgame":{"appid":"801550","name":"VAIL VR"},"genres":[{"description":"Action","id":"1"},{"description":"Casual","id":"4"},{"description":"Strategy","id":"2"}],"header_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2260410/header.jpg?t=1672027052","is_free":false,"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"></ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"></ul>"},"name":"VAIL VR SmoothBrain Pack","package_groups":[{"description":"","display_type":0,"is_recurring_subscription":"false","name":"default","save_text":"","selection_text":"Select a purchase option","subs":[{"can_get_free_license":"0","is_free_license":false,"option_description":"","option_text":"VAIL VR SmoothBrain Pack - $9.99 USD","packageid":810954,"percent_savings":0,"percent_savings_text":" ","price_in_cents_with_discount":999}],"title":"Buy VAIL VR SmoothBrain Pack"}],"packages":[810954],"pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 or 11<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Core i7-6700k / Ryzen 7 3700x<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 12 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> GTX 1080<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Recommend SSD or better</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 or 11<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Core-i7-12700k / Ryzen 9 3900x+<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 16 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> RTX 2080S<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Recommend SSD or better</li></ul>"},"platforms":{"linux":false,"mac":false,"windows":true},"price_overview":{"currency":"USD","discount_percent":0,"final":999,"final_formatted":"$9.99 USD","initial":999,"initial_formatted":""},"publishers":["AEXLAB"],"ratings":{"dejus":{"rating":"l"}},"release_date":{"coming_soon":false,"date":"24 Dec, 2022"},"required_age":0,"screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2260410/ss_9a683d0da57771c61230736e8fc666866022b9cc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1672027052","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2260410/ss_9a683d0da57771c61230736e8fc666866022b9cc.600x338.jpg?t=1672027052"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2260410/ss_35334f181279b0c9055a8a028dcb9a71e4fd1d6f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1672027052","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2260410/ss_35334f181279b0c9055a8a028dcb9a71e4fd1d6f.600x338.jpg?t=1672027052"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2260410/ss_be2876a40be4478347f828cd6a6c514b8b28e8dd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1672027052","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2260410/ss_be2876a40be4478347f828cd6a6c514b8b28e8dd.600x338.jpg?t=1672027052"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2260410/ss_008e21ef4783b1e24a221581e477240096442ed5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1672027052","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2260410/ss_008e21ef4783b1e24a221581e477240096442ed5.600x338.jpg?t=1672027052"}],"short_description":"Escape the lab as Patient 147 with VAIL VR SmoothBrain Pack, featuring 2 exclusive character skins.","steam_appid":2260410,"support_info":{"email":"","url":"https://discord.gg/vailvr"},"supported_languages":"English<strong>*</strong><br><strong>*</strong>languages with full audio support","type":"dlc","website":"https://playvailvr.com"}
