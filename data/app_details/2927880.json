{"about_the_game":"Oh yeah! Forget about cute postcards and selfies in front of ruins. The zone is calling you, brave man, if you have the courage to come in! This is not a recreational park, but a dirty, radioactive cesspool with mutants who have more heads than you have brains.<br>Play as a girl who not only knows how to hold a weapon, but is also not afraid to use it. Do you want to survive? Turn these radioactive deserts into your own personal fight club: fight mutants, mad scientists and anyone who gets in your way.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>DANGER</strong></h2>Here radiation is your slightest problem. Traps? Yeah, but if you're not fast enough, you'll end up as a piece of meat on someone's dinner plate. And don\u2019t expect a kind attitude. Everyone and everything here wants one thing - to survive. But don't worry, with each new artifact you get closer to victory, and mutants are just moving targets for training.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>MADNESS</strong></h2>Forget about the rules, there are none here. Just you, your weapon and the endless, ominous wastelands waiting for you to plunge into them. So, are you ready to become a predator among predators?
