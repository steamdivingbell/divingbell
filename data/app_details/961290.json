The UHD image captures the original illustration in great detail and you will be able to observe even the finest of details exactly as the artist has painted them on the canvas. The puzzle is of low difficulty, making it suitable for beginners and or players looking for a non-challenging playthrough. There are quite a lot of very distinct elements and no uniform areas at all, which should help you reconstruct the full image without too much trouble. Of course, if you find it too easy, you can always give it a try with a higher number of puzzle tiles.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/961290/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1589662932","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/961290/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1589662932","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/961290/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1589662932","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/961290/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1589662932","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"We would like to introduce you to <strong>Steampunk Hearse</strong> - another beautiful artwork from the Polish illustrator <strong>Elwira Pawlikowska</strong>.
