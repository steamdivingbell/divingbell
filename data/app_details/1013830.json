It\u2019s not for the faint of heart, that\u2019s for sure. Some may even end up hating him in the end, never forgiving him for his deeds. But this was what gave his characters so much of that \u201coomph\u201d factor. It was what made his storyline darkly enchanting and tempting for me. So please, do give him a try! He truly is one heck of a guy, that\u2019s for sure!

The MC is well-rounded and I was able to put myself into her mindset, which is a rare thing to find. The small problems I had, in no way detract from the overall experience of the game. The market is saturated with some high-quality games that are rife with bad translations or generic plots. With Agent of Love, it goes above and beyond its storytelling and explores themes that can limit its appeal and audience. However, it does not do this for shock value and puts thought into the story it tells. Like any story, everyone has their own tastes and preferences which cannot be changed regardless.\u201d<br>\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f \u2013 Ominous Beep<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1013830/ss_0b4efc6288e807585eafb158439bcb4cce43410d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1612650198","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1013830/ss_0b4efc6288e807585eafb158439bcb4cce43410d.600x338.jpg?t=1612650198"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1013830/ss_b297c7fe62928e9f88ccac52e914bbc8c90fc541.1920x1080.jpg?t=1612650198","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1013830/ss_b297c7fe62928e9f88ccac52e914bbc8c90fc541.600x338.jpg?t=1612650198"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1013830/ss_4b26e92585b2176481b8a05db664ed93b81a5465.1920x1080.jpg?t=1612650198","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1013830/ss_4b26e92585b2176481b8a05db664ed93b81a5465.600x338.jpg?t=1612650198"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1013830/ss_ed12b0014e43149110a1fa23b4cac3c6ac89d65e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1612650198","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1013830/ss_ed12b0014e43149110a1fa23b4cac3c6ac89d65e.600x338.jpg?t=1612650198"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1013830/ss_e8cdd3ca87aad3d219bf41ac789c44340bb4af69.1920x1080.jpg?t=1612650198","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1013830/ss_e8cdd3ca87aad3d219bf41ac789c44340bb4af69.600x338.jpg?t=1612650198"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1013830/ss_72f517787fd9b43763657cf2561db9a8db1e1632.1920x1080.jpg?t=1612650198","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1013830/ss_72f517787fd9b43763657cf2561db9a8db1e1632.600x338.jpg?t=1612650198"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1013830/ss_78a568e38985745c10d24b6d52addddd85fe3b86.1920x1080.jpg?t=1612650198","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1013830/ss_78a568e38985745c10d24b6d52addddd85fe3b86.600x338.jpg?t=1612650198"}],"short_description":"Play as a detective.
