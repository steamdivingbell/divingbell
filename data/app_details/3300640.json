{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Incompenauts is a co-op FPS roguelike for 1-4 players.\u00a0Fly, shoot, and scrap your way through hyperspace as you work together to keep your rickety spaceship running, avoid hazards, and face off against a robot armada in this sci-fi co-op physics roguelike.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BEST AND BRIGHTEST</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Assemble your crew of up to three friends or bystanders, and assume control of the finest spaceship that could be provided at a day's notice. Navigate the inside (or outside!) of the ship, working together to keep the ship running, powered, and full of air. Step into the cockpit for full third-person navigation control, or step through the airlock to collect passing scrap. Cycle between control of turrets in the Gunnery, or take matters into your own hands, blasting those pesky drillbots into the void.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">NAVIGATE THROUGH DEEP SPACE</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This isn't a vacation, and space sure isn't the beach. Work together with your crew to safely move around or through the many hazards of the final frontier, from asteroid clusters to EMP storms. With risk comes reward, however, as many of the best prizes can be found in the dangerous parts of space...</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TEAMWORK OR BUST</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Who is the leader of the mysterious robot armada? What do they want with your little ship? The answer, in both cases, is to hurry to your battlestations. From frigates to drillbots, scouts to saboteurs, the armada is the ultimate test of cooperation, requiring not only mastery of the ship, but the coordination to handle multiple functions at once. Fight or flee, the mothership waits patiently at the end of your run, the only question is how prepared your crew will be on arrival.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CONTINUE THE JOURNEY</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Tackle the void any way you want with a wide array of game modes and custom settings, including ENDLESS and HARDCORE options. Complete challenges to carry over unlockables through your runs, and discover hints to another threat, lurking on the edges of the universe...<br><br>...and order another pizza, while you're at it. That engine won't stay powered on the current supply.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3300640/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735923260","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3300640/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1735923260","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3300640/0f63ae611513afff6b64e950229026e27c748864/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735923260","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3300640/0f63ae611513afff6b64e950229026e27c748864/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735923260","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Incompenauts is a co-op FPS roguelike for 1-4 players.\u00a0Fly, shoot, and scrap your way through hyperspace as you work together to keep your rickety spaceship running, avoid hazards, and face off against a robot armada in this sci-fi co-op physics roguelike.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BEST AND BRIGHTEST</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Assemble your crew of up to three friends or bystanders, and assume control of the finest spaceship that could be provided at a day's notice.
