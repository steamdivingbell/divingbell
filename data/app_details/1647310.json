We have already released the RPG mode, which is mainly for individual players and has high freedom and playability. You can choose your own specialty, choose the upgrade path for your company and individual, and try to challenge your opponents in various ways. We have also planned a conquest mode that focuses on strategy and a tank battle mode full of steel torrents. This part of the content will be gradually launched after the game's first-hand experience begins, so stay tuned.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>3 Custom Mode or Workshop</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Want a purer battle?
