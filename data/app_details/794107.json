{"about_the_game":"She was affectionately - or sometimes not so affectionately - known by her pilots as the Bent-Wing Bird, the Ensign Eliminator, Hose Nose, Hog Nose, Sweetheart or Hog.

That does not include the unfortunate Ensigns who had so many problems trying to land the long-nosed bird on a carrier that the Navy finally ceased trying. They assigned the F4U to the Marines who quickly learned to love her for her superior fighting ways.
