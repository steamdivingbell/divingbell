{"about_the_game":"On Dark Terms is an online 1-4 player co-op open-world horror set in a post-apocalyptic world where you have signed a contract with Bwonsombdi \u2013 Loa of the Dead \u2013 to acquire protection in the form of a cat to look over your spirit while you attempt to investigate and discover a way to push back the Darkness. You\u2019ll scour the open-world for materials that you can use to craft consumables and Bio Fusion that can be used to fight back against the Darkness. Your goal is to enter Dungeons and destroy Dark Matter and absorb the energy created by observing different forms of evidence that spawned in response to the destruction of dark matter. This mysterious energy is the key to survival.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Key Features: </h2><br><strong>\u2022\tOpen World: </strong> On Dark Terms is a completely open-world game where you are encouraged to explore to gather materials for crafting consumables and special Bio Fusion for Dungeons.<br><br><strong>\u2022\tDungeons: </strong> Dungeons are a NEW take on paranormal investigation that pushes to revolutionize the genre by introducing for the First Time, RPG Survival gameplay in an open-world environment containing 6 unique Dungeons located on the World Map \u2013 Amusement Park, Library, Mansion, Museum, Mall, Office \u2013 and one Training Mode (Practice Dungeon).<br><br><strong>\u2022\tCustomization: </strong> On Dark Terms has so much to offer when it comes to customization and this Early Access only scratches the surface. You\u2019ll be able to customize your character, player icons, your cat, your cat\u2019s room, your apartment, and your gadgets that you hold with stickers! But did I say CAT ROOM? Oh yes, I did! <br><br><strong>\u2022\tCat Room Customization: </strong> As you grow in level, you\u2019ll gain access to new decorations for your cat\u2019s dedicated room!

Dark Matter can only be seen and destroyed using your Astral (cat) Form.  When you find and destroy Dark Matter as your cat, evidence associated with that Dark Matter will spawn. You will then use the correctly equipped item such as an EMF Device to search and observe the evidence. <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2159530/extras/OnDarkTermsDarkMatterGIF.gif?t=1707276497\" /><br><br><strong>\u2022\tEnergy: </strong> Observing evidence with the correct equipped item, causes Observed Energy to spawn that can be absorbed into your player\u2019s body. This energy is what you\u2019ll turn in later to gain experience and level up. The more Energy you absorb the more danger you\u2019ll be in. You\u2019ll want to be careful because you\u2019ll lose all absorbed energy if you die.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2159530/extras/OnDarkTermsAbsorbEnergyGIF.gif?t=1707276497\" /><br><br><strong>\u2022\tStory</strong> Not much is known about what happened to this world.
