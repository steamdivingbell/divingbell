We look forward to seeing people's reactions as well as listen to feedback from the community. Based on this feedback, we will try to improve the game as much as we can. Presumably, the Beta is about 1/6th of the full version of the game. We have developed more content that is not available in the Beta, but will be integrated in the full version of the game. Stay tuned for future developments!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/823870/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1552018367","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/823870/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1552018367","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/823870/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1552018367","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/823870/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1552018367","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/823870/extras/STORY.png?t=1552018367\" /><br><br>John Herrin survived a horrible accident, damaging his brain and memory.
