{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Classrooms</h2>The Classrooms is a procedural, liminal-space, found-footage, survival horror game. In 1996, Robert Chen took his VHS camcorder to the newly condemned local public school to investigate the disappearances of multiple students, including his younger sister. However, shortly after entering the premises, he finds himself lost in a senseless and seemingly infinite maze of halls and classrooms. Discover the contents of the tape he left behind. Explore The Classrooms and discover the various anomalies it contains; from malicious entities to harmless oddities. And remember, it's different every time you play, so your found footage is uniquely yours.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Procedural World</h2>The world of The Classrooms is fully procedural and different every time you play.
