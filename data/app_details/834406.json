{"about_the_game":"The Weardale &amp; Teesdale Scenario Pack 01 \u2013 complete with 10 authentic and realistic career scenarios \u2013 brings you back to the good ol\u2019 days of classic British Railways duties!<br><br>The Weardale &amp; Teesdale Network spans dozens upon dozens of miles of North East England\u2019s oldest and most important railway lines, which connect towns and cities with industries across the Pennines.<br><br>The area was linked with a prestigious and long list of railway heritage, with several railway-related works and engineering facilities to be found throughout the network. Darlington Railway Works, responsible for the building of many steam and diesel locomotives, was built in 1863 and survived until the Beeching Axe in 1966. Shildon Railway Works, known locally as \u2018The Wagon Works\u2019 as it built many of British Rail\u2019s freight revenue vehicles, is also a famous landmark in the area, closing only recently in 1984 and now home to \u2018Locomotion\u2019, the National Railway Museum\u2019s second site.<br><br>Much of this extensive railway network and many of those famous landmarks suffered at the hands of Dr Beeching, whose sweeping changes to the British rail network in the 1960s closed many of the branch lines to passenger traffic. As collieries closed and freight traffic reduced, by 1980 there was virtually nothing left of the famous routes as they were once known.
