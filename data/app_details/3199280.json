You will play as a dishonored Samurai lord or lady, tasked with restoring a once-thriving trade emporium. After creating your custom character, build your marketplace, your shops, camps and workshops, where you'll process the forage you find into valuable products to sell. Use earned money to unlock new followers, or train your existing ones, and expand your property, leveling up various skills in the process. Unlock new products by looking for new resources in the numerous increasingly dangerous regions of <i>Susu Mountain</i>, and with your gained riches, establish a lasting home for both you and your loyal followers.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3199280/extras/SteamTitleCharactersTall.png?t=1729847035\" /> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Cultivate and Forage</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Cultivate the fertile fields surrounding your emporium, growing a variety of crops that will serve as the foundation of your trade, and as food for you and your followers. To expand your product repertoire, you must venture into the wilds of Susu Mountain, an open world teeming with resources to mine, forage, fish, and hunt. Find rare herbs, and elusive creatures, or gather precious minerals in caves deep beneath the earth. With no energy limits to hold you back, the freedom to explore at your own pace is yours - you will not be forced to sleep at night.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Rescue New Followers and Build Relationships</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You soon learn that a mysterious event petrified <i>the Village of Artisans\u00a0</i>- which once supplied the emporium with a plethora of crafted products.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You unlock followers by un-petrifying the villagers one by one, through means that you discover as you play. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Once rescued, the villagers are more than just workers\u2014they are your companions. As you spend time around them, you'll have the opportunity to level up their rapport levels through conversation options and gifts. Befriend them, learn their stories, and, if you choose, pursue romance. Your followers have preferences about food, about where they sleep and what work they do - and you must try to manage them in a way that makes them the most comfortable and fulfilled. A happy artisan is a productive artisan, after all. To increase their skill levels - such as lumbering, handicraft, or transport - you must pay a hefty price for their training, which will make running a profitable emporium that much more rewarding. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Crafting</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With your gathered resources carried on your back, return to camp, where your built processing and crafting stations, as well as your followers await. Train a roster of skilled artisans, each with their own unique conversations and abilities, to help you create a wide array of sold goods - assign tasks to them, such as cutting down trees, mining, crafting, or stocking market stalls, and they will do so automatically while you're gone. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3199280/extras/CraftingGif.gif?t=1729847035\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Buzz of the Marketplace</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You sell products by simply placing them in a market stall, or in the item display of a shop - the layout of both you can freely design and customize with many decoration options. Luckily, your new property lays right next to a trade route which is always swarming with travelling traders. As they pass by, they might stop to inspect your produce - the better the products, the greater the chance they do so. From weapons and armor to pottery and textiles, your products will attract a variety of unique customers - each with their own origin, product preferences, and budget. Anything - even trash - can be sold, but what you sell affects the happiness of your customers, and if they don't leave happy with their purchase, they're sure to leave a nasty comment.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Combat</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Exploration involves defeating the beasts of the wilderness. To do so, you must level up your skills, and find or craft better gear, including new weapons, armor, rings and amulets. Learn how to execute weapon combos, and master movement to defeat increasingly difficult - and rewarding enemies. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3199280/extras/Combat.gif?t=1729847035\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>My Kind of Business</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">At the end of the day, it is up to you what your fantasy of running a feudal era business is.
