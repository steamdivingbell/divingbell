It includes an eclectic collection of tracks composed for trailers, teasers, short movies and websites. Written and produced by OVERKILL's celebrated composer Simon Viklund, the OVERKILL B-Sides album ranges from British punk to the Wild West by way of traditional Croatian folk. As PAYDAY 2 grows, the soundtrack grows with it, and new tracks are added for free.
