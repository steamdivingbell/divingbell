It is set in 2016 in the fictional place called Novazenica, and it has quite a few references to my actual home country, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Step into the shoes of the main protagonist as you solve the mysteries that begin to unfold in Novazenica. In addition to the realistic and atmospheric setting of The Vanished Soul, you will have to solve various puzzles to progress. While exploring, discover various side story elements, interact with many objects in the game, and immerse yourself in the atmosphere with numerous sound elements. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3126900/extras/IMG_Steam_01_v3.png?t=1738085456\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game doesn't rely heavily on grotesque and gore elements but instead tries to slowly bring discomfort to the players through lighting, sounds, and effects. Combine that with the story elements, and you will have a realistic and atmospheric experience in this horror game. The Vanished Soul is powered by Unreal Engine 5, which brings some of the latest technologies, like real-time global illumination, helping you immerse yourself in the game as much as possible!<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3126900/extras/GIF_NEW_02.gif?t=1738085456\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3126900/extras/IMG_Steam_04_v2.png?t=1738085456\" />Step into the shoes of the main protagonist as you solve the mysteries that begin to unfold in Novazenica and its surroundings. The game will try to create a bond between you and your loved ones. Discover and unravel the mysteries that unfold one by one as you play. It is up to you to discover and sort out the things from the past!
