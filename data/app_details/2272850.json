You're given 2 army members, a frog as a weapon, and 3 random starting items. The immediate area around you is cleared of any enemies.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MULTIPLAYER</h2>Multiplayer is all handled by us, so no need for port forwarding or internet to Lan services. You can join through Steam, or a room code.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CHARACTERS</h2>You can play as multiple types of birds, each with separate abilities. The Wren is small and fast, the phoenix poops fire, and the penguin can't fly instead he slides very fast on his lil belly.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ENEMIES</h2>The kitties on the map defend camps where you'll find imprisoned birds, free them and they'll join your army. Other creatures are defending the imprisoned birds as well, and are ready to take you down.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WEAPONS</h2>There's many weapon types each with distinct abilities. Stab or throw your spear, draw your bow for a clean one shot headshot, use a frog to instantly eat an enemy, use a magic staff to blow your foes away. Each weapon has infinite ammo yet a durability so prepare to go through many different weapons on your journey. You'll have to personally supply your bird army with said weapons so make sure to have a plethora.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CRAFTING</h2>Crafting allows you to build the weapons you need on the fly. Place the items on the ground and press your build key over them. In the escape menu you can find the crafting recipes page to help. Crafting items are spawned throughout the world and in chests.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE WORLD</h2>This is an open world with lots of different biomes and enemy types to explore. Each biome has unique creatures and kitties to both haunt and destroy you. Have fun! The forest has kitties that shoot hairballs and ones that grab you, the jungle has pixies, the swamp has ogre kitties and sorcerers, the desert has cowboy kitties and mummies, so on and so forth!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MUSIC</h2>Love Birds also has an awesome soundtrack made by yours truly (Jaxon Hill). With every song made specifically for the game :) Including many battle themes to prevent them from getting repetitive.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"The Gizzard","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2272850/49740b24dbdc1ca1c799c80ec2169fee016f3810.jpg"},{"name":"Souls Of The Damned","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2272850/af4830dcc9cf339bd1930a48098f53e4c2f92d25.jpg"},{"name":"Mid Game","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2272850/dd70f22af363a072fe1c756d8686bd14b24fbb9a.jpg"},{"name":"Armed Militia","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2272850/e5295f4ab79a51d2227344cdf58b1173cf8305e5.jpg"},{"name":"A Frog In Your Throat","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2272850/595760082693876e3a93cb3796ac6f067ae8d598.jpg"},{"name":"Cock Unblocked","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2272850/3e3f7c4866e01ad2f9cb48ffee814aba4318020e.jpg"},{"name":"Forest Liberated","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2272850/2b83411e58be84e075c998a7bedffd1f05804193.jpg"},{"name":"Haunted Forest Liberated","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2272850/df79681aed90f32c2271b54cc3a010a58b42e7f3.jpg"},{"name":"Swamp Liberated","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2272850/847f773981b69736c764af5c2261f53abe57a784.jpg"}],"total":9},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2272850/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1718309076","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2272850/page.bg.jpg?t=1718309076","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2272850/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718309076","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2272850/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718309076","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Join Our Discord For Beta Testing, New Content, Soundtrack Downloads, And More!<br><br><br><br><strong>Slay the cat population!</strong> Cats kill over 2 billion birds a year and it's time to strike back.<br><br>Kill kitties, kill creatures, get loot, fly around, find weapons, play with your friends, explore our unique open world, free imprisoned birds, craft weapons, play as multiple bird types, lay eggs, create a base, and build a bird army.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2272850/extras/early_game_fight_maximum_depth.gif?t=1718309076\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Make your friends join this revenge story</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>All networking is handled by us, no need for port forwarding or internet to Lan services!</li></ul><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2272850/extras/070teleport_demonstration.gif?t=1718309076\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore the many different biomes on your rampage</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Forests, Desert, Swamp, Jungle, Arctic</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2272850/extras/biome_examples.gif?t=1718309076\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Enact advanced weaponry!</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>We intentionally make each weapon type unique</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2272850/extras/frog_example.gif?t=1718309076\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Free your bird brethren, have them fight with you!</h2><strong>YOU RESPAWN AS THEM</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Them kitties guard these cages, and you need them!
