With an interactive environment full of hidden details for the players to find. <br><br>Features:<br>It's a short game which will take about 1.5-2 hours to complete. <br>It's a 'walking simulator' genre but there's interacting with the environment and talking with characters.<br>Gameplay doesn't contain any jumpscares, and it's close to realism so it contains triggers like;<br>arachnophobia, family trauma, claustrophobia, scopophobia, cleithrophobia<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2797160/extras/COF_Gif_Steam_page.gif?t=1716648044\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2797160/extras/Story.png?t=1716648044\" /><br><br>Your neighbours are asking if you could take care of their son while they're out of town, great way to earn a few bucks.
