{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>The 13th Floor</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Step into the shoes of a weary security guard trying to end your shift in a massive office building. The elevators seem to have a peculiar system, and descending to the ground floor is far from simple.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">To make your way down, you must traverse each floor on foot, moving between two elevators. If you encounter irregularities or anomalies, you\u2019ll need to return to the first elevator to reset the system. However, if all appears normal, you can proceed to the next elevator and descend another floor.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This project is my debut as an <strong><i><u>indie developer</u></i></strong>, crafted with passion and attention to detail. <strong><i>The 13th Floor</i></strong> offers a unique exploration experience, challenging your perception and observation skills. Navigate intricate office layouts, uncover subtle details, and immerse yourself in the quiet mystery of this modern maze.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3420680/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737673213","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3420680/page.bg.jpg?t=1737673213","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3420680/12e79d58b05e0e6212d591dc8f3eebe58910c752/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737673213","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3420680/12e79d58b05e0e6212d591dc8f3eebe58910c752/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737673213","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>The 13th Floor</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Step into the shoes of a weary security guard trying to end your shift in a massive office building.
