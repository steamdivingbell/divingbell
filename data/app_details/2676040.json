{"about_the_game":"In a time of peace and prosperity, under the radiant skies of Miralis Island, life flourished in the port city of the same name and its surrounding countryside. The island, known for its flourishing gold veins and fertile soil, gained fame and fortune from brisk trade and the eager gold seekers who flocked to the mines to find their fortune.<br><br>The arrival of ships from distant lands was the order of the day, full of adventurers, traders and fortune seekers attracted by the rumours of the island's wealth. The city pulsed with life, the docks a hive of activity, the markets alive with bargaining and the sound of gold coins filling the air.<br><br>But as the sun shone over Miralis and the island rested in prosperity, quiet questions arose.

What would happen when the golden era ended and the island faced its true trials? These times of uncertainty would shape the destiny of Miralis forever.<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br>Combat options: Use melee and ranged combat with one hand, two hands, bow, crossbow and powerful magic.<br>Living world: Immerse yourself in a world inhabited by over 150 unique NPCs.<br>Challenging enemies: Face over 25 different monsters that will test your combat skills.<br>Realistic simulation: Experience a living game world where NPCs have their own daily routines and routines, deepening immersion.<br>Varied quests: Explore more than 50 varied quests that evolve according to your choices for long-lasting gameplay.<br>Impressive gameplay: Enjoy 10-15 hours of gameplay in a small, yet detailed world to explore.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2676040/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731463697","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2676040/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1731463697","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2676040/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731463697","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2676040/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731463697","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In a time of peace and prosperity, under the radiant skies of Miralis Island, life flourished in the port city of the same name and its surrounding countryside.
