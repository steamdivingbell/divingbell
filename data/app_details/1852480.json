She told Circe that while many innocent lives were taken in Salem, there was such a thing as a witch. They would parade around in the skins of women and haunt entire towns. They would attract young girls to their side so that when their costumes became too loose with age, they always had something new to slip into. Circe\u2019s grandmother told her that it was the job of the Elias family to find these witches and end them, snuff out every single one until there was nothing but rumor and ash left.  <br><br>And so, Circe grew into a fine hunter of witches, ripping them out of the skins of their victims and setting them ablaze so they could return to hell. When the witches were gone, or at least in hiding, someone came to the Elias clan to ask them to join a new cause. While the terror was being controlled in New York, Louisiana\u2019s plague was reaching a fever pitch and they needed an Elias for the cause. Her sense of duty and pride in the family name compelled Circe to head to New Orleans and join the Hunt thinking she would be back quickly and praying that her family would be safe until she returned. <br><br>For three months Circe Elias took a Berthier improved with the trophies of witches into the bayou and hunted a new type of monster. For three months she wrote back home to check on her family and tell them of all the sights she\u2019d seen. She wrote of the apothecary she visited everyday with old women who would fill her kit with salves and bandages. And most importantly, she wrote that soon she would be coming back home to bring her little sister Thula to New Orleans. Though the witches had disappeared, this new threat was just as important, and the swamps were the perfect place to train.  <br><br>When Circe finally arrived back home in Salem, she learned an awful truth: The Witches had not disappeared and, worse yet, they had come to her family for revenge. She rushed in only to see the pieces of her mother, father, and brothers. Thula was the only one left, barely alive and skin all gone. Thula only had enough life left to return the Nagant Circe had given her to protect herself and to warn her older sister. The last of the witches had taken Thula\u2019s skin and gone to Louisiana to find Circe.  <br><br>As Thula took her last breath Circe decided: She\u2019d go back to New Orleans to stay. She\u2019ll continue to hunt the new monsters and wait for the old ones to show up in her sister\u2019s skin. Then she\u2019ll show them pain so unimaginable that her family will smile down at her from heaven.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1852480/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1723708834","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1852480/page.bg.jpg?t=1723708834","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1852480/09bafb5a7b7f147a5decf548b7cbee82be8e4b26/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1723708834","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1852480/09bafb5a7b7f147a5decf548b7cbee82be8e4b26/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1723708834","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Remote Play on Tablet","id":42},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"DLC weapons"},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"This DLC contains one Hunter, two Weapons, and one Tool:<br><br>- The Witch Hunter (Hunter)<br>- Witch Trial (Berthier 1892 Deadeye)<br>- Sister's Keeper (Officer)<br>- Rooted Apothecary (First Aid Kit)<br><br><strong><u>The Witch Hunter</u></strong><br><br>Descended from a long line of witch hunters, Circe Elias was raised ready to fight the unknown.
