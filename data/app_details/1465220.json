Let's live through medieval history with us once again.  Take the rule of the lone hillfort of the 8th century with just few villagers and expand it through the ages up to the prospering empire, which will conquer the enemies along with strong allies.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1465220/extras/TX-SKIRMISH.png?t=1725272687\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1465220/extras/BATTLE1.gif?t=1725272687\" /><br>Skirmish is a basic game mode for singleplayer and multiplayer as well. The player starts in the dark age of the medieval (7th century), with hillfort and a few villagers to start collecting resources, build structures and train units. By researching new technologies, players can progress over centuries, evolve hillfort into a castle and surrounding town into a fortified city. The main target is the same for everyone - capture the enemy castle, so make sure enemies will not be faster.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1465220/extras/TX-CAMPAIGN.png?t=1725272687\" /><br>Magna Regna will feature campaigns designed to introduce new players into the game, and to enjoy it thanks to rich story background including historical battles and great stories of the past.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1465220/extras/TX-T-TREE.png?t=1725272687\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1465220/extras/TechTreeX.gif?t=1725272687\" /><br>Standard gameplay is divided into three ages - dark age, golden age and late medieval. Every research adds up towards the advancement to the next era. Once you advance to the next age, all unresearched technology from the previous one is locked and new ones from the next era become available. The technology available in game is divided into three distinct categories: <ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Politics</strong> - During the game it is up to you to decide who will seize the throne and provide you with his/her bonuses. But be aware that choosing one results in locking his/her rival.<br></li><li> <strong>Economy</strong> - Economy tech tree helps to increase yields of resources and town utilities. Economy points are gathered via obtaining resources and little over time.<br></li><li> <strong>Warfare</strong> - Unlocks new units, makes them stronger and better trained. Warfare points are gathered via fighting enemies and little over time.</li></ul> <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1465220/extras/TX-STRATEGY.png?t=1725272687\" /><br>This is our main motto while developing the game. We want players to be good and enjoy the game without breaking their mouse and twisting their wrists, and the game reflects that. Features like mass unit training and research planning save you some clicks, while population limit prevents you from being overwhelmed by just trying to keep your units alive. All this allows you to spend less time on ordinary city-running tasks and focus more on developing a match-winning strategy.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1465220/extras/TX-M-EDIT.png?t=1725272687\" /><br>The game includes a complex, yet easy to use map editor that can be used by anyone wanting to create their own maps. Integration with Steam Workshop allows players to easily share their creations across the player base and receive precious feedback.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1465220/extras/TX-HISTORY.png?t=1725272687\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1465220/extras/CASTLE.gif?t=1725272687\" /><br>We value historical accuracy of Magna Regna, and want to keep it that way as much as the gameplay allows us. In many cases, the way things worked in the medieval ages works surprisingly well in our game too and that brings many interesting possibilities into it.<br>The first nation introduced in Magna Regna is Grand Moravia, predecessor of today's Bohemia, our homeland. So make us proud of our history, take the rule of little hillfort in the heart of Europe in the medieval dark age and lead it through eras, conquering your enemies and developing your nation up to the glorious empire of knights in shiny armors and first firearms.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1465220/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725272687","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1465220/page.bg.jpg?t=1725272687","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1465220/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725272687","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1465220/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725272687","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1465220/extras/GIF-MR-1A.gif?t=1725272687\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1465220/extras/TX-MR.png?t=1725272687\" /><br>We join the revival of classic real-time-strategy genre.
