A very complete package! Great concept, great execution, great sense of humor, great fun! Im really impressed with how it all came together. I think that's one of the hardest and most impressive things you can do in games (or any medium) is when everything fits together so well. The combination of Fruit Ninja + serving was really clever. And the way you get different items from slashing different parts of the body was great. And it was so intuitive which customers would want which item (Vampire = blood from the neck, zombies = brain from the head, and my favorite was the Krasue who wants poop lol). And the final twist of different levels of decay added more challenge without making the game more complex to understand. Everything was very intuitive. I think if you spend some more time polishing the game you could have a small hit on your hands! Really impressive work! I hope you all keep making games together!\u201d<br>Art-eater<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3303910/ss_3f2839549f57029e0fe200b80aa68780702f73ef.1920x1080.jpg?t=1735368274","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3303910/ss_3f2839549f57029e0fe200b80aa68780702f73ef.600x338.jpg?t=1735368274"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3303910/ss_e99c9e28ebb07857e0927a7c5e4e7fa9dbce2192.1920x1080.jpg?t=1735368274","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3303910/ss_e99c9e28ebb07857e0927a7c5e4e7fa9dbce2192.600x338.jpg?t=1735368274"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3303910/ss_0022876c5cb9ac83f3bb2407319ce74edb5395b3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1735368274","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3303910/ss_0022876c5cb9ac83f3bb2407319ce74edb5395b3.600x338.jpg?t=1735368274"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3303910/ss_1bb1b72abf46b8dc7d17df0d9769244c2146c6c2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1735368274","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3303910/ss_1bb1b72abf46b8dc7d17df0d9769244c2146c6c2.600x338.jpg?t=1735368274"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3303910/ss_b6066cc4ec3de3fc758361ca673ef871a4b9a2b8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1735368274","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3303910/ss_b6066cc4ec3de3fc758361ca673ef871a4b9a2b8.600x338.jpg?t=1735368274"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3303910/ss_b0aeaa823d9940e391d1346d69ceeb1c0b681740.1920x1080.jpg?t=1735368274","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3303910/ss_b0aeaa823d9940e391d1346d69ceeb1c0b681740.600x338.jpg?t=1735368274"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3303910/ss_3fcfa836c4eaa82552e15a78afd892e8983bc18c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1735368274","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3303910/ss_3fcfa836c4eaa82552e15a78afd892e8983bc18c.600x338.jpg?t=1735368274"}],"short_description":"Slice, Suffer, Serve! is a 2D slice-and-click game where you play as a chef, preparing dishes for ghost customers.
