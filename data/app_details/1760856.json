{"about_the_game":"Pixel Puzzles World War II, merging history with the definitive jigsaw puzzler on the PC platform.<br><br>German railway guns of World War II were colossal artillery pieces mounted on specially designed railway carriages, enabling them to be moved quickly and positioned strategically. These formidable weapons, such as the &quot;Big Bertha&quot; and the massive &quot;Dora&quot; gun, were employed for long-range bombardment of enemy targets, including fortified positions, cities, and infrastructure. Their immense firepower and range allowed the German military to engage targets that would have been otherwise difficult to reach with conventional artillery. While their use showcased Germany's engineering capabilities, the railway guns were resource-intensive and required significant logistical support, and their effectiveness was often limited due to their immobility during rapid advances.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PACK INFO:</h2><strong>Puzzle Count: </strong>15<br><strong>Total Piece Count: </strong>3,247<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PACK CONTENTS:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>15 CM Guns - x216<br></li><li>17 CM Gun - x216<br></li><li>20 CM Gun - x216<br></li><li>28 CM Gun - x96<br></li><li>28 CM in Action - x140<br></li><li>340 MM Gun Barrel - x330<br></li><li>Captured 27 - x425<br></li><li>Captured 28 - x330<br></li><li>Soldiers walk on the barrel of a captured gun - x140<br></li><li>Firing over the Channel - x140<br></li><li>Krupp 28 - x140<br></li><li>Schwere Bruno firing - x216<br></li><li>Schwere Bruno - x330<br></li><li>28 CM Gun in Crimea - x216<br></li><li>28 CM Gun firing in Crimea - x96</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1760856/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1694757069","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1760856/page.bg.jpg?t=1694757069","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1760856/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1694757069","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1760856/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1694757069","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Pixel Puzzles World War II, merging history with the definitive jigsaw puzzler on the PC platform.<br><br>German railway guns of World War II were colossal artillery pieces mounted on specially designed railway carriages, enabling them to be moved quickly and positioned strategically.
