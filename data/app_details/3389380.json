{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The chase is as ON as it is CRAZY!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>MiniMo: Crazy Chase</strong> is an online, fast-paced, asymmetrical twist on the classic hide 'n seek formula for 1-5 players where players fulfill one of two different roles. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Either they are <strong>MONSTERS</strong>, <i>hiding</i> to avoid getting caught and<i> seeking</i> to collect all the keys before it's too late... or they play as <strong>THE ROBOT</strong>,<i> hiding</i> from NO ONE but<i> seeking</i> to chase and collect all of those puny, soon-to-be incarcerated monsters!\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">It's a party game through and through, inviting you to jumpscare your friends or steel your stealthy nerves in quick matches that last no longer than 2 minutes!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Over in a flash in more ways than one!</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The good news is you can see things in front of you. The bad news is, that's the ONLY thing you can see! All stages are shrouded in darkness, your flashlights the only weapon against this dim unknown. The monsters' flashlights are... functional at best. The robot, however, has a much cooler, more expensive robo-flashlight to make monster-chasin' easier!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If a monster flashes their lights on a key for some time, they collect it. But if a monster stays within the horrifyingly red light of the robot, it gets CAUGHT and put in monster-jail! If all keys are collected, the monsters win. If all monsters have been caught, the robot wins!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">But wait, isn't 4 vs 1 unfair?</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Well, unfair for whom? </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>When you play as the ROBOT...</strong>you, and you alone, get to be the sci-fi-horror-villain I always knew you could be, making the monsters sweat as they desperately try to avoid you. But you do have a few tricks up your, um, sleeve. Wait, do robots have sleeves?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">For one, the monsters are on the clock... you are NOT! If time runs out, you ALSO win!\u00a0 <br>Secondly, as the game progresses, and those monsters (hopefully and/or regrettably) collect more and more keys, your robot software unlocks hidden benefits.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>The monsters, though...\u00a0</strong>are slippery and, well, plural! Oh, and they have these awesome powers they'll try to use at the right time to (hopefully and/or regrettably) gain the upper hand. Wait, do monsters have upper hands?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Also, it's not over when caught. Fellow monsters may try to orchestrate a prison break just for you \u2013 working together and good communication are your keys to victory!
