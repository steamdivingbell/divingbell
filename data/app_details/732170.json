{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Treasury of the City</strong></h2><br><strong>Magic of Sewer, Street, and Throne!</strong><br><br>The city is a dangerous place, and adventurers daring to brave the urban jungle need the right equipment! Treasury of the City brings you three dozen brand-new magic items perfect for every part of the city, from the back alleys, sewers, and slums, to the halls of power and the smoke-filled back rooms where power brokers rule from the shadows. You\u2019ll find weapons and combat accessories like the toxic scabbard and forgetful sap alongside protective devices like cryptwarden\u2019s plate and the roofrunner\u2019s buckler. Delvers into the dank byways beneath the city will love ratty robes and the sewer suit, while those accustomed to high places will love the lecturer\u2019s staff, senator\u2019s stole, and the scale of endless bureaucracy! Criminals will find handy devices like pilferer\u2019s gloves and the cheater\u2019s hat, while officers of the law wield the mark of the authority, nightwatch crossbow, and the inspector\u2019s bullhorn to bring them to justice! Wherever your heroes venture in adventures of urban intrigue, they\u2019ll find the perfect tools to take down treacherous advisers and bring justice to the streets.
