But most importantly, be ready for tough challenges that require smart decisions. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Time control</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Ever wish you could press CTRL+Z in a game?</strong> In Ricave, you can! Rewind time at will to correct mistakes or misclicks. Ricave is entirely deterministic: rewinding and making the same move again will yield the same result - no &quot;cheesing&quot; RNG to roll higher damage. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Permadeath and progression</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Many roguelikes are challenging and so is Ricave.</strong> While permadeath usually means starting over when you die, Ricave lets you progress across runs by completing quests, leveling up your character, finding permanent items, and advancing the storyline. You'll also gain access to a lobby area where you can buy and personalize a private room with trophies collected from your dungeon adventures. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Health tracking</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A missing leg slows you down, damaged eyes cause blindness, and missing arms limit item interaction. Enemies follow these same rules, so use this to your advantage in combat! You can also suffer from illnesses, bleeding wounds, broken bones, starvation, and more. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unique items</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A potion can heal or harm you, boost your strength or induce weakness, intoxicate or speed you up, act as deadly poison, restore mana, and more. A scroll can make you levitate, teleport you randomly, summon a deadly creature, enhance your vision, rewind time, remove a curse, or inflict conditions like freezing, blindness, and burning. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Moddable</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Ricave's code is structured to simplify modding as much as possible. You are welcome to expand the game with your own content and share your creations with the community. The game includes an in-game mod manager. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Speedrun friendly</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Ricave features a zero-lag, unintrusive movement input system, ideal for players aiming to master their skills and complete the game quickly. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">User-friendly interface</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Roguelikes can be challenging, and going 3D adds even more complexity. Ricave addresses this with a clean, simple, and intuitive interface. High-contrast, stylized graphics will help you quickly understand your surroundings and let you focus on making strategic gameplay decisions. An in-game tutorial is also included to guide new players.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2358360/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737073885","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2358360/page.bg.jpg?t=1737073885","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2358360/045d2b5ea8dd1ab28d2757e5a17d2edc707d4453/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737073885","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2358360/045d2b5ea8dd1ab28d2757e5a17d2edc707d4453/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737073885","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3293980,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2358360/extras/anim1.gif?t=1737073885\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Ricave</strong> is a turn-based, first-person, 3D roguelike featuring procedurally generated dungeons, grid-based movement, time control mechanics, and a user-friendly interface.
