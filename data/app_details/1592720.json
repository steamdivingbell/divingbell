You work in a team with two to four players and an angry garbage truck driver. Your job is to empty garbage cans and containers. Sadly, your contract doesn't state what kind of work you are required to do, so your boss loads you with all kinds of extra tasks, including firefighting and forest work. Naturally you are completely understaffed, and your short-tempered driver has no intention of stopping the truck to wait for you, just because you couldn't empty all the garbage cans while extinguishing a raging wildfire. Luckily, there are heaps of powerups that help you with all those tasks, so your stress level won't reach dangerous heights... Or so you thought! Due to an accident in your bosses DIY time reverting device, you travel back into medieval times with seemingly no way to return and to make matters worse, your contract states that you are still required to work! So better get yourself a sword because the town is in the middle of a siege! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1592720/extras/Timetravel.jpg?t=1734616299\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Garbage Crew! is a roguelike, action, couch-coop game, where, to archive victory, you and your team must make a fight plan on how to coordinate your operation to complete all incentives and make it to the level goal in time.
