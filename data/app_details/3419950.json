{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A Very Merry Nightmare is a 3D First-Person game made in Unreal Engine. The story follows a young boy named Oliver on Christmas Eve who follows a mysterious doll to another world full of Christmas decorations, however, things are not as wonderful as they seem. Oliver must then figure out how to make it back home before it is too late.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Some features include an AI enemy that can both watch the player from a distance and chase the player when prompted. An interact system with objects like drawers, cabinets, and doors. Players can also eat the various sweets in the world and  find hidden notes left throughout the environment.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game was my Senior Project for my major and was made in 16 weeks. It was also my first project in Unreal Engine. I am open to feedback and will have a place for submissions of any issues you might have. I will be taking all feedback into account and am open to adding more to the game in the future. I truly hope you all enjoy this game and I look forward to your feedback!</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3419950/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737665352","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3419950/page.bg.jpg?t=1737665352","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3419950/27d73f8508795a45c7f77abd321d791ae84cece1/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737665352","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3419950/27d73f8508795a45c7f77abd321d791ae84cece1/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737665352","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A Very Merry Nightmare is a 3D First-Person game made in Unreal Engine.
