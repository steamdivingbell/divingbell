The architecture of the ruins feels very alien and ancient, and the sound design and voice over are excellent. You get the feeling that you\u2019re trespassing in a place that was never meant to be seen with human eyes. Highly recommended.\u201d<br>Alpha Beta Gamer<br><br>\u201cThat was incredible. I loved how it\u2019s driven by your curiosity. It understood that Lovecraftian horror isn\u2019t about creatures with tentacles coming out of their face, it\u2019s about the fear of knowledge. Knowledge that fundamentally changes our entire perception of reality and our place in it in a way that completely shatters our mind once we make this revelation.\u201d<br>The Librarian<br><br>\u201cThis is awesome. And definetily one of the best adaptations of a Lovecraft story into a game.
