{"about_the_game":"Embark on a crazy bizarre journey of discovery and conflict -through dreams, and nightmares - in Dreamlander!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExperience a fusion of retro game genres while unfolding the lore of a faded world and trying to restore order across a conquered kingdom. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nExplore different worlds, meet memorable characters, and unravel haunting truths as you make your way through the adventure. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTake control of your dreams and nightmares, meet your maker, and decide the fate of a multiverse!  What more can you ask for?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNote from the creator: <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI really hope you will enjoy Dreamlander. This is, essentially, my retro-game-inspired labor of love. I've been working on this game for nearly 8 years now, and a lot has happened along the way. I've faced several challenges since starting, lost people I loved, and have grown much as an individual. Because of this the game has faced several delays, been changed, and even restarted and rewritten multiple times. I expect Dreamlander to take another year or two to reach completion. My only hope is that when completed, Dreamlander will bring some people as much joy as the games I played as a child brought me. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThanks for checking out my game.<br />\r\nBrad Donohoo","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1225730/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726804616","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1225730/page.bg.jpg?t=1726804616","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1225730/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726804616","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1225730/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726804616","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Embark on a crazy bizarre journey of discovery and conflict -through dreams, and nightmares - in Dreamlander!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExperience a fusion of retro game genres while unfolding the lore of a faded world and trying to restore order across a conquered kingdom. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nExplore different worlds, meet memorable characters, and unravel haunting truths as you make your way through the adventure. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTake control of your dreams and nightmares, meet your maker, and decide the fate of a multiverse!
