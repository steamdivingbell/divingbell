{"about_the_game":"My grandmother was originally from the village, but after the environmental disaster that occurred 30 years ago near their settlement, she moved to our city and lived with us. A year ago she passed away, and the heir to the house in the village was me.

They told me that when I am there, they will call me and tell me what I will need to take to the house, I do not know why they arrange such a mystery and did not say right away what they needed there. They handed me a picture of my grandmother's house and I was hastily escorted out the door and I went on my own adventures, which actually I didn't need.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGhost Village is a fascinating game in which you have to go through a lot of quests.
