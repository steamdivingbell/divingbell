{"about_the_game":"Tafl PTK (Protect the King) is a squad formation auto battler where you play an escaping king. Just like in the classic Viking game Tafl you will be escaping to the corners to win. However, you will be facing waves of enemies as they spawn into the map. The brave squad that you have put together will try their best to stay in the formation specified as they bare the brunt of hordes of enemies and random events. Controllers will be needed for co-op.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2719820/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1709218217","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2719820/page.bg.jpg?t=1709218217","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2719820/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1709218217","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2719820/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1709218217","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2834230,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Tafl PTK (Protect the King) is a squad formation auto battler where you play an escaping king.
