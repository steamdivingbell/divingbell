With its retro 90's-era interface and optional VHS camera effects, this game offers a unique and nostalgic experience for fans of classic tornado videos.<br><br>As you hunt down tornadoes across a realistic recreation of a real-world location in tornado alley, you'll have access to vintage equipment, including scientific probes and doppler radar, to help you track and intercept these powerful storms. Your mission is to collect valuable scientific data from the tornadoes, but don't let the old-school tech fool you - this game is all about fast-paced action and nonstop excitement. You won't have a moment to spare as you navigate treacherous terrain and engage in rescue missions to warn people caught in the path of the storm.<br><br>Selling collected data will earn you money that you can use to upgrade your vehicle, probe, radar and camera. With procedurally generated tornadoes, towns and destruction, no two chases are the same. So rev up your storm-chasing vehicle and get ready for the chase of your life with &quot;Tornado: Research and Rescue.&quot;","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Collected 50x F1 Samples","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2250550/c820ebd9bee5e65501c363a83dea8b57927a1b1a.jpg"},{"name":"Collected 100x F1 Samples","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2250550/15a183c27fb0d83e9653dad9e5866b4066c63745.jpg"},{"name":"Collected 200x F1 Samples","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2250550/0d51a73c2393adf27ce8e8e7d7ebd374beef3088.jpg"},{"name":"Collected 300x F1 Samples","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2250550/f97ac1d67c8ccef27538816b8222248207f6a8b7.jpg"},{"name":"Collected 500x F1 Samples","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2250550/bc89b156ae3df984038b16c751757133077189c9.jpg"},{"name":"Collected 1000x F1 Samples","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2250550/dad24ee93462873608eca35b9712bec8825e8e71.jpg"},{"name":"Collected 50x F2 Samples","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2250550/905a825a4b26ef7217f3d06322a769fb487b0fce.jpg"},{"name":"Collected 100x F2 Samples","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2250550/dff34a3818c997dafca59397018ae5a1c2b9bd46.jpg"},{"name":"Collected 200x F2 Samples","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2250550/600ca7f53048def4cd36ef5654fa9b8bb4b0c493.jpg"},{"name":"Collected 300x F2 Samples","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2250550/3918aae39c2fcda42c50b4fa4f09435bad43cdfc.jpg"}],"total":30},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2250550/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1692109481","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2250550/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1692109481","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2250550/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1692109481","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2250550/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1692109481","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2250550/extras/deploy_probes.gif?t=1692109481\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2250550/extras/warn_towns_collect_data.gif?t=1692109481\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2250550/extras/save_lives.gif?t=1692109481\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2250550/extras/record_footage.gif?t=1692109481\" /><br><br>&quot;Tornado: Research and Rescue&quot; is an action-packed simulation game that takes you back to the glory days of storm chasing in the 1990s, reminiscent of a popular movie from the era.
