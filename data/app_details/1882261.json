{"about_the_game":"Following your quest in the sewers beneath, you and your party are recovering with Waterdeep\u2019s finest healers, when a letter arrives from Khelben Blackstaff, mystic advisor to the Lords of Waterdeep. Trouble is brewing in the Northern and Western regions, and he has tasked you with exploring the land and investigating these incidents. Although nothing has been confirmed, renowned but troublesome archaeologist, Wently Kelso believes the disturbances are related to an evil uprising and the presence of a powerful ancient artefact. These troubles could, of course, simply be the work of unruly bandits, but since Kelso\u2019s previous findings in the sewers of Waterdeep proved true, one would be wise not to easily dismiss his opinion on the matter. Therefore, you should exercise greater care and vigilance as you begin your next adventure.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1882261/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1648566411","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1882261/page.bg.jpg?t=1648566411","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1882261/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1648566411","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1882261/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1648566411","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Following your quest in the sewers beneath, you and your party are recovering with Waterdeep\u2019s finest healers, when a letter arrives from Khelben Blackstaff, mystic advisor to the Lords of Waterdeep.
