{"about_the_game":"A medieval styled Dungeon crawler with an extraction mechanic and incoming zone, the Combat is Physics based and allows you to dismember your enemy's or pick up they're body's and use them as shields or throw them as some kind of weapon, everything can be picked up with enough stat-points invested into strength, but it can also be damaged and/or destroyed when hit with something that's attack is higher then its defense. When your Speed-stats are higher then your opponents in Pve or PvP they get slowed down a little to simulate the difference in your movement speed, which will not that overpowered as it sounds but a very interesting to experience. The shop-system allows Players to set buy or sell orders for specific items and watch they-re price hystorie, in the PvP Arena players can bet in game money, items or they're inventory on themselves or other players or fight just for fun without losing something. After each round you will be able to enter a village where the PvP arena is located and also some NPCs that trade or give Quests, also you will be able buy a plot and design a house and interior with the trophy's of your adventures. Crafting materials will come from the dungeon and allow you to level your crafting skill the craft even better weapons and armor.  some basics like fish, wood or vegetables will also be harvest-able in the village by fishing, farming or wood cutting, however, the best resources will come from the most dangerous places and bosses, which are balanced based on they're unique attack patterns and mechanics. The village is placed on an Island, together with an castle and a forest, future updates will maybe allow access to more islands which will be filled with unique enemy's and resources, and deadly Boss-fights with new interesting attack patters and mechanics.  System requirements will be much lower when the game gets published, it will get a mode with potato graphics, graphics setting &quot;potato&quot; will be available at launch :)","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2783550/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735064718","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2783550/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1735064718","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2783550/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735064718","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2783550/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735064718","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A medieval styled Dungeon crawler with an extraction mechanic and incoming zone, the Combat is Physics based and allows you to dismember your enemy's or pick up they're body's and use them as shields or throw them as some kind of weapon, everything can be picked up with enough stat-points invested into strength, but it can also be damaged and/or destroyed when hit with something that's attack is higher then its defense.
