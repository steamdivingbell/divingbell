{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is a classic match-3 puzzle game where the primary elements are colorful and uniquely shaped blocks. The game boasts a fresh and bright visual style, with multicolored blocks appearing in various shapes on the screen, offering a feast for the eyes. Players use the mouse to click and drag blocks, connecting them with other blocks of the same color. When three or more are lined up, they disappear. This straightforward and intuitive gameplay makes the game easy to pick up yet highly engaging. As players progress through the levels, the challenge gradually increases, requiring more strategic thinking to clear each stage. The background music is light and cheerful, providing a pleasant environment for players to relax and exercise their minds.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3396320/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735129680","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3396320/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1735129680","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3396320/48634db6bfa94a8ca35ab485b34e6d37ef565728/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735129680","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3396320/48634db6bfa94a8ca35ab485b34e6d37ef565728/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735129680","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is a classic match-3 puzzle game where the primary elements are colorful and uniquely shaped blocks.
