It's time to search inside the houses and look for clues. May it be related to the cult that's threatening the folk around the area? Every house has a gate near it, and those gates were locked.

It is not a relaxing experience but slightly thrilling in a couple of moments.<br><br>In the game you search for clues inside houses and some other locations about where your daughter may have been to. You find notes, drawings, interact with some characters, and observe the environmental story-telling. There are some small puzzles, some objects &amp; clues you'll have to find, a little bit of casual platforming, a very easy QTE part...
