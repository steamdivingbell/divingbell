Use an arsenal of plastic limbs, wonky tools, rainbow stickers and googly eyes to assemble creations, please demanding clients, and laugh in the face of perfectionism.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Make a thing!</h2>Glue mannequin limbs to robo-parts. Draw on a smiley face. Slap on a few stick-on tattoos to finish it off. Oh, did we mention there's <strong>NO </strong>Undo button? Time to roll with the punches!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Make a living!</h2>Fulfill wacky client requests however you can. From six-armed action figures, to fancy meals served from a toilet seat - any request is (unfortunately) possible. Explore their world and defeat your ultimate enemies: perfectionism and good taste.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fend off haters!</h2>Flying tomatoes, rabid hammers, electrifying eels... Fend off foes in time or ignore them and see what &quot;statement&quot; they leave on your precious thing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Upgrade your toolbox!</h2>Collect cash for your creations and re-invest it in supplies, tools and workshop upgrades. Expand your inventory or risk ending up making yet another armless Venus de Thingy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Couch Collab!</h2>Test the limits of your relationships by playing any challenge in 2-player couch co-op mode. Lower your expectations now: you two will be making some butt-ugly things.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Share your creations! </h2>Use the built-in video recorder to share your creations with friends, foes, and the world wide web.","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1903070/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1645461202","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1903070/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1645461202","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1903070/extras/about-discord.png?t=1645461202\" /><br>A hero thing, a monster thing, a robo thing\u2026 in Mini Maker, you can make any \u2018thing\u2019!
