You will explore through the ruined remains of planets, teleporting between spaceships, satellites, and colonies, all slowly being digested by the great beast.<br><br>All good platformers must feel great, they need to feel responsive and intuitive. The movement must feel deliberate, with full control being granted to the player. This is the core ethos of Cosmic Worm Food, and it achieves that with tight air control, wall jumping, wall sliding, and consistent, reliable physics.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2334940/extras/jumping_puzzle.gif?t=1679414166\" /><br><br>On their journey, the player will encounter a variety of different monsters, all with unique mechanics and combinations to offer their own challenge for the player to take on.

Some upgrades may be exclusive and can lock other upgrades from being chosen, so choose wisely! None of the upgrades take your fancy?
