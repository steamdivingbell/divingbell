{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>No Alibi</strong>\u00a0is an online co-op top-down heist shooter with roguelike elements. Sneak around without being seen, take hostages, or go in guns blazing - the choice is yours. Use the money to buy an array of customizable guns, from small pistols to massive miniguns and sentry turrets. Add attachments to your guns at the weapons workbench - but keep in mind, the more you invest in your equipment, the more you'll lose if you don't make it out.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your group starts off as a small criminal concern, robbing banks and jewelry stores, but you'll soon find yourself taking massive scores on some high-risk targets. The man you answer to is difficult to keep happy, and if you can't provide, it's game over. The relentless action will keep you on your toes, so make sure you come well-equipped. You'll never truly be ready.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3266730/extras/description-image.png?t=1739212503\" />Game Features</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You begin your run with an SMG, a baseball bat, and a drill. Your party of up to 4 players has the choice of 3 heists, randomly selected each day from 15 total. The goal is to get as much money as possible, and get out without getting killed. Every 3 days, you must meet a quota set by the boss, or your run ends. Use your earnings to buy and upgrade a variety of equipment, including guns, grenades, melee weapons, drills, landmines, and more. If you meet your quota, you can choose a permanent upgrade such as extra health or equipment slots. As you complete higher and higher quotas, the heists available become more and more difficult.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>No Alibi</strong>\u00a0includes a tutorial, support for public or private lobbies, optional voice chat, full controller support, and a number of accessibility options. Each heist has a different set of features, including cash registers, safes you must drill into, armored trucks, and security cameras to disarm. You will go toe-to-toe with a variety of enemies, from auto pistol-wielding mobsters to RPG-firing law enforcement.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Wishlist<strong> No Alibi</strong>\u00a0today!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3266730/extras/No_Alibi_gif_2.gif?t=1739212503\" /></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3266730/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1739212503","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3266730/page.bg.jpg?t=1739212503","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3266730/6751552a797291d4b5b2688e699d716eec956c30/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739212503","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3266730/6751552a797291d4b5b2688e699d716eec956c30/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739212503","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Pixel art violence, blood, and corpses."},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":3481960,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>No Alibi</strong>\u00a0is an online co-op top-down heist shooter with roguelike elements.
