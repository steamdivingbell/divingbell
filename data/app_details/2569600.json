{"about_the_game":"Be Like a Bee: Fly, Collect, and Attack in a Buzzing Journey through the Undiscovered Valleys!<br>Embark on an adventurous journey through the world of valleys in Bee in The Valley! Discover wild, forest, and mountain valleys, filled with unexpected fun moments and exciting challenges.<br><br>Your goal as a bee is to explore these unknown valleys, searching for flowers and collecting nectar to make honey in the hive. But don't be fooled, it's not as easy as it seems. Learn to fly like a real bee in the characteristic zigzag style known as the 'Dance Bee'.<br><br>Each mission becomes more challenging, with increasing time pressure. Your time limit is determined by the honey percentage in the hive, and the pace of honey consumption accelerates with each mission.

Show your defensive skills and protect your home.<br><br>Remember, you can't discover more valleys alone. Expand your bee family and gain support from unique bee friends. Each bee has individual skills that contribute to your success:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Yellow Bee: Talented but not very hardworking.<br></li><li>Green Lady Bee: The youngest bee with lightning-fast wing flapping.<br></li><li>Orange Bee: Fluffy and fat, with a great appetite.<br></li><li>Blue Bee: A swift and agile flyer among bees.<br></li><li>Red Bee: Sharp as a needle, always hitting the mark.<br></li><li>The White Lady Bee: Miss Hive, the most beautiful bee who flies swiftly and collects ample nectar.</li></ul>Unleash your flying skills, overcome challenges, and become the ultimate bee in the valleys.
