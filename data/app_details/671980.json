{"about_the_game":"You wake up, not remembering what dream you had last night. What time is it? Does that matter? This is a simple exploration game. Or at least, that's what I'd like you to believe. Different people experience different things in their lives, and that's reflected in this game. Things come and go, fleeting moments that are easy to miss. What causes things to come into existence? Were they always there, or do they only exist once they're perceived? There's more to life than death. If you don't find anything, close me. You digging through my secrets is unpleasant to me.
