The ability to zoom in and out is nice and can be helpful to spot objects\u2026 If you manage to clear a stage super-fast, you\u2019ll be rewarded with three stars for that level and will receive a great numbers of points. If you find objects within a certain time limit (we are talking seconds here), points will multiply very quickly, which will give you a chance to show your name in the leader board section. So make sure to spot all the objects before you start your round.\u201d<br>zeepond<br><br>\u201cAnche il gameplay si discosta leggermente dai tradizionali giochi Hidden Objects, ed in questo caso possiamo dire in modo interessante. Alcuni degli oggetti sono mimetizzati davvero molto bene, e vi costringeranno ad usare tutti gli strumenti a disposizione, come lo zoom e la possibilit\u00e0 di spostare l\u2019immagine nelle 4 direzioni. Complessivamente, nonostante la quasi assenza di una trama, Time Trap potrebbe piacere agli appassionati del genere. Una colonna sonora piacevole da ascoltare accompagna la risoluzione di rompicapi un po' staccati tra loro, privi di linearit\u00e0, ma comunque stimolanti. Il punteggio ed un simil-multiplayer con classifiche giocatori invogliano a ripetere pi\u00f9 volte il singolo scenario anche a distanza di tempo, allungando il gameplay di qualche ora.\u201d<br>icrewplay<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/661040/ss_db2ac633980cc30b609702fbb1529b9e2fe2bc37.1920x1080.jpg?t=1701016840","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/661040/ss_db2ac633980cc30b609702fbb1529b9e2fe2bc37.600x338.jpg?t=1701016840"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/661040/ss_ed25b0b7b3c38f944241b95d717e373cee9701d4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1701016840","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/661040/ss_ed25b0b7b3c38f944241b95d717e373cee9701d4.600x338.jpg?t=1701016840"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/661040/ss_f5a4ea334dfb9fa6667bb370f5e6aac05f26f4d9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1701016840","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/661040/ss_f5a4ea334dfb9fa6667bb370f5e6aac05f26f4d9.600x338.jpg?t=1701016840"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/661040/ss_070039d0d2dcf712f15bd32a5de348de077a6dc2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1701016840","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/661040/ss_070039d0d2dcf712f15bd32a5de348de077a6dc2.600x338.jpg?t=1701016840"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/661040/ss_1f3288e89540e51d349dc4edfa36de35fbfa463a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1701016840","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/661040/ss_1f3288e89540e51d349dc4edfa36de35fbfa463a.600x338.jpg?t=1701016840"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/661040/ss_ba783c8aab4153bc65e3a4bf046cadf44085f407.1920x1080.jpg?t=1701016840","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/661040/ss_ba783c8aab4153bc65e3a4bf046cadf44085f407.600x338.jpg?t=1701016840"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/661040/ss_d9ebf363b13c8fe067ebd547f7accbf38e28b2ed.1920x1080.jpg?t=1701016840","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/661040/ss_d9ebf363b13c8fe067ebd547f7accbf38e28b2ed.600x338.jpg?t=1701016840"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/661040/ss_026281413d554d0caaa19c10d7e4485de3cb5cda.1920x1080.jpg?t=1701016840","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/661040/ss_026281413d554d0caaa19c10d7e4485de3cb5cda.600x338.jpg?t=1701016840"}],"short_description":"Excellent Hidden Objects game!
