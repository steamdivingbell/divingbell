This is Conner.  I just wanted to briefly say thank you for checking out my game and an extra special thank you to anyone who's supported me in any way throughout the creation of it.  This is by far the most personal game I've ever made, and I think that'll be easy to see for anybody who plays through it.  Much of the process for making this game involved just trying a bunch of weird ideas, and I think that, in the end, it all came together really well.  No matter what, I'm proud of it, and I'm very happy to have made it.  I hope it can help you in the way that it's helped me.
