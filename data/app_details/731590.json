The enemies are nasty in all the right ways, the weapons are straight out of some forgotten b-movie and the music sounds like that nightmare sex room out the back of the Roadhouse bar in Twin Peaks... Genuinely, this feels both like a lost early 90s treasure and a real 2017 original\u201d<br>Rock Paper Shotgun<br><br>\u201cHere\u2019s an FPS with an interesting, albeit garish, retro sensibility... I think we can all agree that using a pentagram and crucifix as a reticule is insanely good and worth the price alone.\u201d<br>PC Gamer<br><br>\u201cIf you\u2019re a fan of the surreal, yet hilarious, Machete films by Robert Rodriguez, you\u2019ll love Midnight Ultra\u2019s beautiful grindhouse art style.
