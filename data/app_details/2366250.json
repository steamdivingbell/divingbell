{"about_the_game":"American Airport Simulator takes us back to the early 90-ties. We are near the ski resort in Aspen, where a special task awaits us. We have to renovate an old military base and create an airport for small planes out of it - and later turn it into an international airport.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Renovate and Develop</h2>Your investor demands rapid progress, but leaves key decisions to you. Demolish walls and add new ones. Pick out decorations and paint the walls your favorite color. Put up modern hangars and create an airplane gas station. However, the most important thing is servicing planes and passengers - the faster they show up, the more money you'll make.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Create and Maintain</h2>You need specialized vehicles to work at the airport. You'll have to fiddle around a bit at first, but a welder in hand can work wonders. A tank with an arm from an excavator? Why not! You will replace each tool with better and faster ones over time. You will replace an ordinary hammer with a jackhammer, and an ordinary saw with a chain one.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2366250/extras/screen_6_850.jpg?t=1734519454\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hire Employees</h2>Your investor requires a quick return on investment, so you need to keep growing the business. Hire employees and assign them the most annoying tasks. Add new services to earn even more!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Keep an Eye on your Guests</h2>Many people pass through your airport. Some are understanding, others are demanding and grouchy. You need to take care of the needs of each of them. If they are satisfied with your services, they will return with their friends. However, have eyes around your head! That nice old lady with a dog in her bag may be a weapons smuggler.

Rent part of the area to a film crew and organize various events (how about air shows?). Each of these activities will promote the airport and allow you to develop your passions.
