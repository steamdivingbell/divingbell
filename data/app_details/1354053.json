Pikes Peak? Humbled. The 'Ring? Conquered. Goodwood? Outright record. Then VW made it even faster with this evolution, the 2020 Volkswagen ID.R that blistered everything anyone thought possible at the Bilster Berg. Developed as an uncompromising and lightweight prototype with immense downforce, this represents the first fully electric racecar for the VW brand.

In a word: speed. Innovation starts with the cockpit where the driver\u2019s seat can be positioned in the centre to make it into a traditional \u201cmonoposto\u201d. The battery is positioned to give it a mid-\u201cengine\u201d feel, while aluminium, carbon, and multi-material composites bring the weight down to less than 1,550KGs ensuring handling and balance.

It holds world records for production cars on many tracks around the world including a stonking 6:45.90 around the \u2019Ring. That\u2019s what comes from 335hp on each wheel, 4WD (and individual-wheel drive for handling performance), advanced torque vectoring, and full carbon fibre chassis based on LMP regs. With a total weight of just 1,735KGs, this EV monster will get to 100kmh in 2.7s and 300kmh in 15s all the way to a top-end speed of 350kmh.
