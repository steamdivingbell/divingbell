{"about_the_game":"Buy a ticket and hop onboard the Duchess Gambit, as Tobar the Ferryman takes you to the strange seaside town of <strong>Point Lookout</strong>. What secrets does the dilapidated boardwalk hold? Who lives in the sprawling mansion? Why is the Punga Fruit so important? And what horrors lie in the depths of the murky swamp? <strong>Point Lookout</strong> is the most open-ended DLC yet, and allows you to explore an entirely new and expansive gameplay area any way you\u2019d like. A completely new quest line allows you uncover the town\u2019s hidden secrets, and wield powerful new weapons like the Double-Barrel Shotgun against the swamp\u2019s dangerous, and deformed, denizens. So venture to <strong>Point Lookout</strong>, if you dare. Just pray it\u2019s not a one-way trip.\n\t\t\t\t\t","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/22440/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1447353329","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/22440/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1447353329","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/22440/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1447353329","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/22440/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1447353329","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Buy a ticket and hop onboard the Duchess Gambit, as Tobar the Ferryman takes you to the strange seaside town of <strong>Point Lookout</strong>.
