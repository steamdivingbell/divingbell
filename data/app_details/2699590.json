{"about_the_game":"Cell Hacker is a game based on cellular automata.

The editor in the game will give you the information you need in real time during the writing process, so you can easily get started with it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u00b7 Your cells can interact with other players' cells in any way, whether through conquest, deception, parasitism, symbiosis, service, and cooperation. But be careful to confirm your neighbors' intentions, they won't always interact with you the way you expect.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u00b7 After placing cells into the cell world, they will automatically run 24/7 according to the logic you wrote, whether you are online or offline. You can come back and observe them any time you like.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u00b7 The game provides a variety of different cell worlds for you to choose from. Some worlds are stable and gentle, some are volatile, and some evolve at a faster rate so you can quickly test the cellular AI you write.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u00b7 This is a slow-paced game. The evolution of the cellular world is often measured in minutes, and the reproduction history of a species may last for several months. You can prepare a sumptuous dinner, get a good night's sleep, and come back the next day to observe what wonderful things your cells have prepared for you as if you were observing a real petri dish.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2699590/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1703600965","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2699590/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1703600965","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2699590/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1703600965","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2699590/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1703600965","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Cell Hacker is a game based on cellular automata.
