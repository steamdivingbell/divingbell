He will eventually have to make a difficult choice... <br><br>A love letter to the oceans, Under The Waves invites you to dive into a gorgeous underwater world, brought to life in a poetic blend of cinematic visuals and poignant storytelling. Live a gripping story through Stan\u2019s eyes and guide him through an unforeseen series of events that will bring him deeper and deeper into the abyss, the reflection of his own psyche. <br>Wander the vast seabed piloting Stan\u2019s submarine and encounter the beautiful wildlife, Stan\u2019s only company while he\u2019s trapped in his own mind. Explore caves, wrecks, and underwater plants with Stan\u2019s special wetsuit, following the mysterious manifestations of his memories, to find a way back to the surface and save his life.
