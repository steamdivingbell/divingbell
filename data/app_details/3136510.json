{"about_the_game":"Motor Tournament is an arcade racer with a story about an event called &quot;Motor Tournament&quot;.<br />\r\nThe game is set in the near future where people automatised everything and eventually got bored and left the planet, looking for additional resources and things to do elsewhere.<br />\r\nThe few who are left on the planet started organising races to help passing time, in these races all sorts of vehicles can participate, ranging from regular race cars to offroad trucks and other forms of motorised vehicles. Anything goes as long as it's exciting and creates a great show.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe tracks allow different types of vehicles to utilise their ups and downs, for example offroad vehicles can take different paths from regular race cars to utilize their offroad capabilities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDamage Model: Parts can be damaged and detached from the cars, this is mostly visual, as for now, it does not affect the performance of the vehicles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCo-op campaign. The game is designed so the campaign can be completed with up to 3 other players cooperatively.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMultiplayer: The game features a multiplayer where players can race against each other or the AI.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGamemodes: Currently there are 2 gamemodes planned, race and derby. In races the first one wins, in derbies the last one wins.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3136510/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725693727","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3136510/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1725693727","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3136510/041c376a3736ffcf20b9a51a8868009e28439db6/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725693727","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3136510/041c376a3736ffcf20b9a51a8868009e28439db6/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725693727","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Motor Tournament is an arcade racer with a story about an event called &quot;Motor Tournament&quot;.<br />\r\nThe game is set in the near future where people automatised everything and eventually got bored and left the planet, looking for additional resources and things to do elsewhere.<br />\r\nThe few who are left on the planet started organising races to help passing time, in these races all sorts of vehicles can participate, ranging from regular race cars to offroad trucks and other forms of motorised vehicles.
