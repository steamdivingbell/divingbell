{"about_the_game":"A game about a sloth named Larry. Larry mysteriously got to the island and tries to return home. The only way home is the ship, the helm of which was stolen by a huge monster. You have to defeat the keeper of the helm, but the task is extremely difficult. To begin with, it is worth buying equipment and pumping the skills of the protagonist. This will help us creeps. Lots of creeps. A lot of creeps.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>Kill various creeps to get gold. For gold, you pump a character by buying him equipment. When the character is ready for the boss fight, defeat the villain and get the opportunity to sail away from the island.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1152450/extras/h11.png?t=1593102571\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1152450/extras/Armor.gif?t=1593102571\" /><br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1152450/extras/h12.png?t=1593102571\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1152450/extras/Units.gif?t=1593102571\" /><br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1152450/extras/h13.png?t=1593102571\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1152450/extras/AttackShip1.gif?t=1593102571\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"THIS IS SPARTA!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1152450/e63a012fec163e62a722b712c13ba365f9012656.jpg"},{"name":"Red sloth","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1152450/662268ae665363c31621da44e1ba72615c889673.jpg"},{"name":"Ronin","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1152450/dd74e05642ad843dc02a39616ff7528dd336049f.jpg"},{"name":"Master Larry","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1152450/cb5e993dc65dd81ad3ce3565613314a3e1270c8a.jpg"},{"name":"Demonic power","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1152450/269bd7f87fc68e70677bf8b35000f722d0a988b2.jpg"},{"name":"Feel the power","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1152450/0842092e30b8e76ce175331c9504202c571057ce.jpg"},{"name":"Knightly duty","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1152450/014c6e521ebf819f707ef1fa4f9706bd890ab9eb.jpg"},{"name":"Dark side","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1152450/31d636802bab6f12eaa01d977de94f3b9a5b7e44.jpg"},{"name":"Buster Sword","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1152450/2de4bb4ee295952acd354a6a596693214e427672.jpg"},{"name":"King protector","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1152450/1b29f681dc0b05a9a5270313fd82af7de5dab015.jpg"}],"total":38},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1152450?t=1593102571","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1152450?t=1593102571","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1152450/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1593102571","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1152450/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1593102571","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A game about a sloth named Larry.
