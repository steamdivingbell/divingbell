{"about_the_game":"Outlandia is a sandbox survival game set in the near future, with special focuses on building structures, ecosystem management and exploration.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter growing increasingly distraught with your boring office-worker life, you decide to invest all of your savings in the purchase of a revolutionary device - a BLDNet drone. This mechanical companion allows you to 3D print a diverse range of structures wherever you are, so long as you have access to the raw material resources in its cloud storage system. With this device, you depart on a journey into one of the few remaining wild areas of the World - Northern British-Columbia, Canada. Do you have what it takes to not just survive, but construct a home base that is a luxurious getaway in the wilderness? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDecompress in the world of Outlandia, where each path is original and open-ended. With no questlines, you are forced to make every decision for yourself, and truly forge your own reality in the vast wilderness. Choose to live in a humble cabin in the woods, or construct a vast automation system that is capable of harnessing all the powers of the natural world - but be careful, as the ecosystem you call your new home is very sensitive to intruders. Will you be able to maintain a balanced ecosystem while you build your mind\u2019s creation, or will you be forced to suffer the consequences of a dangerous and changing climate?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1864400/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1696459794","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1864400/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1696459794","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1864400/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1696459794","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1864400/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1696459794","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Outlandia is a sandbox survival game set in the near future, with special focuses on building structures, ecosystem management and exploration.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter growing increasingly distraught with your boring office-worker life, you decide to invest all of your savings in the purchase of a revolutionary device - a BLDNet drone.
