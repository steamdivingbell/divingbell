The level is cleared when all the characters on the field are paired up.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each level has been designed with a focus on making the puzzle-solving experience enjoyable. Instead of simply increasing the number of similar levels to inflate the game's volume, we have adjusted the levels to ensure that each one offers a unique and engaging challenge.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">While the time it takes to clear all the levels may vary depending on the player, it is estimated that it will take around 10 hours to complete all levels.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Support for Various Genders</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">By default, the game pairs boys and girls together, but you can change this setting from the options menu to allow for same-gender pairings, such as boys with boys or girls with girls.
