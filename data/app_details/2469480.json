{"about_the_game":"&quot; <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">D&amp;D Lost Mine of Phandelver - Syrinscape Sound Link Pack</h2>Syrinscape Sound Link Packs for Fantasy Grounds work with your Syrinscape Super Syrin subscription to provide you context-specific sounds for monsters and NPCs in the D&amp;D Monster Manual.\u00a0 The collection of Sound Sets can be created for free within the Fantasy Grounds Unity sound interface, but this pack has done all the work for you to link the monsters and story elements as you play the adventure. Appropriate sounds from Syrinscape will show up in your Sound Context Window automatically when you access a story element or reference manual page, or when you add an encounter to the combat tracker.\u00a0  This pack include 145 sounds sets for story/reference manual pages, and important NPCs in the D&amp;D Lost Mine of Phandelver adventure module (not included) for moods, music, elements, and oneshots. These sound sets contain links to Syrinscape sounds only and this pack does not grant you access to any sounds you don't already own at Syrinscape. For the best experience, we recommend subscribing to the Super Syrin or the Dungeons &amp; Dragons subscription at Syrinscape to enable access to all sounds used in this sound link module.\u00a0&quot;","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2469480/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1686778859","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2469480/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1686778859","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2469480/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1686778859","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2469480/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1686778859","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot; <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">D&amp;D Lost Mine of Phandelver - Syrinscape Sound Link Pack</h2>Syrinscape Sound Link Packs for Fantasy Grounds work with your Syrinscape Super Syrin subscription to provide you context-specific sounds for monsters and NPCs in the D&amp;D Monster Manual.\u00a0 The collection of Sound Sets can be created for free within the Fantasy Grounds Unity sound interface, but this pack has done all the work for you to link the monsters and story elements as you play the adventure.
