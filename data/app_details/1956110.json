As graduates of Art and Technology, we aim not only to showcase our design achievements but also to convey our profound understanding and unique perspectives on this era. The theme of our graduation exhibition, &quot;Facing the Future, Creating the Future,&quot; is a response to the current Intelligent Revolution.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1956110/extras/HB5.jpg?t=1719845792\" /><br><br>The exhibition is divided into three major sections: Art and Intelligent Technology, Art and System Technology, Art and Display Technology. Through these sections, we delve into intelligent principles, material elements, and interactive experiences in the digital information realm, guided by artificial intelligence and big data. We conduct in-depth artistic experiments based on &quot;design humanities&quot; in the field of intelligent and systematic art. Our research goals focus on technological innovations and artistic creativity in intelligence and systems, encompassing areas such as intelligent services, system design, and digital information practices, paving the way for future integration of art and science.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1956110/extras/HB3.jpg?t=1719845792\" /><br><br>Amid the wave of the Intelligent Revolution, we recognize the significant potential of highway service areas as crucial nodes in intercity transportation. Currently, many service areas face challenges in resource utilization, information integration, and service enhancement. Therefore, we have designed an intelligent management system for highway service areas in the era of the Internet of Things.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1956110/extras/HB2.jpg?t=1719845792\" /><br><br>Centered around intelligent decision-making, optimized management, and enhanced services, this system integrates vast amounts of data to achieve interconnectedness and support rational decisions made by intelligent systems. We have thoroughly studied management needs and designed an Internet of Things digital twin system to promote intelligent management in service areas. Simultaneously, we have also considered traveler needs, optimizing travel processes and creating a more comfortable and convenient consumption environment.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1956110/extras/HB1.jpg?t=1719845792\" /><br><br>A key aspect of this design is the intelligent decision-making module, which aids consumers in making comprehensive and reasonable travel plans during their journey to the service area, effectively balancing the needs of various participants within a complex system. Another focal point is the digital twin console, tailored to the operational needs of the service area, addressing the challenges of managing complex systems.<br><br>Through this design, we aim to provide a solid foundation for the digital development and AI-driven decision-making of highway service areas, while reducing management costs, improving efficiency, enhancing operational conditions, and offering travelers a superior and convenient service experience. We believe this design will bring more possibilities to the economic development of highway service areas and serve as a platform for graduates of Art and Technology to showcase their talents and contribute to society.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1956110/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1719845792","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1956110/page.bg.jpg?t=1719845792","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1956110/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1719845792","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1956110/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1719845792","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":1963880,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1956110/extras/HB4.jpg?t=1719845792\" /><br><br>We stand in an era of transformation, from the Industrial Revolution to the ongoing Intelligent Revolution, where each leap in technology has profoundly influenced the trajectory of human society's development.
