{"about_the_game":"Escape from the Tutorial is a strategic turn-based role-playing game. You will play as Lazar, a young man dreaming of becoming a hero, starting his adventure in Tutorial Village, a place riddled with scams, debt, and despair. Through combat and strategy, escape hardships, meet reliable and unique companions, and uncover the secrets hidden behind this world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combat System</h2>The game combines classic Japanese turn-based RPGs with strategic battle chess. Each round, players must carefully choose their characters' actions and positions to maximize their abilities and tactical coordination. You can set traps to lure enemies, use weather and terrain effects to torment them, and boost morale to unleash powerful ultimate moves!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Character Development</h2>The game features 16 companions, each with their own professions and skills. You can explore, fight, and have heartfelt conversations by the campfire with them, helping fulfill their wishes. As the game progresses, you can upgrade and customize the skills and equipment of Lazar and his companions to create a unique combat style.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Art</h2>The game features beautiful character portraits by the seasoned artist Wareyon and exquisite pixel art by Guan Muzi. In combat, we have combined pixel characters with 3D effects to create fast-paced, dynamic, and visually stunning battles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Exploration and Homestead</h2>Beyond combat, you can explore the vast corners of the New Continent: forests, snow mountains, canyons, and towers. Each area has its own characteristics and offers different resources and treasures. The game also includes a small homestead system where you can use resources to upgrade your base and carriage, aiding your next adventure.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gaming Experience</h2>We place great importance on the player's gaming experience. Thus, you can save your game at any time, including making one-time interim saves on random maps. Additionally, you can reset skill points and talents unlimited times. All team members, including those who died in battle or did not participate, receive equal experience points, allowing you to freely try different character and skill combinations.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2955270/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714437909","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2955270/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1714437909","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2955270/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714437909","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2955270/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714437909","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Escape from the Tutorial is a strategic turn-based role-playing game.
