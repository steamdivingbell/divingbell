{"about_the_game":"The 12 O'CLOCK BOYS are a notorious urban dirt bike pack in Baltimore -- popping wheelies and weaving at excessive speeds through traffic, the group impressively evades the hamstrung police. In Lotfy Nathan's wild, dynamic documentary (three years in the making), their stunning antics are envisioned through the eyes of young adolescent Pug - a bright kid from the Westside obsessed with the riders and willing to do anything to join their ranks. Premiering to critical acclaim at the SXSW and Hot Docs Film Festivals (where Nathan won the HBO Emerging Artist Award), 12 O'CLOCK BOYS provides a compelling and intimate personal story of a young boy and his dangerous, thrilling dream.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/443770/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1551304772","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/443770/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1551304772","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/443770/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1551304772","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/443770/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1551304772","categories":[{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Native Steam Controller Support","id":33},{"description":"Captions available","id":13}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h1>Steam Video</h1><p>This content is only available in an online streaming format.
