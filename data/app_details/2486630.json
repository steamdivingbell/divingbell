In general, I am a huge fan of the whole 'cute things turn scary' trope, but please understand that this game is so much more than that. I don't mean to compare, but if you're a fan of DDLC, you'll most likely enjoy Siren's Call.\u201d<br>Recommended \u2013 Zee-o<br><br>\u201cThis is, hands down, one of the best visual novel experiences I have ever been through, if not the best. You absolutely will not know what you are about to witness when you play this. Every character feels alive. You will grow to care about every one of them, especially the main character[..]Everything in this game is treated about how it should be in real life, making for a realistic experience that really sits with you.\u201d<br>Recommended \u2013 Casca<br><br>\u201cFor the absolute amazing experience I had playing this, Siren's Call deserves nothing less than glowing reviews and praise. The game really does like to mess and play with your mind, and make you second-guess yourself a lot.
