{"about_the_game":"Only Down was made with speed runners in mind. Your skill will be tested. Victories are gained by the inch in this unforgiving puzzle platformer. Work your way downwards though a maze of platforms and obstacles to get Nano home safely. Be careful, for you are a mere mortal who can only fall so far without the ultimate consequence. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers are encouraged to get down as fast as possible. There is a stopwatch counting your every second. We also encourage anyone that finishes to post a screenshot of your finish time. We will be working on a formal leader board post launch.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou are a being called Nano that has been run out of his home by The Uni-Guard. Nano found a safe place to live, and wised-up. He constructed a dangerous maze to prevent the Guard from ever finding his new home. After a long excursion, it was time for Nano to make his way back home....only down...through the maze.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Home Sweet Home","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2522370/6cda6fceb3a832fa6d8d41bac3689798f3f4047c.jpg"}],"total":1},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2522370/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1691496536","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2522370/page.bg.jpg?t=1691496536","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2522370/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1691496536","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2522370/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1691496536","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Only Down was made with speed runners in mind.
