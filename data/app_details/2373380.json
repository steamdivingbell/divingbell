{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Overview</strong></h2><i>Air Traffic Control is one of the world's most demanding professions. Every minute in the tower a Controller is called on to make life or death decisions for thousands of passengers and crewmembers. He or she must control a constantly changing situation; monitoring flight departures and arrivals; guiding planes around bad weather, mountainous terrain, and restricted flight areas; coping with fuel emergencies, slow planes, and fast jets (including the supersonic Concorde). In this fast-moving environment, even the slightest miscalculation can lead to a dangerous near-miss or mid-air disaster! Air traffic control is not for everybody; to succeed you must have superb concentration, quick wits, and nerves of steel.<br><br><strong>KENNEDY APROACH</strong> gives you a chance to test your mettle.
