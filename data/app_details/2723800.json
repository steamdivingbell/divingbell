In this game, both the music and the charts are <i>generated procedurally together at the same time</i>, making sure that they match.<br><br>This game is inspired by <strong>piano improvisation</strong>. It uses 10 keys to play the melodies like it was a piano, with higher notes on your right, and lower notes on your left; though you can easily change the number of keys to any number between 1 and 10 if that's how you prefer to play. And, just like when you're improvising music, the music follows patterns, but always changes the details, and it can go on for as long as you'd like.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2723800/extras/Peek_2024-05-12_22-57.gif?t=1722006403\" /><br><br>Does this use AI and Machine Learning to avoid hiring musicians and charters? <strong>No</strong>. Each collection uses handcrafted algorithms which requires musical, programming, and charting skills to pull off good tracks.

The UI is clunky (it was originally designed as keyboard-only then I somehow got it to also work with mouse), the audio quality is lower than I'd like (in part because I can only use audio samples that can be redistributed, instead of making music pieces using good virtual instruments or recordings), the framerate is not always super consistent, and I haven't been able to playtest it nearly as much as I should have.
