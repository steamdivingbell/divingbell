{"about_the_game":"This minimalist puzzle game is as much a game of logic as it is of patience. The objective of each puzzle is to swap pairs of colored rods such that all four rods that meet in any of 30 corners have different colors - a problem known as &quot;edge coloring&quot; in mathematics. The catch is to solve each puzzle with a limited number of swaps (unless you deactivate that limit).<br><br>The game offers thousands of procedurally generated puzzles in dozens of difficulty levels in various single-player modes as well as shared-screen cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes. The four single-player modes are: with and without limited number of swaps, and with the different kinds of rods visualized as colors or as rotations. The puzzles range in difficulty from very easy to extremely difficult. The most difficult puzzles will test the patience even of hard-core puzzle fans.<br><br>Inspired by a fictional game of a popular sci-fi TV series, the puzzle design combines a mathematical problem (edge coloring an icosidodecahedral graph) with a comfortable learning curve and extra challenging modes for the most devoted fans.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Other Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Players may use keyboard, mouse, Xbox controller, or any combination of them.
