{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ABOUT THE GAME</h2><br>It's a sessional PvP-PvE top down shooter game of intense gunfights, trophy collecting, and resource management in the post-apocalyptic universe of the Undeads. <br><br>You have hundreds of characters and dozens of game factions to choose from - each with its own unique features. <br><br>An incredible number of dangers await the player at every turn - from hunger and thirst to a lack of ammunition, from random game events to gradual equipment breakdown, from ambushes by computer characters to the treachery of other players. <br><br>Unpredictable player behavior - shall you adhere to neutrality or meet with rapid fire every person you meet? Share resources or suddenly kill those who trusted you? Only you decide whether to look for friends or survive on your own.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GAMEPLAY FEATURES</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Random placement of players within the game location at the start of each new match. <br></li><li>Players choose the characters - both humans and zombies have their own advantages. Experiment with the character's unique abilities to create your own style of play. <br></li><li>At the end of the match, players are ranked and rewarded with additional in-game currency. <br></li><li>Resource Management - as you move through the location, search for water, food, medicine, weapons, ammo, armor, and valuable items to trade. Collected items will remain with you after the match - if you manage to survive. <br></li><li>All items found after the match go into a safe storage area. Expand the size of your warehouse to save more items!<br></li><li>In-game Store - go to the merchant to sell unwanted items and purchase weapons, ammo, armor pieces, and even new characters! Don't miss out on unique and seasonal offers in the store!<br></li><li>Equipment Management - each character has a limit on the number of items you can take with you when venturing out into the game world. All weapons and armor in the game have durability indicators - keep an eye on your gear so it doesn't break or let you down at the worst possible moment!<br></li><li>Keep this in mind! If your character dies, all his items will be lost - choose what to take with you and what to leave in the vault. </li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">UNDEADS WORLD</h2><br>The greed of unscrupulous politicians, the zombie virus pandemic, experiments to create super-soldiers, and ordinary human panic have created a world of a dystopian future where everyone can be a friend, and everyone can be an enemy. <br><br>On the battlefields, you can meet townspeople and farmers, builders and engineers, bandits and hunters, survivalists and scavengers, nomads and soldiers. They are confronted by reanimated corpses and plague bearers, bloody butchers and bloodthirsty ghouls, mutant zombies and zombie cyborgs, zombie samurai and zombie knights. They are all trying to win a place in the sun against a backdrop of ruined cities and dying trade routes. <br><br>Choose different characters and make the most of their unique abilities. Form alliances or take treacherous stabs in the back. Accumulate resources, armor, and weapons to increase your chances of survival in every new battle. Become the ranking leader and bring your character to the heights of glory!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2664670/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1723287809","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2664670/page.bg.jpg?t=1723287809","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2664670/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1723287809","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2664670/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1723287809","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ABOUT THE GAME</h2><br>It's a sessional PvP-PvE top down shooter game of intense gunfights, trophy collecting, and resource management in the post-apocalyptic universe of the Undeads. <br><br>You have hundreds of characters and dozens of game factions to choose from - each with its own unique features. <br><br>An incredible number of dangers await the player at every turn - from hunger and thirst to a lack of ammunition, from random game events to gradual equipment breakdown, from ambushes by computer characters to the treachery of other players. <br><br>Unpredictable player behavior - shall you adhere to neutrality or meet with rapid fire every person you meet?
