Getting up, that\u2019s all behind you now. Life has been good to you. Just ten years ago, you were tilling your own fields in a simple straw hat. Today, your kingdom stretches from sea to sea, and your straw hat is the largest the world has ever known. You also have the world\u2019s smallest dog, and a life-size statue of yourself made out of baklava. Sure, money can\u2019t buy happiness, but it can buy envy, anger, and also this kind of blank feeling. You still have problems \u2013 troublesome neighbors that must be conquered.
