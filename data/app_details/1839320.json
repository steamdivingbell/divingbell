{"about_the_game":"We rose to the challenge, and pushed ourselves to greater heights. The Future Project, humanity\u2019s latest achievement in space exploration, will allow us to journey the stars safely and effectively. As the player, you are finalizing the functionality of an AI technology that will relieve humanity of the dangers of exploring new planets. Pilot the AI, exploring planets and combating threats in fast paced combat as it journeys through distinct worlds. Obtain new weapons and abilities to enhance your capabilities and become the ultimate explorer and fighter.<br><br>Continuing the narrative started in Infinite Level's Impressions, The Future Project expands on the story by showing the aftermath of alien contact and the current progress of the titular Future Project. The story of The Future Project is presented in a way that allows players to interpret the game's events in their own way, at their own pace. Integrated naturally into The Future Project's digital world, piece together the development history of The Future Project, the thoughts of its creators, and the hopes of humanity. But beware, for there are those who believe the project will bring ruin to humanity.

As the simulation progresses, players will acquire new abilities which will open previously unexplored areas, allowing the discovery of hidden secrets and upgrades as you explore.<br><br>Though the AI is engineered for exploration first and foremost, there will undoubtedly be hostile creatures that must be defended against. The Future Project aims to create a fast paced, compelling combat system that has the player use their abilities in creative, efficient ways.
