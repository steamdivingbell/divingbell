{"about_the_game":"This is a VR game whose main content is to help guide players in meditative breathing. In the game, players can choose the duration or number of meditation breaths. The game will randomly load different environments, which are basically calm and peaceful outdoor environments, such as parks, seaside, snow-capped mountains and woods, etc. Players need to hold the side grips with both hands when inhaling and release the side grips when exhaling. When breathing, the game will use the particle system to express the changing process of energy, guiding players to pay attention to their bodies. Through multiple breathing exercises, players can focus more and release stress","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2776980?t=1706263427","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2776980?t=1706263427","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2776980/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1706263427","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2776980/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1706263427","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This is a VR game whose main content is to help guide players in meditative breathing.
