Help her by collecting her poems in a beautiful, colorful open world.  The poems are the messages of her past and they will give clues of where to go next and what really happened to Norra.<br>Norra has an imaginary friend, Riggy. Riggy has been part of Norra\u2019s life since she was a toddler. He never left. Riggy plays a big role in Norra\u2019s life and often get in the way of basic life decisions. Norra has this constant fight between herself and Riggy where he became the negativity of her personality and Norra herself the positivity in her life. With this fight going on, Norra can\u2019t sometimes distinguish between fiction and reality.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2133970/extras/Norra.png?t=1671528138\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2133970/extras/AFCL_Kickstarter_Header_2_Story.png?t=1671528138\" /><br>Like most children, Norra has an incredible imagination. With this marvelous imagination, she has built a fantastical world where she and her ever-loyal sidekick, Riggy, escape to. With the help of Riggy, Norra uses this imaginary world as a mirror of reality in which she can safely explore her thoughts and feelings about real-life situations. Unlike most children, however, Norra\u2019s fantasy world and imaginary friend doesn\u2019t stay behind in her childhood. Unable to face the horrid reality of her father\u2019s untimely death, Norra retreats to her imaginary world and into the company of her ever-empathetic friend, Riggy. Trapped inside the confines of her imagination, Norra is unable to make friends and becomes estranged from her mother, who tries to fight her own battles at the bottom of a whiskey glass. Intoxicated by Riggy\u2019s whispers coaxing her to retreat into her mind palace, Norra overlooks valuable relationships, including a potential love interest, Alice, Norra\u2019s classmate and only friend in the real world. Norra\u2019s imaginary world expands and Riggy\u2019s voice amplifies until both drown out the cruel reality, protecting Norra from all that could harm her. Isolating her from everyone, until loneliness is the only friend she knows.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2133970/extras/13.png?t=1671528138\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2133970/extras/AFCL_Kickstarter_Header_4_Characters.png?t=1671528138\" /><br>The characters in this game all have one purpose, and that is to create an emotional connection with Norra.
