{"about_the_game":"<strong>Hi Everyone, Thanks for your support over the years. As one of the only two people behind VectorWave I would like to thank everyone who ever downloaded my game from the bottom of my heart. I've been making plans to revive this game for over 2 years. I've wanted to update it to modern controllers/headsets, even give it a minor graphical facelift, but unfortunately my time is very limited. As of now, VectorWave is dead. You can only play it if you have an original HTC Vive or a first or second gen oculus. This bring me no joy, but after 2 years of attempting to get the time to work on it, I believe it's finally time to throw in the towel. Any free time I get will go towards new game ideas of endeavors I may have. Thanks again.</strong><br><br>VectorWave translates the traditional tower defense experience into virtual reality, allowing you the freedom to buy, place, toss, and move towers as you see fit between each wave with almost no need for menus. Each hand serves its own purpose in your efforts to build an impenetrable defense grid against increasingly difficult hordes of malware bent on destroying your mainframe.<br><br>Moving from a 2-D top down perspective in traditional TD games to Virtual Reality allows us to expand on this genre like never before. Because split second decisions and positioning matter, VectorWave's simple, yet versatile, movement and scaling system allows you to either stand directly in the action, or watch your carefully laid out plans from afar. <br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Current Game Features</h2></strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li>21 Levels<br>    </li><li>20 Enemy Types<br>    </li><li>22 Towers<br>    </li><li>Unique Player Abilities<br>    </li><li>Achievements<br>    </li><li>Global Leader-boards<br>    </li><li>Trading Cards</li></ul><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Planned Features</h2></strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li>Level Editor<br>    </li><li>Challenge Mode<br>    </li><li>Endless Mode</li></ul><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game currently supports the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift</h2></strong><br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Demo Details</h2></strong><br>We included a Demo you could try before you purchase the full product. <br>We understand that it is important for the consumer to know what they are buying.<br>The demo is just a small slice of the finished game that we feel represents VectorWave well.<br>Many more features are included in the full version. <br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Demo Features</h2></strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li>7 Unique Levels<br>    </li><li>10 Enemy Types<br>    </li><li>10 Towers</li></ul><br>All music tracks heard in this game were provided by the generous Zachary Kemp.<br>Check out his Work Here:<br><br><br>Physics and Interaction engine provided by the lovely people over at NewtonVR.<br>Check out them here:<br>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Free Trial","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/629410/643caabe990cc4c932c53faf29a1b79743163185.jpg"},{"name":"Standard License","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/629410/9675b42a9ebe9bdc3d1d985b619d7b99d9b02868.jpg"},{"name":"Deluxe Package","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/629410/a5158491adb9047460960c01f2aa2c32deb08991.jpg"},{"name":"Megabyte","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/629410/f4e1dca45269dd57680016ba69aec9ce0439a602.jpg"},{"name":"Gigabyte","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/629410/02c73253ab3e14e54e9a61ca47240196b07f4a6b.jpg"},{"name":"Thorough Scan","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/629410/faac4241fef0286639fbc7d4ef1adfd1458afb48.jpg"},{"name":"Cookie Cleaner","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/629410/45570a6ea6fba9ec1eb6336fda60b5551582c938.jpg"},{"name":"Spyware Stopper","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/629410/f9ee08e88f4044ae3674cf186474a13996264ef2.jpg"},{"name":"Malware Mutilator","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/629410/8c940cbc8b0b45334539ac321cd33be7978fb76f.jpg"},{"name":"Pew!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/629410/9236a3c3a42cea60d3b9653d067ce6b9fca11c0d.jpg"}],"total":20},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/629410/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1709595780","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/629410/page.bg.jpg?t=1709595780","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/629410/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1709595780","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/629410/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1709595780","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Hi Everyone, Thanks for your support over the years.
