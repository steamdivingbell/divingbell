{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">This is a demo for Mahou Senshi Cosplay Club</h2><br>The game is currently under development with an active Kickstarter campaign, running until November 3rd, 2022. <br><br>In this demo we wanted you to try a little bit of two of the most important features of the game: Creating Costumes and Turn-based Battles. We put one battle for you to try and some of the content for creating and designing costumes. <br><br>If the Kickstarter is successful, the complete game is coming in 2023, and it will be a single-player, story driven, tactical turn-based RPG, about crafting, material combinations, battle skills, and exploring events and quests to find new tools for your crafting.
