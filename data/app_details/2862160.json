Ice spells slow and eventually freeze them. Once frozen, focus on other threats as they slowly thaw, or shatter them with a physical attack for bonus damage. Use the raw power of Fire to damage and eventually set your enemies ablaze for high damage over time. Poison spells will weaken your adversaries and slowly drain the life out of them.
