{"about_the_game":"Betsy the Bunny Rabbit wants to pick up some carrots!<br><br>Hop around, pick up and throw stuff, and try to collect all the carrots! Rock out to amazing chiptune ragtime music! See if you can make it through all 96 rooms!<br><br>It's a puzzle game that's maybe a little different! You can run around, jump, and pick up &amp; throw various things you may find in the room. When you throw something, it flies around the room and bounces off the walls until it hits the ground. It's fun to just hang out sometimes and keep throwing stuff around!<br><br>You can pick up marbles and throw them around the room. If three marbles of the same color line up, they flash and disappear! Sometimes you want that to happen. Sometimes you don't. It's part of life to learn what you want!<br><br>You can pick up and throw critters as well. They can't hurt you, and you can't hurt them. If the mood strikes, you can stand on top of them and ride around. Maybe they can help you reach new places!<br><br>Featuring 12 worlds with 8 rooms each, for 96 rooms total.

When you stand on them, they move left or right; after you jump off of them, they move back to their original position.<br></li><li><strong>Titania Capitol</strong>: The Diamond and Heart Blocks will allow you to super-jump and double jump if you jump off of them.<br></li><li><strong>Equinox Isle</strong>: The Bubble Pots will continuously create bubbles that you can jump on.
