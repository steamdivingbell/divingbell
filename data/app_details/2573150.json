{"about_the_game":"Neon Dash Tales is a mix between die &amp; retry and puzzle-game. Your goal is to fetch all the stars from the level and go to the next one. For that, you have one ally, yourself.

Use this area to make the level easier to avoid getting hit by enemies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game requires skill, patience and problem solving. You can either force the level to do it quickly but also take your time and put safe area to make the level easier. The right balance between these two will help you reach the top score of the leaderboard !<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo summarize, Neon Dash Tales is a snake like puzzle-retry game that mixes reactivity with logic !","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"World 1 Complete","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2573150/8a06c456d17a497cb62b7e758c2b0adfeb4f5323.jpg"},{"name":"World 2 Complete","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2573150/d4fb5de8ad47841784dbb8dac3db0373d3427056.jpg"},{"name":"World 3 Complete","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2573150/6707eae36c99f9300e034d7ecaac73522f7250f5.jpg"},{"name":"World 4 Complete","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2573150/95502a2553822924f8c614f389cb8d12967d7275.jpg"},{"name":"World 5 Complete","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2573150/4d24d221137212aa0477feacd8870f3564f9f3c0.jpg"},{"name":"World 1 Deathless ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2573150/5ab7986a4c72d500dcb8214ee1ba0ea2f3adbece.jpg"},{"name":"World 2 Deathless ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2573150/00432029c8829488b0efb67fbf3b0dc95e3fb778.jpg"},{"name":"World 3 Deathless ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2573150/214f2e2adeef52619fe1edf168341d79b7f86450.jpg"},{"name":"World 4 Deathless ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2573150/7a209104a26d5cee85bbe0133e1de722e19ae342.jpg"},{"name":"World 5 Deathless ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2573150/e8fced4a4ca40c72f9e5e959e705e8fa3e8bccf4.jpg"}],"total":18},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2573150/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1698856651","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2573150/page.bg.jpg?t=1698856651","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2573150/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1698856651","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2573150/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1698856651","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Neon Dash Tales is a mix between die &amp; retry and puzzle-game.
