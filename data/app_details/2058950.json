We intended it to be a kind of a tribute to all the animals that paved the way for humans to go into space. Most of these animals - the first astronauts - did not survive the journey. Our story tells about the adventures of a dog named Bea who ... managed to beat the odds. A Space Tail: Lost in the Sands tells the tale of Bea's adventure on one of the newly discovered planets.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2058950/extras/2gif.gif?t=1660316367\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2058950/extras/header_character.png?t=1660316367\" /><br><br>Bea is a cheerful and courageous character, but the player must remember that she is just a...  dog. She has all the characteristics of a mongrel - she barks, likes to chase her own tail, and learns about the world through her senses. Bea can sniff, listen and observe. These are the main mechanics of detective mode which will help her in exploring and understanding her environment.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2058950/extras/header_2.png?t=1660316367\" /><br>In the full game - Space Tail: Every Journey Leads Home - Bea travels through space discovering more planets. Each planet is different and has its specific inhabitants, who can either become friends of the main character or be very unfriendly towards her.
