Evoke the memories of things which never existed and plan something that\u2019s never gonna happen. Reflect when you don\u2019t need to. Then look inside yourself and try not to cry.<br><br>Just relax and talk to yourself, looking at the professor\u2019s room or trying to perceive the silhouettes in the white emptiness.
