It has a short charge time, and will teleport you to wherever it lands immediately. Think before you throw however, the ball won't teleport you until it lands. If you're in a tricky spot with enemies and try to throw the ball very far, you have to wait for the ball to travel before you teleport. Sometimes it may be smarter to throw the ball closer to you to teleport faster. Watch enemies actions with their balls as a strategy, if they've just teleported, you have a chance to strike as they have to charge it before teleporting again.<br>If you have a Damage Ball coming towards you and can't teleport in time, you can either physically move in your play space to dodge the ball, or if you have a charged Damage Ball in your hand you can block with it. <br><br>Experiment with the balls and come up with strategies to gain an advantage against your multiplayer opponents. <br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><br>Currently there are 3 vastly different multiplayer maps in the game.
