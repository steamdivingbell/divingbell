{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Immerse yourself in the world of <i>SCP: Destruction Protocol</i>. You are a rebel, determined to destroy an underground complex to put an end to the horrific events happening within its walls. However, the plan takes a dark turn when you discover that your team has met a dreadful fate.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">After your comrades descended into the complex without you, you follow in their footsteps, only to find them all dead. Now, you must complete the mission alone, armed with just a flashlight and a Level 4 keycard. As you explore, you\u2019ll find other items, such as a Level 5 keycard that grants access to previously locked doors, along with notes containing useful information about the SCPs and details about the complex itself.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">On your path lie three different zones: the Entrance Zone, Heavy Containment Zone, and Light Containment Zone \u2014 each with its own unique dangers and challenges. The SCPs in this facility are entities that cannot be harmed by conventional weapons. They are merciless, each posing a distinct threat. Some stalk you like prey, some react to the slightest sound, and others only move when you break eye contact.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">To survive, you must study the weaknesses of the SCPs, as you are powerless to fight them directly. Stay observant, adapt to each encounter, and use your wits to evade their deadly attention.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Seek out the scientist who prepared the keycard to activate the Destruction Protocol. Can you complete this perilous mission, or will you vanish into the darkness forever?</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3222150/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730912100","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3222150/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1730912100","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3222150/c45b35dc77217130d307c132ac8920f939a18117/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730912100","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3222150/c45b35dc77217130d307c132ac8920f939a18117/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730912100","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Captions available","id":13}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Immerse yourself in the world of <i>SCP: Destruction Protocol</i>.
