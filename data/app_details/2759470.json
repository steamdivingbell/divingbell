{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Like the full-scale ViperJet, the E-flite Viper 64mm EDF delivers fighter-jet looks and performance with low-wing prop-driven airplane handling so more pilots can enjoy flying a jet! It's a scale EDF that flies smoothly and handles like a sport airplane \u2014 yet is also capable of incredible top speeds and aerobatics. But what truly sets it apart is how easy it is to hand launch or take off, fly, and land, which makes it the class-leading choice for a wide variety of pilots. No glue or special tools are required for assembly, and you can have it ready to fly in less time than it takes to charge a battery! The lightweight, composite-reinforced EPO airframe is factory-finished in the now iconic Aircraft Studio Design trim scheme. And the seven factory-installed digital servos with ball-link equipped linkages deliver crisp and precise control at every speed. It's also equipped with functional LED navigation and landing lights, along with factory-installed flaps for shorter takeoffs and landings plus improved slow-flight performance. The optional-use landing gear features a steerable nosewheel and shock-absorbing trailing-link struts, or you can remove it \u2014 without using any tools \u2014 for more speed and vertical performance when flying over grass!
