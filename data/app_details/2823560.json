Only you are free to decide who to support in this war...<br><br>In <strong>Orkendale: The Scarred</strong> Land you will find a large open world filled with exciting quests, various enemies and dangers. Explore the surroundings and travel through the locations to see how different factions of people live.<br><br>There are 3 different factions of people waiting for you in the game:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Free City - its residents prefer not to take an active part in the general unrest, but this time even they won't be able to stay on the sidelines;<br></li><li>Imperial City - people in it believe that only by uniting the mainland into one kingdom you can get power and global weight in the world. And for the sake of this they are ready to seize all the territories to engage in their subsequent development;<br></li><li>Miner's Town - was formerly part of the Imperial City, but it has defended its independence for 100 years, and it looks like it will soon have to do it again.</li></ul><br>There are many mysteries hidden on the island of Orkendale. You can solve them or leave them untouched.<br>In addition, Orkendale is inhabited by various creatures, but it is dominated by two main species: humans and orcs. The Orcs were defeated many years ago, so since then they are no longer considered an equal race and a threat to humans. They have a small territory where the ruins of an ancient tower still remain.
