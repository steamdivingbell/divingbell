As part of a galactic exploration party, you begin the level by viewing the Solar System from afar \u2013 under the instructions of your Captain, Keen. The mood is set, and the adventure  begins. Once hyper-spacing over to Neptune, you can start playing and place the incoming bricks. After  battling through 5 levels of cube-matching frenzy, you travel to planet Earth. At this stage, there is a short intermission before you continue on to your journey to map the Solar System \u2013 reaching the Sun at level 9.<br><br><i>Painted Forest: </i>The main challenge is time. Upon entering this level, you're greeted by a Green Dragon and fish swimming in a pond.

The ice missiles might also blow up or get up in your face, which will increase the difficulty level.

This is one environment where the player can fight back, however. The final level of the environment, level 10, is a face to face encounter with a fire dragon... a lava dragon... a magma dragon... a hot dragon! The player must beat this level in order to win the environment and earn their achievement.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"The Educated","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/792000/f0b662eb767c5888baba87bd6a64ace39611ca7f.jpg"},{"name":"The Accomplished","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/792000/a0bcd00df4480103dfe96b9155c30d0d98e7ed73.jpg"},{"name":"Rookie Brickster","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/792000/e97da5c6846d010f06a368accd31788125284e4c.jpg"},{"name":"Skilled Brickster","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/792000/ae03d2cf8cd416d58ea613127378e82be297c5e1.jpg"},{"name":"Ace Brickster","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/792000/150de22c7f399e237ac026bc7e2959da73fc264f.jpg"},{"name":"Hero Brickster","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/792000/eafe611e8d0f2c98ffdbebd95d2cce2444a6c5c0.jpg"},{"name":"Elite Brickster","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/792000/eeb90bda76a0bf05e9a3a9c9d8118efe46e21c3d.jpg"},{"name":"Mammoth Brickster","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/792000/2a682a0569fb0a86f82e07e272262fc0748e7839.jpg"},{"name":"Cube Brickster","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/792000/b9b74281e3b9c63435611f425322744166162862.jpg"},{"name":"Pit Ace","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/792000/1c2bc022d5e2b1f4bf9275dc73fa7b34457b77c4.jpg"}],"total":100},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/792000/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1605584025","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/792000/page.bg.jpg?t=1605584025","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/792000/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1605584025","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/792000/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1605584025","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Put your skills to the test in <i>Pit Blocks 3D</i>!
