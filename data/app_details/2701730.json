The game features 4 unit types, 3 building types, and hex grid maps waiting to be conquered. The unit types are arranged from weakest to strongest: Peasant, Militia, Baron, and Knight. Each hex grid allows placing one unit or building, and each unit has one movement point per turn. To afford the cost of units and their maintenance, you must expand your territory and strengthen your economy by building Farms. You can opt to place Outposts or Watchtowers to form defensive lines. Enhance your economy by collecting resources from the terrain or strategically spreading your influence by waiting for a few turns. The joy of victory lies in achieving the highest score or eliminating all your opponents, depending on the game mode.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">We are working hard on Politon, and you can join our Discord channel to stay updated about the latest updates!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2701730/extras/gameplay1.gif?t=1728935846\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">[/url][/p][p][]  [/url][/p</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"The Nomad","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2701730/991005d0bb60a37b1ca5291b8f5cb71175136499.jpg"},{"name":"The Freshman","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2701730/c77863406197b100c64f6d1412f4a3771af6b8e9.jpg"},{"name":"The Sophomore","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2701730/d58eb7357f68f66be0c52c1eefa84405e85ace58.jpg"},{"name":"The Junior","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2701730/871c5794a3a2bb398cfe4f6accc12d5ca2779999.jpg"},{"name":"The Knight","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2701730/c5c20b38838d9bb459a324e4dbfaab4be0bf5017.jpg"}],"total":5},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2701730/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728935846","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2701730/page.bg.jpg?t=1728935846","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2701730/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728935846","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2701730/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728935846","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Have a Look at the Full Version!</h1><p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">&quot;Politon: Prologue&quot; is the free prologue version of &quot;Politon&quot;.
