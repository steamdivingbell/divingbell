Kent's army and those of nearby towns and villages all help to look for her, but none could find even a hint of where she had gone. Over the next few months, the princess would strangely begin slipping from the memories of those who knew her. Before long, it was as if nobody could remember she had ever existed at all...<br><br>Around the same time as the princess' disappearance, mysterious pages filled with great magical energy begin appearing all over the continent. Those who find them are granted power, but nothing but darkness and chaos follows their owners... What are the origins of these strange pages, and could they somehow be linked to the disappearance of the princess?<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2135920/extras/description03.png?t=1732707828\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2135920/extras/description05.png?t=1732707828\" /><br>As you travel across Arcadia, you'll meet various characters.
