A shy yet resilient boy, filled with an immense hatred for the leaders of Humanity and their inhuman methods of handling the war against the vrilles. He wishes to become a painter, but he never will. Like all of his peers, he has been bred to kill by the State, and so he will kill. No one cares about his art. No one cares because reality is war. War. War. Win the war.
