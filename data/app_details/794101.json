{"about_the_game":"The Stinson L-5 is typical of the type of aircraft developed during WWII for duties such as liaison, artillery spotting, photo-reconnaissance and casualty evacuation.

It simply does what it says on the tin.<br><br>The L-5 was dubbed 'The Flying Jeep' and, along with the Stinson L-1 Vigilant, was the only other American liaison aircraft of WWII that was purpose-built for military use. Other types were used, of course, but they tended to be converted from existing commercial designs such as the Piper Cub.<br><br>Nearly all Perspex, the cockpit area affords excellent visibility in all directions and the large door windows  fold down to give uninterrupted viewing below. The design was created to be multi-functional and versions of the L-5 were produced to operate as air ambulances and carry small amounts of freight, munitions and other cargo. Its primary use was as a front-line liaison aircraft and artillery spotter.<br><br>The L-5's supreme ability to get into small, remote areas earned it great respect from the generals and troops alike, and L-5s dropped much needed medical supplies, munitions, food and other provisions to hard-pressed troops in remote areas.
