It features tunnels and galleries dug for the sole purpose of extracting precious minerals, such as gold, silver, mithril and copper.

A large elevator connects this camp to the surface world (or to the dwarven city). All around the elevator spreads the mining camp made of mining huts lodging the miners. Warehouses keep the materials and tools of the trade and even an inn and a small chapel are found in this settlement. Many railroads for mining carts end their trail here.<br><br><strong>Mines</strong><br>The Mines are a random excavation complex. Railroads go until it is possible, but many smaller galleries spread from the main railroaded tunnels.<br><br><strong>The Shaft</strong><br>This large cavern hosts the largest excavation site of the entire mines complex. It is a large funnel going down for hundreds of feet. The dwarves didn\u2019t feel discouraged and built a railroad winding down the shaft. Although it was a masterwork structure, it happens often that mining carts go out of the rails and fall in the shaft.<br><br><strong>Military Outpost</strong><br>Sometimes dwarves meet hostile underground dwellers that don\u2019t allow further excavations. In such cases the dwarves set up a military outpost for the sole purpose of defending the territory. The military outpost is a self-sustaining structure with barracks, kitchen, forge and a well providing fresh water.<br><br>Each map is linked within a an easy to follow outline story entry, with links to the map in mutliple resolutions.<br><br><i>Fantasy Grounds Conversion by</i> <strong>0one Games</strong><br><br>Released on February 05, 2010.
