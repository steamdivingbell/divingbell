By entering different buildings throughout the dungeon you take on many different forms from 8-bit style to hand drawn to a 3d satellite bird that shoots down floating space heads. Travel through an absurdist version of human history as you try and find a sasquatch sex amulet that will, for some reason, enable you to visit the suburbs of the Fuzz Dungeon where you can defeat a sasquatch statue and abolish bad ideas forever.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1506080/extras/Gif03.gif?t=1627740027\" /><br><br><strong> Features:</strong><br>-15 unique levels, each with a different game play. <br>-Unique musical score by Chris Parrello and Lobby Hotel<br>-Full controller support<br>-Around 90 minutes to complete but each level has a ranking system where you can return to complete challenges and achievements.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1506080/extras/Gif04.gif?t=1627740027\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Well destroyed","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1506080/6c4e8ed2127ed1f93a210ffc2b42f7e98e305752.jpg"},{"name":"Mushrooms","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1506080/542b43482660b35e821450c9586bd1100cbc25c3.jpg"},{"name":"Dungeon Head","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1506080/a864fd37cd5a1da1d27dd480265d70f290fab15e.jpg"},{"name":"Runner","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1506080/e42fe47cc221ee64ca7df85c49d324fa1e067868.jpg"},{"name":"Sports","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1506080/d4329443636bef8541b747dadf234116e026177e.jpg"},{"name":"Puke Passages","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1506080/238bee287154fdef6f8bc3702a16cced67e74143.jpg"},{"name":"Big Heads","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1506080/39a59cccb5382118189ac403d214c9b864ad160e.jpg"},{"name":"Image Marketplace","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1506080/dedf7eeea9b1de3c042fcf08df483c9e9990e446.jpg"},{"name":"Conversationalist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1506080/708d4ff9205b3c0c70552268526765f56c1078d2.jpg"},{"name":"Assembly Line","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1506080/bb1988420c8fb49c1d313f64f2778b38f3528b38.jpg"}],"total":19},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1506080/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1627740027","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1506080/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1627740027","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1506080/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1627740027","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1506080/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1627740027","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1506080/extras/Gif01.gif?t=1627740027\" /><br><br>The well back to your job has been absorbed inside a sasquatch sex amulet.
