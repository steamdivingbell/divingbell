{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Explore a unique and connected world. Understand its fragile balance, uncover its deepest questions, and find more than just the answers. Chroma Zero immerses you in a universe of mystery, color, energy, and movement, and challenges your expectations and intuition.

Most progress is gated only by knowledge, which is gained by exploring and experimenting.

The narrative is mostly light-hearted, but can be impactful at times. The puzzles ramp up in difficulty, though the game helps to guide you as well. So if you're exploring everywhere, you will know what to do -- maybe just not how to do it! I was inspired by games like Anti-chamber, Outer Wilds, Myst/Riven, and the discovery elements of Tunic.

So, if you want to do stuff like change your resolution, adjust the sensitivity, adjust the key-bindings, turn on/off motion blur, etc. etc. it is ALL THERE for your fiddling pleasure, but you need a mouse to do it.

An intro-animation offset adjusts the way the game starts, which typically involves a symmetrical pattern repeating across the screen. The offset makes it asymmetric. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Speedrun Timer: A reposition-able timer starts on Play, and stops during dialogue sequences, but otherwise continues until game-over. Also, if this timer is enabled, the button-hold to delete your save file is sped up so fresh restarts can happen more quickly.
