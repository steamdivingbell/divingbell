The game combines elements of tile placement, worker placement, auctioning and bidding, resource management, and set collection to create a unique and engaging gameplay experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Game Rules</strong></h2><br>Players take their turns at the same time, and gain 6 coins each turn. You'll want to visit the Marketplace each turn to see which new tiles are for sale, but beware! All players in the game share the same Marketplace, and once a tile is bought by a player it can no longer be purchased by another. When tiles first appear, they cost 5 coins each. If at the end of the turn they aren't purchased, the cost will reduce to 3 the next turn, and reduced further to 1 coin the turn after that. Players will have to make a judgement call whether or not to buy a tile early for a higher cost, or take the chance and wait to get it later.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2287440/extras/SteamScreenshot.png?t=1726272801\" /><br><br>Each tile generates resources such as food, stone, wood, or soldiers, which players can use to blind bid on special tasks that offer victory points. The player who offers the most resources for a task wins it and earns its victory points. However, players cannot see exactly how many resources another player has. If you offer too many resources to complete a task you might not be able to compete for the next few tasks, allowing other players to win those at a lower cost. By observing your opponents boards and how much they're paying to win tasks, you may be able to have a rough idea of how many resources a player has an enter a more competitive bid without wasting resources!<br><br>But it's not just about generating resources and bidding for tasks. Tile Titans also includes a set bonus system where players can earn additional victory points, resources or effects by collecting certain combinations of tiles. And to add even more strategy, players can block their opponents from completing these sets by buying up a tile before the player who needs it does. The tiles needed to complete set bonuses are visible to all players, so keep in mind what each player might be on the lookout for!<br><br>With its mix of strategic gameplay and beautiful artwork, Tile Titans is a must-play for fans of tile/worker placement and bidding board games.
