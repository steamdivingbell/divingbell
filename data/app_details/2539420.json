Load out your arsenal of spells to free the legion of spirits corrupted by the legion of shadow. Progress through an ever changing forest, to get to the bottom of what's causing the corruption. What is the legion of shadow and what do they want with our world? Defeat waves of enemies to find the truth. <br><br>With different elements at your disposal, combine them with light to create powerful explosions of magic to push back the dark. Dodge and position yourself to make the most of the spell patterns to deliver the strongest attacks possible. The forest is dangerous though, you'll need help. Meet a mysterious person who offers his wares in exchange for purging the dark. No matter how you choose to play, the forest needs your help to free the light once more.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2539420/extras/Gamefeatures.png?t=1692642463\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Magical girl character!<br></li><li>4 colorful magic spells!<br></li><li>A simple and straightforward side scroller!<br></li><li>Big spell explosions!</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2539420/extras/Aboutdevelopment.png?t=1692642463\" /><br><br>This game was developed as a student project at DigiPen Institute of Technology and was created for educational purposes only.
