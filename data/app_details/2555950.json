Every creation has different offensive and defensive abilities depending on its shape and materials used, and combining the same type of block can create parts that have special effects. Editing your weapons and shields and working towards the best creations for your playstyle through trial and error only gets more enjoyable as the going gets tougher.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mind-Boggling Time-Freezing Battles</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2555950/extras/battle_gif_20240808_cropped.gif?t=1736500916\" />When Moma moves, so does the enemy, but when Moma stops, the enemy stops too. In this time-freezing battle system, you will engage in hectic, overwhelming battles... one physical step at a time. Every enemy attack and the power of each attack is clearly shown on-screen, which means you can take your time to analyze the situation and deal with them one by one.

Scanning the upcoming areas is crucial to effective exploration, and by doing so you can choose between a wide variety of floors.
