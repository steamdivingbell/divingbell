{"about_the_game":"MiG-15bis for DCS World is an easy-to-learn aircraft module that is based on the full-fidelity DCS: MiG-15bis. A more accessible Flaming Cliffs-style control concept allows new players to quickly jump into the plane and have fun. At the same time, the full-fidelity physics of the original model is preserved, providing the same professional-level flight characteristics and sense of flight. This version of the MiG-15bis is available both as part of DCS: Flaming Cliffs 4 and as a dedicated module purchase.<br><br>In the 50s of the last century, the MiG-15 was a highly-capable clear-weather interceptor and light ground attack aircraft that saw much action in Korean war. It was the first swept-wing jet fighter to come out of the Mikoyan-Gurevich stable in the late 1940s. MiG-15 maneuverability and high transonic speed made it superior to all UN aircraft except the F-86 Sabre. <br><br>A powerful 37mm autocannon in the lower right fuselage (40 rounds total) and 2 \u00d7 23mm autocannon in the lower left fuselage (80 rounds per gun, 160 rounds total) give the MiG-15bis tremendous punch.
