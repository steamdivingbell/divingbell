Tight control, good challenging difficulty level. In case you missed it like me you can dash with the shift key.\u201d<br>jwpalensky<br><br>\u201cA viewer had me play this game because it shares my name (as good a reason as any I suppose). And I had a fun 30 mins with it, in which time I completed about half the levels. So it's not going to be a long game unless you really struggle. But for the price that's probably reasonable.  While this isn't really my genre it seems like there are a few things done right here. The dash is a fun twist that factors into your strategy a lot. The levels felt tight to me, though not a big fan of the wind. Controls overall felt decent though Ziggy could be a little faster.  Here's the VoD of my play session if you want a better look:   Thanks for the giggles.\u201d<br>ZiggyD<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2190320/ss_7ed56177b648fa2060b405839490734993dfda3c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1728298416","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2190320/ss_7ed56177b648fa2060b405839490734993dfda3c.600x338.jpg?t=1728298416"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2190320/ss_ebb013aa663a84056f8f1a8b3267b1c36bd932cf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1728298416","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2190320/ss_ebb013aa663a84056f8f1a8b3267b1c36bd932cf.600x338.jpg?t=1728298416"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2190320/ss_234ea831ddc7b684a78d1c3d0c5bf91a27f47ba7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1728298416","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2190320/ss_234ea831ddc7b684a78d1c3d0c5bf91a27f47ba7.600x338.jpg?t=1728298416"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2190320/ss_12a842963c3983b4f2e82c7ed81d6ae764384cc2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1728298416","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2190320/ss_12a842963c3983b4f2e82c7ed81d6ae764384cc2.600x338.jpg?t=1728298416"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2190320/ss_e01f0ef84605d74d25c25cc106ac448ca1049b4f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1728298416","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2190320/ss_e01f0ef84605d74d25c25cc106ac448ca1049b4f.600x338.jpg?t=1728298416"}],"short_description":"Ziggy is a challenging platformer about a small lightning bolt trying to get back home.
