{"about_the_game":"<strong>About Solar Bay </strong><br><br>3DMark Solar Bay tests how Windows and Android devices perform when gaming with ray tracing. Results can be compared between platforms. The Solar Bay stress test shows how performance changes over extended gaming sessions. <br><br>Real-time ray tracing brings new levels of realism to in-game graphics. Solar Bay uses Vulkan 1.1 ray tracing to generate realistic real-time reflections on devices running Android or Windows. <br><br>Solar Bay\u2019s ray traced workload increases over three stages, with each section increasing linearly by 100%. On PC, Solar Bay complements our heavier ray tracing benchmarks Port Royal and Speed Way. With it\u2019s three ray tracing benchmarks and the Raytracing feature test, 3DMark covers a wide range of ray tracing workloads, making it an excellent way to measure how your PC\u2019s ray tracing performance scales.   <br><br><strong>Solar Bay Stress Test </strong><br><br>The Solar Bay stress test is a longer test that shows how a device will perform over extended periods of ray traced gaming. It is designed to mirror a longer session of ray-traced gaming and runs the Solar Bay workload in a loop for twenty minutes.  <br><br>Instead of producing a single score, the main result from the stress test is a chart that shows you how the device\u2019s performance changed during the test. This chart can help you understand how your device manages performance and heat during heavy use.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2313300/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736855395","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2313300/page.bg.jpg?t=1736855395","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2313300/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736855395","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2313300/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736855395","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>About Solar Bay </strong><br><br>3DMark Solar Bay tests how Windows and Android devices perform when gaming with ray tracing.
