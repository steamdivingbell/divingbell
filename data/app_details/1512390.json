Hidden in the hollow of a valley, the village of Sainte-Monique-Des-Monts conceals a secret that weighs heavily on the community. The village is left abandoned. Those who remain can only wait.

You will find the old school adventure features that we all love: puzzle solving, exploring, dialogues, inventory, using and combining objects.<br><br><strong>Exploration</strong><br><br>Dynamic and highly-detailed environments are for you to explore. We created a full-scale village that holds many mysteries. Each door can be opened, each building can be entered. Using the 360\u00b0 panoramic viewing and the zoom in functionality, you can even examine every little detail that catches your eye. Is it too dark to see?

There are a lot of characters, their relationships are complex and they all hold a part of the secret.
