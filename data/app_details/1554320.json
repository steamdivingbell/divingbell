{"about_the_game":"Freedom Physics is a 2D physics Sandbox where you can build, create and share your own 2D physics levels and scenarios. Create your own conditions for victory or failure. Engineer complex objects to control and use in levels. <br><br>The main idea of how to &quot;Play the Game&quot; in Freedom Physics is actually to create your own content/levels/scenarios etc. Though there is some levels/content included with the game, there main purpose is to serve as examples.  Use them as starting points for your own levels, copy, edit and save them. <br><br>Making a level is as easy as creating a folder, throwing in a background image, the size of the level will automatically be adjusted to the size of the background images settings in pixels. Add a  music.wav file to add music to the level, etc. Then Load that folder with Freedom Physics and begin placing, connecting and editing objects. Adding events/actions to trigger when keys are pressed, or when objects collide etc.  Many options, events and object attributes to experiment and tinker around with. <br><br>There is also a dedicated website for uploading, viewing, downloaded, rating etc other levels &amp; content created by other users!
