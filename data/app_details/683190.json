Their unified goal: the preservation of humanity from the throes of the Gamma Strain pandemic. They must rescue and evacuate civilians, ensuring that the infection does not spread. <br><br>As with any virus, it's main prerogative is to evolve and disseminate. The <strong>Gamma Primes</strong>, victims mutated by the Gamma Strain, are the perfect catalyst for this task. As a Gamma Prime, you start the game embodying an infected rat.

They can bite corpses and Civilians activating the dormant virus within.  Once bitten, they will transform into Zombies.  When the transformation from Corpse to Zombie is complete, they can be bitten again, and the player embodies the Zombie. Players can then strategically choose when to evolve Into a Gamma Prime. Once they die, they spawn again as a rat, and the cycle continues until there are no more viable hosts left, or all of the Survivors are infected. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/683190/extras/CC_GammaPrimeEvolution.gif?t=1718221863\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/683190/extras/CC_RatBrigade616.gif?t=1718221863\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>CUSTOMIZABLE WEAPONS</strong></h2><br>Each Survivor has unique character-specific weapons and gadgets. Players can customize their weapons, to adapt to their own individual play style. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/683190/extras/CC_WeaponCase.gif?t=1718221863\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/683190/extras/CC_ThumperLoadout.png?t=1718221863\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/683190/extras/CC_WeaponCustomizationSlim.gif?t=1718221863\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>GADGETS</strong></h2>Survivors have standard gadgets, like rat traps, rat spray, and flashlights, but each Survivor has their own gadget sets, which allows for completely unique tactics.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>ABILITIES &amp; SKILLS</strong></h2>Survivors have SKILLS, and Gamma Primes have ABILITIES. Each character has an advancement tree which can be unlocked using the appropriate GNA or DNA.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>PERSISTENT CHARACTER PROGRESSION</strong></h2>Unlock and upgrade each character to your liking with branching upgrade options.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>BLING BLING</strong></h2>From genetically mutated cowl plates, to weapon skins and baubles, make your characters stand out.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>PACK MENTALITY</strong></h2>Multi-level maps combined with strong pack mentality/cohesion mechanics, moral conundrums, and survivor fortifications make Cold Comfort a heart-thumping visceral gaming experience that mixes organized tactical group planning with split-second decision making in real-world scale battles with up to 5 players per side.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>THE GAMMA STRAIN</strong></h2>A world ravaged by a deadly virus, the Gamma Strain. Commonly known as \u201cThe Sickness\u201c, it is an infectious disease caused by a mutation of the influenza virus. The Global Center for Disease and Prevention (GDC) declared an outbreak of a new type of Gamma Strain A to be a pandemic in June 2022.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>GENETIC MUTATIONS</strong></h2>The Gamma Prime are the true survivors, having mutated through the tampered Gamma Strain vaccine. Their enhanced abilities make them a force to be reckoned with.  Each Gamma Prime has their own special abilities that make them truly unique and require a completely different play style.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>DOWNED STATE</strong></h2>Death is the easy way out. When Survivors succumb to their wounds they enter the &quot;downed state&quot;. In this state, they can crawl around, and use their sidearms. Gamma Primes, however, can immobilize them while they are in this precarious and weakened state, and extract DNA from them. This &quot;farming mechanic&quot; is a balancing act. Extract too much DNA too quickly, and the Survivor will die. The extracted DNA can then be used after the match for the player to improve their own Survivor characters; unlocking new weapons, gadgets, and skills.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>COMMUNITY DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT</strong></h2>As game developers, we sometimes suffer from tunnel vision, and forget what is truly important to you, our fans! As an indie studio, Gamma Minus considers community feedback crucial in crafting enjoyable and memorable experiences. We want to invite players to take part in the common effort of making Cold Comfort the game you've always wanted to play. That is why we are very transparent in our regular progress reports and interaction with the growing community on our Discord Server.
