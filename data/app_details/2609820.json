{"about_the_game":"Nixie is a 2D story-driven exploration game about a robot\u2019s search for a missing human lost in an android space colony. Along the way, you\u2019ll meet charming friends, eccentric rivals, and sinister foes in a story full of twists. Slash, fling, and glide your way through an eclectic world, while enjoying colorful 16-bit pixel art and an infectious soundtrack!<br><br>This is the first publicly available version of Nixie and is meant for initial feedback from players. Please consider sending any comments and bug reports at <br><br>DEMO NOTES<br><br><strong>Saving</strong><br>The game currently does not save a game file. Progress is only saved while playing the demo. Returning to the title screen, finishing the demo, or quitting the game erases your progress. This of course will be addressed very soon, probably in the next major demo release. The demo is short enough to beat in one sitting. <br><br><strong>Map</strong><br>There is no interactive map in the game yet. This will obviously be added (hopefully in the near future) as it's a mandatory feature!<br><br><strong>Story </strong><br>There are no storyline elements yet - the game starts at what will most likely be the 2nd area of the game.<br><br><strong>Monitor Support</strong><br>-The demo has been primarily tested on 1920 by 1080 monitors. It has not been tested on any non-16:9 monitors. Anyone with different sized monitors are encouraged to send in screenshots of any display issues.<br><br>KNOWN BUGS<br><br>-Attacking upward rapidly while moving will sometimes cause Nixie to get stuck in the run animation. Ducking + attacking when this happens will release him from this state.<br>-Getting caught under the moving platform above the water will cause Nixie to remain &quot;parented&quot; to the platform after respawning. He'll slide left or right (depending on the platform's movement direction) even though he is no longer on the platform. <br>-Occasionally when reaching the top of a ladder, Nixie will not automatically detach from it. This happens more often when entering a room already on a ladder, such as in the saver room before the boss.","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2609820/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1695330877","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2609820/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1695330877","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Nixie is a 2D story-driven exploration game about a robot\u2019s search for a missing human lost in an android space colony.
