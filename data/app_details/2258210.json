{"about_the_game":"Pyreside\u00a0Waltz is a fantasy-romance visual novel set in a fictional kingdom inspired by Russian fairytales. The story follows Motya, an artificial doll who awakens after an accident without their memories. As they try to figure out who they are and what they are meant to do, they encounter a cast of inhuman denizens, each with their own unique motivations and relationships to explore. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe player can pursue one of five different suitors, each with unique Live2D models and animations (which can be exchanged for static sprites if desired). Though the game will include some light body horror imagery and dramatic elements, it is a romance at its core, with a focus on getting to know the various characters and seeing how their lives intertwine. The demo carries a roughly PG-13 rating.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2258210/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1672513226","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2258210/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1672513226","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2258210/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1672513226","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2258210/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1672513226","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Pyreside\u00a0Waltz is a fantasy-romance visual novel set in a fictional kingdom inspired by Russian fairytales.
