{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Run Heroes Run</strong> is based on the roguelike genre, where you assemble your team of heroes and equip them for an adventure. How does our variation of a roguelike differ from others? The first distinction is that battles occur in real-time with active pauses for more comfortable gameplay, rather than being turn-based. The build system consists of several modules:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0Selecting three heroes for the adventure (in the demo, we limited it to three fully developed heroes, though five more are currently in production, and seven are in the concept stage)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0Choosing active abilities for the heroes that the player will use in battles and level up over time.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0Selecting passive abilities for each hero on each level, the player can choose a passive skill for the hero that will either permanently enhance them or trigger under specific conditions automatically).</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0Equipping heroes with artifacts that empower them until the end of the run.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0Collecting consumables during the run, which are divided into targeted (applied to a specific target or area chosen by the player) and mass items that affect all heroes or enemies at once.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">All of these elements synergize with each other, offering almost limitless build variations, allowing you to combine and develop your hero team in different ways based on your preferred playstyle.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3260800/extras/ezgif-4-b9f4f58a65.gif?t=1728925906\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>The Adventure</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The run in our game is represented by a procedurally generated adventure map.

For the full version of the game, we are developing additional domains for Artemis, Poseidon, and Zeus. Each domain will feature its own fearsome boss, a unique set of enemies with special abilities, and players will need to devise tactics to effectively fight them.
