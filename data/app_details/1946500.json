Fear begins to overwhelm you like freezing water around a drowning man. The whole world goes black again. <br><br>You open your eyes but this time you are in an open field where only a single, majestic, and glowing tree stands tall and proud... It\u2019s soothing. You meet your spirit animal next to that tree, a wise cat; She is battered but not beaten. She tells you that you are in a mental hospital because of an evil entity called the Sickness and in order to save yourself you have to go on a journey into your mind, confront your fears, remember your past, and overthrow the Sickness! <br><br>You feel terrified but seeing as how this is the only way, you firmly nod in agreement. <br><br>You begin your journey as the strongest character you knew in your childhood from a game called Astronaut Jack, A manifestation of your will to fight, hoping this time, you set things right. <br><br>Jack Pilgrim: Space Within is a first-person-shooter, story-driven psychological thriller game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>HAUNTINGLY ATMOSPHERIC </strong></h2>Jack's mind is a crumbling but wonderful place of both beauty and agony, dreams and nightmares, old things and new things.
