Their Fire Arrow capabilities mean they synergise well with Bright Wizards, and they grant reload-rate bonuses to other Imperial missile units. <br> <br><strong>Archers</strong><br>The backbone of Wulfhart\u2019s hunting-parties, these Imperial archers are inexpensive, plentiful, quick to fire, and are great at soaking enemy formations with ranged damage. Their loose formation enables them to trade fire with other ranged units at a profit.<br> <br><strong>Deathjacks (Archers \u2013 Regiments of Renown)</strong><br>These elite archers also have Stalk, Snipe and Vanguard Deployment, enabling them to strike fast, strike first, and remain hidden from view. If well-screened, they can continue to fire without fear of discovery or ranged retaliation.<br> <br><strong>Huntsmen:</strong><br>Only the finest archers ascend to the rank of Huntsmen. Well-drilled and versatile, they have Vanguard Deployment and Stalk, can fire while moving, have a greater range than standard Archers, enjoy a good degree of accuracy, and deal bonus damage to large targets.<br> <br><strong>White Wolves (Huntsmen \u2013 Regiment of Renown)</strong><br>Few face the White Wolves and live to tell of it. These elite Huntsmen match their bow-skills with ruthless melee capabilities, granting them a useful hybrid role. Alongside their Hunter attributes, they also Encourage nearby friendlies and are Immune to Psychology. <br>  <br><strong>War Wagon</strong><br>These mobile armoured wagons are packed with six riflemen, each armed with an armour-piercing Outrider rifle. Slower than standard missile cavalry but far more resilient, they can fire while moving and in all directions, and reposition to place their fusillades precisely where required. In a pinch, they can also be used as chariots and charged into lighter or weakened enemy units.<br> <br><strong>War Wagon (Mortar)</strong><br>These mobile artillery pieces may carry less ammo than standard mortars, but more than make up for it by being able to stay one step ahead of melee combatants, repositioning when threatened to set up a new base-of-fire and bombard the foe afresh. <br> <br><strong>The Black Lions (War Wagon - Helblaster Volley Gun \u2013 Regiment of Renown)</strong><br>The ultimate unit in The Expedition\u2019s armoury, The Black Lion is a devastating mobile light artillery piece.

Many look to disrupt it, but none defend it as devoutly as Nakai the Wanderer. <br><br>Nakai begins play with a vassal faction called the Defenders of the Great Plan \u2013 the caretakers of the great Temple Cities. When one of Nakai\u2019s armies captures a region, it may be gifted to the Defenders.

Combining their terrifying melee power with four giant blowpipes and eight skinks hurling poisoned javelins, it is the ultimate multirole unit. <br> <br><strong>Shredder of Lustria (Dread Saurian Howdah \u2013 Regiment of Renown)</strong><br><br>With rank nine stats, Encourage, and a passive hex aura reducing nearby enemy leadership, The Shredder of Lustria is truly a one-unit army \u2013 and comes with a pricetag to match.<br> <br><strong>Sacred Kroxigors</strong><br>These versatile and hard-hitting monstrous infantry are great all-rounders.
