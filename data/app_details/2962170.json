{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">BEYOND TENMEI can be described as a solo board game adventure where dice determine what spaces you land on, how much damage you deal and take, and what happens during various events.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The dice won't always roll in your favor, but you can spend MP to cast Spells and change any dice on the board. Weigh the cost of doing so carefully, however, as running out of MP before a bad roll can be rather grave!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Combatants will react to the dice based on what Talents they possess. Keep the dice off of values that benefit the opponent, aim for triggering your own beneficial effects, and fight back against RNG!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game can be played methodically with long, well-planned turns, or briskly in quicker sessions. Play through Story Mode once, or do just one more run in Hero Mode with harsher modifiers. Truly formidable foes and rewarding victories await those who see what the game has to offer, but you're free to do so at your own pace!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>-GAME MODES-</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">BEYOND TENMEI features a variety of game-modes to appeal to fans of the &quot;Rogue-lite&quot; genre as well as the linear story-based progression you've come to expect from more traditional RPGs. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Brave Mode</strong> - Journey as a lone Brave of Salvation against the Demon Duke's forces in a 100-space, rogue-lite session where you choose new spells as you progress!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Rebel Mode</strong> - Having trouble with Brave Mode?
