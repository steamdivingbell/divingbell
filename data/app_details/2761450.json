{"about_the_game":"You are invited to an unconventional virtual experience that is all at once artistic, impressive, and inspiring!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Pronovost Art experience is a virtual museum visit that allows you to discover, immerse in, and contemplate the artist\u2019s monumental works in all their striking angles. Photos and videos hardly do justice to the work of the artist, that is why Jean Pronovost has decided to undertake, with his skilled team and cutting-edge technologies, the task of bringing to life a virtual gallery, where dimensional and awe-inspiring art can be felt in a truly immersive way. Here for the first time, all of Pronovost\u2019s works can be found in one place, allowing the visitor to truly appreciate their scale, power, and presence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVisitors can wander freely at their own pace through this virtual gallery, which was inspired by the Pinacoteca of Sao Paulo in Brazil, an architectural marvel that left an indelible mark on the artist when he travelled there. The virtual experience viewer will be able to fully immerse themselves in Jean\u2019s universe in their own way, without interruption, time limit, or other visitors getting in the way!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArtist\u2019s statement:<br />\r\nJean Pronovost\u2019s art is not decorative. It is neither wholly abstract nor simply figurative. His art is visionary, allegorical. His creations are open books leading us through a universe where the strange and mystical reign. With the whip of a paintbrush, he carries us to the heart of an Inca legend or into the urban jungle. With a swing of a spatula, he reanimates a God faded from our memories or challenges our humdrum routine. With striking realism, his paintings and sculptures unveil a universe where yesterday\u2019s signs can interact with our modern world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFascinated with history and mythology, but also inspired by the magic of symbolism, Jean Pronovost uses archetypes rooted in ancient civilizations. He breathes life into gods and legends which constitute the background of his creations. He skillfully blends anachronism with ancient pictorial techniques, thus offering creations to contemplate but also to decrypt, as so many details subtly illustrate his allegorical vision of the world. Delicate touches of color and richness of shape then overlay thoughtful paintings and sculptures, bringing depth to scenes of contemporary life and ancient metaphors. Elegy for the essential and critic of all false values, the work of Jean Pronovost opens the door to an alternative universe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the world where the conscience loses its way on the path towards material gain, where the meaning of our life decays inside a society promoting individualism and power struggle, the artist questions our origins and offers his own personal vision of the world.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2761450/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1715227162","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2761450/page.bg.jpg?t=1715227162","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2761450/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1715227162","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2761450/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1715227162","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"Contains nudity."},"detailed_description":"You are invited to an unconventional virtual experience that is all at once artistic, impressive, and inspiring!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Pronovost Art experience is a virtual museum visit that allows you to discover, immerse in, and contemplate the artist\u2019s monumental works in all their striking angles.
