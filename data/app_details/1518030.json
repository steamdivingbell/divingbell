Use your superior driving skills to avoid them, or turn your tank's cannon and blast them away.<br><br>Each time you fire and hit a vehicle, you can gain extra time, and if you achieve consecutive hits, you can accumulate combo points and earn bonus time based on your maximum combo.

If you get stuck in traffic, you'll be helpless, and the smoke from the destroyed vehicles will block your vision, making it hard to see ahead.
