{"about_the_game":"<i>A Legionary's Life</i> lets you play as a Roman soldier during the years of the Second Punic War and beyond. Rise up through the ranks and win prestigious awards or just focus on making it home in one piece; it's up to you.<br><br>This is a unique single-player game with RPG elements, extensive usage of attribute and skill checks, a turn-based combat system involving many variables (including morale, reach, confined space and high ground) and a touch of roguelike features. Among them, permadeath. If you are unfamiliar with the term, it means you'll have to start over if your character dies; but don't worry: the game is designed to be replayable and you'll see only a fraction of it in each run. Also, you'll be able to spend points on your next legionary based on how well your most successful characters performed.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Try the demo</h2>This game is unlike most RPGs. Your character won't be successful at everything. Challenges should be picked carefully based on your legionary's strengths and weaknesses. In general, the game is not designed to put you in a situation where the odds are against you unless you willingly step into it. At times, you may fail to perform a task and take a mild penalty in Morale and/or Opinions (a measure of your relationships with relevant entities within the game, like your superiors and your fellow soldiers). Don't get discouraged when this happens, it is nothing more than a minor setback you can easily recover from.<br><br>Most of all, I strongly recommend that you try the demo before you buy this game. It's here on Steam and it's free, there's no better way to make sure that <i>A Legionary's Life</i> suits your taste. The demo contains the first 3 parts out of 11.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Carthago Nova","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1058430/a3465d3aa8b180a79681d8c5b1465497d664bc94.jpg"},{"name":"Master Spy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1058430/c897f641702ba1a8224d1dfb5fa146e57fa9bd39.jpg"},{"name":"Duelist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1058430/76036fa7a0a0b7bc301ab2f8823d1ca68a7ef9d0.jpg"},{"name":"Champion","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1058430/24ad2bd0308fe4e664528308f2eccf78245758dd.jpg"},{"name":"Distinguished","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1058430/4b6f29725bcc4d6131963990d32fdc167ad98e40.jpg"},{"name":"Prominent","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1058430/ff5f6d17894145549b09d6f2606c2ba22989c3be.jpg"},{"name":"Hero","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1058430/ce8a72ef1e2579bcce5e90b8cf47588547f7b26c.jpg"},{"name":"Ob Civem Servatum I","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1058430/f7f6d7f8ae827ff00ec2660806b02a768a6b8353.jpg"},{"name":"Ob Civem Servatum II","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1058430/b265ba01f59163e34d492ed00b74a2ab8d755066.jpg"},{"name":"First Man Over The Wall","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1058430/0d8c3b3663792c896ea09f88f84389406f883372.jpg"}],"total":40},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1058430/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726475415","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1058430/page.bg.jpg?t=1726475415","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1058430/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726475415","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1058430/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726475415","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":1074450,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<i>A Legionary's Life</i> lets you play as a Roman soldier during the years of the Second Punic War and beyond.
