{"about_the_game":"Paper Protocol is a Tower Defense game where you and a squad of high tech turrets are tasked with defending the Paper Co. building from angry trees! Control and upgrade a versatile mech and a variety of turrets to defend from the trees.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2965610/extras/BasicUpgradeMontage2.gif?t=1715369629\" /><br>With so many possibilities of upgrades for both the turrets and yourself, there's a plethora of ways to defend! Each turret and yourself have the option of 3 main cores, Hellraiser, Saboteur, and Overdriver. Each are focused on a differing game plan. Hellraiser is all about dealing more damage and using brute force to destroy the trees. The Saboteur core slows, stuns and in other ways hinders the trees to give the turret battalion a better chance to take them out. Overdriver is geared towards helping your other turrets deal more damage and stay at the top of their game.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2965610/extras/BogHagShowcase.gif?t=1715369629\" /><br>The enemy trees aren't pushovers though! Each enemy has unique stats and some have abilities that can get out of hand if not handled correctly! Anywhere from more move speed, to an explosion on death that stuns all nearby turrets. Each enemy brings their own unique threat.<br><br>Advance through the different difficulties and maps to conquer the trees!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2965610/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1715369629","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2965610/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1715369629","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2965610/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1715369629","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2965610/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1715369629","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Paper Protocol is a Tower Defense game where you and a squad of high tech turrets are tasked with defending the Paper Co. building from angry trees!
