{"about_the_game":"<strong>The Bus</strong> is a city bus simulation game in which you drive different buses on different routes around Berlin. The German capital is realistically recreated at a scale of 1:1 and offers many famous sights to discover - be it the Victory Column, the Brandenburg Gate or Alexanderplatz. <br><br>In the Scania Citywide or other licensed buses, you sell tickets to passengers for their journey and experience Berlin anew through the changing times of day, seasons and weather. AI traffic with vehicles and pedestrians as well as complex traffic light systems bring the virtual city to life, and with various customization tools and editors such as the repaint function or mods, you can make <strong>The Bus</strong> your own.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/491540/extras/Features.jpg?t=1739267235\" /><br><br>This list will be regularly updated with new features and content during the Early Access phase:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>TXL, 100, 200 and 300 bus lines with various routes<br></li><li>Original licensed buses from MAN and Scania<br></li><li>Different bus variants: Articulated bus, solo bus, double decker and eCitaro<br></li><li>Large and detailed 1:1 scale map of the German capital city Berlin<br></li><li>Many different points of interest in Berlin<br></li><li>Freeplay single player mode: Transport passengers on any line with the vehicle of your choice<br></li><li>Freedom of movement: Move freely inside the vehicles and the world<br></li><li>Embarking and disembarking passengers, including ticket sales<br></li><li>AI traffic featuring different types of vehicles, pedestrians and complex traffic lights<br></li><li>Full day and night cycle with weather and seasons<br></li><li>Line, route, timetable and tour editors<br></li><li>Bus repaint function<br></li><li>Photo mode to create your own high-quality screenshots<br></li><li>Two integrated web radio channels: DoubleBass.FM and FlashBass.FM<br></li><li>Modding Editor for Unreal Engine 5 Game Editor (available separately and free of charge)<br></li><li>Multiple control modes: Realistic, Arcade and Custom<br></li><li>Control via keyboard and mouse or Xbox Game Controller<br></li><li>Supports multiple steering wheels with and without pedals<br></li><li>Supports multiple eye tracking devices </li></ul>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/491540?t=1739267235","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/491540?t=1739267235","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/491540/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739267235","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/491540/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739267235","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h1>Early Access Roadmap</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/491540/extras/EA_Roadmap.jpg?t=1739267235\" /><br>This is the roadmap for the development of <strong>The Bus</strong> during the Early Access phase.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/491540/extras/EA_Phase2.0.jpg?t=1739267235\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Bus is currently in Phase 2.0 of the Early Access.</h2>Phase 2.0 will receive additional regular updates with more features and content before we update to Phase 3.0.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Freeplay multiplayer mode<br></li><li>Extension of bus line 200<br></li><li>Additional bus line 245 with different routes<br></li><li>New bus variants: VDL Citea LLE and VDL Citea SLFA<br></li><li>AI buses<br></li><li>True to original Indira Ghandi Street depot with connection to all bus lines<br></li><li>Controller support </li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/491540/extras/EA_Phase3.0.jpg?t=1739267235\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Phase 3.0 will be available during the Early Access.</h2>Phase 3.0 will receive additional regular updates with more features and content before we update fully release <strong>The Bus</strong>.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Single player economy mode:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Create your own bus company<br></li><li>Buy vehicles and hire staff<br></li><li>Maintain and repair the vehicles in your fleet<br></li><li>Generate revenue by selling vehicles and tickets</li></ul></li><li>Multiplayer economy mode<br></li><li>Additional and final bus variants<br></li><li>AI trams<br></li><li>Announcements and NPC audio dialogue<br></li><li>Open hub: Freely navigable area between Berlin Central Station and Potsdamer Platz, including the Tiergarten Tunnel<br></li><li>Full tutorial and checklists</li></ul><br>The content and order of features in the roadmap <i>may</i> change before and during the Early Access.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong>The Bus</strong> is a city bus simulation game in which you drive different buses on different routes around Berlin.
