{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dyskairos is an FPS with simple retro-style visuals and some roguelike and metroidvania-like elements. Ascend a mysterious tower, battling its current and former inhabitants - as well as the tower itself - along the way.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You are a traveler trapped near the tower, whose only way out is to replace a special crystal that powers your travel. To do so, you must reach the upper floors where it is being kept. Along the way, you'll find unique abilities that will unlock new pathways, expanding your access to the tower's secrets.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Once you enter, the tower begins to prepare a &quot;cleansing cycle&quot;, giving you only a few minutes inside at a time. Once the cycle completes, items within the tower are randomized. A keycard that was in one place before a cycle may be in a different place after. You'll need to adapt to the tower's constantly changing nature while you make progress from floor to floor.</p>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3463170?t=1739692838","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3463170/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1739692838","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3463170/d1c22a0ec9b78ed282874af789bce57a8f5df151/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739692838","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3463170/d1c22a0ec9b78ed282874af789bce57a8f5df151/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739692838","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dyskairos is an FPS with simple retro-style visuals and some roguelike and metroidvania-like elements.
