{"about_the_game":"&quot;Starfinder RPG - Starfinder Adventure Path #50: Clockwork Demons (Drift Hackers 2 of 3)<br> <br> To begin restoring trust between the factions of a fractured Church of Triune, the heroes must get their leaders to agree to a summit. This meeting takes place in the city's most popular tavern, which doubles as a museum of clockworks. When the talks end, all sides agree that to restore Alluvion, they must first oust the heretical interlopers within the Temple of Triune. But suddenly, the clockwork exhibits lurch to life and the heroes must fight their way through the building to shut them all down. Afterward, the PCs travel up a river of elemental water to reach a secret entrance to the temple, where they must deal with the implacable guardian of Triune's holy computers.Clockwork Demons is a Starfinder adventure for four 9th-level characters, continuing the 3-volume Drift Hackers Adventure Path. Drift Hackers is part of the Drift Crisis, an event taking place across the entire Starfinder game line, in which faster-than-light travel breaks down and the galaxy is thrown into chaos. In addition to the adventure itself, this book includes an examination of the Church of Triune, as well as an Adventure Toolbox filled with a collection of sci-fi clockwork gear and strange alien creatures.
