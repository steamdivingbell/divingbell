{"about_the_game":"Famed theater director Jack Cosmo (Joe Piscopo) is down on his luck and owes a large sum of money to Big Mike (Paul Sorvino) a violent loan shark. Luckily Big Mike is a fan of Cosmo's work, and makes him an offer he can't refuse: Put on a new hit show in under a week, and his debts will be forgiven. The catch is he can only use people also in debt to Big Mike, the main issue is they are all drug users, criminals, or insane. Complicating matters further is that the F.B.I. is investigating Big Mike, and decides to send in field agent, and musical theater aficionado Ethan Trimble (Erich Bergen) to investigate his connection to Cosmo. Attempting to help Jack find his muse so they can continue the investigation, Ethan recruits Jack's estranged daughter Sarah (Erika Christensen) to reconcile with her father. Will they be able to put on the show in time, or will it be curtains for Jack?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/803210/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1530656815","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/803210/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1530656815","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/803210/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1530656815","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/803210/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1530656815","categories":[{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Native Steam Controller Support","id":33},{"description":"Captions available","id":13}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h1>Steam Video</h1><p>This content is only available in an online streaming format.
