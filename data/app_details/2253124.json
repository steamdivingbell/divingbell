{"about_the_game":"Due to its unique inverted gull wing design, the F4U Corsair is one of the most recognizable and iconic U.S. Navy and Marine fighter aircraft of World War II. This updated and upgraded version of the E-flite\u00ae F4U-4 Corsair 1.2m features a factory-installed 3S and 4S compatible power system with an exclusive 70A Smart Lite ESC to deliver more capabilities and performance. The BNF\u00ae Basic version also includes a telemetry-capable AR631 receiver with both AS3X\u00ae and optional-use SAFE\u00ae Select technologies that make it easier to fly than ever before. The airframe is now finished in the iconic &quot;all blue&quot; trim scheme and includes separate decal sheets to customize it with MARINES, NAVY, and other markings. Factory-installed rotating retracts with strut covers, plus operational flaps, take your scale warbird experience to another level!<br><br>This model is equipped with Horizon Hobby and Spektrum exclusive AS3X (Artificial Stabilization \u2013 3-aXis) and optional-use SAFE (Sensor Assisted Flight Envelope) Select technologies, and when SAFE Select is turned on using the mode switch (B on the Spektrum InterLink DX controller) it offers:<br><strong>Pitch and Bank Angle Limits</strong><br>These envelope limits keep the airplane from rolling or pitching upside down.  They also prevent excessive climb or dive angles.<br><strong>Automatic Self-Leveling</strong><br>The airplane instantly returns to and holds level flight when the sticks are released and in the center position.  It\u2019s also helpful for keeping the wings level during takeoffs and landings.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2253124/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1710365493","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2253124/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1710365493","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2253124/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1710365493","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2253124/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1710365493","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Due to its unique inverted gull wing design, the F4U Corsair is one of the most recognizable and iconic U.S. Navy and Marine fighter aircraft of World War II.
