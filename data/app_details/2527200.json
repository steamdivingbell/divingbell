They mostly come in the way of Takedown Melee attacks.\r\nIt can be in the form of piercing an enemy through with a sword, stabbing an enemy multiple times with a Knife, teleporting a point/sharp weapon or tool directly into an enemy's skull, or even just breaking an enemy's neck.\r\n\r\nThere will be the optional dripping blood from wounds that will appear on most flat floor surfaces around the enemy or player taking damage. This option can easily be turned off.\r\n\r\nThe use of Tabaco is frequent but random. The enemy soldiers often take a quick smoke break on their patrols.\r\n\r\nThere are rare uses of profanity, strong language and such insinuations in the form of insults."},"detailed_description":"In 'SameShadow,' you'll step into a world where extraordinary powers of teleportation, matter manipulation, and time-bending abilities await your awakening.
