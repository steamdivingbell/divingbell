Guided by a disembodied voice speaking from the shadows, Eve overcomes dangerous obstacles and solves challenging puzzles on a journey to find her brother and herself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the heart of the mystery sits two rival families, each with their own dark secrets. The more Eve uncovers of the feuding houses and the closer she gets to finding her brother, the more she\u2019ll wish she remained amnesiac. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMistcaller is a supernatural puzzle platformer inspired by games like Limbo.
