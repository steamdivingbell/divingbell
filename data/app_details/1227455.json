{"about_the_game":"VBA-M is a handheld system with the goal to improve integrating the best features from the various builds floating around. It also supports most retro handhelds (borders, palette).

VBA Next is a faster, performance focused version that might not necessarily be as accurate as VBA-M. VBA Next also excludes 8bit handheld system support, and focuses solely on the 32bit handheld system instead.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1227455?t=1677704763","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1227455/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1677704763","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1227455/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1677704763","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1227455/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1677704763","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"VBA-M is a handheld system with the goal to improve integrating the best features from the various builds floating around.
