{"about_the_game":"Mimik is a local multiplayer game in which players hide, seek and tag each other. In the standard game mode, one player is assigned the role of the &quot;it&quot; player, the rest are &quot;not it&quot;. During matches, every puck is visible, forcing &quot;not it&quot; players to hide by 'mimicking' the behavior of the NPCs around them. There is nowhere to hide except in plain sight.<br />\r\nMimik comes with a hand-full of preset game modes to enjoy. It also gives players access to the match settings used to make the rules for each of these unique game modes. Thus making every game mode a customizable experience, as well as allowing players to come up with their own game modes.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2326240?t=1707765625","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2326240/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1707765625","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2326240/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1707765625","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2326240/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1707765625","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Mimik is a local multiplayer game in which players hide, seek and tag each other.
