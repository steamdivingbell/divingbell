{"about_the_game":"Do you love jigsaw puzzles and 3D simulations? So do we. Regrettably, we are not enjoying as many physical puzzles as we would like to. The reasons are usually simple but hard to circumvent: not enough personal time to spend on hours-long sessions, not enough space at home to keep a half-finished puzzle around for days, no friends around to help you build when you want to. 3D simulations, on the other hand, have become more and more intricate in replicating reality. They allow us to enter a virtual world to seek the same entertainment as we used to do in the physical world before.<br><br>That\u2019s why we want to give you the ultimate jigsaw puzzle experience with our game <strong>Masters of Puzzle</strong>. It\u2019s a full 3D, physics enabled, beautiful simulation that you can enjoy whenever you want with whomever you want. Enjoy dozens of UHD puzzles in different styles and earn hundreds of achievements to show your mastery of puzzle building. Store your progress on any puzzle and resume at your convenience. Keep track of your and your friends' accomplishments, participate in regular and special events, enter into contests, and do so much more. Our incredible game aims to give you as much flexibility and entertainment as possible.<br><br>Masters of Puzzle is <strong>not</strong> a typical casual game, though. To experience the full 3D simulation of puzzle building in all its great aspects, you will need to invest time, master all the controls, and discover all the possible ways to manipulate your game environment. Once you accumulate sufficient skill and understanding of the puzzle assembly process, we guarantee you many hours of satisfactory gameplay.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/810360/extras/banner1.png?t=1625682815\" /><br>Let us introduce you to the pleasure of building realistic jigsaw puzzles in a fully simulated, beautiful environment with active physics. Interact with surfaces, items, and the puzzle tiles themselves as if you\u2019re standing in front of your real-world puzzle table. Use the same approach and habits you\u2019ve always used before \u2013 but in a purely virtual scene instead. Create new strategies and explore all the various tools and gameplay preferences we offer - like sorting tiles in containers, gathering them in your virtual hand, or just scattering them around in pure pleasure.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/810360/extras/banner2.png?t=1625682815\" /><br>All of our puzzles are generated procedurally based on a huge number of settings \u2013 some of these are even adjustable by yourself in the game options. Each puzzle can be sliced and distributed into one of the available box sizes at the start of each individual game. Furthermore, the form and disposition of the puzzle tiles can be completely changed when you create a new game even if you still use the same image and box size. Replay your favorite puzzles again and again with a fresh challenge every single time.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/810360/extras/banner3.png?t=1625682815\" /><br>Speaking of challenge, our current puzzle box sizes include sets for beginners - <strong>250</strong>, <strong>500</strong>, <strong>750</strong>, and <strong>1000</strong>; sets for experienced players - <strong>1500</strong> and <strong>2000</strong>; and sets for hardcore players - <strong>2500</strong>, <strong>3000</strong>, and <strong>4000</strong> tiles.

These limited achievements - or challenges, as we call them - can be earned only under special circumstances and usually only inside the limited timeframe of an event.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/810360/extras/banner5.png?t=1625682815\" /><br>The base game comes with a good selection of <strong>free puzzles</strong> for you to enjoy.

A lot of these will be <i>completely free</i> if you own the base game and you will be able to get them as soon as they are made available. Others, mostly the illustrations provided by our partnering artists, will have to be purchased because artists are people too. We are aware of the controversy of DLCs and the love-hate relationship between them and gamers all over the world. However, there are some good reasons for us to structure the game in such a way.<br><br>First, we plan to provide you with new high-quality content on a regular basis. The easiest way to release that content quickly and efficiently is via DLC packages. Second, the UHD quality of our illustrations means that each puzzle box might often be well over 100 Mbs in size. You should not have to download tens of gigabytes of content that you might not currently need to play the game. And last but not least, the diversity of the art we plan to provide will often make certain puzzles click with different people. It is important that the right content for our diverse players can be found easily and quickly.<br><br>Remember, you <i>don't have to</i> acquire all of the DLCs for Masters of Puzzle. You only need to get the puzzle boxes you like and want to collect and play with.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Do you love jigsaw puzzles and 3D simulations? So do we.
