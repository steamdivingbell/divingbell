{"about_the_game":"Welcome to the Null, a surrealist non-space between worlds, times and concepts, populated by outcasts and detritus from across existence. As a lone, self-serving agent of mayhem on a personal mission, sneak, brawl, shoot and swing your way through immersive, open-ended heists.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FLOWER OF STRIFE</h2><br>Control Eris, mysterious disaster-woman maestra on a journey across fantastical locations, no matter who stands in her way. Infiltrate from rooftops, hide in shadows, swing with the grappling tether and more. Ditching subtlety, go up against fantastical characters with larger-than-life melee/firearm hybrid combat inspired by kung-fu films, fighting games, anime and Garry's Mod. No, that last one's serious.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BLOOMING POSSIBILITIES</h2><br>Forget skill trees, experience or inventories. HEARTRENDER employs the Petal system, where you adapt and fluidly exchange abilities from ethereal vases strewn across missions, from a vast array of firearms complete with secondary firing functions to showstopping superpowers of all kinds. A revolver that crystallizes bullets into explosions of pure light. A boomeranging disc of searing light. Flying like a jet and even summoning a motorcycle from thin air. You're an improvised arsenal of mayhem. Act like it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">RETRODIGITAL SURREALIST DAYDREAM</h2><br>Inspired by the famous 20th artistic movement of surrealism and classic 90s adventure games with pre-rendered backgrounds - yet shamelessly powered by the Unreal Engine - HEARTRENDER brings its world-between-worlds setting to strange, beautiful life, including high-class lighting and audio.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">AN IMMERSIVE, SYSTEMIC WORLD OF DETRITUS</h2><br>The Null is an unprecedented place. Learning from classics like Thief, Deus Ex and Dishonored, fantasy and sci-fi collide in a playground where tumbling objects, power grids, vehicles and assorted arcane artifacts occupy the same space as forgetful magical machines, dutybound ghosts from senseless wars, well-dressed birdpeople and more.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2457640?t=1719684709","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2457640/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1719684709","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2457640/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1719684709","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2457640/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1719684709","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"HEARTRENDER contains several instances of intense content.
