{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What is You Make The Game?</h2>Welcome to You Make The Game, a community-driven game development experience! We want to create a game based on YOUR ideas and feedback. This project is an ongoing prototype, updated regularly with new features based on your input. If you\u2019ve ever wanted to help shape a game from the ground up, this is your chance!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How Does It Work?</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Play the latest build of the game and experiment with what we\u2019ve made so far.<br></li><li>Share your thoughts, ideas, and feedback in our Discord or drop a comment on our latest YouTube dev logs.<br></li><li>Watch the game evolve! We release updates based on community feedback, and you\u2019ll see your ideas come to life.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Why Are We Doing This?</h2>We\u2019re a small team of two devs working part-time on You Make The Game. After releasing our previous game Block-ed, we realized how much fun it would be to involve the community from the start. We love working on creative games, but we also know that the best games are built with the players in mind. That\u2019s where you come in!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What You Can Expect:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Regular updates that incorporate community ideas<br></li><li>Full transparency on development progress through dev logs<br></li><li>An open and welcoming environment to share your thoughts and suggestions</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Community-Driven Development: Your ideas help shape the game! Suggest mechanics, features, or anything else you think would be fun.<br></li><li>Regular Updates: Each new YouTube video dev log brings new features to the game. Playtest them and give feedback to guide the next steps.<br></li><li>Interactive Community: Join our Discord to discuss your ideas directly with us and other players. Together, we'll brainstorm, build, and refine the game.<br></li><li>Fun and Experimental Gameplay: The game is still in its early stages, but every update will bring new elements for you to explore. Whether it's level design, mechanics, or art style\u2014we're figuring it out together!</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Why Your Ideas Matter</h2>In You Make The Game, we aim to build something that YOU want to play. Every suggestion, no matter how big or small, helps us craft the best possible experience. We can\u2019t promise that every idea will make it into the game, but we do promise to listen and consider all feedback. Keep in mind, we\u2019re a small team working part-time, so while we can\u2019t implement everything, we love working with the community to figure out what\u2019s most fun!<br><br><strong>Note on Submitting Ideas:</strong><br>By submitting ideas, you agree that they\u2019re shared freely with no expectation of compensation. We want this to be a fun, collaborative process, so if you\u2019re not comfortable with your ideas being used this way, please refrain from participating in the discussions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Development Plans</h2>We\u2019re aiming for about a year of development, though the exact timeline depends on how the project evolves. Because the game is shaped by community input, the scope might change as we explore different ideas together. We\u2019ll share progress through regular updates on Steam and YouTube, so you\u2019ll always know what we\u2019re working on.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Join The Conversation!</h2>Want to help make this game awesome?
