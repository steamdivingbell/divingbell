{"about_the_game":"Find love, fame, and intrigue on the stage of the city's all-woman Opera! Put on a show, survive drama on and off-stage...and win your lover's heart.<br><br><i>A Player's Heart</i> is a 222,000-word interactive lesbian romance novel by Melissa Scott. It's entirely text-based, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.<br><br>You're a rising member of the all-woman Opera company, one of three great theater companies in the glittering rivermouth city of Tristendesande. But Tristendesande\u2019s legal ruler is a three-year-old boy, and his mother the Regent is under ever-increasing pressure from the Castagi Ambassador to rein in the city\u2019s notorious freedoms, the theaters among them. The Opera\u2019s leaders are determined to stay neutral, but the louche, disreputable Electricity Theater\u2014where, scandalously, men and women perform on the same stage, in the same acts\u2014is equally determined to undermine the Ambassador\u2019s influence. And in the hothouse of the theater, love and politics are always entangled.<br><br>Who will you choose? Will you seduce your elegant rival at the Opera, Celeine, with a glittering smile and a dancer's grace, the remains of last night's paint on her lips as she helps you strive to be your best? Or the innocent Myrr, a genius &quot;artifex&quot; on the stage crew: olive-dark, clever, quick and resourceful, holding you close with strong hands and broad shoulders? Or will it be Mervelles, the daring star of the Electricity Theater, with her dapper suit and deliberately messy dark hair, a nimble and sensuous dancer at home with her contradictions? Or perhaps you'll have the society hostess Jasquillyn Isalis, with her kohl-lined eyes and hair piled fashionably high, scented with rose perfume, diamonds flashing against her warm ivory skin.<br><br>Save the day with your brilliant performance and win your true love's heart.
