{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2709980/extras/WhiteTrick_steamimage11__2_.png?t=1706594459\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Story</h2>WhiteTrick is played with a conman who is defrauding second-hand goods and three police officers chasing him, and their goals vary depending on their roles. The impostor &quot;White&quot; can move while hidden from the three police officers, and must commit additional crimes within a set number of turns. And in order to catch White, the police can investigate White's movement path to find clues, guess his movement route, arrest him, or block his movement route to prevent further crimes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">White background</h2>White has no decent job and is making money by selling second hand goods through fraud. His face is already so well known in this village that he wants to leave the village, but he still lacks money. He needs money to leave town, and there are only three transactions left to reach his goal. The appointment locations and items for the three cases have already been prepared. However, due to frequent crimes, I heard that a special team was formed within the police to catch second-hand dealers and they were hunting him down. Can he commit three additional crimes without being caught by the police?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Police background</h2>&quot;James&quot;, who is about to retire, has been transferred to a quiet rural village to spend his remaining years comfortably, and there are &quot;Emily&quot;, who is known for being good at work and strict, and &quot;Samuel&quot;, his troublemaker. As James expected, the village was maintaining its daily life quietly without any incidents or accidents. But starting one day, similar reports kept coming in. It was a second-hand transaction fraud case. Most of the statements made by the victims were consistent, and a dedicated team was immediately formed to catch him. Perhaps because it was not a skill he had tried once or twice, it was not easy to see him with his own eyes. We need to track down the reported crime location, investigate the surrounding area, and find clues about him. And guess and predict his movement path to prevent him from committing further crimes!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Common Guide</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2709980/extras/\ubc94\ud589\uc7a5\uc18c\uc548\ub0b4.gif?t=1706594459\" /><br>\u2022 White complete 3 additional crimes while eluding the police.<br>\u2022 White can see the police, but the police cannot see White.<br>\u2022 The movement tiles for White and Police are different.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Action Guide</h2>\u2022 <strong>White - Move</strong> (shortcut key E)<br> <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2709980/extras/\ud654\uc774\ud2b8\uc774\ub3d9.gif?t=1706594459\" /><br>    \u26ac Go to the yellow marker and mask icon tile.<br>    \u26ac You must move 1 space during your turn.<br>    \u26ac If you do not move within the given turn time, you will move 1 space at random.<br>    \u26ac You cannot move past the police.<br><br>\u2022 <strong>Police - Move</strong> (shortcut key E)<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2709980/extras/\uacbd\ucc30\uc774\ub3d9.gif?t=1706594459\" /><br>    \u26ac Go to the blue marker and police icon tile.<br>    \u26ac You can either not move or move up to 1 space.<br>    \u26ac You cannot stand on the same tile as your fellow cops.<br><br>\u2022 <strong>Police - Investigation</strong> (shortcut key Q)<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2709980/extras/\uc870\uc0ac\uc131\uacf5.gif?t=1706594459\" /><br>    \u26ac You can examine white tiles adjacent to you to find clues about white in those tiles.<br>    \u26ac If the investigation is successful, further investigation is not possible, but if the investigation is unsuccessful, all white tiles adjacent to you can be investigated.<br>    \u26ac If the investigation is successful, no further actions are possible during that turn.<br>    \u26ac All clues found in the ongoing round will be reset when the next round progresses.<br><br><br>\u2022 <strong>Police - Arrest</strong> (Shortcut key W)<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2709980/extras/\uccb4\ud3ec\uc2e4\ud328.gif?t=1706594459\" /><br>    \u26ac You can only arrest one of the white tiles adjacent to you.
