The two players outside VR will take on the role of factory robots, helping to fill orders. These robots can pick up crates, box cubes, move items and help get things organized. The player in VR will be in charge of distributing and smashing open crates, and preparing boxes for delivery.<br />\r\nIn Wacktory, player's aren't just waiting for their turn in VR anymore.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1082750/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1568930513","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1082750/page.bg.jpg?t=1568930513","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1082750/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1568930513","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1082750/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1568930513","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Wacktory\u2122 is a new take on cooperative gameplay that pushes the limits of both Virtual Reality and traditional couch co-op.
