Find and collect the crate and deliver it to the checkered flag to advance to the next level. Make sure to pick up fuel barrels as you drive around the level or you will run out of gas and be an easy target for the enemy turrets. All turrets and walls are destructible in this game. Create your own levels by saving png drawings in the designed folder on your hard drive. Make sure to follow the color scheme provided in the instructions. On startup the game converts the png images into 3D game levels!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2226190/extras/MonsterTruckTransportGameImage.png?t=1725318793\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2226190/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725318793","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2226190/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1725318793","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2226190/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725318793","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2226190/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725318793","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"An arcade bundle by CWDI GAMES.
