Everyone's favourite rapping frog has vanished, and his closest homie Ghost (that's you) is on a mission to find him. SLUDGE LIFE 2 whisks you away to Ciggy City Suites, a luxurious multi-floor hotel heaving with secrets, gadgets, gags, peculiar characters, and ugly corporate architecture to makeover with your spray can.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SPRAY TO WIN</h2>A hundred tag spots are hidden around the Ciggy City Suites and surrounding area, including some so well hidden we almost feel bad about it. Hunt them down, spray them, and let the soulless GLUG corporation know what's what.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MEET AND GREET</h2>There are three times more NPCs in SLUDGE LIFE 2 than in the original game, which means even more citizens, fellow taggers, corporate stooges, and other assorted oddballs to meet and interact with as you explore a truly weird and wonderful open world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TOOLED UP</h2>New items? We got 'em! With the Double Js you can double jump and sprint, while the Portable Launcher lets you throw yourself dramatically into the air. There are more, but we don't want to spoil the surprise. Oh, and all the items from the original are back too.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SOUND OFF</h2>SLUDGE LIFE 2 features a bunch of new music too \u2014 including five killer new tracks from Big Mud himself. Explore the island, find the hidden master tapes, and bless your headphones with fresh beats and rhymes from the most amphibious rapper in the game.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2275150/extras/hans.png?t=1729708238\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"LIVE AT THE BLUNIVERSE","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2275150/b389ff83343d27a4cf7214a06e6bb02c88b1d4c1.jpg"},{"name":"GRANMA'S LOVE","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2275150/b389ff83343d27a4cf7214a06e6bb02c88b1d4c1.jpg"},{"name":"NECRO-MOLD","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2275150/b389ff83343d27a4cf7214a06e6bb02c88b1d4c1.jpg"},{"name":"EXPOSURE","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2275150/b389ff83343d27a4cf7214a06e6bb02c88b1d4c1.jpg"},{"name":"STUFFED","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2275150/b389ff83343d27a4cf7214a06e6bb02c88b1d4c1.jpg"},{"name":"STILL ZOOMIN","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2275150/b389ff83343d27a4cf7214a06e6bb02c88b1d4c1.jpg"},{"name":"WARP TECH","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2275150/b389ff83343d27a4cf7214a06e6bb02c88b1d4c1.jpg"},{"name":"APP LOVING","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2275150/b389ff83343d27a4cf7214a06e6bb02c88b1d4c1.jpg"},{"name":"KICKFLIP","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2275150/b389ff83343d27a4cf7214a06e6bb02c88b1d4c1.jpg"},{"name":"WAREZ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2275150/b389ff83343d27a4cf7214a06e6bb02c88b1d4c1.jpg"}],"total":14},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2275150/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729708238","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2275150/page.bg.jpg?t=1729708238","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2275150/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729708238","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2275150/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729708238","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"This Game may contain content inappropriate for all ages or inappropriate for viewing at work.\r\n\r\nThis may include:\r\nCrude language\r\nNudity"},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2275150/extras/01_LOGO_drip.gif?t=1729708238\" /><br>Big Mud is missing!
