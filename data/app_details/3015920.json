{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A Thousand Years Ago,A mysterious disaster shattered the peace of our world. In an instant, countless people vanished without warning, as if they were mere bubbles bursting into nothingness. They were forcibly transported to a mysterious realm known as The Crimson Expanse.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Crimson Expanse is a bizarre melting pot of countless worlds, a place where at least a hundred different species from various dimensions have been brought together. Entire regions and ecosystems have been ripped from their original worlds and thrust into this alien land. Each species comes with its unique abilities and traits, but survival is brutal\u2014bloodshed is the only constant as they battle fiercely for resources.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Yet, the horrors of the Crimson Expanse go even deeper. Every living being brought here is gripped by an irresistible urge: the instinct to destroy any life form from another world. To make matters worse, the Crimson Expanse seems to thrive on death. Whenever someone perishes, the land becomes more fertile, its resources more plentiful, as if it feeds on the very blood of its inhabitants.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3015920/extras/DesGif1.gif?t=1739991237\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">For our species, survival in this brutal realm comes with unique challenges. Our population in the Crimson Expanse is capped at 100,000.

Using advanced technology, we can replicate the bodies of other species, creating \u201cclones\u201d we call Avatars. These Avatars act as vessels for our souls. When an Avatar is destroyed, our soul can transfer instantly into a new one, granting us what is nearly a second life. However, once an Avatar is damaged, it cannot be repaired\u2014it must be replaced with another.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">While this soul-transfer ability gives us a crucial edge, it is not without limitations. If a soul cannot find a new Avatar within a set timeframe, it will fade and vanish forever.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">To prepare for the relentless challenges of the Crimson Expanse, our pioneers have created a high-fidelity simulation called The Threshold. This training ground replicates the Expanse\u2019s conditions and tests every candidate through grueling trials.
