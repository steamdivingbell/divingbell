{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Deck-building roguelike. Collect randomly presented cards and create the best deck to defeat your enemies.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game is a card game, but also has a roguelike aspect. When you are defeated by an enemy, you will be sent back to the first stage, and your strength at that time will not be carried over. All you can carry over is your skill as a player. Prepare the best deck and the best card playing to defeat the strong enemies that approach you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong><u>Battle</u></strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you progress through the ruins, various monsters will block your path. Use the deck you have built so far to defeat them as much as possible without being attacked. As you go deeper into the ruins, the monsters that live there become very powerful. In order not to run out of power on the way to the ruins, continue to strengthen your deck and somehow fight back.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong><u>Get Cards</u></strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Combat rewards and other events often give you the opportunity to add new cards to your deck. There are types of cards that have strong effects on their own and are effective as immediate combat forces, and types that assume synergy with other cards but show otherworldly performance when they work together. Compare the decks you've built so far and choose the best cards, taking into account which floor of the ruins your hero is currently on.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong><u>Resource Management</u></strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">HP is a very important resource in this game. There are very few ways to recover HP in the ruins. Challenging a strong enemy with low HP increases the risk of game over, so you need to avoid being hit as much as possible in every battle you encounter. Sometimes, temporary strengthening may be prioritized over long-term strengthening of the deck in order to survive the immediate battle.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong><u>Diverse Decks / Ever-changing Game Experience</u></strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">At the start of the game, you choose one of three main characters. The card pool differs depending on the hero you choose, and each hero has a different strategy that they excel at. In addition, the card rewards presented from the card pool are also random, so you will build a completely different deck for each game experience. The events you encounter are also random, and what you think in a given environment is also random. Overall, you will always enjoy a fresh game experience.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3363240/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736275212","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3363240/page.bg.jpg?t=1736275212","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3363240/311bdd0e17f1e858cdd7a65e2d593afffa0c2096/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736275212","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3363240/311bdd0e17f1e858cdd7a65e2d593afffa0c2096/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736275212","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Deck-building roguelike.
