{"about_the_game":"In this Demo, you can meet Nanai-chan in VR environment.<br>This demo is created for the purpose to check if your VR HMD and PC are compatible. <br>There is no action in the demo - but you are able to change Nanai's skin color, costume (and strip her naked) and watch her from 360 angles.<br><br><strong>Oculus Quest users can play too! </strong><br><br>Using ALVR (free) installed on your PC, you can play completely wireless in the comfort of your own bed or couch! What it does is let you play PC-based VR games on your Oculus Quest headset! It basically streams the video and other data in real time! It takes about 5 minutes to set up and has practically zero lag on a 5 GHz network!<br><br>For installation, you will need to follow the instructions on the ALVR github page. If you do not have SteamVR, you can install it by opening Steam, Clicking \u201cLIBRARY\u201d and then clicking \u201cTools\u201d (second from the bottom of the drop-down list). From there, find \u201cSteamVR\u201d and install it.<br><br>For best results, we recommend using a 5 GHz WiFi signal. This usually has the same name as your normal WiFi but with \u201c-5G\u201d at the end. Be sure to connect your Oculus Quest to this! From there, you can use the default settings for Video in ALVR: Codec=H.265 HEVC; Bitrate=30Mbps; Resolution=100%; Buffer size=200kB. You may need to uncheck \u201cSteam Sound\u201d on the Sound tab if you have error messages related to audio. If you use 2G/2.4 GHz, you may find the video quality to be unbearably poor, so we highly recommend you have 5G.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/963580/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1562071431","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/963580/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1562071431","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/963580/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1562071431","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/963580/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1562071431","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,3,5,4],"notes":"You can see Nanai-chan in VR environment.
