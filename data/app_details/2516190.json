{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore derelict spacecraft</h2><br>You are a drone operator, and the newest member of the three-person crew on the Black Jackal, a salvage ship specializing in investigating lost spacecraft in the unexplored reaches of the galaxy. <br><br>Each mission will take you to a different derelict, with its own story and challenges, as you learn more about the galaxy and about your crew.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Navigate their hazards</h2><br>Using spaceflight controls, pilot your salvage drone through cramped corridors and twisted wreckage. Everything in a derelict is a hazard, from damaged machinery, to still-active security systems, to impacts with the walls themselves. <br><br>It will take flying skill, situational awareness, and a strong sense of direction to get through these ships intact.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Solve their mysteries</h2><br>The main goal of each mission is to figure out what happened to the derelict ship. Piece together the vessel's final moments through text evidence, audio logs, and environmental clues. Send your report and decide how the ship's story will be told. <br><br>Outer space is dangerous, but people are even more so.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get out with the loot</h2><br>Scour the derelict for valuable salvage and bring it back to the Black Jackal. Some of it will be out in the open, but the most valuable parts will be well-hidden\u2026 or well-guarded. <br><br>Salvage brought back to the ship can be used to buy upgrades to your drone!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2516190/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1692634427","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2516190/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1692634427","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2516190/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1692634427","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2516190/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1692634427","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"As you explore lost spacecraft in Black Jackal, you will encounter the mortal remains of those who lost their lives in those incidents, occasionally along with clinical descriptions of the causes of death.
