{"about_the_game":"Hello! The aim of this game is to arrange colored blocks in the right order to get a gradient. By default, if you place a block correctly, it will be automatically locked and you will hear the sound. You can disable one or both of these features in the settings. You are also able to lock and unlock blocks manually. It is possible to do that for multiple blocks by holding down right mouse button. When you press \u00abPlay\u00bb button, a level is selected randomly from those you haven't completed yet, but you are also free to choose any level at any time. Pretty simple, right?","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Swap, swap, swap!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1485900/db3da2c0b70a22c3235d26672c9ec96e9aa38ae1.jpg"},{"name":"Flag of the Russian Empire","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1485900/c92b0edecdcb7fb166ba8087661b0bae4531f1b4.jpg"},{"name":"Flag of Russia","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1485900/b8fb51f13fefe72841a00fe676ea33d470538c97.jpg"},{"name":"Very singular tastes","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1485900/7cd39f6eec1aeeaeb9e8b7cd7ccd9b777553754c.jpg"},{"name":"The Joy of Painting","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1485900/046ea8a49f7774c02643856ca69554137047a021.jpg"},{"name":"Eye, caramba!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1485900/b714a10e27517108043a0f5c0612cc977f79913d.jpg"},{"name":"Spirals","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1485900/f12e2790ea82e68533b036150586eb2e636eb2ed.jpg"},{"name":"Flag of Estonia","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1485900/d5c89d07d0b651350485f86441276f11a2cd655a.jpg"},{"name":"Flag of Latvia","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1485900/a16f524197e22092acc856c97d7aebc1334ca4c7.jpg"},{"name":"Flag of Lithuania","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1485900/75ad295fc250deb962fbe8a0f910231c90584ba8.jpg"}],"total":14},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1485900?t=1683700785","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1485900/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1683700785","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1485900/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1683700785","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1485900/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1683700785","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Hello!
