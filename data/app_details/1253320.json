{"about_the_game":"Use ships to attack and destroy enemy space stations in real time. \u00a0Navigate through different randomly setup star maps to get to the exit and win. \u00a0It's a 2D single player space game that's massively replayable. \u00a0No matter how many times you play you'll always have fun and feel dumb for making simple mistakes. There's a wide range of difficulty levels so you can start simple then build your skill to experience the full depth of the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Destroy Enemy Space Stations</h2>Command two groups of ships to attack and destroy enemy space stations. With a bit of practice you'll quickly learn where to place each ship, when to attack what turret and how to counter their abilities, the hard part is mastering it. Only the enemy turrets have abilities so you must be extra focused on using your units as a team and their positioning. Dodge projectiles the best you can and when you make a mistake move a ship to safety and another one in to take some hits.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1253320/extras/Combat_v2_Optimized.gif?t=1601309485\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Just Get to the Exit!</h2>Navigate through different randomly setup star maps to get to the exit and win.
