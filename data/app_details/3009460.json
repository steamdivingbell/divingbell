{"about_the_game":"An Incremental game about hunting increasingly fearsome monsters, wearing their drops as armor, and expanding an ever-growing village of mysterious individuals with unique mechanics. Do you have what it takes to fight against fate and uncover the mysteries of the Isles of Silence?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Engage in Fully Simulated Combat</h2><br>Gear up your Hunting Party and send them out to take on whatever stands in their way! Every monster has it's own unique move-set and special way of making sure your hunters don't have an easy time. Hunters get better at dodging and dealing damage the more they fight each foe, and share that knowledge with their peers as they have downtime. Different monsters are weaker to different weapons and elements, so make sure your hunters are versed in a variety of tools of destruction!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore Unique Builds</h2><br>New armor doesn't just mean that a number goes up! Each piece of armor comes equipped with a variety of skills allowing for detailed and situational build variety. Maybe you want to build an armor set that allows your Hunters to gather more items in the field, or a set that allows them to dodge more attacks for maximum survivability. Or maybe you just want to see how high you can make that damage number go? Different monsters will require different strategies for the fastest kill, but there's always the option of punching the wall until you're through it!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Construct your Village from the Ashes</h2><br>As you progress across the Isles, you'll meet a variety of individuals who will offer you help -- if you provide them the means to do so, of course. The materials you gather while on Expeditions will go into building up different facilities and shelters, providing a variety of buffs and new mechanics. Each individual that moves in has their own backstory and knowledge-base, and will provide you with hints and advice as you progress through the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Overcome the Isles of Silence</h2><br>Each island you land on will introduce new mechanics, new resources, new monsters, and new mysteries. Towers grow from the depths of the ocean, songs emanate from glowing crevices in the ice, and the very land begins to writhe. Every inch of ground you gain will be met with growing opposition as the Isles adapt to the changes you make, viewing your presence as a threat against its very nature.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Now Available on all Devices with a Browser</h2><br>No compatible Operating System?
