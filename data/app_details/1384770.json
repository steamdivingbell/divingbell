In this survivor horror you\u2019ll search through a database full of reports to determine what kind of person lurks behind each one. Everything from cell phone images, decades-old police reports, recent purchases, text conversations, social media accounts, and search history is only a click away to help you assess these reports and either mark them as threats or not. You accomplish these tasks while using the simulated computer system in the game, the A.D.O.S system with tools dedicated to help you.
