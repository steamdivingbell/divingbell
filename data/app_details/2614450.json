{"about_the_game":"You are an environmentalist revolutionary along with the whole of your technologically advanced community within an underwater society, Nimbus, who\u2019s caught in an ancestral war between the serpent-like spiritual race of creatures called the Slinip and your birthright race of the dragon-like creatures known as the Dareux. You are deftly aware of the Earth as a wasted battle ground now that the Spiritual world and the Physical world have merged following the Divine Collapse, a war between the ruler of the spiritual plane of Abaddon Daemon and the creator Jah of Zion. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTraining to wield various weapons, negotiating with foreign communities, and even hacking are requirements just to survive the surface now that it is as universally known that the aftermath of the Divine Collapse now sends all new souls that die into the hellish Abaddon instead of receiving judgement from Jah. The world calls for your contribution to fight back and protect the world your community has sacrificed everything to protect by exposing you to the Slinip's plan to negotiate with the privileged humans aboard the planetary superstructure known as the ARK to colonize the Earth's surface below them in exchange for the eradication of the rising population and representation of non-human life both on and off the ARK.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou are awakened by the demolishing of your home, water flooding the corridors of Nimbus, and the screams of your neighbors as the arbiter of this destruction Raven Slithrin, calls for the presence of your father, Tyson El-Shabazz, to execute him as a declaration of war against the Earth's surface and by extension the Dareux, up keepers of balance. In our action RPG, you must adapt yourself to every new community you visit to retrieve Eco-Blueprints and Dyson Fragments to not only repair your now destroyed home, but to complete your mother's life's work of curing the devastated state of the planet with technology that transcends the magic like methods of spiritual prowess. Untangle the prejudice of the Humans, liberate the isolated Sekhmet, and expose the secrets of the B'cit along with other races you find throughout the Earth on your quest to make a better home for all life.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2614450/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1695945571","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2614450/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1695945571","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2614450/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1695945571","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2614450/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1695945571","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"Mature themes and actions are present in this game.
