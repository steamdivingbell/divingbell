The journey stays the same but your route through them changes with each new run.<br><br>Discover how different elements of your arsenal and the status system sync as you battle in epic set pieces, traveling deeper and deeper into the Martian landscape<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Terraforming, on a Budget</h2>Working as a nameless face at the bottom of the ladder, you work at possibly the most budget-friendly terraforming company in existence, New Earth Landscaping, Inc. After receiving a request for a callout on Mars, you suddenly find your ship out of control and careering towards the surface.<br><br><br>One catastrophic crash later, work must go on and it\u2019s up to you to discover the source of the danger threatening Mars\u2019 core. Sounds easy enough\u2026 Right?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Bullet Heaven</h2>Collect new weapons, expand your abilities and build the perfect arsenal to reach true bullet<br>heaven. You\u2019ll need to if you stand any kind of chance of taking on the multifarious Martian horde hellbent on destroying you. Maximize your offensive capabilities with randomly generated item attachments, which can change and intertwine with devastating status effects.<br><br>Everything, from your antizeno repulsor shield through to nano utility spiders and zenocide projectors, can be upgraded and modified.

Poison spreads to others close by, making them more susceptible to gunfire and other forms of damage.<br><br><strong>Traumatized</strong> - Sometimes fear is the best weapon of all. Inflict the traumatized effect on enemies to make them more susceptible to critical hits. Instill enough fear in them and they\u2019ll flee the battle, sparking similar reactions from those close by.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">I\u2019m Doing My Part</h2>Fight alongside your friends with Crimson Crisis\u2019 couch co-op mode. Double the weapons, double the action and double the danger. A simple drop in and out feature makes it easy for anyone to join the chaos.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Community-Driven Destruction</h2>Expand your experience and cause even more destruction with mods. Crimson Crisis will support community-created mods from launch, allowing you to further add to your arsenal in the fight against the ferocious Martian horde.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/586290/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1705965334","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/586290/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1705965334","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/586290/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1705965334","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/586290/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1705965334","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Embrace the chaos\u2026<br><br>Battle aliens, shoot guns and, above all else, survive to work another day in Crimson Crisis, an action-roguelite set in a post-apocalyptic universe.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Persistence Is Key</h2>Each playthrough of Crimson Crisis is unique due to an almost infinite pool of potential player builds.
