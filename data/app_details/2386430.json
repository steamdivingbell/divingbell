Then all of a sudden the ground starts shaking and a loud explosion is heard in the distance, soon after that your family's house gets destroyed.

Last year it was my (Niekoe) turn. The idea was that everytime my friends beated a game board they had to play a level in a video game. So I asked my colleague from work (CrasyBoy) to help create an awesome video game for that board game weekend.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2386430/extras/TD_-_Boardgame.jpg?t=1686319371\" /><br><br>We had a blast creating Thunderday and the game grew bigger and bigger.
