{"about_the_game":"Mischance is a game that relies heavily on an RNG system. Each and every little task you perform has the chance to kill you (some more than others). On one hand this means that the player has no knowledge over what kills them or keeps them alive, but on the other hand it also means that every time a new game starts you are dealt with different circumstances that lead to different outcomes. The primary objective of the game is to survive for 30 days. Players are also given random modifiers at the start of the game that help reduce the chances of dying by certain means. <br><br>Throughout each game the player will have to make several decisions. Some of which may be deciding whether you should open random packages sent to you, interacting with strangers or taking a day off from work. All of these decisions also have a random chance of either working in your favour or backfiring, leading to the player's death. <br><br><i> <strong>Better start praying. The only thing that's gonna guarantee your survival is luck. And you'll need a lot of that to make it out alive.
