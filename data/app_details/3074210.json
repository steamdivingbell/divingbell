{"about_the_game":"<strong>Champions of Chaxia</strong> is a text-based adventure game. Simple, gamebook-style battle and inventory management are combined with a branching story. Atmosphere and dialog are important aspects. You will try to survive as best you can as a gladiator in Chaxia, a mighty empire feared across the world for its cruelty and determination. Use cunning and preparation to win over a string of opponents. Between battles, navigate the streets and alleys of the shantytown where you're allowed to roam.
