You are an intergalactic biologist that finds yourself stranded on a desolate planet. With the help of the planet\u2019s life-supporting AI, explore the planet to find the lost parts to your ship so you can return home. Along the way, use your abilities to bring the planet back to life!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2899430/extras/breedtext.gif?t=1737162700\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Critters have complex emotional needs that must be balanced in order to breed them and to keep them happy. Critters need to eat, and each species has a unique diet. Some species will eat other Critters, and individuals may feel anxious if a potential predator is nearby. If your garden becomes too overcrowded and there isn\u2019t enough food for everyone, Critters may start to become aggressive and territorial. If the ecosystem is in the correct balance, your Critters will be happy and breed, and their populations will grow!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2899430/extras/LionSwan.gif?t=1737162700\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2899430/extras/buildgardentext.gif?t=1737162700\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Use tools, plant seeds, and place objects to craft balanced ecosystems across nine biomes.
