{"about_the_game":"Return to Japan and embark on bustling and world-leading commuter operations in the heart of Tokyo \u2013 be right on time and master modern EMUs on local and rapid duty. The ultimate capital city service awaits with Union Workshop\u2019s Tokyo Commuter: Keihin\u2013T\u014dhoku &amp; Utsunomiya Lines for Train Simulator Classic!<br><br>The commuter network of Tokyo is formed of many different interconnecting lines that serve different suburbs and offer both local and direct links into the city centre. Opened in 1914, the Keihin\u2013T\u014dhoku line stretched its way across the Tokyo area, running north-south linking many population hubs into Japan\u2019s capital. Thanks to unbeatable reliability and modern signalling, local trains in the rush hour run mere minutes apart, and daytime rapid services run every 5 mins apart. There is plenty of action to be seen!<br><br>And it only gets busier, as the adjacent and much older Utsunomiya Line, dating back to 1883 and runs mostly parallel to the Keihin\u2013T\u014dhoku, offers up even more rapid transit services to the northern hubs of Tokyo. It is quite literally non-stop all day, and as a driver on the network, you have an important role of maintaining Japan\u2019s high standards.<br><br>Each line today is served by 2 different variants of the E233 series EMU. The -1000 series comprised of 10-car sets which run on the Keihin\u2013T\u014dhoku line, featuring a blue accented livery, meanwhile the Utsunomiya is served by the -3000 series, made of both 5 and 10-car formations, the latter of which also features 2 intermediate double decker cars \u2013 more emerald in tone, the 2 lengths can work in tandem to create 15-car trains amidst highest demand, offering unrivalled capacity when combined with such frequent service patterns.<br><br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2><br>A wide selection of engaging Career scenarios are included:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>01.
