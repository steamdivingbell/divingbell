For example, weapons can be brandished at the table and the player's avatar is able to interact with it such as picking up brass knuckles, knife or a gun. The avatar will also pick up drink items, such as drinking from a beer bottle or shot glass. There are no applied affects, such as the avatar getting drunk from drinking. The avatar can also pick up a cigar or cigarette and \"take a drag\" from it. Most of these interactions are random, the player cannot initiate it.\r\n\r\nAvatars\r\nNo Avatars are ever fighting with each other in any physical way. There are ways for the player to express themselves though emotes, such as a chip trick, a throat slit hand motion, happy dance but none of them have any displays of blood, gore or any other mature content.\r\n\r\nEnvironments\r\nThe overall theme of the game is playing Poker in a city called Prominence. There are some allusions to legally and illegally playing poker with the \"Affiliations.\" The player picks an affiliation and gets rewards for leveling them up but not for doing any legal or illegal activities.\r\n\r\nThe Laundromat has some implied drug trafficking through open boxes with non-descript packages in them. The player again, cannot interact with this, there is no dialogue calling it out, it's purely visual.\r\n\r\nMotherland Meats is a meat packaging facility that has the most direct display of mature content. There are clean hanging pig corpses in the freezer, a human-shaped bag in the freezer, some dried blood splatters, and NPCs that are working in the background. There is no in-your-face gore, actively dripping or spilling blood.\r\n\r\nSolo Mode Bosses\r\nThe Mayor character has a British accent and uses what may be consider crude language to address and taunt the player. There is no explicit uses of strong language and no explicit gestures such as the middle finger."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/384180/extras/PP_Steam_GIF1.gif?t=1723720337\" /><br><br><strong>Rise to Prominence</strong><br><br>Welcome to Prominence Poker, a card game that pits players from around the world against each other \u2013 and devious AI \u2013 to build the rep, prestige, and bankroll needed to be, and beat, the best of the best. <br><br>A single hand can make all the difference in this immersive free-to-play Steam Texas Hold 'em title \u2014 do you have what it takes to be prominent in this town?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/384180/extras/PP_Steam_1.png?t=1723720337\" /><br><br><strong>Rich Single-Player Story &amp; Setting</strong><br><br>Set in the city of Prominence, a gambling paradise founded by crooked folks looking to go straight, the solo story mode pits you against four factions and their leaders as you play your way to a final showdown with &quot;The Mayor&quot; \u2013 the mysterious town founder who will guide you through your career.
