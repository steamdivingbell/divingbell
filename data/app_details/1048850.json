The bouncy soft pieces pile up, creating a unique play field that you stack your pieces on.  Think of it as squishy Tetris.<br><br>The game has a chill paced zen-mode that goes infinitely long as long as you don't fill the board too full.  The other mode, challenge mode, starts going faster as you match pieces and has a timer you have to constantly increase by matching pieces.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1048850/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1571771186","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1048850/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1571771186","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1048850/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1571771186","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1048850/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1571771186","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1048850/extras/JellyBlocks_cropped.gif?t=1571771186\" /><br><br>Jelly blocks is a squishy match-3 game you create matches by bouncing and smooshing blocks together.
