{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Eden: Project New Earth</strong> lets you experience the adventure your way \u2013 in single-player or multiplayer mode. Play locally or on servers, with friends or strangers, together in PvE or against one another in PvP. Form alliances, build communities with others, or defend yourself against hostile adversaries. Transform from a bare clone of yourself into a pioneer, rediscovering technology and adapting it to the challenges of an unknown planet.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Explore the remnants of an ancient civilization and uncover the secrets hidden within its ruins, caves, and dungeons. Discover their history, learn what happened to them \u2013 and find out how their technologies might become the key to your survival.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You\u2019ve been chosen to secure humanity\u2019s survival in a new star system. But this new planet is as dangerous as it is full of potential. While Earth was left in chaos, your mission is to colonize and sustainably manage this world \u2013 to succeed where Earth failed.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Survive a Merciless World</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Quickly find shelter and familiarize yourself with the planet\u2019s conditions. But survival isn\u2019t as simple as finding food and water. You\u2019ll need to maintain a balanced diet, ensuring your body has the right levels of vitamins and minerals to thrive. Not everything that looks edible is safe. Some plants or fruits might weaken you \u2013 or worse, make you sick.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Diseases and New Challenges</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The planet doesn\u2019t just threaten you with visible dangers like aggressive wildlife or harsh weather but also with invisible threats: diseases. Unfamiliar viruses, parasites, or bacterial infections may endanger your health. You\u2019ll need to discover cures by studying the local flora and fauna or developing new technologies. But beware \u2013 some diseases can spread to your companions or community, adding yet another layer of difficulty to your survival.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Extreme Weather and Natural Disasters</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The planet\u2019s weather is unpredictable and unforgiving. Violent storms, scorching heat, freezing temperatures, or toxic rainfall could strike at any moment. Prepare well and design your base to withstand even the most brutal conditions. Thoughtful planning and forward-thinking construction will be the key to surviving these environmental challenges.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Encounters with Fauna</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Not everything that moves on this planet is your friend. The predators you hunt may also see you as prey. However, some creatures can be tamed if approached carefully. Train them to serve as loyal companions or even mounts. But stay vigilant \u2013 the planet\u2019s wildlife is diverse and often deadly.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Build and Optimize Your Home</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Protect yourself from harsh environmental conditions by building a base that\u2019s as safe as it is efficient. Take advantage of an innovative construction system that allows you to place blueprints without consuming resources. Only when everything is perfectly planned will materials be used. This lets you build smarter and more sustainably while avoiding costly mistakes.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A Deep and Evolving Story</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you explore the planet, you\u2019ll encounter fragments of its past. Who once lived here? What led to their downfall? And how does it all connect to your mission? As you progress, you\u2019ll uncover the true story of the planet and gain insight into why you were chosen for this expedition.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2702350/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738317765","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2702350/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1738317765","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2702350/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738317765","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2702350/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738317765","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Eden: Project New Earth</strong> lets you experience the adventure your way \u2013 in single-player or multiplayer mode.
