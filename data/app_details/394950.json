{"about_the_game":"A retro-inspired masterpiece, Mystery Castle is the one puzzle game that will rule them all!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is for everyone who loves adventure, treasure hunting, laughing out loud, transforming into creatures, drinking potions, possessing monsters, explosions, inept wizards, witless golems, huge floating eyeballs, magic portals, magic lanterns, grumpy dwarfs, cheerful eskimos, irate hotel owners, giant monsters, throwing bombs at giant monsters\u2026 and then laughing some more!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs Monty the Wizard you must solve 180 unique stages and save the five Castles of Mystery from the evil that lurks within. Are you smart enough to outwit a giant snowman? How about a half-witted ogre? Along the way, you'll meet a host of colorful characters, from Stumpi the treasure-hungry dwarf in the Fortress Underground to the bossy Mr Chow in the Mystical Pagoda. They will all have plenty of advice - some of it might even be helpful!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou will discover hidden paths with a magical lantern and create your own with a well-placed bomb or two. In one moment you'll be dodging between boiling lava and Fire Golems, and in the next sliding perilously over sheets of ice \u2013 just be sure not to fall to your doom into the bottomless abyss. You will need to transform into a troll to move heavy objects, a bat to fly across deep chasms, and a frog to squeeze through tiny holes. But how will you avoid the deadly gaze of the Eye-Spy that can turn you to stone in a blink? Drink a handy potion to shrink to a fraction of your size or perhaps sneak past by possessing a nearby ghost.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour options are only limited by your genius.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Wizardry: Open Sesame","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/394950/d9086ae6f0304656d2e3f7b268d890048d293fa3.jpg"},{"name":"Wizardry: Teleportation","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/394950/8a0a4bed0f5c707cda2e2dcef131e5b86ff5b607.jpg"},{"name":"Wizardry: Transmutation","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/394950/573b56b3c70648839f1068f3d078e66b5eb59e6d.jpg"},{"name":"Wizardry: Possession","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/394950/1094efe4ffeacddda7170d207fb37a5a19b5f25b.jpg"},{"name":"Wizardry: Alchemy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/394950/cc9cb7390a8966f7e8772872fa9b00ad9a0f6132.jpg"},{"name":"Adventurer: Walk on Water","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/394950/3752bde3c2da61483427e3d2e552b24f03f7b3c4.jpg"},{"name":"Adventurer: Leadership","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/394950/4ffc6cab15793da915495f8dc06a710ea75fd9ce.jpg"},{"name":"Adventurer: Secret Finder","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/394950/93ed56ae1ee11bbb9b5a30c4f7e0b4fcfb91e422.jpg"},{"name":"Adventurer: Switched On","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/394950/629810881305229cfeead58d056affc467506b4b.jpg"},{"name":"Adventurer: Demolitions","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/394950/74887fa46d1b4e9043c92f6c9bd0212b006c1326.jpg"}],"total":25},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/394950/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1463495142","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/394950/page.bg.jpg?t=1463495142","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/394950/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1463495142","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/394950/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1463495142","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"A retro-inspired masterpiece, Mystery Castle is the one puzzle game that will rule them all!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is for everyone who loves adventure, treasure hunting, laughing out loud, transforming into creatures, drinking potions, possessing monsters, explosions, inept wizards, witless golems, huge floating eyeballs, magic portals, magic lanterns, grumpy dwarfs, cheerful eskimos, irate hotel owners, giant monsters, throwing bombs at giant monsters\u2026 and then laughing some more!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs Monty the Wizard you must solve 180 unique stages and save the five Castles of Mystery from the evil that lurks within.
