{"about_the_game":"This is a software for players to learn programming while making games. Players could learn programming from scratch by making some classic games, such as Life Game, Retro Snake, etc. Then players need to make a little bit more complex game called Two Snakes, which requires players to play with two hands, or making an AI for another snake.
