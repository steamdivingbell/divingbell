{"about_the_game":"In this 3D adventure platformer, you take control of Craig. A teenager who got kidnapped, and now needs to get back home. Be careful, though! There are angry guys everywhere who don't like Craig. Don't worry, you can fight back most of the time. Of course, since Craig is a teenager, he's not great at driving. Just make sure you get back home in time before somebody else gets kidnapped...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn gameplay, you can...<br />\r\n1. Control Craig (or Trevor) with easy controls.<br />\r\n2. You can explore a few areas that are quite different very different from each other.<br />\r\n3. You can punch (or shoot) enemies around you.<br />\r\n4. Use the right control stick to change which direction is forward (and usually change which way the camera is facing).<br />\r\n5. Figure out how to beat certain challenges.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsually, the gameplay will be in 3rd Person point of view, but when you get to the forest, you will be in 1st Person point of view for a more chilling experience! When in first person, the controls remain largely the same.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3189570/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733671888","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3189570/page.bg.jpg?t=1733671888","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3189570/11630b56e359a8e8a2af6131bd04069fda97b0f5/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733671888","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3189570/11630b56e359a8e8a2af6131bd04069fda97b0f5/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733671888","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3277210,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"In this 3D adventure platformer, you take control of Craig.
