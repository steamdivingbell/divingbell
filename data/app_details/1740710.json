{"about_the_game":"Our story begins with a very good looking pigeon with an amazing name, who's dream is to act in the great theater that they live in. With the help of a lovely human, a fluffy pigeon and a questionably french bird, they create the perfect human disguise: a trench coat.  Heigh-ho, hey-ho! Alas, suddenly, the world ends! Zounds! Bazinga! Yeet! All hope is lost! But, in the nick of time, a figure approaches this spectacular pigeon with an offer. Would you like to try again?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThree Pigeons in a Trench Coat is a fast paced, action, adventure game, where you try to find out what ends the world and stop it before the world ends again five minutes later. And if you fail? Just try again!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe world resets everyday, right before the world ends. During the day investigate the oddities of the town to find clues as to what ends the world, disguise yourself as a person in a trench coat in order to talk to the residents and fight the monsters that lurk in this town. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDo all of this with the help of your pigeon friends, Fluff and Wazu. They control the arms of the trench coat, and fly with you while outside of the trench coat. They also let you fire more powerful weapons while in the trench coat, allowing for a seamless flow between dodging attacks as a bird, and inflicting incredible damage to your foes as a trench coat.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou know, all the things pigeons normally do","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1740710/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1639680333","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1740710/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1639680333","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1740710/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1639680333","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1740710/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1639680333","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Our story begins with a very good looking pigeon with an amazing name, who's dream is to act in the great theater that they live in.
