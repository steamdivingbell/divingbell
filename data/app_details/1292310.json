{"about_the_game":"Solar Sails is a space-action RPG with adventure elements. Control a pirate ship, plunder the royal navy, launch a scout duck to search for treasures, upgrade your ship with alien technologies, and sail onwards to unveil the darkest secrets of the universe.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1292310/extras/Combat_Gif_1.gif?t=1731478850\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Play like a pirate</strong></h2><br>You control a team of space pirates in a galaxy full of dangers, ancient mysteries, and unique alien species. The galaxy is controlled by two human superpowers locked in a cold war. To make a living, you complete quests to build a reputation with various factions, smuggle illegal goods, raid trade convoys, and search for alien artifacts to sell on the black market. But be wary, your actions as a pirate will trigger a response from the authorities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Control a pirate crew</strong></h2><br>In Solar Sails, you control a pirate ship with upgradeable modules, offensive and defensive, that can be manned by crew members. The crew members are all story-related characters, each with their own active and passive skills. Each crew member comes with their own abilities for each of the disciplines - weaponry, navigation, and defense. Your abilities as a player depend on the layout of the crew. How you level up your characters is up to you.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1292310/extras/Combat_Gif_3.gif?t=1731478850\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Story</strong></h2><br>The story revolves around four main characters - a gruesome self-loathing captain who seeks to bring his family back from the dead; an underappreciated young engineer who searches for his long-gone cat that doubtfully exists; a young cadet accused of mass murder due to her unruly magical powers, and therefore, determined to learn to control them; and a time-traveling duck determined to prevent the end of the galaxy in the future.<br><br>Driven by tales of riches and promises of immense power, the pirates open Pandora's Box - a gateway to another dimension - and unleash an ancient evil that threatens to consume all life in the galaxy. Will the pirates be able to put their personal goals aside and work toward the common good? Or will they doom the galaxy in pursuit of personal ambitions?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1292310/extras/Combat_Gif_2.gif?t=1731478850\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Features</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Explore</strong> a unique fantasy universe with its species, factions, and characters.<br></li><li><strong>Plunder</strong> merchants, outposts, and convoys to loot valuable goods and artifacts.<br></li><li><strong>Capture</strong> hostages to trade them for ransom or interrogate them for additional information.<br></li><li><strong>Smuggle</strong> illegal goods and commodities to make some extra gold.<br></li><li><strong>Control</strong> a space duck to scout asteroids and find hidden treasures.<br></li><li><strong>Upgrade</strong> your ship with powerful alien technologies and abilities.<br></li><li><strong>Level up</strong> your characters - each of them has their own skills to contribute to the ship.<br></li><li><strong>Steal</strong> items from enemy space stations and flee on a small speedy space boat.<br></li><li><strong>Collect</strong> treasure maps, ancient texts, and artifacts, and unlock secret levels.<br></li><li><strong>Earn Reputation</strong> with different factions by completing their quests.<br></li><li><strong>Help Pastafarians</strong> spread the gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster in the galaxy.<br></li><li><strong>Gain Power-Ups</strong> from enemies, alien runes, or Flying Spaghetti Monster boons.<br></li><li>Play alone in <strong>Single Player</strong> mode or together with a friend in <strong>Local Co-op</strong> mode. </li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1292310/extras/Lineup.jpg?t=1731478850\" /><br><br>Ready or not, hoist the damn sails!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1292310/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731478850","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1292310/page.bg.jpg?t=1731478850","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1292310/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731478850","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1292310/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731478850","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Solar Sails is a space-action RPG with adventure elements.
