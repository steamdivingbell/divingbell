This may include visual effects such as explosions, weapon effects, and light blood splatter to enhance the battle experience.\r\n\r\nThe storyline and character roles are designed to build a competitive and immersive setting, focusing on strategy and collaboration rather than mature or sensitive themes like drug use or self-harm.
