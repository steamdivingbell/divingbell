{"about_the_game":"The F-86 Sabre is one of the most iconic and recognizable fighter aircraft ever built. As one of the first-ever jet-powered fighter aircraft with swept wings, it achieved an unmatched victory ratio of 10 to 1 against the MiG-15 during the Korean War. Lieutenant Jim Thompson was credited with shooting down two MiGs during that time, one of which had a dragon painted on the side. Soon after, he had a similar dragon painted on the side of his iconic F-86, known as \u201cThe Huff.\u201d The E-flite UMX F-86 Sabre 30mm EDF is an ultra-micro-sized model of the famous aircraft that arrives factory-assembled and ready to fly right out of the box, including a premium fully painted with waterslide decal finish. It\u2019s equipped with an updated and optimized 4S-compatible power system to meet modern-day EDF performance expectations\u2013making it the highest-performance ultra-micro class jet model yet! It\u2019s also equipped with expertly tuned AS3X and optional-use SAFE Select technologies, plus it provides real-time battery voltage and other telemetry information to compatible transmitters. And because of its ultra-micro size, pilots can fly the UMX F-86 in more places and smaller spaces than most other EDF models, including at many large parks and sports fields! The fixed landing gear with a steerable nosewheel makes it easy to taxi, take off from, and land on smooth surfaces. Or, you can remove the landing gear for more speed and vertical performance with easy hand launches \u2013 thanks to the automatic Hand Launch Assist mode \u2013 over and landings on grass. It all adds up to deliver an authentic, affordable, and convenient F-86 flying experience you can\u2019t get with any other model!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759420/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724890727","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759420/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1724890727","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759420/0ddce933e106cf7545bb0b6a67f81c50b14c0b58/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724890727","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2759420/0ddce933e106cf7545bb0b6a67f81c50b14c0b58/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724890727","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The F-86 Sabre is one of the most iconic and recognizable fighter aircraft ever built.
