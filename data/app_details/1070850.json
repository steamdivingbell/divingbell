In the wake of a devastating earthquake, its decaying figure looms in the distance, replacing pleasant childhood memories with an air of mystery. For Thomas Wilkes, the park holds a very special place in his heart. It is where his father once worked, and where he'd celebrated the majority of his birthdays. Now, after his father's sudden passing, Thomas wants nothing more than to visit the park one last time. He will slip past the rusted gates and unknowingly enter a waking nightmare.<br><br><strong><u>Features:</u></strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A true survival horror experience. Dive deep into the darkness of the Wonder Park and try to survive the horror within.<br></li><li>Use the environment to your advantage to hide from or outsmart your pursuers. Your camera isn\u2019t just for taking mid-chase selfies, either -- its flash can buy you precious time! When escape is no longer an option, you can use the weapons you have found to fight back. However, such luxuries are scarce, and every enemy has unique characteristics to consider.
