{"about_the_game":"Architecture is a \u2018shaped touch\u2019 between what our bodies can perceive and the information around us.  As our bodies increase their range of sensorial abilities through advancements in healthcare and wearable technologies, climate change is simultaneously redefining our expectations of future environments.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nExamples include the ability to see within the near infrared spectrum of light, access layers of augmented reality, hear plants communicate in low frequency sound or the ability to empathize with those who\u2019s senses differ from your own. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nArchitecture\u2019s shape is less of an objective form and more of a spectrum of sensorial shapes layered upon one another for those with varying access.
