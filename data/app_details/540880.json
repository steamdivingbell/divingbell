{"about_the_game":"Rosemary left her family's farm a year ago to become a Knight in Shining Armor! ... but being a knight is harder than she thought, and she's looking for work at the foot of the perilous Mount Needle. Thankfully, there are four handsome princes here who need an escort through the mountain pass, and Rosemary is just the knight for the job! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs Rosemary, you'll brave fierce beasts and difficult terrain, not to mention the fact that your traveling companion can be a royal pain. But that's okay! Because you're brave and noble and not-at-all distracted by the handsome guy you're bound to protect. You've got the armor, you've got the sword, and you're all ready for a fairytale romance: if the snowstorms and bone-chilling winds don't get in the way. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd maybe these princes aren't quite as charming as you expected... <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRose of Winter is a charming visual novel with adventure, romance, and heartbreak. Choose one of four princes to take on your adventure, and make decisions to unlock multiple endings. Featuring an adorable story and art by Magnolia Pearl, Aatmaja Pandya, and Victoria Grace Elliot, plus music by Toby Fox, Rose of Winter is ready to sweep you off your feet!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Tale as Old as Time","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/540880/afbb69cd7f59c849fc21cd7348ff35f35d103a45.jpg"},{"name":"Dragon Rage","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/540880/767a2a5b10780b0bb5af05d210211ea5be056856.jpg"},{"name":"Kiss from a Rose","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/540880/453c58422807052e6cb02f7425aa470901bb3dab.jpg"},{"name":"Dragon Rider","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/540880/158f76a6845d73b6f33c76155ecf28960a53dac1.jpg"},{"name":"Quite a Handful","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/540880/e4a68ebca1bcde652c3bc811598c998e0f0c77e5.jpg"},{"name":"Fist of the Beast King","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/540880/ee266cb722a05daf938eb738fb5311d1bc2f5b78.jpg"},{"name":"Tamer of Beasts ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/540880/1f58bd41448bc83dc13fd20e30e51bd030e87822.jpg"},{"name":"What Is This, a Kingdom for Ants?
