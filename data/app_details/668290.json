{"about_the_game":"In <i>From Orbit</i> you'll manage the crew of a small spaceship.  Stranded deep in uncharted space, they need to make their way home.

Escape. The resources on each planet won't last forever, but the alien creatures willing to bite your legs off never seem to end, eventually overwhelming even the most stalwart crew.
