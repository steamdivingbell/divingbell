{"about_the_game":"The Golden Age of the Kingdom of Draknus, brought forth by the legendary Golden Hero\u2019s rebellion, is long over. However, those ancient malicious dragons, which once kept the Draknians enslaved for hundreds of years, are invading in order to return the people to fetters and chains. Fortunately, the ancestors of the Golden Hero remain as the royal family of Draknus.<br><br>Of warfare and a burning passion is what I sing. In this fantasy RPG inspired by both ancient western literature and contemporary media, you play as Princess Vendra Thetis, one of the two royal twins of Draknus, and travel the provinces of the kingdom in order to secure stability for the lands, which have been blighted by the destabilization efforts of the kingdom\u2019s ancient and hated enemy, the Malhepteon. Fight and watch how Vendra develops into a person fit for her station as she burns away her reputation as the \u201cWorthless Princess,\u201d a title attributed to her that originated from her bitter rivalry with her twin brother, Prince Gaius Thetis.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">This Game Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> A strategic take on turn-based party combat.<br></li><li> A new, but simple magic element system that encourages using spell combinations, thinking a turn or two ahead, and coordination across party members.<br></li><li> A dynamic level cap that helps avid explorers from becoming undesirably over-leveled.<br></li><li> Three difficulty settings that work in tandem with the dynamic level cap to keep players on par with the power curve, under-powered, or over-powered.<br></li><li> 20+ hours of main quest and side quest content (may vary based on play style).<br></li><li> A rich character-driven narrative set in a fantasy kingdom with some unique cultural aspects.<br></li><li> A segmented open world!
