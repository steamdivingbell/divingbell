{"about_the_game":"Finally, there is exciting news for fans of WRS again! Just in time for the start of the winter season, a DLC will be released with a new game world, frequently requested features and no less than three new ropeways. The highlight is the completely new 8-seater gondola lift from Doppelmayr with a long-awaited middle station, which brings plenty of new technical gaming fun for single and multiplayer. Speaking of multiplayer, the DLC also introduces a skiing mode for multiplayer with 3rd-person perspective, which can be enjoyed on the fun slope on the new map. In addition to the DLC, a major update to the main WRS2 game will also be released, which will be available for free to all WRS2 customers.
