{"about_the_game":"Manage the resources and population of your station to expand it, bringing in more humans to work and ensuring their survival while mining resources from mysterious asteroids. Beware, dangers in space are all around you, and some are closer than they appear. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSTORY :<br />\r\nOne year ago, an asteroid nearly destroyed life on Earth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, after colliding with the Moon, it deviated from its trajectory and is now orbiting Earth. This asteroid, rich in valuable resources such as various metals and ice, has captured the world's attention for an even more valuable resource: the 'Galiorb', which can be used in many electronic components such as microchips or batteries. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnfortunately, the core of the asteroid is highly radioactive, and no human could survive on its surface for more than a few seconds. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe only solution to mine the precious Galiorb is to build a space station at a safe distance from the asteroid to send mining drones for short periods before their circuits begin to fail. This is how the 'Stellar Station' project was born, and it is now seeking engineers to design and build the station, making it suitable for human habitation and the operation of its various modules.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, the intensive mining of the asteroids starts triggering anomalies that getting more and more serious and dangerous.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3028420?t=1732105154","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3028420/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1732105154","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3028420/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732105154","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3028420/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732105154","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"HDR available","id":61}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Manage the resources and population of your station to expand it, bringing in more humans to work and ensuring their survival while mining resources from mysterious asteroids.
