{"about_the_game":"Learn Words - Use Syllables is an exciting mix between a word and a trivia game. Words are split into colorful syllables and you have to put them back together as fast as possible. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe words in every level are bound to a certain topic, so you have to know about the topic to solve it. If you aren't that familiar with a specific topic - simply click the bulb and learn something new!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMain Features<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- 100 levels split into 10 separate categories, ranging from science and geography to technology knowledge<br />\r\n- Classic and limited time modes<br />\r\n- Learn spelling and syllabification of words, plus new vocabulary!<br />\r\n- Play in 8 different languages - Polish, English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian or Dutch. <br />\r\n- Each language with separate progression - switch easily and expand your knowledge of new languages<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpell quiz<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStart with simple single syllable words and get into more difficult territories as you progress. Build complex words and put your grammar knowledge to a test. Can you solve all the available levels in all 8 languages?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSyllables are split into separate colorful bubbles to help you get into new levels easily. First syllable of a word always starts with a capital letter, which will make starting a level clear and you won't ever get stuck.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMeet our clever owl!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNeed some help to start your initial experience? - That's where our clever owl will come in handy. Let our companion guide you through initial levels to learn all the mechanics and solve a handful of entry levels before getting into the uncharted waters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCollect stars, unlock new categories<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith every level your performance will get scored and as you'll collect enough stars - new categories will unlock. Get back to already finished levels and try to collect as many stars as possible. Will you manage to unlock all the available categories?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you're opting for something easy to learn the ropes, we encourage you to start with the sport or geography categories as they'll test your everyday knowledge.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you're get more expertise, you'll be able to get into the technology and science categories and explore the metaverse or even the outer space parts of our universe!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCan't decide on a category?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLearning syllables is difficult enough and you don't want to focus on choosing the right category? Let our random mode decide for you!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn random mode the game will enter one of your already unlocked levels and will surprise you with a set of unexpected words to guess. Master all the word and syllables throughout different languages and score a 3-star result in every category to become the master of words.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Hello World!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2195570/e4e0d9a6b42f8fef0031e8e888f8166fa695c044.jpg"},{"name":"Pupil","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2195570/963733c40e3425f52009611ff41517a3624431e2.jpg"},{"name":"Pro","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2195570/ce5dd200089a83d176c412fc138c713efdd296d5.jpg"},{"name":"Scholar","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2195570/fbc7c89243d1fa9d512278bff00b445331d8cf5f.jpg"},{"name":"Expert","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2195570/b50449237b5fbdae7fe89d6e532c2e32f0404874.jpg"},{"name":"Master of words","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2195570/3f45664a26b33ff7b7c1330a60eff61cc27eb9a8.jpg"},{"name":"Linguist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2195570/362170d56721a2d9c6c0fdbe70be6b27330d59df.jpg"},{"name":"Polyglot","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2195570/25b63b816a020fbb56273621af99cdcd4d1adc92.jpg"},{"name":"Cheat sheet","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2195570/2aecb1156ed27b179f3b2892520f59aa0b823729.jpg"},{"name":"Top of the class","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2195570/8ecc588383bf46918fc42d328079fb6842c54d10.jpg"}],"total":15},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2195570/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726473992","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2195570/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1726473992","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2195570/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726473992","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2195570/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726473992","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Learn Words - Use Syllables is an exciting mix between a word and a trivia game.
