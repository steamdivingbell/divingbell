{"about_the_game":"Find the unfindable and do the impossible? It\u2019s all in a day\u2019s work for you. As a concierge, how far will you go to make billionaires\u2019 dreams come true?<br><br><i>Platinum Package</i> is a 500,000-word interactive contemporary drama by Emily Short, with additional content by Harris Powell-Smith, where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based\u2014without graphics or sound effects\u2014and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.<br><br>As an employee of Platinum Concierge, it\u2019s your job to find the unfindable and do the impossible for the world\u2019s wealthiest people. Charter a helicopter on fifteen minutes\u2019 notice to bypass LA rush-hour traffic? Transport a priceless emerald-and-diamond necklace across three continents? Arrange a candlelit dinner in a cave with waiters that rappel down the walls? No problem at all. You have your finger on the pulse of every brand, trend, and connection of the still-new 21st century.<br><br>But you also get to see the darkness behind the glitter: the excess, the waste, the callousness of the overly wealthy, the sacrifices that your colleagues make to help already-privileged people's wishes come true.<br><br>As your slate of clients grows, you\u2019ll need to bring every bit of professional skill that you\u2019ve got. When clients\u2019 requests take you close to the edge of legality - and sometimes, over it - will you still grant their wishes? Will you cover up your clients\u2019 misdeeds, no matter how far they go? Will you try to convince them to walk a different path? Will you join them for the ride, basking in the luxury of their lifestyle - and possibly even becoming fabulously wealthy yourself? Will you help your fellow concierges rise along with you, or will you betray and undermine them at every turn?<br><br>How far will you go to help your clients?
