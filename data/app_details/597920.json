Fight or Flight. Here you must survive, using your wits, strength, bravery and cunningness. Grow up from a cub, find a home and mate, have kids and raise them, leave a legacy and rule the forest.<br><br><br>Journey through a vast, seamless world filled with the wild carnivores and dormant humongous herds of herbivores as you survive in the forest.<br>You take birth as a cub, weak and untrained for this wild, rampant and harsh forest. There is a chance of your Mother and / or Father being alive with you. As the game is a simulation of the real wild. If you are alone it will be harder for the player to survive initially. Being a child is important as you grow in strength, gain strength quicker when child. Hunt / Forage, find a home and Mate as you grow up with time or quick growth.<br>Mating will produce kids (if done right), if you die during a fantastic battle. Your spirit has the chance to take over the body of your offspring if you have any. This will enable you as the spirit to live longer and continue your stride towards dominance in the forest. (The spirit can only move in the family blood line ).<br><br> <br>The game has been tried to be as realistic as possible. I\u2019ve tried to imitate real animals in the game from smallest animals to the largest. The traits, statistics and behaviours of each animal is unique, distinctive and are recreated from reality.<br>There is a small story why this game was developed by me personal but a part of the reason why this game to being is to say \u201cProtect our Animals\u201c.<br><br><br>Survivalizm is not an empty sandbox. I\u2019ve tried to fill it with reactive AI all throughout the world. In each area, you enter. The AI isn\u2019t just see player and Attack like 95% of games.<br>The AI in Survivalizm:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Moves in herd<br></li><li>Finds its own food and water<br></li><li>Finds mates<br></li><li>Protects its children<br></li><li>Feeds it children<br></li><li>Reacts to player:<br>                - Runs if Player is better in strength or is Predator.
