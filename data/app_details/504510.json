Being a small group of dedicated students with no money to spend on music, we have been blown away by quality and love all composers put into their work for the project. It has been an amazing journey and we are happy to finally to share some of that with you today.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe are excited to offer the music of Divinia Chronicles as a standalone soundtrack, we hope you enjoy it wherever you are or travel.
