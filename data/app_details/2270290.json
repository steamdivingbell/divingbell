{"about_the_game":"<strong>STORY</strong><br><br>In ROCK RUSH, you are Stoner (the dumbest rock in the world). He decides one day that he wants to figure out a way to defeat paper, and in turn, Break The Cycle. His logical decision is to pump dangerous experimental drugs into him and grab his gun. This allows him to dash (dashing is good as rocks cannot walk). It makes him able to avoid paper and rescue scissors (which cuts the paper). The underlying question is what will the effects of the choice to Break The Cycle be?<br><br><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong><br><br>In ROCK RUSH you have to play through a set of 5 sections for each level (usually). You only have 15 seconds on the clock and you gain a slight amount of time at the end of each level. To complete a section you need to grab the key, then free the scissors. You will be graded based on how well you played at the end of a level. As well as the ticking time until you eventually crash you have to deal with your stamina. The only way to increase it is to find syringes in boxes. Another building layer is the challenge to avoid paper. The paper can never truly die until you complete the level as the paper can tape itself back up. The only way to truly defeat paper is by rescuing the scissors which will then cut the paper. If the paper grabs onto you, it will squeeze you until you die. Once you get further in the game you can get guns along with boxes that can only be destroyed by guns. These guns are useful in stalling paper and breaking boxes, but it's hard to aim while dashing, forcing you to stop and waste time. This game also only has 3 lives, when they are all lost you must restart to level 1. All these chaotic elements create a game that requires fast thinking, along with mastery over the gameplay, and the systems within the game. It's a hard game that always makes you feel like you can make it, yet you keep dying over and over.<br><br><strong>REASONS TO GET GAME</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Made by one guy (maybe a cool one?)<br></li><li> You are a rock (very cool)<br></li><li> You shoot many guns (all fun to shoot)<br></li><li> Your worst enemy is paper (obviously)<br></li><li> You can dash (but cooler because you're on drugs)<br></li><li> Original art and music (wild stuff)</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2270290/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1673320149","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2270290/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1673320149","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2270290/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1673320149","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2270290/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1673320149","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2270300,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<strong>STORY</strong><br><br>In ROCK RUSH, you are Stoner (the dumbest rock in the world).
