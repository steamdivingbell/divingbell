{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You start off in a quite empty two dimensional plane of space, you can move around any direction your facing. Then suddenly you are quite likely to encounter some polygon asteroids, make sure to not bump into these. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">But do not worry you have some tools to aid you, such as handy laser shooters strapped to the front of your ship, fire these to damage asteroids, once an asteroid is hit enough it will break up into smaller ones, if that's helpful? idk up to you. If you do accidentally gently bump into an asteroid, do not panic! Your ship is also equipped with the finest energy shields in the galaxy, be aware tho, these shields do not regenerate health, so make the most out of your immunity.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your mission? Quite simple. You must follow the tracker signal.. this will lead you to a <i>waypoint. The amount of these you have collected will be visible to you. What are they for you ask? Absolutely nothing (yet).</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Anything else you should know about? There may be a couple things lurking around....
