{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With the Himrrs, a special freight wagon is making its way into Train Simulator. At the late 1990s, the Himrrs was developed as a two-part sliding wall wagon, which is used in particular for transporting bulky but lightweight parts in the automotive industry. The reason for this is the large loading dimensions, which exceed the G2 standard \u2013 this means that the wagon can only be used on routes with special permits. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">From 1998, the wagon developed by ADtranz was built in Hungary and then taken over by TRANSWAGGON GmbH. At DB, these were then classified as private wagons, easily recognisable by the &quot;P&quot; following running number. While the majority of the wagons have an unpainted aluminium shell, a handful were painted in bright yellow. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The virtual re-creation for Train Simulator awaits with a detailed model and high-resolution textures and inscriptions.
