{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><u>Vessels and Retainers</u></strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Unleash Unique Strategies and Combos</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Syndicate of Souls, players take control of a Retainer, one of many powerful characters from the game\u2019s world. Retainers have the unique ability to wield Vessels, ancient weapons that contain the souls of mythical beings. When paired with Vessels, Retainers can single-handedly change the tide of any battle.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This synergy isn't just rich in lore; it transforms gameplay. Players can mix and match Retainers and Vessels at will, creating unique strategies and devastating combos. Whether equipping the warrior Myr with the lethal reach of Prideseeker, or the maven Lin with the constant swarm of Entom, players will have the chance to demonstrate their skill and creativity on an ever-changing battlefield.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><u>Prepare for Battle</u></strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Syndicate of Souls features a variety of maps to choose from. Enter Dreamfall Grove for the traditional 5v5 MOBA experience, with combat spread across three lanes and a colorful jungle. For faster-paced games, try the Deserted Stronghold, a two-lane 3v3 map set in the swampy ruins of an ancient fortress. Lastly, Roadway to Ruin is a single-lane map with several side objectives, great for condensed 1v1 duels or hectic team fights.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3327160/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733242879","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3327160/page.bg.jpg?t=1733242879","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3327160/a9e4a5fc0ef57169d6b74c3c0137f24b7cc28716/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733242879","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3327160/a9e4a5fc0ef57169d6b74c3c0137f24b7cc28716/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733242879","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Fantasy Violence, Revealing outfits, Mild profanity"},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><u>Vessels and Retainers</u></strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Unleash Unique Strategies and Combos</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Syndicate of Souls, players take control of a Retainer, one of many powerful characters from the game\u2019s world.
