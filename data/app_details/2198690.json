The Trivia game for people who don't like trivia. Which number is bigger? The number of streetlights in the world, or the number of rats in New York City? Bet on which is bigger, and risk it all to bring home a win! We spent <strong>hundreds of hours</strong> making sure the facts are legit. 2-20 players, great for drop-in-drop-out play.<br><br>Unrealty: Ever find yourself trying to sell your friend a treehouse that has a waterslide, a clockwork butler, and a Unicorn stable? No? Well you will if you're playing Unrealty! Everyone is a real estate agent, trying to sell fantastical houses to one of your friends, who is playing as a whimsical client. Houses have crazy upsides and hilarious downsides. Debate your friends on whose house is best, then play a Rumor on their houses to make them worse! The Improv game that helps players that are bad at improv. 3-7 players, great for close friends.<br><br>Little Stinkers: Pass around the net in this short and snappy game of trying to figure out whether or not your friend is telling the truth about what bugs in the net, or if they're a STINKER! If you get caught lying, or if you accuse someone incorrectly of lying, take a stinkbug. First to 3 stinkbugs LOSES and everyone else wins! 3-6 players, Great for dirty, stinking liars.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2198690/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733091880","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2198690/page.bg.jpg?t=1733091880","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2198690/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733091880","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2198690/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733091880","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Game contains occasional text prompts referencing nudity and alluding to drug use.
