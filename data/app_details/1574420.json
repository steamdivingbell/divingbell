There are two ways of making a map for Chunkers:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Design the map in-game and save it from the menu</strong>. As a server admin, you can use the 'creative' command to give yourself every block there is and design the map from within the engine. You can also self-host a server and design the map with your friends. And yes, you can save how the map currently looks from any server you're currently connected to as well.</li><li><strong>Use a voxel editor</strong>. Chunkers maps are saved in a voxel format that's usually used for voxel art. Any editor supporting this format can be used to edit the map. To learn more about this, check out our documentation.</li></ul><br>Chunkers also features many interesting blocks that interact with their surroundings. For example:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Lava</strong> gives damage to any player walking over it</li><li><strong>The Piston</strong> bounces the player high into the air when stepped on</li><li><strong>The Explosive</strong> ignites when shot and explodes in a little while after</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1574420/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1670409033","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1574420/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1670409033","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1574420/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1670409033","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1574420/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1670409033","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1574420/extras/ezgif-1-6889347168.gif?t=1670409033\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>\ud83d\ude1f This project is no longer being worked on \ud83d\udc94</strong></h2>Sadly, Chunkers was too much of a mess for us to finish.
