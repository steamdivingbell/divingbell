{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0 \u00a0 The game presented to your attention is based on simple game mechanics, where you must control a letters flying up. Letters move freely, but having reached the limit, they remain in a certain aligned column. Your task is to make words from flying letters, directing them to the column you need. The main goal of the game: to make &quot;Diamond&quot; words to advance through the levels, and ultimately complete the game. The secondary goal is to make bonus words to increase your score several times. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Features of the game: </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 1.

And the word does not necessarily have to start from the top of the column, it can start from any position. Every time a letter is docked, the combination of letters in the dictionary is checked, and if such a word is in the dictionary, it will be highlighted. At this point, and before docking another letter, you can delete the highlighted word. Or you can leave it to later make a longer word. The longer the word, the more points you earn by deleting it. In order to move on to a new level, you must make a certain (Diamond) word. It is chosen randomly and at the first level its length is two letters. Having made this word, you move on to a next level where the length of the Diamond word increases by one. And so on until the thirteenth level, after which you become a winner! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0 \u00a0 If you decided that the game is too easy, then do not rush to conclusions. It is very difficult. And the thing is that the letter you need may not appear for a very long time, and from those that do appear you need to make words and clear the field, because if your letter docks with the fifteenth row, you lose. But don't worry, if you have advanced to a new level, your current score and level will be saved. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Good luck in completing the game!
