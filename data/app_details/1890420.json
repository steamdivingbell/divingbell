{"about_the_game":"Darkness and futuristic drama awaits with Darkest Hour from Ayato Sound Create!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith a focus on electronic beats, this pack is perfect for modern or sci-fi games! Explore cyber cities or busy malls while the beats thrum in your players ears. Battle against thugs with the strumming of electric guitars playing in the background, or choose one of the tracks with a heavy and fast paced beat to keep your players focused on the fight. Or grab the more haunted tracks with creaks and almost ghostly wails to turn an empty building into someplace creepier and much more dangerous. Even the more upbeat tracks still carry a bit of underlining darkness, meaning that you can give your players a slight feeling of unease even during happy moments. After all, that cheeriness can\u2019t last forever, right?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd with multiple file formats for each song, it\u2019s easy to drop them into your favorite engine and start using them right away!
