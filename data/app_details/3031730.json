{"about_the_game":"About this game:<br />\r\nThis game is a Soul-like swordplay game where you fight from morning to night, switching between two characters depending on the situation.<br />\r\nAs a knight employed by a futuristic city, you need to fight smartly and avoid taking as much damage as possible in order to get a good evaluation.<br />\r\nThe evaluation from the company is very strict, so if you do not fight seriously for one day, you will be fired and the game will be over.<br />\r\nWhen night falls and the day ends, the company will evaluate your battles for the day. If your evaluation is B or higher, you will continue to be employed, but if it is below that, you will be fired and the game will be over.<br />\r\nIf you continue to be employed, you will then fight a boss enemy.<br />\r\nRepeat this for five days, and defeat the boss enemy on the fifth day to reach the ending.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the start of a stage, you first select one of ten cards.<br />\r\nCards increase or decrease stamina (enemy/player), increase or decrease attack power (enemy/player), and double (halve) experience point gain. There are ten types of cards in total. The enemy/player's status will change according to the content of each card.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the two characters is always selected with a blue frame around its face image. If you change the character you are controlling to the character with the blue frame, your attack power will be 1.5 times higher.<br />\r\nSo the trick to fighting advantageously is to always select the character with the increased attack power.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCrosses (health), gears (experience points), swords (increases attack power), and triangles (increases reputation with companies) are placed randomly on the field on the mini-map.<br />\r\nYou can obtain up to three sword marks with sword upgrades and choose from them.<br />\r\nSword upgrades have a rarity and are assigned random values.<br />\r\nObtaining a cross mark as a character's stamina will restore 50 health for two characters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDo your best to fight through five days.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n*The trial version is designed so that the game will end after a certain amount of time.<br />\r\n*Keyboard controls are not possible.<br />\r\n*Operation cannot be guaranteed with controllers other than the XBOX CONTROLLER.","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3031730/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718714308","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3031730/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718714308","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"About this game:<br />\r\nThis game is a Soul-like swordplay game where you fight from morning to night, switching between two characters depending on the situation.<br />\r\nAs a knight employed by a futuristic city, you need to fight smartly and avoid taking as much damage as possible in order to get a good evaluation.<br />\r\nThe evaluation from the company is very strict, so if you do not fight seriously for one day, you will be fired and the game will be over.<br />\r\nWhen night falls and the day ends, the company will evaluate your battles for the day.
