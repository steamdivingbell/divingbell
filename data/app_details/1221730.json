{"about_the_game":"Avani has a chance to save her mother's life if she can convince an entire town that science is fake. Play as Avani, debating everyone you can find in turn-based battles to persuade them to follow you. You will be debating alone, but those that accompany you will follow you to the ends of the earth.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CLASSIC RPG GAMEPLAY</h2><br>Equip yourself in the best gear to fight (debate) in classic turn based encounters. Each battle will improve your knowledge and debate tactics. Level up to discover new skills. The more followers you acquire the more areas you will be able to explore.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TACTICS</h2><br>Instead of axes and fireballs, you will be using debate tactics and tricks like <strong>Unverified Claim</strong>, <strong>Strawman Argument</strong>, <strong>Conspiracy Video</strong>, <strong>Loaded Question</strong>, or <strong>Misinformation Meme</strong>. Beware though, your opponents will have defensive techniques of their own, like <strong>Scholarly Article</strong>, <strong>Peer Reviewed Journal</strong>, <strong>Fact Check</strong>, <strong>Critical Thinking</strong>, or <strong>Check Sources</strong>. Don't worry, though, just <strong>Deflect</strong> to block and gain back your health!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">STORY</h2><br>Discover an emotional story that is at times as sad as it is ridiculous.
