Battle against a variety of dangerous enemies and hunt down the Doomsdragon as foretold by prophecy. Kyvir: Rebirth is a single player card game that combines elements of RPG, deck building, and roguelike gameplay. This game features an original dual deck mechanism, hundreds of distinctive items, skills, and cards for you to experiment with. The possibilities are endless, ensuring a unique experience with every adventure.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dual Deck Combat</h2>Fight exciting enemies with unique characters that each have an assortment of weapons. Each weapon will enable different styles of combat. Navigate the ability to control two decks in battle. There are no fixed paths to victory. Leverage your cards, equipment, skills, and, most importantly, your wit to construct powerful builds for every occasion. And come share your experience with our community.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Class Skills</h2>Learn different skills with different characters on every adventure.
