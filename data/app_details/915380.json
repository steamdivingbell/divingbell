{"about_the_game":"In the early 2000s there was this game, called &quot;Johnny Megatone&quot;.<br>I used to play it on the television, and it made my infancy.<br>In 2011, Johnny disappeared from my country and it's been since then that I haven't been able to give it a taste again.<br><br>For some nostalgia reasons I guess, I long longed to propose something similar for the pc universe. Something like Johnny!<br>I also wanted my game to feel like a tribute to the original, since I miss it so much!<br><br>There were 6 arches in the authentic game and mine covers the first, settled in a forest and other beautiful places.<br><br>To sell without copyright problems, the whole artistic side of the project was made completely by me using Photoshop.<br>Some backgrounds and sounds were obtained from the internet, but always copyright-free.<br>Scripting was also developed by me as well as the choice of the game engine.<br><br><strong>Characteristics</strong><br>- There is no possibility to save. This is because I wanted to mantain a certain extent of atmosphere that also the original had (In fact I couldn't save there!);<br>- On the other hand, this game can be completed in 2 hours if you never lose and are either talented or lucky;<br>- Movement system is choppy and kinda slow. Again, I did that on purpose because I really enjoyed it back then in Johnny;<br>- It is not said that a scenario change leads to a more hostic gameplay. It might be, but that's not 100% assured;<br>- There are some interesting secret passages you might want to find and delve deeply into;<br>- You'll have a pistol with 6 projectiles and 6 bombs that are needed to go on and survive; you can find supplies for them during the course;<br>- Enemies respawn if you go back and forth through each screen; keep that in mind and don't waste your inventory;<br>- Learning the movement system might take a few tries: it's not easy to get into it and might annoy at first. Don't give up!<br>- You'll start your adventure with 10 lives. To increase your chances of surviving, gather up 1000 points to obtain one extra life point;<br>- Avoid traps, choose right timings, kill enemies, crouch when needed, detonate bombs to destroy unstable dirt, climb ladders and use moving platforms to go on!<br>- I reckon this game will be great for the ones who are curious!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/915380/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1536103142","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/915380/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1536103142","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/915380/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1536103142","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/915380/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1536103142","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In the early 2000s there was this game, called &quot;Johnny Megatone&quot;.<br>I used to play it on the television, and it made my infancy.<br>In 2011, Johnny disappeared from my country and it's been since then that I haven't been able to give it a taste again.<br><br>For some nostalgia reasons I guess, I long longed to propose something similar for the pc universe.
