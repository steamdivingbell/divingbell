{"about_the_game":"Welcome to Vandaan, a gripping post-apocalyptic game where you wander alone through the remnants of a shattered world. Your mission is to find the right path to save a loved one. Without the ability to save your progress, every decision has irreversible consequences.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe once-vibrant world lies in ruins. Abandoned cities, crumbling buildings, and overgrown streets are all that remain of a civilization that has fallen. You must uncover the secrets of this desolate landscape as you navigate through the wreckage, always searching for clues that will bring you closer to your goal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe world you traverse is full of dangers. Treacherous terrain, collapsing structures, and unexplored areas pose a constant threat. A single mistake could be fatal, as there is no way to save your journey. Every step must be carefully considered, and you must be prepared to face the challenges that block your way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this unforgiving environment, you are entirely on your own. There are no allies, only the silent world around you. Your survival depends on how well you adapt to the new reality and make the right choices.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVandaan offers an intense gaming experience in a bleak, abandoned world. With no ability to save, every moment is filled with tension and danger. Find the right path, uncover the dark secrets, and fight for survival in a world where you are completely alone.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2266590/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727451408","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2266590/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1727451408","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2266590/df9c7db2fe20863db987a9876ec49b1af6ffcae4/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727451408","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2266590/df9c7db2fe20863db987a9876ec49b1af6ffcae4/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727451408","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to Vandaan, a gripping post-apocalyptic game where you wander alone through the remnants of a shattered world.
