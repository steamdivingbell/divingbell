{"about_the_game":"<strong>Carve Your Own Path</strong><br><br>Ethos 2: Fall Of Empires is a Historical RPG where every single decision you make affects your journey. Abilities, upgrades, weapons, interactions, quests, the atmosphere, and much more, are all affected by the actions and moral decisions you make within the game. <br><br>Become a tyrant, a hero, a lone wolf, or many other archetypes, the choice is yours!<br><br><strong>The Story</strong><br><br>The game takes place in the year 1453. You play as Constantine XI Palaiologos, the last Emperor of the Byzantine Empire. Your once great city of Constantinople has fallen into the hands of the Ottomans and your goal is to take it back. <br><br>You can do this by gathering troops/equipment/allies from leaders of other nearby nations in Egypt, the Balkans, The Middle East, and more! OR you can also choose to overthrow the leaders of other nations, and take their nations by force! <br><br>You may also attempt to take back Constantinople by making yourself an extremely powerful one-man-army, and attempt to take the city by yourself whenever you are ready. This can be through many means such as assassination of Mehmed the Conqueror, or by facing the entire Ottoman army by yourself.<br><br><strong>Style</strong><br><br>The game is very non-linear. Meaning that you can technically attempt to finish the final quest very early on in the game. Its an open-world game that doesn't place a limit on exploration. <br><br><strong>Consequences</strong><br><br>Want to murder a main character that you need to complete a quest? Go for it. But expect there to be consequences. Want to become a pacifist and try to not harm anyone ever? Go for it. But expect there to be consequences.<br><br><strong>Why This Game Is Being Made</strong><br><br>As a massive RPG-fan, I was very tired of many AAA games giving you the illusion of 'your decisions matter'. Because at the end of the day, choices in many AAA games pretty much only affected how much of a discount you could get at a merchants shop, or how some NPC's react to you when you walk by. <br><br>I really want choices to matter in games. And that's why this game is being made.<br><br>Saying that, this is a passion project for myself, and no one should expect this to be a AAA title. But hopefully it could be a really fun indie game that people can replay and have fun with :)","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1787680/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1634070592","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1787680/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1634070592","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1787680/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1634070592","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1787680/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1634070592","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Killing, Battles, Weapons, Blood.
