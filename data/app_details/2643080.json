{"about_the_game":"For most, Archaeology is supposed to be a quiet job. For this team, it's been an incredibly hard one.

A planet ship of incredible size and technology, said by some to even have the power to grant wishes!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut when it turns out not only to be hostile but active too, and shoots down one of the team only for them to call a desperate last wish for revenge that it actually decides to grant, things go from bad to disastrous! With an ancient superweapon out to grant revenge, your friend injured and a galaxy unaware of the danger approaching it, that's where you come in!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTaking control of an elite fighter, the Type One, you'll have to take to the air and space across 5 levels, to stop the ancient threat before it's too late! Master the ship's lasers, beam weapons and it's screen clearing electron pulse to make it through! And take care-the enemy has more than a few tricks up their sleeves!<br />\r\nAnd, if you're feeling up to the challenge, aim for that 1cc perfect run!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2643080/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1699873578","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2643080/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1699873578","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2643080/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1699873578","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2643080/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1699873578","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"For most, Archaeology is supposed to be a quiet job.
