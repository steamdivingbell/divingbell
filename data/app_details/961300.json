The UHD image captures the original illustration in great detail and you will be able to observe even the finest of details exactly as the artist has painted them on the canvas. The puzzle is of medium to high difficulty, therefore it will provide you with a satisfactory challenge even if you're an expert in assembling this type of image. There are distinct elements to give you the foundation here, but there are also a few uniform areas and similar-looking details that might get harder to sort out. Overall, the image has a lot of great and very detailed elements in it to make it very fun and rewarding to reconstruct.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/961300/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1589663099","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/961300/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1589663099","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/961300/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1589663099","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/961300/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1589663099","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"For your enjoyment, we present <strong>The Goblin Watermill</strong> - another beautiful artwork from the Polish illustrator <strong>Elwira Pawlikowska</strong>.
