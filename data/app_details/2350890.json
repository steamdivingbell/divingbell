{"about_the_game":"Full of grit, action, and stray bullets, <strong>The Declassifier</strong> is a top-down shooter set in an alternate version of USA inspired by action B-movies from the 80's. Take control of an inconspicuous trucker who - on his quest for revenge - stumbles face first into the government\u2019s behind the scenes workings and long kept secrets. Don\u2019t let them brainwash them any more and you just might turn out to be the only person capable of handing freedom back to the people\u2026 democratically, more or less. <br><br>This game will test your reflexes and precision, all while touching upon conspiratorial and controversial subjects - presented as tongue-in-cheek as you\u2019d expect from an 80\u2019s action flick. Be ready to fight your way through compact levels packed to the brim with enemies, master your weapons and gadgets, and see how the public and the media react to your quest.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2350890/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727738029","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2350890/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1727738029","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2350890/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727738029","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2350890/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727738029","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Full of grit, action, and stray bullets, <strong>The Declassifier</strong> is a top-down shooter set in an alternate version of USA inspired by action B-movies from the 80's.
