{"about_the_game":"Become the Leader of the surviving societies in Surviving the Aftermath: New Alliances. <br>The future of humanity is in your hands: new settlements - and new enemies - arise,  and what was just a memory of civilization can become a reality. Find allies, fight common enemies, and unite the Wasteland!<br><br>Key features <br><br><strong>Stronger together:</strong> meet varied societies and help them with their requests to earn their loyalty and improve your colony with more than 12 new buildings.<br>Positive interactions with other societies increase your reputation. But fail to meet their expectations and you\u2019ll see them join your new rival, who will gain more control over the Wasteland.<br><br><strong>New enemies in a Dynamic World Map:</strong> bandits and beasts scour the Wasteland, compelling you to protect your settlement and those of your allies. Groups of bandits terrorize survivors and take over key locations. Make sure to defend and support other societies by trading and constructing new buildings whenever possible. An expanded user interface allows you to manage every single step to the unification of the Wasteland. <br><br><strong>Covert missions:</strong> shaping a new world isn\u2019t easy. And while collaboration is key, leaders can influence societies in more\u2026 subtle ways. Sabotage, theft, espionage, and even propaganda will become tools in your arsenal, and specialists\u2019 skills will affect how likely they are to succeed in a mission. Be mindful of the consequences though: failure will decrease your reputation and give more control to your rival and may cause the societies you targeted to retaliate.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1803780/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1700122249","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1803780/page.bg.jpg?t=1700122249","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1803780/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1700122249","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1803780/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1700122249","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Become the Leader of the surviving societies in Surviving the Aftermath: New Alliances. <br>The future of humanity is in your hands: new settlements - and new enemies - arise,  and what was just a memory of civilization can become a reality.
