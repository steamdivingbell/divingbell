{"about_the_game":"Welcome to Pyramid Game!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaybe you are wondering why you need to play this game? Because pyramids are everywhere in the real world. Pyramidal architecture has been found all over the world in the long and bright history of human civilization.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you enter the game, you will be given a corresponding bank account that will immediately arrive with a sum of money, which will be your initial funds. The bank account will be determined by the level of bank you purchase, with the game itself plus the 5 DLCs totaling 6 different levels of bank accounts, and the initial amount of money arriving being the minimum daily closing balance for that level of bank account. Please note that purchasing the DLC does not add wealth to your existing assets, the 6 bank levels generate 6 separate game archives. Because we are not looking for players to increase their wealth in the game by purchasing the DLC, but rather these 6 initial funds symbolize 6 different classes of birth, we want players to experience if the different classes of birth will affect where they end up. Some of our DLC is very expensive, even though we know that players are fully capable of buying it, but we do not want players to buy it, but as a contrast, our original intention is to let players understand that even if they are born with a low starting point, they can still through their own hard work and wisdom finally arrive at a position that belongs to them, maybe in the end, this position is very high, maybe not so high, but both are the most suitable for them, the most admirable. Similarly, even if you were born with a high starting point, it's not easy to maintain your position all the time. Please remember that you will only have this initial amount of money and we will not add any microtransactions to increase your wealth, as the original purpose of this game was to ensure absolute fairness for all players. You can earn salary through different jobs, the current job is some completely randomly generated math calculations and English words, you can choose different number of questions or words and difficulty range to earn the corresponding salary, regularly do these jobs believe that you will be able to get a great enhancement of your personal ability in reality.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you have enough money, you can go to the casino to grow your wealth. Why only the casino? We have considered making a savings and investment system, but no matter what we did, we eventually realized that more money will always have an advantage over less money, and it's not completely fair. Our casino system is also limited to dice and roulette, or other games controlled by a physics engine that we can think of in the future. Our casino system is absolutely fair to anyone of any wealth, through multiple completely random factors and is controlled entirely through mechanics, with no algorithms behind the scenes interfering with the results. Our purpose is to create the New World of Pyramid Game that is completely fair.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhy is it called Pyramid Game? Because your personal asset value in the game will be ranked in real time with players all over the world in the Pyramid Game Global Leaderboard, and your wealth changes will be uploaded every minute, and you can see your global ranking changes synchronously. After accumulating a certain number of players, the system automatically weights the total wealth of all players and the percentage of players in each segment, and divides all players into A to Z levels according to their rankings and wealth. Theoretically, Pyramid Game supports an unlimited number of players online all around the world at the same time, and uploads data every minute and refreshes the global leaderboard every 10 seconds without any delay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe are sure that there will be extremely computer talented players who will play this game and maybe you want to change the value of the total assets by modifying the game data. But if you look carefully at the trailer and the screenshots you should have noticed that every transaction and even every result in our casino is recorded precisely to the second. Even though up to 500 to 1500 history records are displayed in the game, but only for different computer configurations and smooth running of the game, every record of this game from the first time it was run to the last is kept intact. Our wealth value is through these data for multidimensional calculation and verification, wealth value does not exist in any of the values in the game, and even each record has a set of hash value generated by a random hash algorithm, we welcome players can crack the modified data to change the wealth to affect the ranking, because it is a reflection of personal ability, but we do not recommend doing so. Even though there is currently no program added that will clear the data if it detects that it has been modified, it is very probable that the modification error causing the data is incomplete resulting in you have to restart the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy the way, as a reminder, you can check your bank balance while working or vacationing at the casino, you can even check your bank transaction details while playing at the casino then work in your free time to make the most of every minute you have. Pyramid Game inspires you to comprehend the real world in the game, hope you find your position in the pyramid early!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"YSBC","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2936160/24ee91e6cae10f20ccd8521f278bdc216da141a5.jpg"},{"name":"YSBC Advance","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2936160/835f3481110f04f5482bc91d937be205eb0fa466.jpg"},{"name":"YSBC Premier","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2936160/02a16c4dc2653745442db6aeacbdc569e830281b.jpg"},{"name":"YSBC Elite","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2936160/69695aade996efcd1c4b33c859c50ee5e7276a24.jpg"},{"name":"YSBC Jade","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2936160/5fc11bea597d38922866e0d64a4a17caedd6fb40.jpg"},{"name":"YSBC Private","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2936160/5a31e75f6ce715d6150f109490e715a13112b7f6.jpg"}],"total":6},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2936160/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738633307","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2936160/page.bg.jpg?t=1738633307","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2936160/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738633307","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2936160/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738633307","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Welcome to Pyramid Game!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaybe you are wondering why you need to play this game?
