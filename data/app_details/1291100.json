Designed for only the bravest players, Night Spasm is an entertaining adventure of quests, combat, and personal learning experiences that tell a lore-rich story you can study, question, and interpret endlessly.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The story follows the lives of three main characters, <strong>Theodore</strong>, <strong>Vander</strong>, and <strong>Evana</strong>, three air pilots who find themselves in a mysterious world after seemingly dying from a plane crash. Saved from a cruel death by the wise and friendly mage known as <strong>&quot;MOG&quot;</strong>, the pilots find themselves in <strong>The Island</strong>, a beautiful world once designed to save the lives of those meeting an unfortunate end, now locked in war by an ambitious and terrifying enemy. <strong>Inevit</strong>, a phantom of unknown motivations, has captured a mystical entity called <strong>The Rechance</strong>, the grand source of magic power responsible for saving the lives of countless creatures, including you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As the player, you must guide the heroes in forming a colony to take down Inevit and restore The Island to its former glory.

Featuring a turn-based yet hectic combat system, decide friend versus foe to greatly alter your timeline. Strategy and resourcefulness are keys to defeating your enemies, whoever they may be, as you teach your colony members new skills, equip them for combat, and get to know them better, one way or another...</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A SMALL DECISION...</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">From the people you spare to the side quests you decide to skip, <strong>there is no illusion of choice.
