{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Arcadia Issue 013 - February 2022</h2>  Welcome to ARCADIA! Inspired by old-school tabletop magazines, ARCADIA is MCDM's digital magazine for 5th edition GMs and players. We hope you like it! <br> <br><strong> Group Maneuvers</strong> by Steve Fidler with art by Gustavo Pelissari. Has your barbarian ever wanted to toss the fighter into the fray? Have your ranger and rogue asked to fire their arrows at the same to make dodging harder for another target? Want two dragons to overlap their breath weapons at the same time on unsuspecting adventurers? This article provides new teamwork reactions that heroes and their foes can use to make combat more dynamic. <br> <br><strong> Monsters of Wonderland</strong> by Kat Kruger with art by Henrik Rosenborg. Inspired by the works of author Lewis Carroll, this article brings you new whimsical creatures to challenge your players with strange magical abilities. The bandersnatch, hag moth, mome rath, and snark come to life in these stat blocks, and they're not asking you to join a tea party. <br> <br><strong> Poor Undead Souls</strong> by Mario Orteg?n with art by Elisa Serio &amp; Faizal Fikri. Not all ghosts are the same. Each has their own unfinished business that keeps them in the world of mortals. That's why this article brings you seven new ghost variants, each with lore, exorcism techniques, new traits and action options, and a sample NPC spirit. <br>  &quot;","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2403920/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1683033258","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2403920/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1683033258","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2403920/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1683033258","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2403920/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1683033258","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Arcadia Issue 013 - February 2022</h2>  Welcome to ARCADIA!
