{"about_the_game":"Circuit de Barcelona Catalunya is the sixth premium Track DLC for Automobilista 2! A popular race track for many international racing series in recent decades and staple on the F1 calendar since 1991, the Barcelona circuit has been a favorite among teams to test and develop their cars due to its mix of long mid and high-speed corners, making it an ideal testbed to gauge and develop their aerodynamic performance. For the 2023 Grand Prix the track is reverting to the pre-2007 layout, opting out of the unpopular tight chicane at the end of the lap for the two ultra-fast right-handers that cars used to tackle back in the day before entering the long 1km long home straight. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe track currently is offered with two layouts - with and without the chicane at the end of the lap.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2461740/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1686347743","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2461740/page.bg.jpg?t=1686347743","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2461740/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1686347743","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2461740/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1686347743","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Circuit de Barcelona Catalunya is the sixth premium Track DLC for Automobilista 2!
