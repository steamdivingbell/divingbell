Who knows, maybe it will be easy and you will be able to exit through the main door. Or maybe you will make a brilliant plan that will take you through a long chain of events, and you will make the escape of the century!<br>Remember that the people around you are great helpers. This means that some old man or lady may well help you! And of course, there's a bunch of stuff around. Any item can help you escape, whether it's a key to the main door or an ordinary tablespoon.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Diseases are the main obstacle!</h2><br>You're an old man, so diseasesis an unpleasant but common thing for you. Arthritis, poor eyesight and hearing, or ordinary diarrhea can greatly affect your well-being! &quot;Escape from the Nursing Home&quot; has an impressive list of diseases, and each of them will have its own positive or negative effect on the character, as well as affect the gameplay.<br>The main thing to remember is that any disease can go to the next stage or even provoke an attack that will require urgent treatment!

Dizziness, dry mouth and weakness will definitely be your long companions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">We are all different!</h2><br>In the game &quot;Escape from the Nursing Home&quot; you can create a character to your liking. You can play as a nice old lady with an elegant haircut, or you can create an old rocker with tattoos, piercings and the most old-fashioned hairstyle!<br>But not only you have a unique appearance and history. Your neighbors and even nurses will be created randomly.<br>And of course, be ready to read a lot of funny, creepy and burning stories of their lives created by the neural network!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Friends are everything!</h2><br>To get to know your neighbors better, you'll have to make friends with them! Make new acquaintances, say a couple of compliments or even present a gift. And what it will lead to, a strong friendship or a romantic relationship, depends on you.<br>And don't forget about the medical staff. They are people too, and they can also chat with you. And maybe you'll even be able to charm them, you old lover!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">All in good time!</h2><br>You're not young and forgetfulness is your middle name, so you need to be looked after. The nurses have a well-planned schedule of the day so that you do not forget to eat, take medicine or get some fresh air in the garden. But many old people in this nursing home have their own ideas for the day, so the nurses have a lot of work to do!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Behave yourself! Or not really...</h2><br>This is not a prison, so any old man can not go to the gym, not do procedures and not attend concerts if he does not want to. You can walk all day in the garden and feed the birds at the fountain. But don't forget! There are restricted areas that are accessible only to staff. Do you want to take a walk to the staff cafeteria to drink coffee? Be prepared to be kicked out! And don't be rude to the staff, be a nice grandpa.<br>Well, if you have already ruined relations and continue to play pranks, get ready for punishments!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Escape \"Just the escape\"","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2516870/de215e863f2f8cb8daa43171a7670c996837ce2b.jpg"},{"name":"Escape \"God of Stink\"","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2516870/d553c3ab1ef88386f5d98ad866dff60b7caef5f5.jpg"},{"name":"Escape \"Still alive\"","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2516870/68f4509704e8eb9c9712a507788bee5c7dd0a433.jpg"},{"name":"You died!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2516870/fa705068da12d5ad41009e9b81491828c6f866e7.jpg"},{"name":"Not an oldster anymore!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2516870/746ee9e88599df46787476dd18078efc5bf71764.jpg"},{"name":"Formula 1!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2516870/72f4f8d5043c7b0b44dbad9d7c99df959586e4cb.jpg"},{"name":"Escape \"Green fairy...\"","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2516870/28a6e6eafe549ad6c9b1e60b4d926b986aaddf18.jpg"},{"name":"Escape \"Pure Energy - Pure Power\"","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2516870/48d072de61e27c3a2d8640985c092f1c42940228.jpg"},{"name":"Fashionable look!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2516870/2c6dc582811d96554c7b6df49be410feb9f881d2.jpg"},{"name":"Escape \"Was there a fence here?\"","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2516870/db34c337d5995519049a66f62d4ae1ecf679f1d4.jpg"}],"total":56},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2516870/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737391822","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2516870/page.bg.jpg?t=1737391822","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2516870/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737391822","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2516870/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737391822","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Roadmap</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2516870/extras/roadmap_v7.png?t=1737391822\" /></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>&quot;Escape from the Nursing Home&quot; is a role-playing game in which you have to try on the role of a nursing home patient.
