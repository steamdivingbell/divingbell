{"about_the_game":"OVIVO is a minimalist 2D platformer in a black-and-white world with an unusual mechanic. The main character, named OVO, is created from these two halves of the world and has the ability to switch between them. When OVO is black on a white background, all black elements become platforms and the white space becomes the walkable area, with gravity pulling downwards. The character can swap its colors, becoming white and causing all white areas to become platforms, with black turning into space and gravity pulling upwards.<br><br>OVO travels through this metaphorical world, filled with illusions and hidden messages, overcomes various dangers, and collects mysterious symbols.
