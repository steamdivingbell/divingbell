Every block must have a connection to the core. Each element has its own hit points, level of fire resistance, ability to resist impact and explosion. Some of them can also be flooded or lose their lift power. Every destroyed element has an impact on a vessel's combat capabilities - strategic block placement can improve your vehicle\u2019s survivability and efficiency.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Weapons</strong></h2>Each weapon is a separate object with its own logic and physics systems. Before shooting, a weapon checks if it doesn\u2019t don't hit or collide with its own vehicle. Weapons types include many variants of artillery, missile launchers, machine guns, flamethrowers, torpedo launchers, bombs, depth charges, and crazy close combat weapons. One of the unique weapons is a harpoon that can grab and pull enemies or pull its own vehicle to the ground.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Physics</strong></h2>The shape and size of the vehicles' hull affects their air and water drag. Vessels with an angled, aerodynamic hull are faster than those that look like a brick. Some blocks generate buoyancy or lift, center of which should be balanced with the center of mass. Water has realistic wave simulation, there is also wind that can be used by sails.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Mechanics</strong></h2>The game has realistic gun ballistics and armor penetration mechanics; angled surfaces offer better protection from projectiles and can cause them to ricochet. Most blocks can be made using different materials that have different weights and other properties. Enemy vehicles can behave differently, depending on what weapons they have installed and what their goals are.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Leaving a trail of fire","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/952240/630a32a17918595e45c890679bc948e5c330af6b.jpg"},{"name":"I can see their tanks from here!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/952240/f553e5d53124e06479427f5cf461ba9c380d5218.jpg"},{"name":"Crushing Depth","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/952240/e4d9e0b8617d68b4a22e52ff183845d740582741.jpg"},{"name":"Dream big, build bigger","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/952240/2ee7cb3b7dd04a2b135f89cf0a46f72ce65c097f.jpg"},{"name":"I just want to watch the trees fall","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/952240/85a625b535b7abcca2cd1fe2801fb4c301718a35.jpg"},{"name":"Lighter than air","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/952240/c45d1c2c6e75e3679a2e54821fd96df449c37494.jpg"},{"name":"Cut through the waves","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/952240/ece7b36bc89a6294a2b7d65d2897a03912ba8200.jpg"},{"name":"Diesel Efficiency","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/952240/3fcb8a0e5484a6c82f6641a83a608609790aebe1.jpg"},{"name":"Knowledge is power","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/952240/d2663cd3918b78d4e091699fbf81821175871cff.jpg"},{"name":"Nemesis on the Horizon","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/952240/f5f38e8eee9502f5960ba73d74d9cb209167b544.jpg"}],"total":23},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/952240/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726671143","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/952240/page.bg.jpg?t=1726671143","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/952240/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726671143","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/952240/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726671143","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/952240/extras/104nen.gif?t=1726671143\" /><br>Build magnificent machines from over 300 unique elements.
