{"about_the_game":"<strong>Cross of the Dutchman</strong> is an action adventure game based on the true story of the folk legend 'Pier Gerlofs Donia'. <br><br>The story takes place in <strong>medieval Western Europe</strong>, in the province of Frisia, near the turn of the 16th century. Though Pier and his family lived in peace, the world around them was changing for the worse. Saxon legions were invading nearby villages, making the lives of the native people next to impossible. On one fateful day, Pier got involved with the Saxon oppressors, escalating the situation for the worse. The events portrayed in this great adventure caused Pier to gather a band of farmers and form a front against the oppressors.
