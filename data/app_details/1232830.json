The box can be used both as a platform for you to jump off of, as well as a shield to protect you from enemies. The game requires skill and precision. However, most of the levels have multiple solutions and the game always lets you take a step back to figure out the most optimal path.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features </h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Over 50 unique and challenging levels.<br></li><li> 6 different areas, each with their own soundtrack.<br></li><li> Blue blobs.<br></li><li> Red blobs.<br></li><li> A boy.<br></li><li> A box.</li></ul>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Sweet Victory!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1232830/706475a32d2ced2fcb1dc970176c5eec9c40c9ab.jpg"},{"name":"Flawless Victory!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1232830/7366f03636422227379543655f0db0db8c896ea5.jpg"}],"total":2},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1232830/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1628857755","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1232830/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1628857755","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1232830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1628857755","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1232830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1628857755","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Boyandbox</strong> is a skill based puzzle platformer where you use a teleporting box to solve problems.
