{"about_the_game":"A not so accidental world pandemic of 2030, that turned people to their more primal selves, has become the reason for the downfall of modern civilization.

There is still a lot of work to be done. But as of today, many systems and mechanics are ready:<br>+ LOCATION: One demo extensive sandbox location &quot;Raskolovo Village&quot;.<br>+ INTERACTIVE: Over a hundred unique structures, objects and stashes to explore.<br>+ LOOT: A large number of items: clothing, shoes, hats, gear, food, drink, medicines and accessories.<br>+ INVENTORY: Items of gear and clothing with compartments for storing and moving useful items.<br>+ SAVE: A full-fledged system for saving game progress.<br>+ MOVING: Indirect control of the character with the ability to set complex trajectories from a sequence of points.<br>+ DODGES: Fast sideways dodges for greater character mobility.<br>+ PARKOUR: The ability to move over rough terrain, overcome obstacles, climb elevations and ladders.<br>+ STEALTH: The ability to walk, crouch, or crawl to reduce your character's visibility to enemies.<br>+ COVERING: The ability to take cover behind objects and operate from a safe position.<br>+ SLOW MODE: Slow down for calm and deliberate assessment and control of the situation.<br>+ WEAPONS: Non-target shooting, an extensive arsenal of modern weapons, ammunition with different types of ammo, realistic ballistics with ricochets and penetrations of obstacles<br>+ AIMING: A special aiming mode extending the range of visibility of the character and giving the ability to do point damage using optical sights. <br>+ CUSTOMIZATION: A variety of modules for customizing weapons. Modules affect the behavior of the weapon when firing.<br>+ MELEE: The ability to use kicks, cold weapons, and techniques to break free from grapples.<br>+ SURVIVAL: The damage a character takes inflicts wounds, bleeds, and worsens the character's condition. Tourniquets, bandages, and medicines are for healing and recovery. Eating and drinking restore the character's energy and water needs. Hunger and thirst affect stamina and well-being.<br>+ HOSTILE: Infected are not zombies, but people with altered consciousness due to exposure to a pathogen. Infected are fast-moving, hardy, and have increased survivability and aggression. Vision, hearing, and smell allow infected to detect and pursue prey. <br>+ PROGRESS: (Warning!) The starting version has a nominal save system. In the event of death, only the possessions in the character's inventory are saved, with the character resurrected at the starting point. Quitting the game will reset all progress and you will have to start from scratch.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PLANNED SYSTEMS</h2>During development, the following planned systems and mechanics will be added:<br>- LOCALIZATION: Translate game text into as many languages as possible: Chinese, Portuguese, Korean, German, French, Italian, Hebrew and other languages as our capabilities allow.<br>- ARSENAL: New weapon types: grenades, grenade launchers, rocket launchers, mines.<br>- DEVICES: Special equipment: night vision devices, thermal imaging cameras, tactical lidars.<br>- CUSTOMIZATION: Helmet customization: installation of lights, tactical devices on helmets.<br>- MOLLE: Customization of modular equipment: ability to reconfigure pouches on special platforms.<br>- CRAFT: Creation of essentials from ingredients.<br>- INFECTED: More types of highly dangerous infected.<br>- PEOPLE: Characters are healthy people, representatives of different factions: friendly, neutral and hostile, with their own AI system.<br>- COMPANION: An autonomous companion of the game character.<br>- SURVIVAL: Expansion of the survival system: the need for sleep, diseases, negative and positive effects and their impact on the character.<br>- EVENTS: System of random local events.<br>- RPG: Stats, parameters, skils, perks, attributes of the character and their influence on the actions performed.<br>- MAP: Global map of the region with the ability to move between individual locations, including the ability to return to already opened locations.<br>- LOCATIONS: Five extensive story locations. <br>- QUESTS: A system of quests and dialogs.<br>- STORY: Most important to the game.
