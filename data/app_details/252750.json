The fact that I became obsessed with making sure every mouse made it through the obstacle course tells you how addictive this game can be. Of the 80 levels included, there are a few that can stop you in your tracks and put you off from returning, but that minor flaw aside, MouseCraft is a great game that puzzle fans should take a look at.\u201d<br>9/10 \u2013 The Sixth Axis<br><br>\u201cIf you\u2019re a fan of puzzle games, don\u2019t miss Crunching Koalas\u2019 brilliant remix. MouseCraft drops you into a series of challenges that will initially make you feel like a mouse trapped in a maze. But after working your way through these environments, you\u2019ll feel like a mad scientist who can\u2019t be stopped.\u201d<br>8/10 \u2013 Game Informer<br><br>\u201cOffering up a new experience every time the mice finish their well-deserved cheese, MouseCraft is a refreshing experience for those in need of a complex puzzle game. It may not be has light-hearted as it could have been, but Mousecraft succeeds by making the player think instead of laugh.
