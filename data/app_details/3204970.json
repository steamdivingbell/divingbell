{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>The Steel Dawn</strong> is a unique project that combines elements of classic RPGs and unique combat mechanics. A deep story, a well-developed world and a variety of gameplay options make this game attractive to a wide audience.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In a vast galactic Empire, the loss of contact with an important cargo convoy has caused alarm. The convoy's last activity was recorded near the Terminus system, consisting of three planets. Each of these planets developed in its own unique way, but one of them, Vectis, stood out for its military power. It was with it that the Empire entered into an alliance, making it its vassal. Under the control of the Empire, they began to capture neighboring planets, one of which was the main character's homeland - the planet Venta. After losing the war, the main character ended up under the control of the Empire's vassals.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When the game begins, the main character is given an important mission on his home planet. He is sent in a capsule to his homeland, where he lands in the middle of the desert expanses. From here his adventures begin.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Gameplay: The player will have to complete many interesting quests, fight against other robots with melee and ranged weapons. All robots consist of parts, which, if damaged, the robot loses its functionality. For example, you can shoot off the enemy's hand with a weapon, which will make him run away in fear. The player can also explore a huge game world teeming with bandits, or customize his robot from found parts.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3204970/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737660836","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3204970/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1737660836","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3204970/9350c45cc9234a1a16754b99652614fe1a0eb143/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737660836","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3204970/9350c45cc9234a1a16754b99652614fe1a0eb143/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737660836","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>The Steel Dawn</strong> is a unique project that combines elements of classic RPGs and unique combat mechanics.
