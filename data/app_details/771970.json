{"about_the_game":"Asteroids on steroids? An arcade game with a good story? A spaceship tweaker's dream? At its heart, Star Runner is an intense, challenging 2D space shooter with resource collection, depth and replayability. Zip through dynamically created solar systems to wreak havok on enemy spaceships and starbases while dancing around asteroids to mine them for the materials needed for weapons, thrusters and repairs. Weapons at the player's disposal include lasers, photon cannons, railguns, homing missiles (plasma, antimatter, nuke) and three special weapons (cloak, wormhole generator, systems hacker). Gather enough resources during your assault to unleash the ultimate weapon -- the mysterious StarBuster. It is a lesson in destruction the galaxy shall never forget.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Star Runner: Easy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/771970/c723a5282fffeed0ed8a7a7d1bf2ca7645d4641f.jpg"},{"name":"Star Runner: Clown","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/771970/5316d1c1420a93ae12126d1f1a1419dd2fb4bbf0.jpg"},{"name":"Star Runner: Normal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/771970/08a2c28e4288ff789750bf1775542c7dc3e1c393.jpg"},{"name":"Star Runner: Hard","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/771970/6774aa0fbbade4e8d5e67574e39815f73c02c992.jpg"},{"name":"Star Runner: Legend","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/771970/16791e28092dff97176554093090f793cb9d2ec9.jpg"},{"name":"Star Runner: Insane","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/771970/9070a2566135d9b39cdd28c09bb6c05c504aac74.jpg"},{"name":"Star Runner: Godlike","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/771970/daf1075a17baa5547d3557bfe9da6c317c5fa865.jpg"},{"name":"Star Runner: Complete","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/771970/642cfa5fdcde16d524ac4a1eaa7e4593c7d0353d.jpg"},{"name":"Star Runner: Custom","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/771970/cea5f07238180ffc886a5e97c596ff70d13fb5b0.jpg"}],"total":9},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/771970/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1591891477","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/771970/page.bg.jpg?t=1591891477","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/771970/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1591891477","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/771970/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1591891477","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Asteroids on steroids?
