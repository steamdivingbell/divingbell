{"about_the_game":"Lady Helena, the woman who hired you, is abducted through a polychromatic portal before your eyes! With the portal closing and only moments to act, you must decide who will follow into the unknown. Will you be able to work together even while torn apart?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAltered Fates\u00a0challenges investigators like never before by dividing the team across two maps that are in play simultaneously. The first is a proper 1920s mansion, like those you have come across in previous investigations. The second, however, is the future of this home\u2014 now an abandoned, boarded-up building. Each map presents its own series of challenges, with the investigators in the present directly affecting the investigation of their companions in the future: an item tucked beneath a loose floorboard may be found later in the same hiding place, or a rescued captive may be able to return to the mansion in the future.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/929680/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736186030","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/929680/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1736186030","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/929680/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736186030","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/929680/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736186030","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Lady Helena, the woman who hired you, is abducted through a polychromatic portal before your eyes!
