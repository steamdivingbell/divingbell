To traverse through Sector 2 a region on the planet Entriga, the Armored Xpress Company felt it necessary to implement a more protective measure. &quot;MECH&quot;\u00a0 an advanced military grade delivery robot which can be equipped with an array of weapons and items allowing agents to defend against hostile threats. While delivering packages you can choose to help the towns people\u00a0through various side quests which can unlock special rewards. <br><br>In combat Armored Xpress MECH uses energy from supply crates\u00a0that are matched during play to power its weapons and systems. Weapons are available to fire\u00a0 at specific power levels with a maximum of 4 levels. You can strategically fire each weapon at will or wait until they are at their maximum level. This strategy allows you to reserve a weapon or\u00a0unleash all the weapons at once for a truly devastating attack. Each supply crate matched with its corresponding color in groups of 3 fills the matching weapons power gauge. Supply crates matched with more then 3 of the same color generates a special care package crate. When broken these crates drastically boosts the corresponding weapons power gauge. Items and other abilities are powered by MECH's ability gauge/ABG system which fills over time. Sequential matches\u00a0in a turn generates a combo which fills the ABG faster allowing you to use abilities sooner.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1598660/extras/AX-features-616x150.png?t=1687708927\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Story-Driven campaign</strong> - Help Agent 117 deliver a top priority package through perilous hostile region.<br></li><li><strong>Active Time Battle system </strong>-  Actively battle your opponents without waiting. <br></li><li><strong>Fully explorable world</strong> - Explore a detailed and engaging 3d world. <br></li><li><strong>Full array of weapons and items</strong>- Purchase and equip up to 4 weapons onto MECH.
