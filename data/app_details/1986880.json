{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GROW YOUR GRANDPA!</h2>In Growing My Grandpa! you take the role of Adrienne, an intensely introverted little girl in an unhappy home. She is as creative as she is shy. In a trash-strewn basement that appeared to be the site of a strange scientific study, Adrienne discovers a weird secret that defies all but the most imaginative biological explanations. With a desperate wish, she begins raising a powerful entity who she knows as her Grandpa. Given a little food, it begins to grow. Spoken with a bit, it begins to have conversations. However, this entity abides by a strange and deadly logic, and Adrienne must discover the secrets of the basement if she is to have a chance at a happy life.
